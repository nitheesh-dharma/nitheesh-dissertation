<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-30 15:22:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Background</I>
</P>
<P>We wanted to assess whether corticosteroids including ACTH are an effective treatment for children with epilepsy. Corticosteroids are sometimes used as an additional therapy to antiepileptic drugs in children with uncontrolled epilepsy. The role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy is yet to be established.</P>
<P>
<I>Study characteristics</I>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to August 2014. One study was included in this review. In total, data from five children, with uncontrolled seizures, aged between one and 11 years old were assessed. The duration of this study was two months; one month for the corticosteroid treatment and one month for the placebo (inactive) treatment. One of the five children was withdrawn from the study and another had epileptic spasms which meant we could not include their data in our analysis. Therefore, we were only able to compare data for three children. All three received both of the study treatments and the frequency of seizures they experienced while taking each treatment was compared.</P>
<P>
<I>Key results</I>
</P>
<P>One child showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with low dose corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. This child plus another child both showed a 25% to 50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst being treated with the higher dose of corticosteroids compared to the placebo treatment. A third child showed no reduction in seizures with either of the doses. As only one study was found which included data from three out of five participants, further statistical analysis was not possible. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of corticosteroids in children with epilepsy.</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of evidence</I>
</P>
<P>The evidence from the one study included in this review was rated as low quality due to the small sample size. There is a need for larger, well-designed studies.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-30 15:18:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A single RCT was included that recruited five children in a double blind cross-over trial. One child was withdrawn prematurely from the study and another had infantile spasms and hence was excluded from further analysis. Adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH 4-9) was administered. Of the three children analysed, one showed a reduction in seizures of 25% to 50% at both the low and higher doses of corticosteroids compared to placebo; one child showed a reduction in seizures at the higher dose only and one child showed no reduction in seizures at either dose. No adverse effects were reported.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:40:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:40:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epilepsy is defined as the occurrence of recurrent epileptic seizures. An epileptic seizure is defined as a manifestation of epileptic, i.e. excessive or hypersynchronous, usually self limited activity of neurons in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Blume-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blume 2001</LINK>). Epilepsy comprises many different syndromes and has an estimated incidence of 150 per 100,000 per year during the first year of life, 60 per 100,000 per year at ages five to nine years and 4 to -50 per 100,000 per year in older children. Its prevalence is 4 to 5 per 1000 in the developed world (<LINK REF="REF-Forsgren-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsgren 2004</LINK>). Up to 20% of patients continue to have seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Deonna-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deonna 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:40:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Steroids, including prednisolone, prednisone, adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH), methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone have been used in the treatment of various seizure disorders, including epileptic spasms, Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, childhood myoclonic epilepsies and myoclonic astatic epilepsy. They have also been used to treat various forms of non-convulsive status epilepticus, fugues, absence status, atonic status and complex partial status epilepticus (<LINK REF="STD-Chutorian-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Chutorian 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marescaux-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marescaux 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oguni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oguni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuru-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuru 2000</LINK>). Gelastic seizures have also been treated with ACTH (<LINK REF="REF-Go-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 1999</LINK>). In addition, they have been used to treat early and explosive onset of epileptic encephalopathy, including Rasmussen&#8217;s encephalitis where there may be an autoimmune or post-infectious inflammatory cause (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2005</LINK>). Whilst their benefit in the treatment of epileptic spasms is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Hancock-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lux-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lux 2005</LINK>) their role in other types of epilepsy remains unclear. They are widely accepted as having significant adverse effects including increased risk of infection, glycosuria, electrolyte imbalance, suppression of the hypothalamus and pituitary, psychosis, weight gain, hypertension, increased risk of nephrocalcinosis, brain atrophy and subdural effusion (<LINK REF="REF-Riikonen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riikonen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satoh-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satoh 1982</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:40:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prednisone is a synthetic corticosteroid. It has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to prednisolone. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, a derivative of cortisol and is the active metabolite of the drug prednisone. Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical term used for cortisol, the principal glucocorticosteroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to stimulation by ACTH. Strictly speaking ACTH is not a steroid; it is a 39 amino-acid polypeptide secreted by the anterior pituitary, which when released stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol. There are two 'ACTH' preparations in widespread use; ACTH i.e. adrenocorticotrophin hormone and tetracosactrin. ACTH is a natural bovine-derived product administered as a daily intramuscular injection. Tetracosactrin is a synthetic analogue of corticotrophic hormone. However, in the UK, because of the concerns regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) ACTH has been withdrawn from the market. The mechanism or mechanisms underlying the antiepileptic action of steroids is unknown. Suggestions include alterations in neurochemical transmission as a result of alterations in serotonin turnover or gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) uptake. These effects may be mediated through the glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors, or both. Data on the age, sex, and site-dependent expression of these in human brains are lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Watzka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watzka 2000</LINK>). Deflazacort is a methyloxazoline derivative of prednisolone. Overall, deflazacort has demonstrated equivalent efficacy to that of prednisolone and other oral steroids in a variety of conditions. When compared with other oral steroids, such as betamethasone and prednisone, deflazacort has shown a lower incidence of steroid-induced adverse effects, such as bone loss, glucose intolerance, Cushing&#8217;s syndrome and growth velocity suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2003</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:40:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current evidence based on some prospective and retrospective studies suggests steroids have some role in treating children with epilepsy. However, there is a paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of steroids in this population.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of steroids in the treatment of the childhood epilepsies (excluding epileptic spasms) and their effect on seizures, cognition, quality of life and adverse effects.</P>

<P>The literature search of Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and DARE found nine randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Only a single study was identified as suitable for inclusion in the original review published in January 2007. It was reported by Pentella (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005222.pub2/full#CD005222-bbs2-0001">Pentella 1982</A>) and evaluated ACTH 4-9 analogue (ORG 2766) in five children using a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over design.</P>

<P>The included study (<A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005222.pub2/full#CD005222-bbs2-0001">Pentella 1982</A>) was a prospective double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial of ACTH analogue 4-9 in five children with intractable seizures. Participants were aged between 1.5 and 11 years and had a history of multiple seizure types and mental retardation or developmental delay. Other treatments, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as well as ketogenic diet were continued unchanged throughout the study period. The trial lasted nine weeks during which ACTH 4-9 was administered for four weeks and a placebo for four weeks with a week lapse between the medications. It was concluded that one week was sufficient for a 'wash out' period. ACTH 4-9 was given in a dose of 5 mg a day for the first two weeks and 10 mg a day for the next two weeks. Both the recipients and assessors were blinded. The outcomes were reported only during the nine week study period. EEGs were recorded prior to the study and during the last week of each month of therapy. One child was withdrawn from the study due to worsening seizures on placebo administration. One child had infantile (epileptic) spasms and we therefore excluded him/her from the analysis of this review.</P>
<P>For the current update, we did not find any new studies to include in this review.</P>

<P>A number of prospective observational studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dooley-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dooley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snead-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Snead 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willig-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Willig 1980</LINK>) and a few retrospective studies (<LINK REF="STD-Charuvanij-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Charuvanij 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chutorian-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Chutorian 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oguni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oguni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verhelst-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Verhelst 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamatogi-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yamatogi 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-2008" TYPE="STUDY">You 2008</LINK>) were found for the use of steroids in epilepsy. In addition, a number of retrospective and prospective studies of the efficacy of steroids in continuous spike waves in slow-wave sleep (CSWS), including Landau-Kleffner syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Buzatu-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Buzatu 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lerman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lerman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 2005</LINK>) and Rasmussen's syndrome (<LINK REF="STD-Hart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hart 1994</LINK>), were found.</P>
<P>Six randomised trials reported the use of short courses of steroids in patients with recent onset epileptic seizures and neurocysticercosis (<LINK REF="STD-Garg--2006" TYPE="STUDY">Garg 2006</LINK>; <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005222.pub2/full#CD005222-bbs2-0002">Kalra 2003</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Kishore-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kishore 2007</LINK>; <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005222.pub2/full#CD005222-bbs2-0003">Mall 2003</A>; <LINK REF="STD-Prakash-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Prakash 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singla-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Singla 2011</LINK>), with the primary aim of treating the lesion. In no study was it possible to ascertain the effect of steroids on epilepsy independent of the effect of steroids and antiparasitic treatment on the underlying cause. Therefore, these studies were excluded from further analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Grosso-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grosso 2008</LINK> compared hydrocortisone versus deflazacort (derivative of prednisolone) in drug resistant epilepsy of childhood. This study did not meet the criteria for inclusion in this review as it compared one form of steroid against the other in terms of efficacy, and seizure relapse rate rather than steroids against another therapy or no therapy. It was not possible to ascertain change in seizure frequency due to steroid treatment as both groups received one or other form of steroid throughout the duration of trial; therefore, we also excluded this study.</P>
<P>In the updated searches, 27 studies were found. However, after initial screening of titles and abstracts, all studies were excluded due to irrelevance. The results of the updates search only are detailed in the <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:41:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single RCT we found was a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pentella-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pentella 1982</LINK>). However, only three children could be included in the analysis of this review as one child was withdrawn from the study before receiving the study medication and another had epileptic spasms. Although the included study had potential bias through missing data, the reasons for exclusions were explained and seems unlikely to have had a significant effect on the outcomes. This study had good methods of blinding. Despite this, the small sample size may introduce bias as it is unlikely that this study is adequately powered to detect statistical significance. Therefore, <LINK REF="STD-Pentella-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pentella 1982</LINK> was rated as having an overall high risk of bias. Further information regarding the risk of bias assessment are detailed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> section.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:41:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the one study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Pentella-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Pentella 1982</LINK>), the only outcome measure of interest was seizure frequency. On 5 mg ACTH 4-9 a day, one child with psychomotor and myoclonic seizures had a 40% reduction in psychomotor seizures and a 47% reduction in myoclonic seizure compared to placebo. Another child, with akinetic seizures, had a 9% reduction in seizures compared to placebo. On the 10 mg a day dose the first child had a 30% reduction in psychomotor seizures compared to placebo and the second child had a 34% reduction in akinetic seizures compared to placebo. A third child had tonic-clonic seizures and did not show any reduction in frequency of seizures on either dose of ACTH 4-9 compared to placebo.</P>
<P>Therefore, the overall reduction in seizure frequency of more than 25% and less than 50% occurred in one child at the low dose and in two children at the higher dose. The reduction in psychomotor seizures and myoclonic seizures was more than 25% and less than 50% in one child on low dose. The reduction in psychomotor seizures and akinetic seizures was more than 25% and less than 50% in one child each on higher dose. The child with tonic-clonic seizures had no reduction in seizure frequency on either.</P>
<P>There were no differences in the EEGs before the study and during the trial period. No side effects were reported when on ACTH 4-9 analogue.</P>
<P>Further analysis was not performed.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:41:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The updated review identified only one RCT which was already included in the original review. This study found some small improvement in two out of three children who took part in the study and the third child showed no improvement.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:41:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Excluding epileptic spasms, there is no reliable evidence from randomised controlled trials to support the use of steroids in childhood epilepsy. Evidence is lacking concerning the efficacy of steroids in controlling seizures (including status epilepticus), in improving cognition and in improving quality of life. Moreover, there are no reliable data from randomised controlled studies concerning the potential adverse effects of using steroids to treat childhood epilepsy.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-12 11:41:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the identified study was rated as low risk of bias, it was of low quality due to the very small number of participants and short duration of follow-up assessments. Therefore, no robust conclusions can be drawn from this.</P>
<P>Possible reasons for the lack of a good evidence base for the use of steroids to treat childhood epilepsies, other than epileptic spasms, include the heterogeneous nature of the population of intractable childhood epilepsies, making patient selection difficult; the wide availability of alternative treatments which are usually used in preference to steroids because of the perceived risks of steroid treatment; and the inherent difficulties of undertaking clinical trials in children.</P>

<P>There have been case reports of using different steroids in treating various forms of non-convulsive status epilepticus, fugues, absence status, atonic status and complex partial status epilepticus (<LINK REF="STD-Chutorian-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Chutorian 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marescaux-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marescaux 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oguni-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oguni 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuru-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuru 2000</LINK>). ACTH has also been used to treat gelastic seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Go-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Go 1999</LINK>). In addition to this, they have been used to treat early and explosive onset of epileptic encephalopathy where there may have been an autoimmune or postinfectious inflammatory cause (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2005</LINK>). In this regard, the study identified in the updated review yielded consistent findings in terms of the broader literature in this field.</P>

<P>There are several implications for research.<BR/>(1) Adequately powered multicentre randomised controlled trials of corticosteroids should be carried out in childhood epilepsies of different types including non-convulsive status. (This is also recognized in the NICE guideline in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>).)<BR/>(2) Studies need to consider carefully, clinically relevant efficacy measures, taking into account the various reasons why steroids are given in the childhood epilepsies.<BR/>(3) Studies should incorporate validated measures of quality of life and cognition.<BR/>(4) Studies should be of sufficient duration to be clinically relevant and to enable adverse effects to be detected.</P>
