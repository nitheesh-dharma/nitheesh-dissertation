<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be performed either manually as in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or using mechanical devices as in automated PD (APD). The aim of this review was to compare the effectiveness of CAPD and APD. Only three small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (139 patients) were identified after an extensive literature search, and we found no difference between CAPD and APD for clinically important outcomes. APD may however be considered advantageous in select group of patients such as in the younger PD population and those in employment or education due to its psychosocial advantages. These outcomes were only reported in one trial. Large, long-term RCTs are needed in this area.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be performed either manually as in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or using mechanical devices as in automated PD (APD). APD has been considered to have several advantages over CAPD such as reduced incidence of peritonitis, mechanical complications and greater psychosocial acceptability.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the comparative efficacy of CAPD and APD in patients who are dialysed for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register and CINAHL. Authors of included studies were contacted, reference lists of identified RCTs and relevant narrative reviews were screened. <BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs comparing CAPD with APD in patients with ESRD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 13:40:49 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Data were abstracted independently by two authors onto a standard form. Risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and a mean difference (MD) for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials (139 patients) were included. APD did not differ from CAPD with respect to mortality (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.37), risk of peritonitis (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.11), switching from original PD modality to a different dialysis modality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02), hernias (RR 1.26, 95% interval 0.32 to 5.01), PD fluid leaks (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.83), PD catheter removal (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48) or hospital admissions (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.17). There was no difference between either PD modality with respect to residual renal function (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.66 to 1.32). One study found that peritonitis rates and hospitalisation were significantly less in patients on APD when results were expressed as episodes/patient-year. Another study found that patients on APD had significantly more time for work, family and social activities. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>APD has not been shown to have significant advantages over CAPD in terms of important clinical outcomes. APD may however be considered advantageous in select group of patients such as in the younger PD population and those in employment or education due to its psychosocial advantages. There is a need for a RCT comparing CAPD with APD with sufficiently large patient numbers looking at important clinical outcomes including residual renal function, accompanied by an economic evaluation to clarify the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of both modalities.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-12 13:41:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves performing the PD exchanges manually whereas, automated PD (APD) is a broad term that is used to refer to all forms of PD employing a mechanical device to assist the delivery and drainage of dialysate. The various forms of APD include continuous cyclical PD (CCPD), intermittent PD (IPD), nightly intermittent PD (NIPD), and tidal PD (TPD). In CAPD, the patient or carer must perform at least three to five exchanges every day. Many problems inherent to CAPD such as lack of sustained patient motivation over long periods of time, technique failure, and recurrent peritonitis, led to a resurgence of interest in APD and the introduction of CCPD in 1981 (<LINK REF="REF-Diaz_x002d_Buxo-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz-Buxo 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Venkataraman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkataraman 2002</LINK>). APD has been reported to have several advantages over CAPD including lesser incidence of peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Brunkhorst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunkhorst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holley-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holley 1990a</LINK>), better small solute clearances (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 1998</LINK>) and reduced incidences of hernias (<LINK REF="REF-Kathuria-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kathuria 1994</LINK>). APD (in the form of NIPD) has also been suggested to offer a number of unproven psychosocial benefits over CAPD, which relate directly to fewer connections and patient independence from dialysis during the daytime, particularly for workers, school pupils or carers of elderly or debilitated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wrenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wrenger 1996</LINK>). Additional benefits of APD include possibly reduced back pain and body image difficulties due to being free of fluid in the abdomen during the daytime (<LINK REF="REF-Wrenger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wrenger 1996</LINK>). Performing APD at night in the supine position has been shown to result in reduced intra-abdominal pressures compared with the upright position in CAPD (<LINK REF="REF-Twardowski-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twardowski 1983</LINK>). APD is also considered to be more suitable form of PD in patients who have a rapid rate of solute transfer across their peritoneal membrane (high transporters) because of the ability to perform rapid frequent exchanges with shorter dwell times (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2005</LINK>). APD has in fact been proposed as an alternative to CAPD in all patients for whom PD is considered suitable (<LINK REF="REF-Diaz_x002d_Buxo-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diaz-Buxo 1985</LINK>). The Renal Association (UK) and the European Best Practice Guidelines for peritoneal dialysis recommend APD for PD patients who have high peritoneal transporter status, in those with need to avoid high intraperitoneal pressures and in patients with psychosocial reasons (<LINK REF="REF-EBPG-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBPG 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKRA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKRA 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proportion of PD patients on APD has been steadily increasing over the past decade. In the US the percentage of PD patients on APD has risen from 9% in 1993 to 28% in 1997 and to 54% on 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flanigan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanigan 2001</LINK>). The direct costs of APD have been shown to be 1.22 times greater than CAPD (<LINK REF="STD-Bro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1999</LINK>). Given the consistently increasing trend towards greater APD usage it is important to know the proposed psychosocial and clinical benefits of APD have to be weighted against its increased cost and the risk of likely acceleration of residual renal function decline compared to CAPD.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-12 13:30:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>APD did not differ from CAPD with respect to important clinical benefits such as mortality, risk of peritonitis, switching from their original PD modality to a different dialysis modality including an alternative form of PD, hernias, PD fluid leaks, PD catheter removal and hospital admissions. Dialysis adequacy measures were also not different between both PD modalities. It must be noted that one study (<LINK REF="STD-De-Fijter-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Fijter 1994</LINK>) found that peritonitis rates and hospitalisation were significantly less in patients on APD when these results were expressed as episodes/patient-year. Whilst most of the quality of life measures were not different between patients on APD and CAPD, <LINK REF="STD-Bro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1999</LINK> found that patients on APD had significantly more time for work, family and social activities. It is important to note that whilst there were no statistically significant differences between either PD modality with respect to most outcomes, the 95% CIs were wide enough to suggest that clinically important differences may indeed exist.</P>
<P>The effect of APD on peritonitis rates when compared to CAPD is controversial with some favouring APD (<LINK REF="REF-Brunkhorst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunkhorst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holley-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holley 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Carm-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Carm 1999</LINK>), some CAPD (<LINK REF="REF-Golper-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golper 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oo 2005</LINK>) and a few others finding peritonitis rates to be similar between both modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Howard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Troidle-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Troidle 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viglino-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viglino 1995</LINK>). Our meta-analysis of number of patients with peritonitis during the trial period did not find any difference. An analysis of a large cohort of patients (&gt; 30,000) starting PD over a three-year period showed that in the first year of dialysis patients on APD had a significantly better patient and dialysis technique (<LINK REF="REF-Guo-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guo 2003</LINK>). Although patients on APD were found to younger than CAPD patients, the differences in patient and technique survival were significant even after adjustment for age and diabetes status. In contrast to this study our evidence, derived from RCTs, did not show any evidence of better patient or technique survival between APD and CAPD.</P>
<P>The CANUSA study and other studies have shown an increased mortality in CAPD patients with peritoneal membrane high or rapid solute transport characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Churchill-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 1998</LINK>). Although APD may offer better small solute clearances in such patients compared to CAPD, currently there is no evidence that this translates into improved survival rates (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2003</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Bro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1999</LINK>, only patients with high or high-average peritoneal transport characteristics were included. This study allowed us to explore the hypothesis that patients with such peritoneal transport characteristics might do better on APD than on CAPD. This study did not show any advantage with APD with regards to patient or technique survival in this specific PD population group but this may be due to the study's small patient population and short follow-up period.</P>
<P>Although APD has the potential to offer better small solute clearances than CAPD, our meta-analysis did not demonstrate any differences in dialysis adequacy. This is not surprising as previous studies have shown that in real life situations the differences between both modalities with respect to creatinine clearances are modest at best. The 1996 Peritoneal Dialysis Core Indicators Study showed that weekly creatinine clearances were 58.9 L for CAPD and 60.7 L for APD (<LINK REF="REF-Blake-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blake 1999b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Preservation of residual renal function is of great importance as it has been shown to be a predictor of patient survival for those on PD (<LINK REF="REF-Bargman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bargman 1995</LINK>). Some studies have shown that APD is associated with a more rapid loss of residual renal function when compared to those on CAPD (<LINK REF="STD-Hiroshige-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hiroshige 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hufnagel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hufnagel 1999</LINK>). However subsequent studies have given contradictory results (<LINK REF="REF-Holley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holley 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moist-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moist 2000</LINK>). Our review did not show any difference in end of study period residual renal function, between either PD modality.</P>
<P>The strength of this analysis is that this is a comprehensive systematic review of RCTs comparing APD and CAPD. We had rigid inclusion criteria of including RCTs alone and have used a very comprehensive search strategy of all major medical electronic databases and other sources. The data from RCTs have greater validity than observational studies as the process of randomisation removes potential biases by ensuring that the patient groups are equal in terms of both known and unknown characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1999</LINK>). There has been one previous systematic review (Macleod 1997) which only included the only study published at that time (<LINK REF="STD-De-Fijter-1994" TYPE="STUDY">De Fijter 1994</LINK>). We have included two additional studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iles_x002d_Smith-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Iles-Smith 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The major limitations of this review include the small number of identified trials, variability in their design, conduct, and intervention protocols. Two of the three studies were less than a year in duration. These trials are also not appropriate for the assessment of long-term clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>There were only a total of 139 included patients which makes it very unlikely that these trials would have been able to detect significant differences with respect to the clinically important outcomes assessed. The included trials did not give us any information regarding peritoneal characteristics. It is a well recognised feature of these treatment modalities that patients' peritoneal transport characteristics have an impact on their efficacy with high transporters performing better on APD whilst low-transporters do better on CAPD.</P>
<P>There have been two economic evaluations comparing APD and CAPD. <LINK REF="REF-Macleod-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macleod 1997</LINK> showed that the cost for APD compared to CAPD/patient/year to prevent one episode of peritonitis was 11000 (1997 prices). The other economic evaluation which was done using the data obtained from <LINK REF="STD-Bro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bro 1999</LINK> and showed that APD was 1.22 times more expensive than CAPD.</P>
<P>Whilst the use of APD has been expanding rapidly mainly at the expense of CAPD (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>) it is surprising there are only three RCTs with 139 patients comparing it with CAPD, and none since 1999. The increase in use of APD may due to its perceived psychosocial advantages and patient choice as a result of such advantages, however this has not been properly investigated.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>APD does not have significant advantages over CAPD in terms of important technical outcomes. However it may be considered in select group of patients based on their peritoneal transport characteristics and in the younger PD population and those in employment or study due to its psychosocial advantages.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for an RCT comparing CAPD with APD with sufficiently large patient numbers looking at important clinical and psychiosocial outcomes including residual renal function, accompanied by an economic evaluation to clarify the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of both modalities</P>
