<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review, 'High-frequency ventilation versus conventional ventilation for treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome' (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2013</LINK>), which included 8 RCTs.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We included 2 additional recently completed trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>) that met our inclusion criteria in this version. We included new data from a third recently published RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>) that was previously unavailable.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The updated review reaches new conclusions. Pooled results from 10 RCTs suggest that although high-frequency oscillation improves oxygenation and reduces the risk of treatment failure (refractory hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, hypotension, or barotrauma), there is no difference in mortality compared with conventional mechanical ventilation in people with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The quality of evidence was very low for patient-important outcomes due to imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency and methodological limitations.</P>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition. It is characterized by acute lung inflammation, stiff lungs that increase the work of breathing, and reduced ability of the lungs to adequately oxygenate the blood. Survivors can have a reduced quality of life. People with ARDS usually require an artificial respirator in order to prevent death. High-frequency oscillation (HFO) ventilation differs from conventional ventilation in that very small breaths are delivered very rapidly (180 to 900 breaths per minute). HFO helps with the opening of collapsed lung tissue by providing constant positive pressure in a person's airway. We performed a systematic review to determine whether HFO improves clinical outcomes (including preventing deaths) when compared to conventional breathing machines for adults and children with ARDS.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling 1850 participants in this updated review. One large trial was stopped early because of increased deaths among participants who were randomized to HFO. Four trials reported at least some funding from manufacturers of HFO ventilators.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>HFO did not reduce the risk of death in hospital in eight trials enrolling 1779 participants. The ability of the lungs to oxygenate blood, measured at 24 to 72 hours of ventilation after randomization, was 18% to 26% better in participants receiving HFO. HFO had no effect on the length of time an artificial breathing machine was required. The risk of unwanted side effects, including low blood pressure or further injury to the lung due to high airway pressure, was not increased.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence </B>
</P>
<P>We found substantial inconsistency among clinical trials which reported the effect of HFO on the risk of death in participants with ARDS. The quality of evidence is very low for outcomes that would be most important to patients. This is because of a lack of precision and consistency, and because in many cases the methods used by investigators during clinical trials were not of the highest standard. This indicates that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the effect of HFO on death. Additional randomized trials could change these findings.</P>

In participants randomized to HFO, there was no significant difference in hospital or 30-day mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.16; P = 0.46, I² = 66%; 8 trials, 1779 participants, 807 deaths) compared with conventional ventilation. One large multicentre RCT was terminated early because of increased mortality in participants randomized to HFO compared to mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume and high positive end expiratory pressure, with HFO reserved only as a rescue therapy. We found substantial between-trial statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0% to 66%) for clinical outcomes, including mortality. </P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-03-26 14:16:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by acute lung inflammation causing pulmonary congestion, hypoxaemia, and decreased pulmonary compliance. ARDS is defined as a syndrome characterized by acute onset (i.e. within seven days), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, and ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322;) less than 300. People with mild ARDS (formerly called acute lung injury) have a PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; between 200 and 300. Moderate and severe ARDS refer to the more severely ill subset of people in whom the PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; ratio is less than or equal to 200 and 100 respectively (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Definition-Task-Force-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Definition Task Force 2012</LINK>). ARDS has a fairly high incidence (<LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2005</LINK>) and is associated with substantial mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Phua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phua 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2005</LINK>), morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Angus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angus 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herridge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herridge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herridge-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herridge 2011</LINK>), and costs (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2006</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-26 14:16:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-frequency oscillation (HFO) is an alternative ventilation technique in which very small tidal volumes are delivered at very high frequencies using an oscillatory pump while mean airway pressure is held constant. Humidified, oxygenated gas (bias flow) passes in front of a diaphragm which oscillates at high frequencies (3 to 15 Hz, or 180 to 900 breaths per minute). The mean airway pressure is determined by the rate of bias flow and by a resistance valve at the end of the bias flow circuit. Tidal volumes are much smaller during high-frequency oscillation (1 to 4 mL/kg) compared to mechanical ventilation, and the constant mean airway pressure leads to smaller changes in alveolar pressure. Because tidal volumes during HFO may be smaller than anatomic dead space, gas exchange occurs through gas mixing as opposed to bulk flow. Mechanisms of gas exchange during HFO include direct ventilation of proximal alveoli, Taylor dispersion, asymmetric velocity profiles, pendelluft, and diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Slutsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slutsky 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-03-26 14:16:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mechanical ventilation is usually required for adequate tissue oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-Artigas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Artigas 1998</LINK>) but may also perpetuate lung injury by over-distending and rupturing healthy alveoli, and by triggering a secondary inflammatory response that amplifies lung injury from repeatedly opening and collapsing lung units (<LINK REF="REF-Dreyfuss-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dreyfuss 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gattinoni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattinoni 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muscedere-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muscedere 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranieri 1999</LINK>). Lung-protective ventilation seeks to limit alveolar distension, recruit non-aerated alveoli, and prevent further alveolar collapse (<LINK REF="REF-Gattinoni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattinoni 2006</LINK>). Low tidal volumes with (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercat-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercat 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villar 2006</LINK>) or without (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1998</LINK>) high positive end-expiratory pressure may reduce ventilator-induced lung injury. Nevertheless, mortality in people with ARDS remains high (<LINK REF="REF-Phua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phua 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2005</LINK>). HFO theoretically meets the goals of a lung-protective ventilation strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Rimensberger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimensberger 2003</LINK>), with extremely small tidal volumes (1 to 4 mL/kg) and constant lung recruitment. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-31 11:33:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Although HFO is used in some centres in people with ARDS who do not tolerate conventional mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finkielman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkielman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2004</LINK>), its role, especially outside the realm of &#8216;rescue&#8217; therapy, remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kacmarek-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kacmarek 2008</LINK>). Several observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fort-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fort 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2001</LINK>) show improved oxygenation when hypoxaemia seems refractory. Our earlier systematic review of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2013</LINK>) included eight small trials, and found that HFO might reduce mortality, although several trials did not mandate optimal lung-protective ventilation in control groups. Additional studies have subsequently become available. Furthermore, in the context of recent (<LINK REF="REF-Dominguez_x002d_Cherit-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dominguez-Cherit 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>) and future pandemics, there is a pressing need for evidence-based syntheses of the effects of potentially life-saving interventions for people with ARDS. We have therefore updated our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2013</LINK>) comparing HFO to conventional mechanical ventilation for adults and children with ARDS, to determine the effects of HFO on mortality, other clinical and physiological outcomes, and adverse events, to address these issues.</P>

<P>Potential sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies included participants, ventilation strategies, and outcome definitions. Because we felt that this diversity would not support the underlying assumptions of a fixed-effect model, we used random-effects models for all pooled analyses.

<P>A priori, we planned subgroup analyses to explore potential heterogeneity for the primary outcome of hospital or 30-day mortality and to test whether results were consistent for important subgroups of trials or participants. </P>
<P>First, we hypothesized that age might influence the benefit from HFO. Increasing age worsens the prognosis in ARDS and thus older participants might benefit less from HFO compared with younger participants (<LINK REF="REF-Brun_x002d_Buisson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun-Buisson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flori 2005</LINK>). Conversely, HFO is commonly used for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and thus children may benefit more from HFO compared to adults (<LINK REF="REF-Cools--2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cools 2015</LINK>). We therefore performed a subgroup analysis comparing effects of HFO in trials enrolling post-neonatal children (weight &#8804; 35 kg, as defined in the paediatric trials) versus adults.</P>
<P>Second, we hypothesized that the subset of participants with severe and life-threatening hypoxaemia may benefit more from HFO, recognizing that most people with ARDS do not die of hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 2005</LINK>). We therefore planned a subgroup analysis of participants with a higher (&#8805; 150) versus lower (&lt; 150) baseline PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; ratio, but insufficient data precluded this analysis.</P>
<P>We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis comparing trials which mandated lung-protective ventilation in the control group, defined as &#8804; 8 mL/kg of ideal or predicted body weight, to trials that did not mandate tidal volumes &#8804; 8 mL/kg, to examine whether the benefit of HFO might be greater when compared to conventional ventilation with higher tidal volumes compared to conventional ventilation with smaller tidal volumes (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>A priori, we hypothesized that potential methodological biases (e.g. quasi-randomization or unclear or unconcealed allocation) might influence the results of our meta-analysis in favour of HFO, whereas excessive cross-overs or losses to follow-up might bias the results against HFO. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis limited to trials at low risk of bias, across all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
<P>We also performed a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded trials at risk of bias due to early termination for benefit or harm.</P>
<P>Finally, we performed additional sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings under alternative assumptions where data were incomplete or missing after author contact (for example, censoring participants who were lost to follow-up).

<P>The main finding of our systematic review and meta-analysis is that HFO did not reduce hospital and 30-day mortality in participants with ARDS compared to conventional mechanical ventilation. This finding was based on a small number of trials (eight for the primary analysis), participants (1779) and events (807), resulting in wide confidence intervals. The quality of evidence for the effect of HFO on mortality was very low, due to imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and methodologic limitations (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-03-29 00:47:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our primary analysis was based on a small number of trials, some of which included relatively small numbers of participants and few outcome events, and have wide confidence intervals. Furthermore, although we found moderate heterogeneity for our primary outcome (hospital or 30-day mortality), this may be an underestimate, given the small number of trials. A priori subgroup analyses did not adequately explain heterogeneity, although heterogeneity appeared to be slightly lower (I² = 41%) in three trials with low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Derdak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Derdak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samransamruajkit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samransamruajkit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>). Nevertheless, HFO did not reduce mortality when only studies with low risk of bias were pooled (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although our meta-analysis suggests HFO might reduce treatment failure, the criteria for treatment failure varied across trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bollen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Derdak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Derdak 2002</LINK>) or were not predefined (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samransamruajkit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samransamruajkit 2005</LINK>), and outcome assessors were not blinded. Therefore caution should be used when interpreting this finding, especially in view of the overall neutral effect of HFO on mortality in our systematic review, and the results of the second largest HFO trial to date (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>) which found that HFO increased mortality.</P>
<P>Limited data precluded subgroup analyses based on the degree of hypoxaemia and analyses of longer-term mortality and health-related quality of life. We found moderate to high heterogeneity for physiological endpoints, which limited their interpretability. Because of limited data, we were unable to analyse duration of mechanical ventilation separately for survivors and non-survivors to address the possibility that differences in early mortality could drive overall differences in duration of mechanical ventilation. The risk of bias was low in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Demory-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Demory 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Derdak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Derdak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papazian-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Papazian 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samransamruajkit-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Samransamruajkit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>) but remained unclear in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bollen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2004</LINK>). Thus, our findings do not support HFO for the treatment for ARDS. The overall quality of the evidence is very low for the most important outcomes to patients, such as mortality (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), indicating considerable uncertainty, and that future trials may impact our findings (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Strengths of our review include methods to minimize bias, including a comprehensive literature search, duplicate data abstraction, and use of a predefined protocol outlining our hypotheses, methodological assessment of primary studies, and statistical analysis plan. We considered important clinical, physiological, and safety endpoints. Although blinding of participants, their families, and clinicians was not feasible, five of 10 trials had low risk of bias. </P>
<P>Our meta-analysis may have overestimated the treatment effect of HFO because the control group of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bollen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Derdak-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Derdak 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>), including the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>) which dominated the pooled analyses, was exposed to higher tidal volumes (&gt; 6 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight) than currently recommended (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). However, a sensitivity analysis showed no difference in trials that implemented lower tidal volume lung-protective ventilation in the control group. Alternatively, the higher rate of cross-overs due to treatment failure in participants randomized to conventional ventilation may have reduced the measured effect of HFO. In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arnold-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arnold 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bollen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bollen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>) more than 10% of participants crossed over from their assigned mode of ventilation. </P>
<P>Metholodical diversity in the primary studies may account for the inconsistency in some of the reported findings. In the second largest study (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>, n = 548), investigators reported an increase in mortality associated with early application of HFO in participants with ARDS. This trial, however, may have been susceptible to truncation bias due to early termination for harm. Furthermore, the control arm used a protocol incorporating recruitment manoeuvres and high positive end expiratory pressure, which may have conferred additional benefit over conventional ventilation with low tidal volumes in participants with ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Briel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meade-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meade 2008</LINK>). Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK> reported a statistically significant reduction in mortality associated with HFO; however this study differed from others because HFO was used intermittently and for a variable period of time each day based on a predefined protocol, and was combined with tracheal gas insufflation. Furthermore, participants who received protocolized HFO were cared for by selected experts (<LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>; personal correspondence), which was not the case for participants undergoing conventional ventilation, which may have led to performance bias. Finally, the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>, n = 795) utilized a different HFO ventilator (Novalung R100) which differed from the other studies which used HFO ventilators designed by Sensormedics.</P>

<P>Our findings differ from our previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2013</LINK>), which found reduced mortality and treatment failure in participants with ARDS receiving HFO. However, we have included two additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2013</LINK>) of HFO compared to conventional ventilation and unpublished data provided by primary investigators, which generated more reliable estimates of treatment effects through increases in sample size and outcome events.</P>
<P>The improvements in PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; that we observed are consistent with observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ferguson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferguson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fort-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fort 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2001</LINK>). Although HFO increased PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; compared to conventional ventilation, there was no difference in oxygenation index (defined as 100 x mean airway pressure/(PaO&#8322;/FiO&#8322; ratio)) because of the higher mean airway pressure applied during HFO. Although high airway pressure during conventional ventilation is harmful to the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Ranieri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranieri 1999</LINK>), the importance of the higher mean airway pressure during HFO is unclear because of its incompletely characterized relationship to alveolar pressure, which is a more important determinant of lung injury than mean airway pressure in ARDS. Direct comparisons of mean airway pressure and oxygenation index between HFO and conventional ventilation may not be valid because, in contrast to conventional ventilation, mean airway pressures measured in the trachea during HFO are 6 to 8 cm H&#8322;O lower than values displayed on the ventilator (<LINK REF="REF-Muellenbach-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muellenbach 2007</LINK>). From a clinical perspective, improved oxygenation may not always be associated with improved clinical outcomes in ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-Bernard-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernard 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slutsky-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slutsky 2009</LINK>), because death due to refractory hypoxaemia is relatively uncommon, compared with death due to multiple organ failure.</P>
<P>Our findings seem inconsistent with experimental studies in animals showing that HFO reduces histologic alveolar over-distension compared to conventional mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Sedeek-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sedeek 2003</LINK>), possibly because of the delivery of smaller tidal volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Hager-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hager 2007</LINK>), and by corollary, other clinical trials which have shown that smaller tidal volumes improve mortality in participants with ARDS (<LINK REF="REF-ARDS-Network-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ARDS Network 2000</LINK>). Although we found no increase in barotrauma or hypotension resulting from higher mean airway pressures employed during HFO in pooled analyses, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>) HFO was associated with increased need for vasoactive medications, and increased use of sedatives and analgesics which may have offset the theoretical benefit of HFO.  </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-03-30 21:45:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The risk of death due to ARDS is very high (<LINK REF="REF-Phua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phua 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rubenfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubenfeld 2005</LINK>) and appears to have stabilized over the previous decade (<LINK REF="REF-Phua-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phua 2009</LINK>). In our review, the median control group mortality in participants with ARDS was 47%. A recent observational study of H1N1 influenza demonstrated a substantial proportion of those with severe ARDS required inhaled nitric oxide, prone positioning, HFO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), usually for refractory hypoxaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>). These therapies have different risk-benefit profiles (<LINK REF="REF-Adhikari-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adhikari 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peek 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sud-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sud-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2014</LINK>). Inhaled nitric oxide is expensive, has not been shown to reduce mortality, and may increase renal dysfunction (<LINK REF="REF-Adhikari-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adhikari 2007</LINK>). ECMO may reduce mortality but requires considerable technical expertise and is not widely available (<LINK REF="REF-Peek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peek 2009</LINK>). Mechanical ventilation in the prone position reduces mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2014</LINK>) and is inexpensive, but is not without complications (<LINK REF="REF-Gu_x00e9_rin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guérin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taccone-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taccone 2009</LINK>) and may interfere with other aspects of patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Bein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leonet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found that the quality of evidence for the routine use of HFO in ARDS over conventional ventilation is very low. The role of HFO as rescue therapy when conventional mechanical ventilation has failed due to inadequate gas exchange or the inability to ventilate with acceptably low tidal volumes, is unclear because in several trials included in this review, participants randomized to conventional ventilation received HFO as rescue therapy. Which rescue therapy should be used when conventional ventilation fails likely depends on availability and centre-specific expertise, although current evidence at this time indirectly favours the use of prone ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Sud-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sud 2014</LINK>) or ECMO (<LINK REF="REF-Peek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peek 2009</LINK>) before HFO. Because the effects on PaCO&#8322; were very inconsistent, it may be prudent to avoid HFO in intensive care units that admit many patients with raised intracranial pressure, which may be exacerbated by elevated PaCO&#8322; (e.g. neurocritical care units). Our results are based on a relatively modest number of trials with moderately heterogeneous findings, resulting in wide confidence intervals. As such, future trials may impact on our findings. Nevertheless, the use of HFO as a first-line strategy for ARDS is not supported by the findings of our systematic review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-28 23:15:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should focus on subgroups of patients that may benefit from the improvements in oxygenation during HFO, such as those with severe hypoxaemia at baseline or those who fail conventional ventilation due to refractory hypoxaemia, or that may require higher mean airway pressures in order to facilitate alveolar recruitment, such as those who are morbidly obese. An individual patient data meta-analysis may be helpful to further explore the effects of HFO on mortality in such subgroups. Intermittent sessions of HFO employed in combination with tracheal gas insufflations according to a predefined protocol appeared to reduce mortality in one small single-centre trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>, n = 125). While promising, these findings should be replicated in a larger multicentre RCT.</P>
<P>Participants who were randomized to HFO in one RCT that was stopped early for possible harm (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>) experienced slightly higher mean airway pressures immediately after randomization, compared to other studies in this review. However, because mean airway pressure required during HFO is a post-randomization variable, and may be associated with illness severity, a relationship between the magnitude of mean airway pressure during HFO and mortality cannot be determined without additional data, such as a RCT comparing protocols for higher versus lower mean airway pressure for ARDS treated with HFO. An individual patient data meta-analysis could also help elucidate other important prognostic factors which predict response to HFO. Recently, a small observational study demonstrated the feasibility of using an oesophageal balloon catheter during HFO to approximate transpulmonary pressure as an alternative means of titrating HFO. However further research is needed to determine whether this approach is clinically beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another opportunity to improve the success of future trials of HFO would be to adopt consistent protocols for its optimal application (<LINK REF="STD-Fessler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Fessler 2008</LINK>). In our review, only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mentzelopoulos-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Mentzelopoulos 2012</LINK>) routinely applied recruitment manoeuvres as part of the HFO technique, and only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2013</LINK>) attempted to maximize the frequency of oscillation in order to obtain the smallest possible tidal volume (<LINK REF="REF-Hager-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hager 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Total duration of mechanical ventilation (1) is ambiguous, as it may be measured in two ways in critical care trials: days of mechanical ventilation or ventilator-free days. Since these endpoints cannot be combined we analysed them separately.
