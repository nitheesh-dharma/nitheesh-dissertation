Three of the new studies investigated antidepressant drugs as pre-emptive treatments to prevent development of neuropathic pain (Bowsher 1997; Lampl 2002; Reuben 2004). We have added a table listing the studies with continuous data (Additional Table 01).<BR/>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Antidepressants for treating neuropathic pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>A number of medicines used to treat depression (antidepressants) are effective in treating pain associated with nerve damage (neuropathic pain). At least one third of patients with neuropathic pain who took traditional antidepressants (such as amitriptyline) obtained moderate pain relief or better. There is also evidence that Venlafaxine, a newer antidepressant, has similar effectiveness to traditional antidepressants. However, approximately one fifth of those who take these medicines for pain discontinue the therapy due to adverse effects. There is very limited evidence that some other newer antidepressants, known as SSRIs, may be effective but more studies are needed to confirm this. Neuropathic pain can be treated with antidepressants and the effect is independent of any effect on depression. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>
<B>. </B>For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. In this update a total of sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion (including 11 additional studies (778 participants)) Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-09-04 09:12:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Philip J Wiffen">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Further updating was started in mid 2009 with plans to split this large review into several smaller ones. Work has began on Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline is widely used to treat this condition. <BR/>Neuropathic pain refers to a group of painful disorders characterised by pain due to dysfunction or disease of the nervous system at a peripheral level, a central level, or both. It is a complex entity with many symptoms and signs that fluctuate in number and intensity over time. The three common components of neuropathic pain are steady and neuralgic pain; paroxysmal spontaneous attacks; and hypersensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Woolf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain can be very disabling, severe and intractable, causing distress and suffering for individuals, including dysaesthesia and paraesthesia. Sensory deficits, such as partial or complex loss of sensation, are also commonly seen. In addition, there are significant psychological and social consequences linked to chronic neuropathic pain, which contribute to a reduction in quality of life.</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain is quite common in general medical practice. The prevalence of trigeminal neuralgia is 2.1 to 4.7 persons per 100,000 of the population, and of painful diabetic neuropathy occurs in 11% to 16% of Type 1 diabetics as well as Type II diabetics and postherpetic neuralgia is found in approximately 34 per 100,000 of the population (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>). Treatment of neuropathic pain is not easy. Patients with neuropathic pain do not always respond to standard analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and to some extent neuropathic pain is resistant to opiates. The pharmacologic agents best studied and longest used for the treatment of neuropathic pain are antidepressants and anticonvulsants (<LINK REF="REF-Woolf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 1999</LINK>). The clinical impression is that both drug classes are useful for neuropathic pain but there are unanswered questions, such as, 'Which drug class - antidepressants or anticonvulsants - should be the first-line choice?'; 'Is one antidepressant drug superior to another?'; 'Is there any difference in response to antidepressants in different neuropathic syndromes?'.</P>
<P>Previous systematic reviews of anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) for the treatment of chronic pain found a number of controlled trials showing analgesic effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tremont_x002d_Lukats-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tremont-Lukats 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2001</LINK>). Carbamazepine has been shown to be an effective treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Gabapentin is effective in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy but may not be superior to carbamazepine in terms of analgesic effectiveness. Five review articles are known; two are reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Magni-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magni 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onghena-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onghena 1992</LINK>), and three are systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Max-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Max 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1995</LINK>). In the most recent of these, a systematic review of antidepressants and anticonvulsants for diabetic neuropathy and post herpetic neuralgia, both drug classes were shown to be equally effective (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mechanisms of action of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain remain uncertain. Analgesia is often achieved at lower dosage and faster (usually within a few days) than the onset of any antidepressant effect which can take up to six weeks. In addition, there is no correlation between the effect of antidepressants on mood and pain. Furthermore, antidepressants produce analgesia in patients with and without depression (<LINK REF="REF-Onghena-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onghena 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two main groups of antidepressants are in common use. The older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline, imipramine and many others, and a newer group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The clinical impression was that TCAs are more effective in treating neuropathic pain. However, SSRIs are gaining acceptance for pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-McCleane-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCleane 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, antidepressants have been classed into groups as follows:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>TCAs such as amitriptyline and imipramine (the so-called tetracyclics e.g. mianserin and maprotiline are also included in this group;</LI>
<LI>newer antidepressants including SSRIs such as paroxetine; serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), venlafaxine and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase type A (RIMAs) such as moclobemide;</LI>
<LI>herbal treatments (St John's Wort);</LI>
<LI>any other antidepressants to include mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), bupropion and L-tryptophan. It is not implied that these are in any way similar.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>TCAs exhibit more significant adverse effects, which limit clinical use, particularly in older people. The most serious adverse effects of TCAs occur within the cardiovascular system, such as postural hypotension, heart block and arrhythmias. The most common adverse effects are sedation and anticholinergic effects (such as dry mouth, constipation and urinary retention) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2006</LINK>). SSRIs are better tolerated, they are free of cardiovascular side effects, are less sedative and have fewer anticholinergic effects than TCAs (<LINK REF="REF-Feighner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feighner 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glassman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glassman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glassman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glassman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peretti-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peretti 2000</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the analgesic effectiveness and adverse effects of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain. </P>

Studies could have taken place in any care setting (in-patient, outpatient, day-care, community). Studies with fewer than ten participants were excluded as small studies yield unreliable results (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study assessment</HEADING>
<P>Trial reports that appeared potentially relevant were identified using the search strategy described above. Using the full text of each study, trials were assessed for inclusion in the review by two review authors (TS and PW)<B> </B>according to defined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted using forms designed for this purpose. Reasons for excluding trials from the review are documented in the 'Characteristics of Excluded Studies' table. Disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study quality</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the included studies was assessed where possible in terms of the adequacy of concealment of allocation. This was done using the criteria defined in The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>) where grade A is adequate concealment; grade B is uncertain allocation concealment; grade C is clearly inadequate concealment, grade D is not used).</P>
<P>In addition, the Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. This scale covers three dimensions of study quality: randomisation, blinding and study withdrawals. The maximum possible score is five.</P>
<P>The three item scale is as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Was the study described as randomised? (1 = yes; 0 = no).</P>
<P>Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (1= yes; 0 = no); deduct one point if inappropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Was the study described as double-blind ? (1 = yes; 0 = no).</P>
<P>Was the double blinding well described and appropriate? (1 = yes; 0 = no); deduct one point if inappropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Description of study withdrawals and dropouts</HEADING>
<P>Were withdrawals and dropouts described? (1 = yes; 0 = no).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis</HEADING>
<P>For cross-over trials data were used from the first arm (if available) and also any data relating to patient preference were recorded. Analysis was carried out using an intention-to-treat model. Analyses were planned using a fixed-effect model unless significant heterogeneity was found. The data were extracted from included trials and, where appropriate, entered into RevMan Analyses 1.1.2 in RevMan 4.2.10. An Excel template developed locally was used to calculate Numbers-Needed-to-Treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH)</P>

In all four studies SSRIs were superior to placebo. Fluoxetine 20 mg and 40 mg were stated to be more effective than placebo in 98 patients with idiopathic facial pain (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1997</LINK>) and in treatment of 54 patients with diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Max-1992b" TYPE="STUDY">Max 1992b</LINK>); paroxetine 40 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1990a</LINK>) and citalopram 40 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1992a" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1992a</LINK>) were also reported to be effective in treatment of diabetic neuropathy in two small studies. See more detailed data of the studies in the 'Characteristics of Included Studies' table. Insufficient reporting of the data in these studies prevents the calculation of NNTs.</P>
<P>One study that compared paroxetine 20 mg or sertraline 50 mg to amisulpride 50 mg (antipsychotic) in patients with burning mouth syndrome did not demonstrate any differences<BR/>between the two SSRIs (<LINK REF="STD-Maina-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Maina 2002</LINK>). RR for effectiveness was 0.96 (not significant), 16/23 patients responded to paroxetine and 13/18 to sertraline. No difference was found in efficacy of SSRIs and amisulpride, RR 1.01 (not significant). Twenty-nine patients out of 41 responded to SSRIs compared to 19/27 who responded to amisulpride.</P>
<P>Only two controlled studies compared SSRIs to TCAs. In the first placebo controlled study paroxetine 40 mg was compared to imipramine in doses of up to 350 mg/day in 26 patients with diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1990a" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1990a</LINK>). Only mean data were reported. Both drugs reduced the neuropathy score more effectively than placebo, but paroxetine was reported to be 'somewhat less effective' than imipramine. In spite of this, the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores shown graphically are similar for paroxetine and imipramine. In the other study fluoxetine was compared to amitriptyline and desipramine in 47 patients with postherpetic neuralgia. Clinically meaningful pain relief (moderate or better) was significantly more likely with desipramine (12/15) than with amitriptyline (9/17) or fluoxetine (5/15) (<LINK REF="STD-Rowbotham-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rowbotham 2004</LINK>).</P>

Relative risk of effectiveness for two of these studies including data of pain relief or global improvement was RR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.3) and the NNT for effectiveness compared to placebo 3.4 (95% CI 2.2 to 7.7) (<LINK REF="STD-Feinmann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Feinmann 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lascelles-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Lascelles 1966</LINK>). ITT analyses were performed in both studies: 34/48 patients on dothiepin 150 mg experienced pain relief as compared to 21/45 on placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Feinmann-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Feinmann 1984</LINK>), and in another study 15/20 patients reported pain relief on phenelzine 45 mg as compared to 7/20 on placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Lascelles-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Lascelles 1966</LINK>). In two studies mean data were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Forssell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forssell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1997</LINK>). In a study of 97 patients fluoxetine 20 mg was reported by authors to be more effective than placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1997</LINK>). Venlafaxine 75 mg was not statistically significantly superior to placebo in 30 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Forssell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Forssell 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Burning mouth syndrome</HEADING>
<P>Only one placebo-controlled study was found in burning mouth pain. In that study trazodone 200 mg was shown to be ineffective (<LINK REF="STD-Tammiala_x002d_Salonen-99" TYPE="STUDY">Tammiala-Salonen 99</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Postoperative neuropathic pain after breast cancer treatments</HEADING>
<P>Three small placebo-controlled studies of postoperative neuropathic pain after breast cancer surgery and radiotherapy were found (<LINK REF="STD-Kalso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuben-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reuben 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasmuth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tasmuth 2002</LINK>). In one study chronic pain was significantly reduced by venlafaxine 75 mg (14/48 patients in venlafaxine arm; 34/47 in placebo arm). Also analgesic use was significantly lower in the venlafaxine group 8/48 versus 26/47 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Reuben-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reuben 2004</LINK>). Only mean data were available in two studies. In the first study amitriptyline 100 mg was reported to relieve pain significantly in 20 breast cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Kalso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 1996</LINK>); in the second study some pain relief was reported with venlafaxine 75 mg in 15 breast cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Tasmuth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tasmuth 2002</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pre-emptive use of antidepressants</HEADING>
<P>Five studies investigated pre-emptive use of antidepressants in neuropathic pain. Three small placebo-controlled studies of postoperative neuropathic pain after breast cancer surgery and radiotherapy were found (<LINK REF="STD-Kalso-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reuben-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Reuben 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tasmuth-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tasmuth 2002</LINK>). In all three studies at least some preventive effect was demonstrated with antidepressants, either amitriptyline or venlafaxine, in prevention of postmastectomy pain. In one study low dose of amitriptyline (25 mg) was shown to be superior to placebo in prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in 80 patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bowsher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bowsher 1997</LINK>). In another small placebo controlled study of 39 thalamic stroke patients amitriptyline 75 mg was not superior to placebo in prevention of post stroke pain (Lampl 2000).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects and drug-related study withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>Across all studies, 453<B> </B>participants dropped out of active groups for a variety of reasons including adverse effects (13% of participants receiving antidepressants). Number-needed-to-harm (NNHs) were calculated for different antidepressants irrespective of the condition treated. These were calculated for minor harm, which included symptoms such as drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, urinary retention, sweating, headache, blurred vision, palpitations, irritability and ataxia. Studies with active control were not included in analyses of NNH for minor harm.</P>
<P>Major harm was defined as any effect leading to withdrawal from the study. The NNH for major harm for tri-and tetracyclic antidepressants was 28 (95% CI 17 to 68) for amitriptyline (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6) and 16 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine (RR 2.5; not significant). For other antidepressants no statistically significant difference was found as compared to placebo. The NNHs for minor harm for TCAs was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) and 9 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine (RR 1.20; not significant).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The additional trials now included have strengthened the evidence for the use of TCAs and provided new information of the use of venlafaxine. There is limited evidence that antidepressants do not have a pre-emptive effect in preventing the development of neuropathic pain.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>This review of 61 RCTs provides robust evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressants in treating neuropathic pain. Tricyclic antidepressants have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5); RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) and venlafaxine of 3.1 (2.2 to 5.1); RR 2.2 (95 % CI 1.5 to 3.1). This means that for every three or four patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. </P>
<P>There is limited evidence to suggest that the newer SSRI antidepressants may be effective. These medicines are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required. Studies of other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan were too small for any firm conclusions to be made.</P>
<P>In terms of specific conditions, TCAs were shown to be effective in diabetic neuropathy and post herpetic neuralgia. There is some indication of effectiveness in central pain and atypical facial pain but few trials and small participant numbers prevent firm recommendations.</P>
<P>There is a lack of evidence for any effect in burning mouth syndrome. There is evidence that TCAs are ineffective in HIV related neuropathies.</P>
<P>Adverse effects with TCAs can be significant and lead to withdrawal from treatment. In this review, 20% of participants receiving antidepressants withdrew because of intolerable adverse effects. The adverse effects of TCAs are well documented from the clinical experience of treating depression. These include troublesome effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention. The daily dose administered as a single night time dose often helps patients cope with the drowsiness element. Severe adverse effects include arrhythmias and heart block. Caution is needed in patients who have a history of cardiac disease, or are elderly, or both.</P>
<P>It is well recognised that pain has an emotional component. This review demonstrates in a limited way that analgesia is independent of any effect that these drugs are having on depression. This supports the clinical impression of pain specialists and published work (<LINK REF="REF-Onghena-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onghena 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The quality of the reporting limited the ability to combine data: many reports gave insufficient information, used a variety of different outcome measurements, and variable dosing. The quality of reporting in recent trials remains disappointing, in particular insufficient details are provided to enable effectiveness to be assessed. This is marked by an on-going preference to only report mean pain data rather than by reporting the number of participants responding. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The best evidence of pain relief is for TCAs and amitriptyline in particular which has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.5 to 4.2). There is some new data on venlafaxine in the treatment of neuropathic pain (three studies) which shows NNTs quite similar to TCAs (NNT for venlafaxine 3 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1). Only limited data exist for the effectiveness of SSRIs. For patients who get relief from TCAs but find the adverse effects a problem, the very limited data on SSRIs suggests that a trial of SSRIs in those individuals may yield benefit. </P>
<P>The effect of antidepressants was mainly demonstrated in treatment of diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. A limited number of studies were available in the other neuropathic pain syndromes such as central pain, atypical facial pain and postoperative pain after breast cancer treatments. No effect of antidepressants was demonstrated in one small study of burning mouth syndrome and in two studies of HIV related neuropathic pain. </P>
<P>The clinical impression is that antidepressants are effective. Effectiveness is usually seen in a few days if there is a response. It also seems to confirm clinical practice, that if one antidepressant is not effective or not tolerated then another may be effective. It would seem prudent, based on this evidence, to initiate treatment with amitriptyline and to switch to an alternative TCAs or venlafaxine if some pain relief is achieved but side effects are troublesome. Limited evidence suggests that antidepressants do not have a pre-emptive effect.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is needed with regard to the effect of newer types of antidepressants, such as SSRIs or SNRIs in the treatment of neuropathic pain, this is important because these drugs generally are better tolerated than TCAs. There is some evidence suggesting that these medicines may be of benefit in neuropathic pain. Head to head trials with TCAs are required to demonstrate effectiveness. The on-going trend to report only mean data in RCTs does restrict analysis. Reporting of responder numbers in each arm of a trial would significantly add to the usefulness of those trials in clinical practice.</P>
