<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Hypertensive emergencies occur when high blood pressure is associated with the presence of acute end organ damage, such as heart attack or stroke. There is controversy as to when and which blood pressure drugs to use in these situations. This review looked for all studies where patients were randomized to one or more treatments to measure the effects of such therapies. The questions of the review were to see whether drug treatments affected death or cardiovascular morbidity or whether there were differences between drug treatments. The available evidence was insufficient to answer these questions.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hypertensive emergencies, marked hypertension associated with acute end-organ damage, are life-threatening conditions. Many anti-hypertensive drugs have been used in these clinical settings. The benefits and harms of such treatment and the best first-line treatment are not known.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To answer the following two questions using randomized controlled trials (RCTs): 1) does anti-hypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or no treatment affect mortality and morbidity in patients presenting with a hypertensive emergency? 2) Does one first-line antihypertensive drug class as compared to another antihypertensive drug class affect mortality and morbidity in these patients?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane clinical trial register. In addition, we searched for references in review articles and trials. We attempted to contact trialists. Most recent search August 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All unconfounded, truly randomized trials that compare an antihypertensive drug versus placebo, no treatment, or another antihypertensive drug from a different class in patients presenting with a hypertensive emergency.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Quality of concealment allocation was scored. Data on randomized patients, total serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular events, withdrawals due to adverse events, length of follow-up, blood pressure and heart rate were extracted independently and cross checked.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifteen randomized controlled trials (representing 869 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Two trials included a placebo arm. All studies (except one) were open-label trials. Seven drug classes were evaluated in those trials: nitrates (9 trials), ACE-inhibitors (7), diuretics (3), calcium channel blockers (6), alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists (4), direct vasodilators (2) and dopamine agonists (1). <BR/>Mortality event data were reported in 7 trials. No meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes, due to insufficient data. The pooled effect of 3 different anti-hypertensive drugs in one placebo-controlled trial showed a statistically significant greater reduction in both systolic [WMD -13, 95%CI -19,-7] and diastolic [WMD -8, 95%CI, -12,-3] blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no RCT evidence demonstrating that anti-hypertensive drugs reduce mortality or morbidity in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, there is insufficient RCT evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. There were some minor differences in the degree of blood pressure lowering when one class of antihypertensive drug is compared to another. However, the clinical significance is unknown. RCTs are needed to assess different drug classes to determine initial and longer term mortality and morbidity outcomes.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>A hypertensive emergency is the clinical setting where a marked elevation of blood pressure is associated with acute end organ damage e.g.. encephalopathy or aortic dissection. As such it is a life-threatening condition. The goal of treatment is to reverse the end organ damage, prevent adverse outcomes and prolong life. This review focuses on blood pressure lowering drugs that are used in this emergency setting. <BR/>The management of hypertension in these emergency situations represents a significant therapeutic challenge. Many antihypertensive drug classes have been used with the objective of rapidly reducing blood pressure, and the expectation of reducing adverse clinical outcomes. This approach was first recommended by Gifford in 1959 [<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 1959</LINK>] based on a series of 8 cases with hypertensive encephalopathy that were treated with sodium nitroprusside. Based on this case series evidence this approach has become and remained the standard of care and is currently recommended by most if not all guideline committees [such as <LINK REF="REF-JNC_x002d_7" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC-7</LINK>]. At issue in this review is whether RCT evidence supports this approach and which drug classes are the most effective.<BR/>Two published systematic reviews have addressed these issues. One compares different antihypertensive drugs, but it pools hypertensive emergency and urgency trials [<LINK REF="REF-Cherney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherney 2002</LINK>]. Urgencies are defined as marked elevated blood pressure in an otherwise stable patient (i.e., without acute end organ damage). In our opinion the urgency setting is very different from that of emergencies and needs to be reviewed separately. <BR/>The second systematic review, a Cochrane review of interventions [<LINK REF="REF-BASC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2001</LINK>] that alter blood pressure after acute stroke, is not limited to RCTs studying drugs to reduce blood pressure and includes RCTs whether or not the patients had elevated blood pressure. Therefore, it also does not answer the question raised here.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>General<BR/>To find and quantify the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for antihypertensive drug treatment of patients with a hypertensive emergency, defined as marked hypertension associated with acute end organ damage.</P>
<P>Specific <BR/>To answer the following two questions:<BR/>Does anti-hypertensive drug therapy as compared to placebo or no treatment affect mortality and morbidity in patients with a hypertensive emergency?<BR/>Does one first-line antihypertensive drug class offer a therapeutic advantage, in terms of mortality and morbidity, over another in patients with a hypertensive emergency?</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>All unconfounded, truly randomized control trials that compare a first-line antihypertensive drug class versus placebo, no treatment or another first-line antihypertensive drug class. Crossover trials are excluded. There is no language restriction.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants must meet the following hypertensive emergency definition: any clinical setting where patients present with marked elevation of blood pressure in the presence of acute end organ damage. Examples of acute end organ damage are the following: myocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary oedema, acute aortic dissection, encephalopathy, stroke, and life-threatening bleeding (intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage).<BR/>Thus, patients with marked elevation of blood pressure but without acute end organ damage (defined as urgencies) are not included.<BR/>There is no evidence as to what constitutes "marked blood pressure elevation". Therefore, we have chosen blood pressure level(s) commonly used in clinical practice to mandate the use of antihypertensive drugs (along with other acute therapy such as pain management) in relevant clinical settings. For example, for patients with acute myocardial infarction a SBP greater or equal to 180 and or DBP &#8805; 110 mm Hg is the threshold above which thrombolysis is contraindicated [ACC/AHA-<LINK REF="REF-Antman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antman 2004</LINK>].For patients with acute aortic dissection or with left ventricular failure and pulmonary oedema a SBP greater or equal to 120 mm Hg and or DBP &#8805;70 mm Hg is the threshold for therapy [<LINK REF="REF-Dalen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalen 1979</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Mattu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattu 2005</LINK>]. For patients with intracranial haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage a SBP &#8805; 160 mm Hg is the threshold because of a higher incidence of re-bleeding above this level [<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2005</LINK>]. For patients with any other acute end organ damage setting a SBP &#8805; 180 and or DBP &#8805; 110 mm Hg is the defined threshold.<BR/>We included all RCTs that included patients with these minimum or higher thresholds. In the case that a RCT does not define blood pressure inclusion criteria but had included only one category of patients (patients with pulmonary oedema, for example), then the mean base-line blood pressure had to be equal to or greater than these defined thresholds. In the event that an RCT had included patients with different end organ damage clinical settings, a mean base-line blood pressure of SBP &#8805;180 and or DBP &#8805; 110 mm Hg is acceptable for inclusion. <BR/>Note: Pregnancy-related hypertensive emergencies are excluded from this review.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data abstraction:<BR/>Two reviewers (MIP &amp; VM) independently decided whether a trial was included. They also independently extracted and entered the data from the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Absence of consensus was resolved by a third reviewer (JMW). <BR/>A modified Cochrane quality scoring system was used for concealment of allocation and blinding: A (adequate &amp; double-blind), B (unclear &amp; single-blind or open label), C (clearly inadequate &amp; open-label). The two reviewers (MIP &amp; VM) also independently assessed the quality of studies. Authors were contacted in case of missing information.</P>
<P>Analyses:<BR/>For the synthesis and analysis of the data Cochrane Review Manager 4.2.9 was used. <BR/>Relative and absolute risk differences (with 95% confidence interval) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes for each trial on an intention to treat basis. Heterogeneity between trials results was tested using chi-squared test, where p less than 0.05 was taken to indicate significant heterogeneity. The fixed effect model was used when there was homogeneity and the random effect model was used to test for statistical significance where there was heterogeneity. <BR/>Trials were not sub-classified according to dose or dosing regimen. Data for blood pressure was combined using a weighted mean difference method, whereby the trials are weighted according to the number of subjects in the trial and the within-study variance. Some of the trials did not report a within-study variance for blood pressure reduction. In these studies standard deviation (SD) was imputed using the following hierarchy:<BR/>1. Pooled standard deviation calculated either from the t-statistic corresponding to an exact p-value reported or from the 95% confidence interval of the mean difference between treatment group and comparative group.<BR/>2. Standard deviation of blood pressure/heart rate at the end of treatment.<BR/>3. Standard deviation of blood pressure/heart rate at baseline (except if this measure is used for entry criteria).<BR/>4. Weighted mean standard deviation of change in blood pressure/heart rate calculated from at least 3 other trials using the same drug and dose regimen.<BR/>5. Weighted mean standard deviation of change in blood pressure/heart rate calculated from other trials using the same drug.<BR/>6. Weighted mean standard deviation of change in blood pressure/heart rate calculated from all other trials (any drug and dose).<BR/>Several sensitivity analyses were pre-planned to test robustness including the use of both fixed and random effects models, 95 and 99% confidence intervals, and quality of trials. Also sensitivity analyses were pre-planned according to the clinical setting and to the class of drug.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Fifteen randomized controlled trials (869 patients) were found that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Two trials were placebo-controlled[<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pastorelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pastorelli 1991</LINK>]. Only one trial [<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1996</LINK>] was confirmed to be double-blind, while the rest were open-label.

<BR/>Drug vs. placebo or no treatment</I>
<BR/>Although we included two placebo-controlled trials, only one provided systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) data [<LINK REF="STD-Pastorelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pastorelli 1991</LINK>] and this was limited to one hour of follow-up. In this trial, 3 classes of antihypertensives were included : calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists. The pooled effect showed a statistically significant greater reduction in both systolic [WMD -13.14, 95%CI -19.48,-6.80] and diastolic [WMD -8.03, 95%CI -12.61,-3.45] blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy. There was no data on heart rate.<BR/>It was not possible to extract BP data from the other placebo-controlled trial [<LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1996</LINK>]. In addition to not reporting any measurement of variability, this trial reported BP data as change in mean arterial pressure (MAP).</P>
<P>
<I>Nitrates vs. diuretics</I>
<BR/>Three trials compared nitrates to diuretics [<LINK REF="STD-Beltrame-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beltrame 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verma-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 1987</LINK>]. Furosemide was the common diuretic used in all of them with two nitrates, nitroglycerine and isosorbide as comparators. Neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure lowering effect was statistically different between the two classes of drugs. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Beltrame-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Beltrame 1998</LINK>, the systolic blood pressure lowering effect of both drugs was greater (-21 mm Hg for furosemide; -23.75 mm Hg for nitroglycerin) than that reported in the other two trials [+1.0, +1.6 mm Hg for furosemide groups; and -6,-8 mm Hg for isosorbide groups, respectively ]. The reasons for that difference across trials are not clear. Despite these differences, heterogeneity was not present when pooling all these three trials. Heart rate change was also not significantly different for both classes of drugs.</P>
<P>
<I>Nitrates vs. alpha-1 antagonist<BR/>
</I>Two trials compared the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (A1A), urapidil, with nitrates [<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 1998</LINK>]. The first trial used nitroprusside and the second used nitroglycerine as comparator. <BR/>The systolic blood pressure lowering effect of the two nitrates was similar (-58.4 mmHg for nitroprusside and -59.5 mmHg for nitroglycerine). However, the effect of urapidil (administrated at the same dose in both trials) was very different (-37.6 mmHg and -73.5 mmHg). A similar discrepancy was seen for diastolic blood pressure. This heterogeneity precluded the pooling of these trials in a meta-analysis for these outcomes. </P>

<I>Nitrates vs. dopamine agonist<BR/>
</I>For this comparison one trial was included [<LINK REF="STD-Elliott-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Elliott 1990</LINK>]. During 4 hours of treatment, nitrates were associated with a statistically significant greater reduction in systolic blood pressure as compared with a dopamine agonist (WMD -14.00, 95%CI -27.72, -0.28). There were no differences between these classes in diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.</P>
<P>
<I>Nitrates vs. ACE-inhibitors<BR/>
</I>One trial compared a nitrate with an ACE inhibitor [<LINK REF="STD-Hirschl-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hirschl 1999</LINK>]. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate.</P>

Using the fixed effect model, CCBs were associated with statistically significant increase in heart rate as compared to the nitrates (WMD 11.76, 95%CI 4.45,19.07). However there was significant heterogeneity across trials and this increase was no longer statistically significant when a random effect model was used.</P>

<I>Nitrates vs. direct vasodilator</I>
<BR/>For this comparison one trial was included [<LINK REF="STD-Verma-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Verma 1987</LINK>].

The pooled data shows that CCBs were associated with a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure as compared with ACE-I (WMD 7.86, 95% CI [4.92, 10.81]. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in the reduction of systolic blood pressure. In 3 trials that reported heart rate changes [<LINK REF="STD-Angeli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Angeli 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marigliano-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Marigliano 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>] CCBs were associated with a significant increase in heart rate as compared with ACE-Inhibitors (WMD 22.91, 95%CI 19.8, 26.01).

</I>Two trials [<LINK REF="STD-Pastorelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Pastorelli 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 1993</LINK>] compared an ACE-Inhibitor with an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (A1A). Both trials used captopril as comparator but one trial used prazosin and the other used ketanserin. The pooled data shows that ACE-I were associated with a significantly greater reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared with A1A (SBP WMD -20, 95% CI [-22.85,-17.39; DBP WMD -3.70, 95% CI [-7.08,-0.31]). For SBP outcome there was statistically significant heterogeneity across trials. However the difference was still significant when the random effects model was used.

<I>Diazoxide vs. hydralazine<BR/>
</I>For this comparison one trial [<LINK REF="STD-DANISH-II-1986" TYPE="STUDY">DANISH II 1986</LINK>], which dealt with exclusively hypertensive encephalopathy patients, was included. During 4 hours of treatment, hydralazine was associated with a statistically significant greater reduction in both systolic (WMD 13.56, 95%CI 3.06, 24.06) and diastolic (WMD 14.67, 95%CI 8.01, 21.33) blood pressure as compared with diazoxide (WMD -14.00, 95%CI -27.72, -0.28). It is important to mention, though, that there was no measure of variability reported in this trial. Therefore, we imputed the standard deviation of the change according to our hierarchy from other trials (Last option: weighted mean standard deviation of change from all trials; any drug any dose). There was no heart rate data reported.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This is the first systematic review investigating mortality and morbidity outcomes for all RCTs of drug treatment for hypertensive emergencies. A systematic review that combined hypertensive emergencies and urgencies [<LINK REF="REF-Cherney-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherney 2002</LINK>] did not include 11 trials included in our systematic review. Furthermore, Cherney's review mixed randomized with non-randomized trials.<BR/>The only other relevant systematic review in relation to hypertensive emergencies is that conducted for acute stroke by <LINK REF="REF-BASC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2001</LINK>. We excluded one trial [<LINK REF="STD-Lisk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lisk 1993</LINK>; n =16 patients] that the <LINK REF="REF-BASC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2001</LINK> systematic review had included. The reason for excluding it was because the blood pressure criteria in this trial (&gt;170/95 mmHg) did not meet our blood pressure threshold criteria (SBP&#8805; 180 and or DBP &#8805; 110 mm Hg). This exclusion does not affect our conclusion for clinical outcomes as this trial did not report clinical outcomes. The other <LINK REF="REF-BASC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BASC 2001</LINK> trials were not included because blood pressure at baseline was not elevated. Thus, these clinical trials did not include hypertensive emergency patients, as we have defined it.<BR/>One of the limitations in our review is that most of the included trials were small (average 58 patients per trial). Furthermore, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1996</LINK> all trials were of poor quality.<BR/>Three included trials deserve further discussion. <LINK REF="STD-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hamilton 1996</LINK>, the only double-blind trial, includes patients with acute pulmonary edema and high blood pressure, and it compared captopril vs. placebo. It demonstrates that this high quality and double-blind trial was ethical and feasible. The <LINK REF="STD-DANISH-II-1986" TYPE="STUDY">DANISH II 1986</LINK> trial was the only trial that included patients exclusively with hypertensive encephalopathy. This was a well organized multicentre trial, conducted in Denmark, comparing diazoxide vs. dihydralazine. Due to its study design, the ethical committee accepted that the informed consent could not be obtained from patients as all of them had symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy. A downside of this study is the fact that the trialists reported their results in duplicate publications that did not cite the other publications [The original publication, <LINK REF="REF-Krogsgaard-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krogsgaard 1983</LINK>, is not cited in the other duplicate publications, <LINK REF="REF-McNair-1985_x002d_D" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 1985-D</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McNair-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krogsgaard-1986_x002d_D" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krogsgaard 1986-D</LINK>]. In addition, blood pressure values were not the same in the different publications, and none of the publications measures blood pressure variability. The largest trial, <LINK REF="STD-Schreiber-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schreiber 1998</LINK>, included 133 patients with acute pulmonary edema plus high blood pressure, in an out-of-hospital setting, who were randomized to receive either nitroglycerin or urapidil. The ethical committee (Vienna, Austria) agreed that no informed consent had to be obtained at the time of inclusion for randomization. However, 16% of all randomized patients were excluded from the analyses which could potentially bias the results. Consistent with this, there was significant heterogeneity when this trial was combined with another trial studying the same comparison groups.<BR/> <BR/> In 19 of the excluded trials it was not possible to determine how many patients had acute end organ damage or merely had elevation of blood pressure. We believe that it would be misleading to include these trials in this review as the impact of antihypertensive drugs is potentially different. If individual patient data could be obtained, the patients with acute end organ damage could be added to our review. <BR/> It was perhaps surprising and definitely disappointing that we could find no randomized controlled trial evidence to answer the first question we have posed: Does antihypertensive therapy as compared to placebo or no treatment change mortality and morbidity in patients with hypertensive emergencies? The one available placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that blood pressure was reduced with drugs as compared to the control treatment, however, it was too small and of too short duration to assess morbidity and mortality. We feel it is important for physicians to know that this is one of the clinical settings where treatment is not supported by RCT evidence.<BR/>Despite the lack of evidence it is not hard to accept the necessity of lowering blood pressure in those clinical settings where the excessive increases in blood pressure are the cause of the end organ damage. However, this is not necessarily the best approach in settings where the excessive elevations of blood pressure are probably caused by end organ damage such as high BP in the presence of a cerebrovascular accident. The presently accepted approach for the immediate treatment of hypertensive emergencies in clinical practice is primarily based on a series of cases published in 1959 [<LINK REF="REF-Gifford-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gifford 1959</LINK>]. In this study carried out over a period of 18 months the author demonstrated the ability to reduce blood pressure with nitroprusside, within minutes, in 8 patients with hypertensive emergencies (mostly patients with hypertensive encephalopathy) whose blood pressures had remained elevated after treatment with reserpine or hydralazine. However, he did not report clinical outcomes so we do not know whether these patients did better as a result of the blood pressure lowering. Gifford recommended prompt blood pressure reduction in clinical settings other than hypertensive encephalopathy such as intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute left ventricular failure. The lack of RCT evidence leaves the distinct possibility that in some clinical settings defined as hypertensive emergencies immediate antihypertensive therapy could be doing more harm than good. <BR/>There is a hypertensive emergency not included in the present systematic review, eclampsia. Due to its pathophysiology and the involvement of the infant as well as the mother , we felt this clinical entity must be studied separately from other hypertensive emergencies and include outcomes in the infant as well as the mother. There is a Cochrane systematic review [<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2006</LINK>] that has studied the drugs for treatment of very high blood pressure during pregnancy. However, Duley's SR was not limited to patients with eclampsia and did not separately report outcomes in the eclampsia patients. To the best of our knowledge there is no systematic review dealing exclusively with eclampsia and anti-hypertensive treatment. Thus, a systematic review in this specific area is currently needed.<BR/>The present review also does not provide any mortality and morbidity evidence from RCTs to inform clinicians as to which first-line antihypertensive drug class provides more benefit than harm in hypertensive emergencies. This lack of evidence was due to the fact that the trials were too small, did not follow the patients for a long enough period of time and frequently failed to report all important outcomes. In addition all the RCTs except one were open-label trials and therefore concealment of allocation was not possible in most cases. Although, these shortcomings of the trials would not likely affect mortality and morbidity outcomes, they could bias blood pressure and heart rate data. <BR/>Neither did we find RCTs that compared different strategies to reduce blood pressure. Thus, how fast or how much blood pressure should be lowered in hypertensive emergencies remains unknown. <BR/>Although it is unproven, it is highly likely that antihypertensive therapy is an overall benefit in a hypertensive emergency and therefore a placebo controlled trial to prove this would be unethical. What is clear is that this is a clinical area where properly conducted randomised trials are badly needed. At the present time RCTs could be conducted to compare different drug classes and treatment strategies e.g.. aggressive rapid lowering of blood pressure to a target versus lowering the blood pressure slowly at a defined rate such as 5-10% every 2 hours. What is also clear from this review is that any trial must follow patients long-term and document mortality and morbidity. One of the best examples of an adequate RCT in an emergency setting is the CRASH trial [<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2004</LINK>] where 10,000 patients with acute head injury were randomized to intravenous steroids or placebo. Its approach to handle ethical issues could serve as model when conducting a trial with hypertensive emergency patients. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from RCTs that anti-hypertensive drugs reduce mortality or morbidity in patients with hypertensive emergencies, defined as marked hypertension associated with acute end organ damage. Furthermore, there is insufficient RCT evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. There were some minor differences in degree of blood pressure lowering between drug classes. However, the clinical significance is unknown.<BR/>This review demonstrates a blood pressure lowering efficacy for: nitrates, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, alpha-adrenergic antagonist, calcium channel blockers and dopamine agonists. Nitrates (including nitroprusside) have been studied the most. Therefore, if a hypertensive emergency patient cannot be treated as part of an RCT and a nitrate is available, it is a reasonable choice of therapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess different blood pressure lowering strategies and different first-line drug classes in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Outcomes in such trials must be mortality and total serious adverse events at different times of follow-up such as 7 days, 1 month and including at least 6 months of follow-up of all patients. </P>
