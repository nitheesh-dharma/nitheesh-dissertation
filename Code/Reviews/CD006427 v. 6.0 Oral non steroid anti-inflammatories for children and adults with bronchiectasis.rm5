<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Infection and inflammation play an important role in the symptomatology and disease progression in patients with bronchiectasis. Anti inflammatory drugs may reduce the inflammatory cascade and thus may be beneficial in people with bronchiectasis. Using the standard search module of the Cochrane Airways Group, no randomised controlled trials that assessed the use of oral non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in bronchiectasis were found. Thus the routine use of NSAIDs in bronchiectasis cannot be recommended. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-12-10 11:40:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bronchiectasis, previously termed an 'orphan disease' is increasingly recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity especially in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Karakoc-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karakoc 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karadag-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karadag 2005</LINK>) and in pockets of affluent countries (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>). The underlying aetiology of bronchiectasis varies from post recurrent respiratory infections to rare immune deficiencies. However, bronchiectasis is also a common pathway for a variety of diseases. Thus, the presence of bronchiectasis is also increasingly recognised in common (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>) and uncommon respiratory diseases (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>) and sarcoidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>)) as well non primary respiratory (e.g. autoimmune) diseases. When bronchiectasis is present with another underlying disorder, it increases the morbidity and mortality of the underlying diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>). For example, in diseases like COPD the presence of bronchiectasis has been reported in 29-50% (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2000</LINK>) of cohorts and when present, increases the severity (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>) and frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Gursel-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gursel 2006</LINK>) of respiratory exacerbations. Thus, management of the symptoms and severity of bronchiectasis is important. </P>
<P>The dominant symptoms and signs of bronchiectasis are productive or wet cough, dyspnoea on exertion and presence of other respiratory signs (clubbing, chest wall deformity, respiratory noises such as wheeze or crepitations on auscultation). In the long term, pulmonary decline may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Twiss-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twiss 2006</LINK>). In both children and adult cohort studies, asthma-like symptoms in people with bronchiectasis have been described and when present, are associated with accelerated pulmonary decline when compared to those with bronchiectasis but without asthma-like symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Keistinen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keistinen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1969</LINK>).</P>
<P>Like patients with COPD, children and adults with bronchiectasis also suffer from recurrent acute exacerbations, some of whom require hospitalised treatment. Effective management regimes for bronchiectasis would reduce the frequency or severity of respiratory exacerbations, and/or the long term pulmonary decline. Based on Cole's 'vicious circle hypothesis', microbial colonization/infection is important in the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis as it leads to bronchial obstruction and a normal or exaggerated inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Cole-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cole 1986</LINK>). Anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the inflammatory cascade and thus ameliorate symptoms and reduce long term pulmonary decline. </P>
<P>NSAID's are a class of medicine that act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyses the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. These prostaglandins promote inflammation, pain, and fever, support the function of platelets that are necessary for the clotting of blood, and protect the lining of the stomach from the damaging effects of acid. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are therefore drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects - they reduce pain, fever and inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Behrman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrman 2003</LINK>). Thus the anti-inflammatory effect of NSAIDs that may have a beneficial effect for patients with bronchiectasis. </P>
<P>Although NSAIDs have potential benefits for those with bronchiectasis, their use can lead to adverse events. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, decreased appetite, rash, dizziness, headache, and drowsiness. NSAIDs may also cause fluid retention, leading to edema. The most serious side effects are kidney failure, liver failure, ulcers and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sanghi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanghi 2006</LINK>). Some individuals are allergic to NSAIDs and may develop shortness of breath when an NSAID is administered (<LINK REF="REF-Behrman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrman 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, NSAID's with selective COX 2 inhibitory action, that have less gastrointestinal adverse effects is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-McGettigan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGettigan 2006</LINK>,<LINK REF="REF-Sanghi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanghi 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>In cystic fibrosis, preliminary evidence suggests that NSAIDs may prevent pulmonary deterioration in people with mild lung disease due to CF (<LINK REF="REF-Lands-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lands 1999</LINK>). However, extrapolation of treatment for CF to non-CF bronchiectases may be harmful e.g. recombinant human DNase efficacious in CF causes harm in non CF bronchiectasis (<LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>). Thus a systematic review on the efficacy of NSAIDs in the management of children and adults with bronchiectasis would help guide clinical practice. </P>

<P>It was planned that for the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, odds ratio (OR) would have been calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This analysis would have assumed that children not available for outcome assessment have not improved (and probably represents a conservative estimate of effect).</P>
<P>The results from studies that met the inclusion criteria and reports any of the outcomes of interest were to be included in the subsequent meta-analyses. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) would have been calculated (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 5). For crossover studies, mean treatment differences were to be calculated from raw data, extracted or imputed and entered as fixed effects generic inverse variance (GIV) outcome, to provide summary weighted differences and 95% confidence intervals. In cross-over trials, only data from the first arm was to be included in meta analysis if data was combined with parallel studies (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Numbers needed to treat (NNT) was to be calculated from the pooled OR and its 95% CI applied to a specified baseline risk using an online calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2003</LINK>). Any heterogeneity between the study results was to be examined, described and tested to see if it reached statistical significance using a chi-squared test.</P>

<P>No randomised controlled trials that addressed the role of oral NSAIDs in patients with bronchiectasis were found. Tamaoki et al (<LINK REF="STD-Tamaoki-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Tamaoki 1992</LINK>) in a randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial used inhaled indomethacin and not oral NSAID. This study showed a significant decrease in amount of sputum when indomethacin was given three times a day for 14 days by inhalation though there was no improvement in the pulmonary function. Llewellyn et al (<LINK REF="STD-Llewellyn-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Llewellyn 1995</LINK>) administered oral indomethacin for 28 days to nine patients with bronchiectasis and found no change in the respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function or sputum characteristics. This was not a controlled trial. Laviolette et al (<LINK REF="STD-Laviolette-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Laviolette 1987</LINK>) studied the effects of Mefenamic acid on bronchial tone in healthy volunteers and did not include patients with bronchiectasis. They found no difference in the FVC, FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FRC and specific airway conductance between the drug and placebo group after 2 days of therapy. Vizel et al (<LINK REF="STD-Vizel-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Vizel 1991</LINK>) used aspirin to see its effect on pulmonary ventilation in patients with infiltrative tuberculosis. This was also not a controlled trial.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the absence of randomised control trials, there is no evidence to support or refute the efficacy of oral NSAIDs for the management of bronchiectasis in children and adults. Thus NSAID cannot be recommended as routine therapy in the management of children or adults with bronchiectasis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>In view of some benefit shown by inhaled NSAIDs in bronchiectasis, RCTs are clearly needed to study the possible beneficial effect of oral NSAIDs. The studies should be of parallel design and utilise both subjective and objective outcomes and studied over short, medium (&gt;12 months) and long term so that the efficacy on pulmonary decline can also be assessed. Both paediatric and adult studies are required. </P>
