<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-25 11:18:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The sexual abuse of children is a substantial social problem that affects large numbers of children and young people worldwide. For many children, though not all, it can result in a range of psychological and behavioural problems, some of which can continue into adulthood. Knowing what is most likely to benefit children already traumatised by these events is important. This review aimed to find out if cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT) help reduce the negative impact of sexual abuse on children. Ten studies, in which a total of 847 children participated, met the inclusion criteria for the review. The reporting of studies was poor, and there appear to be significant weaknesses in study quality. The evidence suggests that CBT may have a positive impact on the effects of child sexual abuse, including depression, post-traumatic stress and anxiety, but the results were generally modest. Implications for practice and further research are noted.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-04-05 12:04:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite differences in how it is defined, there is a general consensus amongst clinicians and researchers that the sexual abuse of children and adolescents ('child sexual abuse') is a substantial social problem worldwide. The effects of sexual abuse manifest in a wide range of symptoms, including fear, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and various externalising and internalising behaviour problems, such as inappropriate sexual behaviours. Child sexual abuse is associated with increased risk of psychological problems in adulthood. Cognitive-behavioural approaches are used to help children and their non-offending or 'safe' parent to manage the sequelae of childhood sexual abuse. This review updates the first Cochrane review of cognitive-behavioural approaches interventions for children who have been sexually abused, which was first published in 2006.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-03-13 21:38:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural approaches (CBT) in addressing the immediate and longer-term sequelae of sexual abuse on children and young people up to 18 years of age.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-04-05 10:25:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011 Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to November Week 3 2011); EMBASE (1980 to Week 47 2011); CINAHL (1937 to 2 December 2011); PsycINFO (1887 to November Week 5 2011); LILACS (1982 to 2 December 2011) and OpenGrey, previously OpenSIGLE (1980 to 2 December 2011). For this update we also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-02-07 17:02:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of CBT used with children and adolescents up to age 18 years who had experienced being sexually abused, compared with treatment as usual, with or without placebo control.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-02-07 17:02:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of titles and abstracts identified in the search. Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies and entered these into Review Manager 5 software. We synthesised and presented data in both written and graphical form (forest plots).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-05 12:04:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 10 trials, involving 847 participants. All studies examined CBT programmes provided to children or children and a non-offending parent. Control groups included wait list controls (n = 1) or treatment as usual (n = 9). Treatment as usual was, for the most part, supportive, unstructured psychotherapy. Generally the reporting of studies was poor. Only four studies were judged 'low risk of bias' with regards to sequence generation and only one study was judged 'low risk of bias' in relation to allocation concealment. All studies were judged 'high risk of bias' in relation to the blinding of outcome assessors or personnel; most studies did not report on these, or other issues of bias. Most studies reported results for study completers rather than for those recruited.</P>
<P>Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and child behaviour problems were the primary outcomes. Data suggest that CBT may have a positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, but most results were not statistically significant. Strongest evidence for positive effects of CBT appears to be in reducing PTSD and anxiety symptoms, but even in these areas effects tend to be 'moderate' at best. Meta-analysis of data from five studies suggested an average decrease of 1.9 points on the Child Depression Inventory immediately after intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) decrease of 4.0 to increase of 0.4; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 53%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.08), representing a small to moderate effect size. Data from six studies yielded an average decrease of 0.44 standard deviations on a variety of child post-traumatic stress disorder scales (95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 46%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.10). Combined data from five studies yielded an average decrease of 0.23 standard deviations on various child anxiety scales (95% CI 0.3 to 0.4; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.84). No study reported adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-31 11:48:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this updated review remain the same as those when it was first published. The review confirms the potential of CBT to address the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse, but highlights the limitations of the evidence base and the need for more carefully conducted and better reported trials.</P>

<P>Perceptions of what constitutes sexual abuse differ, as do the definitions used by researchers and others. Despite these differences, there is a general consensus amongst clinicians and researchers that this is a substantial social problem that affects large numbers of children, of both sexes, of all ages, across culture and social class (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentky 1996</LINK>). Methodological problems, including those of definition, mean that estimates of the incidence and prevalence of child sexual abuse vary considerably. Girls are more likely to be victims than boys, with estimates of prevalence rates ranging between 20% and 32% for females and between 4% and 8% for males (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereda-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereda 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Child sexual abuse refers not to a disease or medical condition but to an event, or series of events, in a child's life. Some children are victimised on a single occasion, but more often sexual abuse occurs over a period of time, sometimes years (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2002</LINK>). The duration of exposure to sexual abuse depends on a range of factors, including the perpetrator's ease of access to the child or young person and the steps taken to secure his or her silence, such as threats and coercion (<LINK REF="REF-Eilliot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eilliot 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1998</LINK>). Except in communities ('sects' or 'cults') where social relationships may be formulated in ways that undermine or break down normal relationships within families, sexual abuse is usually hidden.</P>
<P>Child sexual abuse can be perpetrated within the family (by a parent, step-parent, sibling or other relative); by those known to the child outside of the home (for example, friends, neighbours, teacher), or by strangers. It is estimated that around one third of sexual offences against children are committed by adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Prentky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentky 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grubin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grubin 1998</LINK>). Other subgroups of sexual offenders include those with a learning disability and those with mental health problems (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Beech-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beech 2009</LINK>). The majority of sexual offences against children are committed by people known to them, although most are not members of their family. Around one third of perpetrators are family members, including fathers, brothers, cousins etc. Child sexual abuse perpetrated by natural parents appears relatively rare, with estimates ranging from between 1.5% to 16% of sexually abused children (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999</LINK>). Whilst the rate of sexual offences committed by step-fathers is comparable to that of natural parents, the fact that stepfathers are a much smaller group means that they are more likely to commit child sexual abuse. When children experience sexual abuse by one parent within the family, the research literature often refers to the other parent as the 'non-offending parent'.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sequelae of sexual abuse</HEADING>
<P>The consequences of sexual abuse on the social and emotional well being of children, and on their development, are well-documented. Many, but not all, children who have been sexually abused develop significant mental health difficulties related to this form of abuse. Cross-sectional studies have pointed to a number of factors that appear to influence the extent and severity of these effects, such as the age of the child, the frequency and duration of the abuse, the severity of the abuse and the relationship of the child to the perpetrator (see <LINK REF="REF-Friedrich-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedrich 1986</LINK>). A number of longitudinal studies shed some light on the likely developmental trajectory of problems over time and on those factors that limit adverse consequences and/or aid recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Oates-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oates 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tebutt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tebutt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puttnam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puttnam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swanston-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanston 2003</LINK>). Common symptoms include fear, anxiety and low mood, and these are often the focus of interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2009</LINK>). It is helpful to use a developmental perspective when considering the effects of sexual abuse as different problems manifest depending on the age of the affected child. For example, preschool children are likely to experience anxiety, nightmares, externalising behaviour and inappropriate sexual behaviours (see <LINK REF="REF-Kendall_x002d_Tackett-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall-Tackett 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trickett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trickett 1997</LINK>). In school-aged children, difficulties may manifest as school problems, hyperactivity and nightmares, whereas adolescents are more likely to suffer from depression, generalised anxiety, suicidal or self-injurious behaviour, or substance misuse.</P>
<P>A significant percentage of children appear not to demonstrate any of these psychological sequelae immediately following their abuse. Some of these children may develop problems in their psychological or social functioning later (so-called 'sleeper effects'). Some may never present any problems.</P>
<P>Prolonged stress, particularly at critical times (such as infancy and adolescence), can bring about changes in the brain and brain functioning that may explain a number of the difficulties experienced by maltreated children in later life (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Teicher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teicher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andeson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andeson 2008</LINK>). The body of research on the neurological impacts of abuse is relatively new, and whether different forms of abuse have differentiated consequences and how the long-term effects of maltreatment are influenced by the quality of subsequent caregiving or familial/genetic factors, amongst other questions, remain the subject of investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Jackowski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackowski 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shenk-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shenk 2010</LINK>). Although the majority of sexually abused children do not go on to offend, there is some support for the hypothesis that the experience of sexual abuse in childhood is associated with an increased risk for sexual offending in adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Jespersen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jespersen 2009</LINK>), and that child sexual abuse, like other forms of maltreatment, may increase the risk of delinquency and adult offending more generally (see <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Currie-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thornberry-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornberry 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact on adult functioning and use of services</HEADING>
<P>In adults, a history of childhood sexual abuse is strongly associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders. In an analysis of the UK Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007, <LINK REF="REF-Jonas-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 2011</LINK> examined the association between sexual abuse in childhood (defined as younger than 16 years) and adulthood (16 or over) and six types of common mental disorder (depression, mixed anxiety/depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic, phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder), dependence disorders (alcohol and drug misuse) and disorders established from screening tools (post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders). The authors report that "all were strongly and highly significantly associated with childhood sexual abuse (P = &lt; 0.0001), particularly if non-consensual sexual intercourse was involved, for which odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 3.7 to 12.1. For some disorders, the relative odds were higher for females than males, but formal tests for moderation by gender were significant only for common mental disorders and then only in relation to non-consensual sexual intercourse" (p 712). In a study of 2759 children in Australia with a substantiated case of sexual abuse (in the period 1965 and 1995), <LINK REF="REF-Cutajar-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutajar 2010</LINK> found a lifetime record of contact with public mental health services in 23.3% of cases of those who had been sexually abused in childhood, compared with just 7.7% of controls, with the rate of contact being 3.65 times higher (95% CI, 3.09 to 4.32, P &lt; 0.0001). Childhood sexual abuse increased the risk for most disorders, including psychosis, affective disorder, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders (see also <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Not all victims of sexual abuse have consequent psychological problems throughout their life; however, there is an association between having suffered such a trauma in childhood and experiencing higher rates of a wide range of problems in psychological and social functioning in adult life (see <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2008</LINK>). Many of these difficulties are similar to those reported by children who have been more recently abused, including: depression, anxiety, phobias (<LINK REF="REF-Molnar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molnar 2001</LINK>), low self-esteem, and relationship and parenting difficulties (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1993</LINK>). Young women who have been sexually abused have been reported to be at increased risk of engaging in high risk sexual behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Farmer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farmer 1998</LINK>) and experiencing higher rates of sexual re-victimisation (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2002</LINK>). These consequences are reported by both men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Banyard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banyard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dube-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dube 2005</LINK>). Finally, a small but important minority of abuse victims go on to abuse others sexually. It is not clear whether these outcomes are specific to the experience of being sexually abused, or related to the other difficulties that children in these situations often face. Some studies suggest that being brought up witnessing or experiencing intrafamilial violence may combine with the experience of sexual abuse to increase the risk of a young man subsequently abusing others (<LINK REF="REF-Skuse-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuse 1998</LINK>). Longer-term prospective studies testing and examining these consequences are awaited.</P>
<P>The rationale for interventions for children who have been sexually abused is that successful intervention may not only reduce the psychological and social impact of sexual abuse for a victim and their family, but also modify the impact on future generations, through improved functioning as a parent, and (if there is an association) by reducing the risk of future abuse by its victims.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive-behavioural approaches</HEADING>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural approaches derive philosophically, theoretically and empirically from four theories of learning: respondent conditioning (associative learning); operant conditioning (the effect of the environment on patterns of behaviour, particularly reinforcement and punishment); observational learning (learning by imitation), and cognitive learning (the impact of thought patterns on feelings and behaviour). They combine to provide an integrated approach to assessment and intervention that pays careful attention to the developmental and social contexts in which learning occurs. In the treatment of children who have been sexually abused, cognitive-behavioural approaches focus on the meaning of events for children and non-offending parents, endeavouring to identify and address maladaptive cognitions (for example, being permanently 'soiled'), misattributions (for example, feelings of blame and responsibility) and low self-esteem. In addition, interventions drawn from operant, respondent and observational learning paradigms are used to address more overtly behavioural problems such as externalising behaviours (aggression or 'acting out'), internalising behaviours (anxiety, self-blame or deprecation) or sexualised behaviour, usually mediated through the involvement of a parent not responsible for the abuse.</P>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions for children who have been sexually abused are typically short-term structured interventions of around 12 sessions, though they can extend upwards to 40 sessions depending on need and case complexity (<LINK REF="REF-Deblinger-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deblinger 1996a</LINK>). The intervention is tailored to the developmental age and symptomatology of individual children, so a fully prescribed programme does not exist.</P>
<P>In the 1990s, two research teams, Cohen and Mannarino (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>) and Deblinger and Heflin (<LINK REF="REF-Deblinger-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deblinger 1996a</LINK>), published manuals that described a cognitive-behavioural treatment model for children who had been sexually abused. Deblinger and Heflin's original model has three core components. The first is coping skills training, in which both children and parents learn skills for coping effectively with the emotional distress that often follows sexual abuse, for example cognitive coping, in which children and parents learn to identify and dispute dysfunctional thoughts and replace them with more accurate and effective coping responses. This helps to prepare children for the central component of the model, namely gradual exposure and cognitive and affective processing. Gradual exposure combines elements of systematic desensitisation and in vivo exposure to reminders of trauma. Children are gradually introduced to low-level anxiety-provoking stimuli, followed by increasingly anxiety-provoking ones. Gradual exposure "aims to disrupt the maladaptive associations between innocuous abuse-related cues and the more extreme negative emotions that develop as a result of respondent conditioning" (<LINK REF="REF-Deblinger-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deblinger 1996a</LINK>, p.18). Cognitive and affective processing aims to help children make sense of their experiences, without which they may be vulnerable to developing distorted and maladaptive cognitions and feelings about sex, relationships and the world more generally. The third component is behavioural skills management, directed at helping parents manage the behavioural problems that can sometimes result from sexual abuse, including sexualised behaviours. Parents learn to model and reinforce effective coping and effectively to manage these problem behaviours. These therapeutic elements are accompanied by education regarding child sexual abuse, healthy sexuality and personal safety skills. Deblinger and Heflin describe their cognitive-behavioural intervention as "most appropriate for use with children who exhibit symptoms of PTSD and/or confusion or misconceptions about their sexual abuse experiences" and describe the intervention as designed to alleviate PTSD symptoms. In their model, Cohen and Mannarino integrate aspects of other theoretical frameworks of relevance to child sexual abuse, namely an emphasis on the meaning of the abuse (in terms of their relationship to the perpetrator and the non-offending parent, i.e. attachment theory and family systems); the extent of a child's interpersonal trust and self-efficacy (empowerment) and how their abuse experiences, and in many cases that of their mothers, were reflected in relationships with others (see <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>These two teams later collaborated in developing a broad-based cognitive-behavioural model, designed to address the breadth of behavioural, physical and/or emotional difficulties that can be the direct result of traumatic experiences, including sexual abuse. They refer to this as trauma-focused CBT, which they define as "a components-based hybrid approach that integrates trauma-sensitive interventions, cognitive-behavioural principles, as well as aspects of attachment, developmental neurobiology, family, empowerment, and humanistic theoretical models in order to optimally address the needs of traumatised children and families" (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>, p.32). The approach to managing the symptomatology is fundamentally cognitive-behavioural and we use this term throughout the review.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-04-05 10:44:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Children who experience trauma, including child sexual abuse, may experience profound changes in how they see themselves, the world and others. Many of them may experience psychobiological changes that contribute to the development and maintenance of post-traumatic stress symptoms, which <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK> categorises as affective, behavioural, cognitive, complex PTSD and psychobiological trauma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2006</LINK>). To some extent these symptoms overlap and interact to reinforce one another. CBT is designed to address these symptoms using a range of specific techniques, examples of which are listed below.</P>
<P>
<I>Emotional distress: </I>children are helped to cope effectively with their emotional distress by learning relaxation and a range of skills such as emotional expression and cognitive coping skills. Children (and parents) learn how to label the feelings associated with the abuse and to communicate them to others; they also learn to identifying maladaptive beliefs and attributions and replacing them with those that are more accurate and effective (<LINK REF="REF-Deblinger-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deblinger 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flannery_x002d_Schreder-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flannery-Schreder 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Anxiety: </I>depending on age, children are taught to recognise the signs of anxiety, the triggers that precipitate it (both external and internal - maladaptive thoughts and cognitive errors) and gradually to replace their maladaptive responses with adaptive ones. Central to achieving this is helping the child to face (rather than avoid) the situations that promote anxiety, to experience and practice coping. Techniques might include relaxation, self-control, desensitisation and cognitive restructuring (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Muris-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muris 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Behaviour problems:</I> parents are taught how behaviour is triggered (antecedents) and shaped or maintained by consequences, and how to change these to improve behaviour. They are also taught about the effects of sexual abuse so as to better understand children's behaviour.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-04-05 10:48:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Generally speaking, cognitive-behavioural approaches have a record of experimental evidence of their effectiveness in dealing with a wide range of emotional and behavioural problems, many of which feature in the symptomatology of children who have been sexually abused, for example, anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1994</LINK>), internalising and externalising behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Harrington-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrington 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kazdin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kazdin 1989</LINK>) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>). Conceptually they provide a broad, evidence-based framework for assessing the effects of sexual abuse on personal, interpersonal and familial relations, and planning interventions tailored to individual circumstances. As a focused, time-limited form of intervention, it may also be a cost-effective way of helping a larger number of children than currently receive help.</P>
<P>Earlier reviews within the field (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelhor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelhor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 1999</LINK>) suggest that cognitive-behavioural interventions, as part of a broader psychosocial intervention, may be an effective form of treatment for sexually abused children. However, these reviews include studies of a wide range of methodological types, and did not select studies on the basis of methodological rigour. They also include a range of therapeutic interventions. Our review of CBT for sexually abused children was originally published in 2006. In keeping with good practice, this update was undertaken to ensure that the review continues to reflect current best evidence.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:03:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For binary outcomes, for example, 'attempted suicide' or 'not attempted suicide', we calculated a standard estimation of the odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Numbers needed to treat were not calculated due to the small number of studies.</P>
<P>We analysed continuous data where (i) means and standard deviations were available or calculable and (ii) there was no clear evidence of skew in the distribution (mean less than one standard deviation from an upper or lower bound) if the study was small (fewer than 20 participants per group). Where standard deviations were not given directly, we calculated these using test statistics wherever possible. Where scales were measuring the same clinical outcomes in different ways, we used standardised mean differences in order to combine results across scales.</P>
<P>Where an outcome was assessed using a measure with subscales, we used the total score, providing the full scale addressed the outcome of interest. Otherwise, we used the most relevant subscore. For example, when assessing the impact of CBT on anxiety, we used the total score for the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) rather than the scores for any of its subscales, which are designed to assess the impact of intervention on particular aspects such as physiological anxiety or concentration anxiety. When assessing the impact of CBT on children's behaviour, we used the 'externalising' subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL); when deciding between 'state anxiety' and 'trait anxiety', we used the former as this seemed best to capture the outcome of interest, i.e. present state anxiety; when selecting one of three data sets reported for K-SADS-E (with no total score), we selected 're-experiencing' rather than 'avoidance' or 'hypervigilance'.</P>
<P>When a choice needed to be made between two overlapping measures of the same outcome, we chose the measure that appeared most accurately to reflect the outcome of interest without reference to the results.</P>
<P>Some studies provided outcome assessments at multiple points in time. As per protocol, we grouped these into the categories of i) immediate, ii) up to six months ,and iii) at least one year. When a study collected outcomes at multiple time points within the three to six month category, we averaged these to arrive at a single composite estimate. For studies that measured outcomes at multiple time points at least one year after treatment (for example, 12 and 24 months), we used the most distal measure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Study authors typically reported data for study completers rather than for those recruited to the study (for example <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies focused solely on girls who had been sexually abused (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK>). The remaining studies included both boys and girls, with the percentage of boys ranging from 11% (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>) to 42% (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>) was concerned with preschoolers (boys and girls aged 3 to 6 years). Four studies set similar inclusion criteria for age: 7 to 13 years (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>), 8 to 13 years (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK>), 8 to 14 years (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>). Inclusion criteria for the other five studies ranged from children aged 2 to 8 years (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>) to children aged 4 to 13 years (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>), 5 to 17 years (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>), 6 to 17 years (<LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2001</LINK>) and 7 to 15 years (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials made the independent substantiation of sexual abuse an inclusion criterion. Most set cut-off points on the time of last episode of abuse as an inclusion criteria, ranging from six months (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>) to two or three years (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>). Whilst <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK> did not set a time limit, the authors report that the mean age of the children was 5.45 years (SD = 1.47) and the mean age of first experience of sexual abuse was 4.5 years (SD = 1.47), based on mothers' estimates. The report by <LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK> did not specify inclusion or exclusion criteria, but all participants were said to have provided statements, substantiated by independent assessment, that they had been sexually abused.</P>
<P>All studies had inclusion criteria that specified contact sexual abuse. The range of abuse experienced by participants was broad, and differently reported, but the following picture of participants emerged. Most were abused by men known to them. The majority were family members. In four studies, approximately half the children and young people had experienced oral, vaginal or anal penetration (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2001</LINK>). In the study dealing with the youngest participants, the percentage that had experienced vaginal or anal intercourse was 26% (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>). In the study of children aged 2 to 8 years, the number reported to have experienced penile penetration was 16% (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>). Participants in all studies ranged from those who had experienced one incident of abuse to those who had experienced multiple incidents, sometimes over many years. Many participants also reported the use of force, or threat of force. Not all studies reported detailed abuse data (for example, <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>). See <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> for a profile of participants in each study.</P>
<P>Five studies reported the presence of particular symptomatology thresholds as an inclusion criterion. <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK> required reports of behavioural difficulties in participants, as indicated in the records of the child's assigned caseworker, together with a pre-treatment score on the Child Depression Inventory of at least one standard deviation above the mean score obtained from a normative sample of girls aged 8 to 13 years. <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK> required a minimal level of symptomatology defined as a Weekly Behavior Report Total Behavior score of more than seven or any sexually inappropriate behaviour reported on the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory. <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK> stipulated that participants had to meet five criteria for sexual abuse-related DSM-IV-defined PTSD, including at least one in each of the three clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance or numbing, and hyperarousal). <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK> required the presence of three post-traumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms, including at least one symptom of avoidance or re-experiencing the phenomenon. Investigators decided to take both children who met full DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD and those with partial PTSD symptoms because of the possibility of delayed onset of episodic course. <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK> required that the children met diagnostic criteria for PTSD or provided evidence of high risk of developing the disorder.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Group treatments</HEADING>
<P>In two studies, therapy was provided only to children and on a group basis (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>). These studies compared the efficacy of CBT to a wait list control (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>) and 'conventional sexual abuse specific group therapy' (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>) respectively.</P>
<P>One study provided group therapy to children and their mothers in separate groups (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>). This study compared CBT with supportive group therapy (parents) and an interactive CBT approach with a didactic, information-based approach for children. In addition, members of the CBT group met for an additional 15 minutes each week for a joint parent and child activity session.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Individual treatments</HEADING>
<P>The remainder provided individual therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK> compared the efficacy of CBT applied to children and their mothers with supportive, unstructured psychotherapy, also to children and their mothers. Three other studies compared CBT with nondirective supportive therapies (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies compared the efficacy of CBT provided for the child with CBT provided to the child and parent/family (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>). Both studies also used a control group (community control and wait list respectively) and <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK> had a fourth arm which examined the efficacy of teaching parents CBT strategies for helping their child.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Number and content of sessions</HEADING>
<P>The group-based therapies were provided over six and 10 sessions respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>). For the experimental group, Berliner augmented the conventional sexual abuse specific group therapy provided to the control group with sessions specifically explaining the nature of fear, the principles of Stress Inoculation Therapy and their application to disclosure impact and self-esteem. Burke's therapy was based primarily on classical conditioning (relaxation, imaginal exposure and behaviour rehearsal) and education, aimed at providing participants with strategies for managing negative affect.</P>
<P>The individual therapies were provided for between eight to 20 sessions (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Participants in Celano's study (<LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK>) had eight sessions of one hour each, in which therapists deployed developmentally appropriate cognitive-behavioural and metaphoric techniques to address children's maladaptive beliefs, affect and behaviour. In all but two or three sessions, the therapist spent half the time with the mother and half with the child. The remaining sessions were conducted conjointly. Three studies provided around one and a half hours per week, divided between parents and child over eight and 12 weeks respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>). CBT programmes in these studies included the use of cognitive reframing, thought stopping, positive imagery, contingency reinforcement programmes, parent management training and problem solving, together with psychoeducational and supportive interventions. These interventions were also central to the studies by Deblinger and King, which had three arms: child, parent and child + parent. <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK> provided therapy in 12 x 45 minute sessions to participants in the parent-only and child-only arms. In the parent and child arm, therapy also entailed 12 sessions, but this time of up to 90 minutes. In <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>, all participants each received 20 x 50 minute sessions. This means that in the parent + child arm, 40 x 50 minute sessions were provided.

<P>In each study that examined child depression, child sexual behaviour and child behaviour, the same measures were used, namely the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacs-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacs 1981</LINK>), the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory (CSBI) (<LINK REF="REF-Friedrich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedrich 1992</LINK>) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991</LINK>), respectively (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>) used the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children - Epidemiologic Version administered to parents (K-SADS-E) (<LINK REF="REF-Orvaschel-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orvaschel 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orvaschel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orvaschel 1994</LINK>); one study (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) used the K-SADS-PL (Parent and Lifetime Version) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1997</LINK>), and another (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>) used the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) (<LINK REF="REF-Briere-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briere 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Some studies examined outcomes not included in the protocol for this review. Some investigators also looked at children's coping ability. <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK> used the Global Assessment Functioning scale (GAF) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>) and an instrument developed by the investigators themselves, the Coping Questionnaire for Sexually Abused Children (CQ-SAC) and <LINK REF="STD-Celano-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Celano 1996</LINK> used the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1983</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dominguez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dominguez 2001</LINK> measured children's subjective distress using the Impact of Events Rating (IES-R) (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1979</LINK>), whilst <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK> assessed children's attributions using the Children's Attribution and Perception Scale (CAPS) (<LINK REF="REF-Mannarino-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannarino 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Parents' Emotional Reaction Questionnaire (PERQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>) was used in two studies to determine the impact of intervention on parental distress (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>).

The other five studies, using two scales (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1978</LINK>), yielded an average decrease of 0.23 standard deviations on various child anxiety scales (95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%;<B> </B>P value for heterogeneity 0.84; &#964;<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.0) immediately after treatment, and four of these (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) reported a sustained decrease of 0.28 standard deviations (95% CI decrease of 0.52 to decrease of 0.04; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.62; &#964;<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.0) after at least one year (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>Five studies provided conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of CBT in the domain of child behaviour problems assessed using the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 67%, P value for heterogeneity 0.02; &#964;<SUP>2</SUP> = 6.81) (<LINK REF="REF-Friedrich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedrich 1992</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>) observed increases of 4.7 and 1.7 points and three (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) observed decreases, one of which was statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>). In a meta-analysis, there was no evidence of an effect on average (mean decrease of -0.65 points, 95% CI -3.53 to +2.24 points). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) provided longer-term data. The first of these observed a much smaller increase than the same study in the short term. Overall, the average effect found at the three- to six-month assessment point was similar to that immediately after treatment, but was not statistically significant (-0.46 points, 95% CI -5.68 to +4.76 points; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Note that <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK> did not report data for this outcome because it was not statistically significant. We have not successfully retrieved these data, but their inclusion is highly unlikely to change the overall conclusion for this outcome.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ii) Externalising behaviour (for example, aggression, 'acting out')</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies provided data on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) externalising behaviour scale (<LINK REF="REF-Achenbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achenbach 1991</LINK>). A meta-analysis of standardised differences in means (due to different scoring systems being used for the scale) did not provide evidence of a beneficial effect on average (decrease of 0.12 standard deviations, 95% CI decrease of 0.40 to increase of 0.17). However, the results were inconsistent (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 58%; P value for heterogeneity 0.03; &#964;<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.08), with one study observing a statistically significant increase (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>) and one a statistically significant decrease (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>).</P>

A statistically significant increase of 4.4 across the two studies was observed immediately after treatment (95% CI 1.0 to 7.7).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">v) Parents' emotional reactions</HEADING>
<P>We added this outcome as it is closely related to 'belief in their child's story' and 'accurate attributions'. The Parent Emotional Reaction Questionnaire (PERQ) is designed to assess stressful parental emotional reactions to the sexual abuse of their children. Parents are asked to endorse the frequency of specific reactions including fear, sadness, guilt, anger, embarrassment, shame and emotional preoccupation. No psychometric data are currently available. Two studies used the PERQ (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) and across these a decrease of seven points (95% CI 3.8 to 10.1) was observed (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK> measured outcomes longer term, and observed a smaller but still statistically significant decrease of 4.6 points.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-04-05 12:05:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten randomised trials, involving 847 participants, were included in this review. All studies examined CBT programmes provided to children or children together with a 'non-offending' or 'safe' parent i.e. a parent not implicated in the abuse. One study compared CBT with a wait list control (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>); the remainder compared CBT with treatment as usual, which was typically supportive, unstructured psychotherapy. Only four studies were judged 'low risk of bias' with regards to sequence generation and only one study was judged 'low risk of bias' in relation to allocation concealment. All studies were judged 'high risk of bias' in relation to the blinding of outcome assessors or personnel. Most of the reports provided no information on these, or other domains of bias, and most reported results for study completers rather than those recruited.</P>
<P>Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and child behaviour problems (sexualised behaviour and externalising behaviour) were the primary outcomes in this review. The evidence from the trials suggest that CBT may have a positive impact on the sequelae of child sexual abuse, although most results were not statistically significant. Strongest evidence for positive effects of CBT appear to be a modest reduction in depression, PTSD and anxiety symptoms.</P>
<P>
<B>Depression: </B>meta-analysis of data from five studies suggested an average decrease of 1.9 points on the Child Depression Inventory immediately after intervention (95% CI decrease of 4.0 to increase of 0.4; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 53%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.08). A decrease of 1.9 on the CDI represents a modest change on a scale that previous studies indicate has a standard deviation of approximately 7 (<LINK REF="REF-Smucker-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smucker 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twenge-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twenge 2002</LINK>) and represents a small to moderate effect size, broadly equivalent to that seen on the anxiety scales in meta-analyses in this review.</P>
<P>
<B>Post-traumatic stress: </B>immediately post intervention, data from six studies yielded an average decrease of 0.44 standard deviations on a variety of child post-traumatic stress disorder scales (95% CI 0.16 to 0.73; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 46%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.10).</P>
<P>
<B>Anxiety: </B>combined data from five studies yielded an average decrease of 0.23 standard deviations on various child anxiety scales (95% CI 0.3 to 0.4; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; P value for heterogeneity = 0.84). No study reported adverse effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Child behaviour problems: </B>a<B> </B>meta-analysis of data from five studies found no evidence of an effect on child behaviour problems (mean decrease of -0.65 points, 95% CI -3.53 to +2.24 points). Combined data from five studies provided conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of CBT for sexualised behaviour, as measured by the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 67%, P value for heterogeneity 0.02) (<LINK REF="REF-Friedrich-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedrich 1992</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 2001</LINK>) observed increases of 4.7 and 1.7 points and three (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) observed decreases, one of which was statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berliner-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berliner 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) provided longer-term data.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:53:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few studies included in this review and they originate, with one exception, from the United States of America. Whilst this may limit the applicability of the evidence to some health and social care settings, the evidence itself has considerable cross-cultural applicability, anchored as CBT is on an understanding of child sexual abuse and its consequences based on learning theory. Generally, the studies appear to be representative of the range of abuse experienced by children between the ages of three and 17 years.</P>
<P>One of the debates in the field is whether or not 'asymptomatic' children should be included in therapy. Five of the 10 studies included in this review appear to have included asymptomatic children. This may have limited the ability of these studies to reveal any effects of the intervention, as it is more difficult to demonstrate improvement in individuals who are functioning relatively well. The three studies that required evidence of post-traumatic stress symptoms as an inclusion criterion demonstrated a positive impact on this aspect of child health (<LINK REF="STD-Deblinger-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Deblinger 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>). Two of the studies that stipulated a minimal level of behavioural symptomatology as an inclusion criteria, including evidence of any sexually inappropriate behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>), appeared to have some impact on externalising behaviour or sexualised behaviour, or both, but the evidence is only suggestive. The other study (<LINK REF="STD-Burke-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1988</LINK>) reported improvements, but did not provide data in a form that could be incorporated in the meta-analyses. Other studies that did not specifically target children with such behaviour, or with PTSD, had similar results. This may reflect similarities across study samples in symptomatology, irrespective of inclusion criteria, and the profile of abuse experienced by study participants supports this suggestion (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:55:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of current evidence about the efficacy of CBT in treating the emotional, psychological and behavioural consequences of children who have been sexually abused could be improved. Studies appear to have a range of methodological weaknesses which, exacerbated by poor reporting, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. In line with other reviews, there is a suggestion that these approaches may be beneficial, compared to treatment as usual, but the strength of evidence contained within these randomised and quasi-randomised trials is considerably more muted than other reviews suggest (see below).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-03-25 13:41:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We endeavoured to extract prespecified outcomes, but due to the absence of strong reporting norms there remains a risk that the scales reported are a biased representation of those collected by the study authors (selective reporting). It is also possible that the practice in some studies of reporting the results for only those children who completed all post-treatment assessments represents a further source of bias, though in what direction it is not possible to say. Only three studies stated that they undertook intention-to-treat analyses.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-03-13 23:20:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this updated review do not differ from those of the original review, published first in 2006 and republished in a new format in 2009. The general direction of findings presented is in keeping with those of other reviews (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Corcoran-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corcoran 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Medeiros-Passarela-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Medeiros Passarela 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trask-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trask 2011</LINK>). However, this review emphasises the inherent methodological weaknesses of the available studies. This should augur more caution in the interpretation of results than is espoused by other reviewers (for example, <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2000</LINK>). Studies may have been well designed (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2004</LINK>) but there are potentially serious weaknesses in their implementation, analyses and reporting.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:59:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:57:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is nothing in this review to detract from the general consensus that cognitive-behavioural approaches merit consideration as a treatment of choice for sexually abused children who are experiencing adverse consequences of that abuse (see <LINK REF="REF-Trask-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trask 2011</LINK>). There is relatively consistent evidence that cognitive-behavioural approaches may lead to reductions in depressive, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms in children. The results of this review do, however, suggest that the evidence is weaker than other reviews would suggest. Most of the studies in this review describe the CBT intervention used as 'trauma-focused', meaning simply that the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse are conceptualised as the consequences of trauma, which is reflected in the structure and the content of treatment.</P>
<P>Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural approaches are already recommended by some as part of a flexible, staged response to this problem in a number of jurisdictions (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puttnam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puttnam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2008</LINK>). In practice, however, they are not often widely available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-05 11:59:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single most important implication for research in this area is for researchers to better document and report study design and execution. Researchers should pay particular attention to reporting the history and reasons for dropouts and exclusions throughout the course of the study and the methods of randomisation. Further studies should consider focusing solely on sexually abused children who are experiencing identifiable symptoms of post-traumatic stress or other adverse consequences of sexual abuse. Studies should endeavour, wherever possible, to follow up participants for at least one year, and preferably two, rather than the very short term (or no) follow-up periods that characterise some current studies.</P>
<P>More, carefully conducted trials that consider which subgroups benefit (or not) from particular styles of treatment delivery would be helpful to clinicians (for example, group versus individual and parent-child versus child only), as would studies that considered treatment harms more carefully. Five of the 10 studies in this review come from essentially a single team of researchers (Cohen and colleagues) and it would be helpful to engage more teams of researchers to study what is a promising intervention for an important problem.</P>
<P>Finally, this is an area where observational studies of follow-up in real world settings would provide important information about how symptoms develop and/or attenuate, and critically, on the mechanisms leading to participant attrition.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Data are reported only on 80 (of 154 total) children who completed at least eight sessions and also completed at least one outcome measure at both of the follow-up assessment points. The authors conducted statistical tests comparing baseline characteristics of treatment completers and non-completers, and did not find statistically significant differences. However, these analyses were likely not conducted with high statistical power to detect meaningful differences, and the authors did not report data that would allow for computation of effect sizes comparing participants who had dropped out and those who did not. The authors also conducted statistical tests examining the baseline characteristics of completers lost to follow-up and those contributing data to the study. In these analyses, completers contributing data to the study had statistically significantly higher scores on the CBCL (total score), but no other statistically significant differences emerged. Again however these analyses were likely not conducted with high statistical power to detect meaningful differences, and the authors did not report data that would allow for computation of effect sizes comparing participants who had dropped out and those who did not. Finally, the authors compared baseline characteristics of the 80 treatment and control participants contributing data to the study, and found no statistically significant differences. Here, the authors did provide data that would allow for the computation of effect sizes illustrating the magnitude of differences between the two groups. In general, differences are small and favour the comparison group (i.e., the completers in the comparison group were slightly better off at baseline), with SMDs ranging from -.42 to +.39 (mean = +.03). This suggests that, on balance, the treatment and comparison groups were comparable on measured baseline characteristics, although their comparability on unmeasured characteristics is unclear (this is especially worrisome given the magnitude of attrition).</P>

<P>Seven of 32 participants dropped out of the study. African-American children were over-represented in the drop-out sample, while Hispanic children were over-represented in the sample of children who remained in the study. In addition, youth who dropped out had marginally lower higher scores on the CDI (SMD = .62, p = .09) and on the intrusive thoughts subscale of the Impact of Events Scale - Revised (SMD = .54, p = .15), as well as statistically significantly higher self-esteem (SMD = 1.00, P = .008). SMDs for the other measures ranged from -.29 to +.20, and seem to be relatively balanced between illustrating better functioning for the dropouts and the participants who remained in the study.</P>
<P>Dominguez also examined differences between completers in the treatment sample and completers in the comparison sample at baseline. In this case no differences were statistically significant, but statistical power for these tests was quite low. Generally speaking, participants in the CBT group had fewer problems at baseline than their comparison group counterparts. Treatment youth reported better baseline functioning on eight of ten reported outcomes (SMDs ranged from -.42 to +.91), with a mean effect size of +.29.</P>

<P>Data for three outcomes measured at 6 and 12 months were censored because their results were not statistically significant. One of these (the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory) was an outcome included in this review. Data for this outcome have been requested from the study authors. However, it is highly unlikely that inclusion of data from this study would change the overall conclusion reached in this review regarding the effects of CBT interventions on child sexual behaviour.</P>

<P>Dealing with missing data</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>In the original protocol for this review, the following sensitivity analyses were planned to deal with the problem of missing data.</P>
<P>a) For dichotomous outcomes, such as 'offended' or 'attempted suicide', the authors will assume that those who were lost to follow up (i) had proportionately the same outcomes as those who completed in the control group; (ii) experienced the successful outcome; (iii) all experienced the unsuccessful outcome.</P>
<P>b) Where there is evidence of a significant differential drop-out rate between the experimental and control groups, data will be excluded from the analyses to assess their influence on the overall result.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Assessment of reporting bias</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Any disagreements about eligibility will be resolved through discussion and, if necessary, with the involvement of the third author. Where appropriate, further information will be sought from the study authors.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Subgroup analyses and investigation of heterogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If substantial heterogeneity is identified within a meta-analysis, two possible sources will be investigated separately: i) studies that include non-offending parents in the treatment programme and those that do not, and (ii) studies that focus on abuse-specific behaviour and those that do not.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analyses</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Primary analyses will be based on available data from all included studies relevant to the comparison and outcome of interest. In order to assess the robustness of conclusions to quality of data and approaches to analysis, sensitivity analyses will be performed, as follows:<BR/>(a) Intention-to-treat.<BR/>For dichotomous outcomes, such as 'offended' or 'attempted suicide', we will assume that those who were lost to follow up (i) had proportionately the same outcomes as those who completed in the control group; (ii) experienced the successful outcome; (iii) all experienced the unsuccessful outcome<BR/>(b) Differential dropout.<BR/>Studies with severe imbalance in terms of numbers of attrition will be excluded from the analyses to assess their influence on overall results.</P>
