<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:03:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute asthma is a common cause of visits to emergency departments (ED) and the majority of patients are treated and discharged home. Some people will have a relapse of acute asthma within two weeks of being discharged after apparently successful treatment. Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist drugs are used to open the muscles in the airways and corticosteroids drugs are used to reduce inflammation of the swollen airways. Corticosteroids can be inhaled (ICS) or swallowed as a tablet (so-called oral corticosteroids). ICS may reduce adverse effects and get to the airways more directly than oral corticosteroids. This review of trials found that there was insufficient evidence that inhaling corticosteroids as well as taking the drugs orally is better than oral use alone, after emergency department treatment for an asthma attack. There is also insufficient evidence that taking ICS alone is as good as taking them orally, although there is some evidence to support using ICS alone for mild asthma attacks after emergency department discharge. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Patients with acute asthma treated in the emergency department (ED) are frequently treated with inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and systemic corticosteroids after discharge.

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-11-12 13:58:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of ICS on outcomes in the treatment of acute asthma following discharge from the ED. To quantify the effectiveness of ICS therapy on acute asthma following ED discharge, when used in addition to, or as a substitute for, systemic corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-11-12 13:58:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register, which consists of systematic searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases supplemented by handsearching of respiratory journals and conference proceedings. In addition, primary authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts also were searched. The searches have been conducted up to September 2012</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-11-12 13:59:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We included both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients were treated for acute asthma in the ED or its equivalent, and following ED discharge were treated with ICS therapy either in addition to, or as a substitute for, oral corticosteroids. Two review authors independently assessed articles for potential relevance, final inclusion and methodological quality.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:09:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data were extracted independently by two review authors, or confirmed by the study authors. Several authors and pharmaceutical companies provided unpublished data. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed effect model and heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) statistics.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:00:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion. Three of these trials, involving a total of 909 patients, compared ICS plus systemic corticosteroids versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone. There was no demonstrated benefit of ICS therapy when used in addition to oral corticosteroid therapy in the trials. Relapses were reduced; however, this was not statistically significant with the addition of ICS therapy (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; 3 studies; N = 909). In addition, no statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the two groups for relapses requiring admission, quality of life, symptom scores or adverse effects.</P>
<P>Nine trials, involving a total of 1296 patients compared high-dose ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone after ED discharge. There were no significant differences demonstrated between ICS therapy alone versus oral corticosteroid therapy alone for relapse rates (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; 4 studies; N = 684), admissions to hospital, or in the secondary outcomes of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use, symptoms or adverse events. However, the sample size was not adequate to exclude the possibility of either treatment being significantly inferior and people with severe asthma were excluded from these trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:39:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy provides additional benefit when used in combination with standard systemic corticosteroid therapy upon ED discharge for acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS therapy alone may be as effective as oral corticosteroid therapy when used in mild asthmatics upon ED discharge; however, the confidence intervals were too wide to be confident of equal effectiveness. Further research is needed to clarify whether ICS therapy should be employed in acute asthma treatment following ED discharge. The review does not suggest any reason to stop usual treatment with ICS following ED discharge, even if a course of oral corticosteroids are prescribed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-25 09:48:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute asthma is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department (ED). In the US, acute asthma accounts for nearly two million ED visits per year (<LINK REF="REF-Mannino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mannino 1998</LINK>). Approximately 10% to 20% of these patients will require admission to the hospital, and for those discharged from the ED after apparently successful treatment, approximately 10% to 20% will relapse within the subsequent two weeks ( <LINK REF="REF-Griswold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griswold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2010</LINK>;). The enormity of the asthma problem overall has led to the creation of several national (<LINK REF="REF-NAEPP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAEPP 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boulet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS_x002f_SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS/SIGN 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EPR3-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPR3 2007</LINK>) and international (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2011</LINK>) asthma guidelines.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:32:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is general agreement that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (e.g. salbutamol, albuterol) and systemic corticosteroids (e.g. delivered by oral or intramuscular (IM) routes) are first-line agents for acute asthma. Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are bronchodilators and are used to provide rapid symptom relief, whereas corticosteroids are used to counter airway inflammation and hasten resolution of the asthma exacerbation. However, there remain numerous controversies regarding the optimal dose, frequency and route of delivery of these medications.</P>
<P>Current practice for patients discharged after assessment and treatment in the ED usually involves the use of short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and oral corticosteroids prescribed for five to 10 days after discharge in a majority of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2003</LINK>). Oral corticosteroids may be prescribed as fixed-dose treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Verbeek-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verbeek 1995</LINK>); however, complicated tapering regimens have also been described. While the evidence for oral corticosteroids is strong, the evidence and recommendations for the role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the management of acute asthma after discharge are inconsistent. This is also reflected in practice. For example, in Canadian EDs, use is as high as 69% at discharge, whereas in US centres use is lower (&lt; 15%) (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>). When ICS agents are prescribed, they may either be used with (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>) or as a replacement for (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>) oral corticosteroids. Given the practice variation with respect to ICS treatment in acute asthma care (<LINK REF="REF-Griswold-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griswold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1998</LINK>), the update for this systematic review in this area has been carried out to provide direction for treatment and further research.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-25 09:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>ICS have the potential to be of benefit in the acute setting. Potential advantages of ICS in acute asthma therapy might include their reduced systemic side effects, direct delivery to the airways and a greater efficacy in reducing airway reactivity and oedema either alone or in addition to systemic corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, ancillary evidence from studies of other airway diseases suggests that ICS agents may act over the short term to improve outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ausejo-Segura-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ausejo Segura 1999</LINK>). They have been shown to be effective alternatives to oral corticosteroids in long-term asthma therapy, where they can reduce or even eliminate oral corticosteroid requirements (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>)</P>

<P>Several trials have examined the use of ICS in acute asthma upon ED discharge and they have yielded conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>); however, systematic literature searching and meta-analytic techniques should generate stronger conclusions and recommendations. One cost effectiveness analysis <LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2012</LINK> suggested that ICS may lead to a decreased number of admissions and ED visits as well as providing substantial cost savings. The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000</LINK>) concluded "there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy provides additional benefit when used in combination with standard oral corticosteroid therapy upon ED discharge for acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose ICS therapy alone may be as effective as oral corticosteroid therapy when used in mild asthmatics upon ED discharge; however, there is a significant possibility of a type II error in drawing this conclusion. Further research is needed to clarify whether ICS therapy should be employed in acute asthma treatment in the ED or following ED discharge." The 2012 update of this review will examine these conclusions in relation to evidence from relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published since 2000.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:06:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Patients must have been randomised to receive ICS treatment following discharge from the ED, either in addition to, or as a substitute for, standard oral corticosteroid therapy. ICS administration was defined as any corticosteroid agent administered by metered-dose inhaler (MDI), other inhaler, or nebuliser after ED discharge. Asthmatic patients also may have received additional asthma medications (such as IM corticosteroids, beta<SUB>2</SUB>agonists, ipratropium bromide, theophylline compounds, antibiotics, and/or anti-histamines). Data for these co-interventions were recorded or requested from the authors directly when this information was incompletely reported.</P>
<P>There were two distinct types of studies in this systematic review, which form two separate parts of the review. In the first type of study, the treatment groups compared ICS combined with oral corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid alone. In the second type of study, the treatment groups compared ICS alone versus oral corticosteroid alone. It is anticipated that this review may be divided into two separate systematic reviews in the future, when more studies in each topic area are completed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">ICS plus oral corticosteroid to oral corticosteroid alone</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared ICS plus oral corticosteroids to oral corticosteroids alone (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>). All three studies were from North America, and all three involved adolescents or adults (aged 12 to 60 years overall). Earliest mean PEFs in the ED were 40% to 55% predicted in all of these trials, suggesting moderate to severe disease at presentation.</P>
<P>ICS were administered in the intervention group for 20 to 24 days. Different drugs were administered, in doses ranging from moderate to high. ICS were administered by MDI with spacer (<LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>), Diskhaler (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>) or Turbuhaler (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>). Both groups received a fixed-dose five- to seven-day course of oral prednisone.</P>
<P>Co-interventions included various inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in all studies. The studies permitted concurrent medications to be continued, including theophylline, ipratropium bromide and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, although they did not permit them to be started during the study, and overall these agents were infrequently used. All three studies excluded patients who were currently using ICS or who had recently used oral corticosteroid.</P>
<P>Two of the three studies reported asthma relapse rates as their primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>), and was reported in the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>). Asthma relapse was defined similarly in all three studies (an unscheduled visit for worsening asthma symptoms). Secondary outcomes in two of these studies included the Asthma-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and seven-point Likert scales for asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>). However, the AQLQs used in each study were different; one used the original, full-length, previously validated AQLQ (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>), the other study employed the "mini-AQLQ" (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>). The third study recorded incidence of a variety of symptoms on a categorical scale (<LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>). PEF (absolute and % predicted) were also reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>). All three studies recorded incidence of adverse effects, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and relapse to hospital admission. Length of follow-up in the three studies was from 20 to 24 days.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">ICS versus oral corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies compared ICS alone to oral corticosteroid alone (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Francis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nana-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nana 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verona 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manjra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manjra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Franco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Di Franco 2006</LINK>). Five involved only children and four involved only adults. In the adult studies, severity was assessed as mild to moderate (mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) 60% to 75% predicted on discharge in two of the studies, and PEF 60% to 90% predicted on presentation in the third study, involving people with less severe asthma exacerbations). In the four paediatric studies where the information was available, PEF were generally 70% to 80% predicted on discharge. In all the studies, patients presenting with severe acute asthma were excluded. In seven of the nine studies, high-dose ICS was compared to tapering doses of oral corticosteroid, while two studies compared high-dose ICS to fixed-dose oral corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>). In six studies, a seven-day course of both treatments was administered. In one study, treatment with ICS for 16 days was compared with 16 days of treatment with a tapering dose of oral corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>), and in another study similar treatment regimens were given for 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Franco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Di Franco 2006</LINK>). In the final study, 24 days of ICS was compared to eight days of oral corticosteroid treatment (tapered) (<LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>). The route of administration was by Turbuhaler, Diskhaler or MDI with spacer in all but two of the studies (both in children), where a nebuliser was used. Co-interventions included various inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in all studies. The studies allowed concurrent medications, including theophylline, ipratropium bromide and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists to be continued, although they were infrequently used in all but one study where approximately 57% of the patients were on oral beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and 55% were on xanthines (<LINK REF="STD-Nana-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nana 1998</LINK>). Four of the five paediatric studies comparing ICS to oral corticosteroid either excluded patients on ICS at presentation, or had a very low (&lt; 2%) enrolment of these patients, while about 25% were on ICS at baseline in the fifth study (<LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>). All four adult studies comparing ICS versus oral corticosteroid included patients who had previously been on ICS. In two studies, approximately 35% of the patients were taking ICS at presentation, while about 80% of patients in the other two studies were already on ICS. Patients on oral corticosteroid at presentation were excluded from all of the studies. Two of the five paediatric studies used absolute PEF as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Verona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verona 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manjra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manjra 2000</LINK>), and it was also reported in a third study (<LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>), while one used % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>). Four of these studies did not report relapse rates (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verona 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manjra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manjra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>), and no patients in the fifth study relapsed (<LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>). Secondary outcomes in these studies included asthma symptoms, incidence of adverse events and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use. One of the three adult studies used change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Nana-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nana 1998</LINK>), and one of the adult studies used asthma relapse rates as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2000</LINK>). The third adult study used "treatment failure" as the primary outcome. Patients were categorised as a treatment failure if (a) PEF fell below 60% of the best/predicted value on two consecutive occasions, or (b) a symptom score of 3 (indicating the symptoms were the same or worse than on entry to the study) was recorded on three or more consecutive days, or (c) the patient withdrew because of uncontrolled symptoms or an adverse event related to asthma (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>). This outcome was pooled with the data for asthma relapse from other studies in the analyses. The fourth study used change in sputum eosinophil percentage as the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Franco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Di Franco 2006</LINK>). Other outcomes in the adult studies included the AQLQ in one study, symptom scores (on a variety of scales) in all studies, PEF and incidence of adverse events. Length of treatment and follow-up in the studies of ICS versus oral corticosteroid was seven days in six of the studies, although two of these studies also recorded absolute PEF at 21 days (but no other outcomes at these times) (<LINK REF="STD-Manjra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manjra 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verona 1998</LINK>).

<P>There were no statistically significant differences in the number of people experiencing an asthma relapse between patients treated with ICS and those on placebo.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:39:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review examined the best available evidence for the use of ICS in the management of patients with asthma exacerbations after discharge from the ED or other acute care settings. There are several important findings that arise from this meta-analysis. First, despite an exhaustive search and the existence of recommendations supporting the use of ICS in outpatient treatment of acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Boulet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Emond-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emond 1997</LINK>) only 12 trials were identified, many of which were small, and there were marked variations in the study designs. Clearly this is an area where further research is needed.</P>
<P>Second, there were two distinct potential roles for ICS therapy in this setting: either in addition to standard therapy with systemic corticosteroids, or as a substitute for systemic corticosteroids. For both types of studies in this review (ICS plus oral corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid alone; ICS versus oral corticosteroid), most pooled results did not demonstrate significant differences between the treatment approaches. This lack of statistical significance has very different implications for the two comparisons, and the two approaches will therefore be discussed separately.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">ICS plus oral corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid</HEADING>
<P>There was a total of 909 patients included in the studies: 455 treated with ICS plus oral corticosteroid, and 454 treated with oral corticosteroid alone. The pooled results of studies on the effect of the addition of ICS to standard oral corticosteroid therapy failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit on the primary outcome, asthma relapse, despite a trend in favour of ICS at both seven to 10 and 20 to 24 days. In addition, there appeared to be no benefit on the secondary outcomes of hospital admission or pulmonary function tests. Interpretations of the other pooled outcomes (e.g. quality of life, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and asthma symptoms) was limited by statistically significant heterogeneity and variable reporting.</P>
<P>Despite the presence of a statistically and clinically important sex difference in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>), the sex-treatment interaction did not reach statistical significance in this meta-analysis and heterogeneity was demonstrated. While it is unclear at this time if this subgroup finding is valid, the hypothesis warrants detailed exploration in future research. In addition, none of these studies included children under the age of 12 years, so further study in younger children may be indicated.</P>
<P>The primary role of ICS in chronic stable asthma is clear; however, the role of adding ICS for emergency physicians and other healthcare providers treating acute asthma remains unclear. Since many patients with severe acute asthma already meet criteria for ongoing treatment with ICS by current guidelines, adding the agent may be a wise 'preventive' measure upon ED discharge. In mild or moderate acute asthma where there is a low risk of relapse, treatment may not be immediately beneficial. Since the treatment appears safe and side effects are uncommon, the main issue in these cases may be the cost of the drug. Moreover, the interpretation of the pooled results for the primary outcome suggests the potential benefit may be large (OR = 0.46) and the risk of a detrimental effect is small (OR = 1.02)</P>
<P>Of note, there was no significant effect of ICS therapy demonstrated on pulmonary function tests. The point estimates for the differences between the groups for absolute PEF were less than 5 L/min or less than 3% predicted at all time intervals. This is consistent with the systematic reviews of ICS therapy in the ED treatment of asthma, and of oral corticosteroid therapy in the ED treatment of asthma, where there was minimal effect of oral corticosteroid therapy on pulmonary function tests, despite beneficial effects on other outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2003</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">ICS alone versus oral corticosteroid alone</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000</LINK> there were seven studies contributing to this comparison; five were published (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nana-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nana 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Volovitz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Volovitz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manjra-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Manjra 2000</LINK>) and two were unpublished (<LINK REF="STD-Francis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Francis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verona-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Verona 1998</LINK>; both in abstract form only). A total of 1204 patients were incorporated. Unfortunately, despite the relatively large number of patients included in these trials, the studies varied markedly in their reported outcomes, and smaller numbers of patients contribute to each of the individual outcomes. In 2012 two additional studies were added (<LINK REF="STD-Nakanishi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nakanishi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Franco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Di Franco 2006</LINK>) contributing data from a further 92 patients to increase the total to 1296.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference between the treatments for asthma relapse, at either seven to 10 or 16 to 21 days. The important question to be answered is whether or not there is sufficient information to conclude these two treatments are equivalent (similar). At seven to 10 days, the OR for relapse was 1.0, with the 95% CI from 0.66 to 1.52, which suggests potential difference beyond what would be the minimally clinically important difference (MCID). Only one study contributed data to the 16-day outcome, with an OR for relapse of 1.26 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.99), again providing imprecise estimates of the true effectiveness. None of the studies were powered for equivalence, and the pooled results are<B> not </B>compatible with equivalent efficacy between the two treatments. Although three studies reported admission rates, the admission rates were very low overall (one patient only), so the point estimate for difference in admission needs to be viewed with caution, as reflected by the wide CI values (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95).</P>
<P>These studies included only patients with relatively mild asthma, as evidenced by the inclusion criteria and relapse rates. One of the studies defined relapse as the failure of symptoms or peak flow to improve, a definition different from all other studies included in this review. This definition would likely include less 'severe' relapses, and it is not clear if this is an appropriate surrogate outcome for relapses resulting in an additional acute care visit (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>). This was the largest study contributing to this outcome (403 of 684 total patients), and were its data not included, the range of uncertainty for the treatment effect would be much broader.</P>
<P>Several studies used absolute PEF as the primary outcome. There was a small, statistically significant improvement in PEF in the group treated with ICS at 20 to 24 days, with an improvement of 15 L/min compared with the oral corticosteroid-treated group. The minimum difference in pulmonary function tests that is considered clinically significant has been infrequently studied in this setting. In the adult population, a minimum improvement of approximately 30 L/min in PEF (<LINK REF="REF-Tiffany-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tiffany 1993</LINK>), or a 10% to 12% predicted rise in PFT is likely to be necessary to demonstrate a clinically important difference. The small improvement in peak flow demonstrated here would be unlikely to be important to patients, particularly in the absence of other demonstrated benefits of ICS therapy. Only a small number of studies reported rescue medication use: there was no clear benefit to either therapy in this outcome.</P>
<P>Other outcomes, including quality of life, asthma symptom scores and side effects, were recorded and reported in diverse ways, with little information that was amenable to pooling. Many of the trials used new scales with questionable validity for measuring these outcomes. In addition, the information for several of the trials was reported incompletely, precluding the incorporation of these results in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>In the conclusions for seven of the nine trials, it was stated that ICS therapy may be substituted for oral corticosteroid therapy after an acute asthma attack, as there were no significant differences demonstrated between the treatments. None of these trials (two of which were published in abstract form only) discussed the possibility of type II error in drawing these conclusions, and only one presented a power calculation but did not have the required number of patients in the trial. Four of the trials based their conclusions on a lack of statistically significant differences in results from lung function tests between the treatment groups. However, this may not be an appropriate outcome to use in assessing clinical equivalence. Lung function has not been shown to be responsive to treatment with corticosteroid agents in other systematic reviews in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2003</LINK>), despite improvements in other clinical markers. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Franco-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Di Franco 2006</LINK>) was unable to find a significant difference between the treatment groups for changes in percentage of sputum eosinophils, which has been shown to be helpful in monitoring chronic asthma, but is not well studied in acute asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2002</LINK>). The seventh trial did present a priori sample size calculations, but was unable to accrue the required number of patients in the trial and had a calculated power of only 57% to demonstrate a clinically significant difference in relapse rates (<LINK REF="STD-Levy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Levy 1996</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:27:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was heterogeneity among the studies for several of the secondary outcomes including symptoms and quality-of-life, particularly in the ICS plus oral corticosteroid versus oral corticosteroid comparison. This heterogeneity may affect the pooled result for the primary outcome as well, potentially obscuring a subgroup of patients in whom ICS therapy may provide a more marked benefit. To investigate the heterogeneity further, differences between studies in design, populations, outcomes and interventions used need to be considered. One potential explanation for the heterogeneity between the studies might be the dose of ICS used. The study that showed clear benefit of ICS on several outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Rowe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rowe 1999</LINK>) used high-dose ICS, while the two studies that did not show a beneficial effect of ICS used moderate-dose ICS (<LINK REF="STD-Brenner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brenner 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camargo-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 2000</LINK>). However, this is a between-study comparison made after the completion of the review, and should only be considered as a hypothesis for future research. The small number of studies did not permit other meaningful comparisons to be made in this systematic review. A meta-analysis using individual patient data from the studies may be more informative. In the ICS versus oral corticosteroid comparison, all of the studies included patients with relatively mild asthma exacerbations: these results should not be generalised to those with more severe exacerbations.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-25 09:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is not surprising that these studies, and a meta-analysis of them, failed to generate conclusive results, as the trials were relatively small. For asthma relapse, if baseline asthma relapse rates were 10%, to show a 50% reduction in the risk of relapse (5% absolute risk reduction), 621 patients would be required in each arm of a trial to demonstrate this difference with a power of 80% and alpha level of 5%. If the goal was to demonstrate a 25% relative risk reduction (2.5% absolute risk reduction), 2764 patients would be needed in each group (for a total sample size of 5528 patients).</P>
<P>While the studies in the ICS versus oral corticosteroid comparison provide some evidence that ICS therapy alone may be effective in people with mild asthma exacerbations upon ED discharge, there is insufficient evidence at this point to support the use of ICS, rather than oral corticosteroid, as the standard of care. People with more severe asthma exacerbations were not included in these studies, so these results cannot be extrapolated to this population. Moreover, the cost differences between the two are also an important consideration (with an approximate cost of USD0.10 per day for prednisone, versus USD0.80 per day for ICS). If further trials in this area support a conclusion of equivalence between these therapies, there would need to be evidence of other compelling reasons to use ICS in place of oral corticosteroid therapy, such as side effect profile, symptom control or compliance, which were not evident in this systematic review. Perhaps the most compelling reason for using ICS on discharge from the ED following an exacerbation is that it can form the start of an appropriate chronic asthma management programme for that patient.</P>
<P>With regard to random sequence generation 10 trials were judged to be low in risk of bias (selection bias). The risk of bias for two of the remaining trials was unclear. In terms of the blinding of participants and personnel 11 trials were judged to be at low risk of performance bias. In just one trial the risk was judged to be unclear. All 12 were regarded as low risk of bias in terms of attrition bias.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-11-12 14:41:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a possibility of publication bias in this meta-analysis. By missing unpublished negative trials, we may be over-estimating the effect of ICS therapy when used in addition to oral corticosteroid therapy, or we may be missing trials that would add more support the conclusion that ICS are as efficacious as oral corticosteroid in people with mild asthma. However, a comprehensive search of the published literature was conducted, and attempts to uncover unpublished trials were made by corresponding with authors and the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ICS. We recognise that unpublished trials may exist.</P>
<P>There is also a possibility of selection bias; however, two independent review authors selected studies for inclusion, and criteria for study inclusion and exclusion were explicitly specified. Finally, this is an evolving area, and it will be important to re-evaluate this topic area in the future.</P>

<P>This review updated the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Edmonds-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edmonds 2000</LINK>). Despite an extensive search we only found two new studies to include, both in the ICS versus oral corticosteroid comparison, and they had few data amenable to inclusion in the review. Data were added to the previous analyses for hospital admission and beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use at 14 to 21 days, and two new outcomes were added: FEV<SUB>1</SUB> % predicted at six to 10 days and 16 to 21 days to include data from these two studies. However, all of these outcomes had only one study contributing to each time point, and the overall conclusions of the review were unchanged.</P>

<OL>
<LI>There is insufficient evidence from primary studies to support the hypothesis that the addition of ICS therapy to standard oral corticosteroid therapy is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma upon ED discharge.</LI>
<LI>ICS alone do not appear to be less effective than standard oral corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma, but there is insufficient evidence to state that they are of equivalent efficacy. There is some support for the use of ICS alone in people with mild asthma exacerbations; there is no evidence to support this practice in moderate or severe acute asthma exacerbations.</LI>
<LI>Until further research results are available, the mainstay of therapy in outpatients with acute asthma remains oral corticosteroid for five to 10 days (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2003</LINK>), or in some cases IM agents.</LI>
<LI>The results of ICS plus oral corticosteroid versus ICS alone do not apply to young children since none of the studies involved patients younger than 12 years of age.</LI>
<LI>The addition of ICS should be made on an individual basis using patient preferences, past asthma control and physician experience.</LI>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-25 09:58:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many unanswered questions about the use of ICS in acute asthma treatment upon ED discharge.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Additional research is required to determine if there is a beneficial effect of ICS therapy in addition to standard oral corticosteroid therapy in severe acute asthma exacerbations. Despite the lack of overall benefit, this may be because of heterogeneity between the trials. Further research involving pre-defined subgroups (particularly asthma severity and gender) appears warranted.</LI>
<LI>An individual patient data meta-analysis of these trials may help clarify where further research should be directed.</LI>
<LI>Trials designed to compare the possibility of substituting ICS therapy for standard oral corticosteroid therapy should be designed as equivalence trials, with a clear, a priori definition of what will be accepted as proof of equivalence, and adequate sample sizes to address this question.</LI>
<LI>Future research in this area should focus on clearly defined, clinically important outcomes, with clear definitions for asthma relapse, admission, timing and type of pulmonary function testing, and length of follow-up.</LI>
<LI>Pulmonary function tests should not be used as the primary outcome for these trials. Overall, the primary studies investigating oral corticosteroid and ICS in acute asthma treatment, as well as the meta-analyses, do not show a significant acute effect of corticosteroid therapy on pulmonary function, despite beneficial effects on other, clinically important outcomes such as admission or relapse rates.</LI>
<LI>Further RCTs involving children (especially below 12 years of age) are required to examine the benefit of ICS following discharge from the ED when used in addition to oral corticosteroids.</LI>
