<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-09 09:26:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to know whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Stroke can cause paralysis of some parts of the body and other difficulties with various physical functions. Physical rehabilitation is an important part of rehabilitation for people who have had a stroke. Over the years, various approaches to physical rehabilitation have been developed, according to different ideas about how people recover after a stroke. Often physiotherapists will follow one particular approach, to the exclusion of others, but this practice is generally based on personal preference rather than scientific rationale. Considerable debate continues among physiotherapists about the relative benefits of different approaches; therefore it is important to bring together the research evidence and highlight what best practice ought to be in selecting these different approaches.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 96 studies, up to December 2012, for inclusion in the review. These studies, involving 10,401 stroke survivors, investigated physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke compared with no treatment, usual care or attention control or in comparisons of different physical rehabilitation approaches. The average number of participants in each study was 105: most studies (93%) included fewer than 200 participants, one study had more than 1000 participants, six had between 250 and 100 participants and 10 had 20 or fewer participants. Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function (functional movement), balance, walking speed and length of stay. More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China. These studies showed many differences in relation to the type of stroke and how severe it was, as well as differences in treatment, which varied according to both treatment type and duration.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review brings together evidence confirming that physical rehabilitation (often delivered by a physiotherapist, physical therapist or rehabilitation therapist) can improve function, balance and walking after stroke. It appears to be most beneficial when the therapist selects a mixture of different treatments for an individual patient from a wide range of available treatments.</P>
<P>We were able to combine the results from 27 studies (3243 stroke survivors) that compared physical rehabilitation versus no treatment. Twenty-five of these 27 studies were carried out in China. Results showed that physical rehabilitation improves functional recovery, and that this improvement may last long-term. When we looked at studies that compared additional physical rehabilitation versus usual care or a control intervention, we found evidence to show that the additional physical treatment improved motor function (12 studies, 887 stroke survivors), standing balance (five studies, 246 stroke survivors) and walking speed (14 studies, 1126 stroke survivors). Very limited evidence suggests that, for comparisons of physical rehabilitation versus no treatment and versus usual care, treatment that appeared to be effective was given between 30 and 60 minutes per day, five to seven days per week, but further research is needed to confirm this. We also found evidence of greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke, but again further research is needed to confirm this.</P>
<P>We found evidence showing that no one physical rehabilitation approach was more effective than any other approach. This finding means that physiotherapists should choose each individual patient's treatment according to the evidence available for that specific treatment, and should not limit their practice to a single 'named' approach.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>It was difficult for us to judge the quality of evidence because we found poor, incomplete or brief reporting of information. We determined that less than 50% of the studies were of good quality, and for most studies, the quality of the evidence was unclear from the information provided.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2014-04-11 10:03:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Various approaches to physical rehabilitation may be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate surround the effectiveness of relative approaches. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use a mixture of components from several different approaches.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-11 10:03:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.</P>
<P>For the previous versions of this review, the objective was to explore the effect of 'physiotherapy treatment approaches' based on historical classifications of orthopaedic, neurophysiological or motor learning principles, or on a mixture of these treatment principles. For this update of the review, the objective was to explore the effects of approaches that incorporate individual treatment components, categorised as functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskeletal intervention (passive), neurophysiological intervention, cardiopulmonary intervention, assistive device or modality.</P>
<P>In addition, we sought to explore the impact of time after stroke, geographical location of the study, dose of the intervention, provider of the intervention and treatment components included within an intervention.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2012), EMBASE (1980 to December 2012), AMED (1985 to December 2012) and CINAHL (1982 to December 2012). We searched reference lists and contacted experts and researchers who have an interest in stroke rehabilitation.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function, balance, gait velocity and length of stay. We included trials comparing physical rehabilitation approaches versus no treatment, usual care or attention control and those comparing different physical rehabilitation approaches.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently categorised identified trials according to the selection criteria, documented their methodological quality and extracted the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included a total of 96 studies (10,401 participants) in this review. More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China. Generally the studies were heterogeneous, and many were poorly reported.</P>
<P>Physical rehabilitation was found to have a beneficial effect, as compared with no treatment, on functional recovery after stroke (27 studies, 3423 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.97, for Independence in ADL scales), and this effect was noted to persist beyond the length of the intervention period (nine studies, 540 participants; SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.04). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value &lt; 0.0001, for independence in ADL), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week is effective. This evidence principally arises from studies carried out in China. Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.003, for independence in ADL).</P>
<P>We found physical rehabilitation to be more effective than usual care or attention control in improving motor function (12 studies, 887 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), balance (five studies, 246 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56) and gait velocity (14 studies, 1126 participants; SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60). Subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value 0.02 for motor function), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes delivered five to seven days a week provides significant benefit. Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.05, for independence in ADL).</P>
<P>No one physical rehabilitation approach was more (or less) effective than any other approach in improving independence in ADL (eight studies, 491 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.71) or motor function (nine studies, 546 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.41). These findings are supported by subgroup analyses carried out for comparisons of intervention versus no treatment or usual care, which identified no significant effects of different treatment components or categories of interventions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Physical rehabilitation, comprising a selection of components from different approaches, is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Evidence related to dose of physical therapy is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions. No one approach to physical rehabilitation is any more (or less) effective in promoting recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Therefore, evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation should not be limited to compartmentalised, named approaches, but rather should comprise clearly defined, well-described, evidenced-based physical treatments, regardless of historical or philosophical origin.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in many Western nations. In Australia, the UK and the USA, it is within the top 10 causes of long-term physical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathers 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ovbiagele-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ovbiagele 2011</LINK>). The most common and widely recognised impairment caused by stroke is motor impairment, which can be regarded as loss or limitation of function in muscle control or movement or limitation in mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Wade-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1992a</LINK>). Motor impairment after stroke typically affects the control of movement of the face, arm and leg on one side of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Warlow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warlow 2008</LINK>) and is seen in about 80% of patients. Almost two-thirds of stroke survivors have initial mobility deficits (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaughnessy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaughnessy 2005</LINK>), and six months after a stroke, more than 30% of survivors still cannot walk independently (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2000</LINK>). Therefore, much of the focus of stroke rehabilitation, in particular, the work of physiotherapists (also known as physical therapists or rehabilitation therapists), is focused on recovery of physical independence and functional ability during activities of daily living; commonly the ultimate goal of therapy is to improve the function of walking and recovery of balance and movement (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Various approaches to physical rehabilitation can be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate about the relative effectiveness of these approaches are ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kollen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollen 2009</LINK>). Descriptions of these approaches are best considered within a historical context.</P>
<P>Before the 1940s, physical rehabilitation approaches primarily consisted of corrective exercises based on orthopaedic principles related to contraction and relaxation of muscles, with emphasis placed on regaining function by compensating with the unaffected limbs (<LINK REF="REF-Ashburn-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashburn 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partridge-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partridge 1996</LINK>). In the 1950s and 1960s, techniques based on available neurophysiological knowledge were developed to enhance recovery of the paretic side. These new approaches included the methods of Bobath (<LINK REF="REF-Bobath-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bobath 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1985</LINK>), Brunnström (<LINK REF="REF-Brunnstr_x00f6_m-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brunnström 1970</LINK>) and Rood (<LINK REF="REF-Goff-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goff 1969</LINK>), as well as the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation approach (<LINK REF="REF-Knott-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knott 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Voss-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voss 1985</LINK>). In the 1980s, the potential importance of neuropsychology and motor learning was highlighted (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turnbull-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turnbull 1982</LINK>) and the motor learning, or relearning, approach was proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1982</LINK>). This suggested that active practice of context-specific motor tasks with appropriate feedback would promote learning and motor recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1987a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1998</LINK>). The practical application of these approaches appeared to result in substantial differences in patient treatment. Approaches based on neurophysiological principles seemingly involved the physiotherapist moving the patient through patterns of movement, with the therapist acting as problem solver and decision maker and the patient being a relatively passive recipient (<LINK REF="REF-Lennon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 1996</LINK>). In direct contrast, motor learning approaches stressed the importance of active involvement by the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1982</LINK>), and orthopaedic approaches emphasised muscle strengthening techniques and compensation with the non-paretic side.</P>
<P>Since the 1980s, the need to base neurological physiotherapy on scientific research in relevant areas such as medical science, neuroscience, exercise physiology and biomechanics, and to test the outcomes of physical interventions to develop evidence-based physiotherapy has been increasingly emphasised. However, anecdotal evidence and the results of questionnaire-based studies suggest that, traditionally, many physiotherapists continued to base their clinical practice around a 'named' treatment approach. From the 1990s, the Bobath approach, based on neurophysiological principles, came to be recognised as the most widely used method in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1992</LINK>), Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1994a</LINK>) and the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Davidson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davidson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lennon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackley 1996</LINK>). As a consequence, since this time, physiotherapists have often sought evidence related to these 'named' approaches to the physical rehabilitation of stroke patients.</P>
<P>In some parts of the world, clear preferences for one 'named' approach have prevailed; however in others, physical rehabilitation approaches for stroke have developed with greater eclecticism, resulting in geographical preferences for mixing particular approaches, or components from different approaches, as well as preferences for single 'named' approaches. For example, in China, where stroke rehabilitation is not yet considered standard care (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>), standard 'approaches' to rehabilitation have been proposed, including 'standardised tertiary rehabilitation' (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2007-isch" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2007 isch</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Research-Group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Research Group 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>) and 'standardised three-phase rehabilitation' (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2004b</LINK>). These approaches arguably appear to draw on the full range of treatment interventions available from all orthopaedic, neurophysiological and motor learning approaches described in Western literature, while incorporating traditional Chinese therapies such as acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhuang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuang 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>More recently, calls asking physiotherapists to cease using named approaches and to stop selecting treatments based on historical perspectives have increased. Physiotherapists have been urged to refrain from using compartmentalised, named approaches and to select clearly defined and described techniques and task-specific treatments, regardless of their historical or philosophical origin (<LINK REF="REF-Kollen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhammer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhammer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayston 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2005</LINK>). Although a move away from named approaches in preference of more evidence-based approaches has been deliberately implemented in some countries, such as the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Kollen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Peppen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Peppen 2004</LINK>), heated debate continues about the evidence for doing this (<LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 2010</LINK>), and some physiotherapists around the world continue to exhibit preferences for particular named approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2009b</LINK>).</P>

<P>Continued controversy and debate about the relative effectiveness of physical rehabilitation approaches and evidence of clear preferences for particular named approaches in some parts of the world, despite increasing calls for this to change, justify the importance of this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to address limitations within previous versions of this review</HEADING>
<P>The original versions of this review classified approaches to physiotherapy on the basis of historical principles described in the literature; however we classified interventions as neurophysiological, motor learning, orthopaedic or mixed, according to the descriptor or name of the intervention provided by trialists (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> displays the criteria that we used in classifying neurophysiological and motor learning approaches (NB: We are not using these criteria in this updated review.). However, the 2007 version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK>) identified several limitations associated with this method of classification.</P>
<OL>
<LI>This classification was based on Western approaches and descriptions of physiotherapy and did not incorporate physical therapy delivered across the whole world. In <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK>, we identified a large number (26) of non&#8211;English language (23 Chinese) trials (and classified them as 'studies awaiting assessment'). We stated: "The information currently available from the majority of the Chinese trials awaiting assessment suggests that it is unlikely that the interventions studied in these trials will fit into the western categorisations and classifications of physiotherapy treatment approaches developed for this review. Prior to the next update of this review, the authors intend to seek advice and write additional inclusion and exclusion criteria to deal with the non-western approaches to physiotherapy for stroke".</LI>
<LI>The 'mixed' approach category within the review could potentially incorporate a large number of heterogeneous interventions that may not be meaningful to combine. <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK> stated: "A limitation of combining all mixed approaches is that this category potentially amalgamates any number of possible combinations of other approaches and techniques"<I>.</I>
</LI>
<LI>We found difficulties in determining the classifications of motor learning and mixed approaches for some studies. <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK> stated:<I> "</I>difficulty was experienced in distinguishing between a mixed approach (not a mixture of two different approaches, such as <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1970</LINK> mixing orthopaedic and neurophysiological approaches, but an unclassified mix [where the interventions were not easily classified into a 'named' approach]) and a motor learning approach. The mixed, intensive and focused approach investigated by <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK> and the problem-solving approach investigated by<I> </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK> and<I> </I>
<LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK> had stated philosophies very similar to those of motor learning approaches. However, the described techniques and the supporting references led the reviewers to classify these interventions as mixed. This highlights a key problem with the classification of the motor learning approach. Although a motor relearning programme has been described by Carr and Shepherd (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1987b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1987b</LINK>),<I> </I>these authors primarily advocate an approach based on related research in relevant areas such as medical science, neuroscience, exercise physiology and biomechanics. Such an approach is arguably one of research-based practice, rather than being based on one specific philosophy".</LI>
</OL>
<P>It was therefore essential to plan solutions and strategies to address these limitations before this update of the review was conducted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Consensus methods to inform update of this review</HEADING>
<P>To address the identified limitations within previous versions of this review, before this update we convened a stakeholder group comprising 13 purposively selected people: three stroke survivors, one carer and nine physiotherapists. Members of this group are listed and acknowledged in the <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK> section. We used formal group consensus methods to reach consensus decisions around review aims and methods, while focusing on clinical relevance, as such methods are recognised to be advantageous when subjective judgements need to be organised (<LINK REF="REF-Nair-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nair 2011</LINK>). The consensus methods were based on nominal group techniques, as this method enables the pooling of decisions and judgements from a group of informed experts, leading to votes on a range of options until ultimately group consensus is reached (<LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 2010</LINK>). The review authors attended the stakeholder group meetings and contributed to discussions; however we did not participate in the voting process. This approach was taken to ensure that the results of the voting reflected the views of stroke survivors, carers and physiotherapists and were not biased by the opinions of the review authors. The process of stakeholder group involvement is outlined in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The stakeholder group specifically discussed the categorisation of interventions and inclusion of evidence from the international trials listed as awaiting assessment in <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK>, which led to voting on two key statements.</P>
<OL>
<LI>"The current categories (based on western approaches) are appropriate and clinically relevant".</LI>
<LI>"These international trials (which do not fit into the categories of western approaches) should be included in our review of physiotherapy treatment approaches".</LI>
</OL>
<P>We determined the proportion agreeing with each statement. We audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim the consensus decision meetings. We coded and analysed qualitative data using NVivo software: 84% of group members disagreed with statement 1, and 100% agreed with statement 2. Two key themes and several subthemes emerged from the transcribed data. Key themes were that (1) current categories of rehabilitation approaches should be amended to enable inclusion of all international evidence and (2) current physiotherapy taxonomies have limitations and concerns that have been raised surrounding their relevance to clinical practice in the UK.</P>
<P>Discussion amongst stakeholder group members led to the generation of, and agreement on, a proposal that the optimal way of classifying the 'approaches' for this review consisted of using systematic categorisation of the treatment components described in relation to interventions. This discussion followed a presentation of treatment components described in a sample of 10 Chinese trials that had been listed as 'awaiting assessment' in <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gong-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Pan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Xie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). On the suggestion of the stakeholder group, to further explore the range of treatment components and reach agreement on definitions of these components, we systematically extracted descriptions of physical rehabilitation approaches from the 20 trials included in <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2007</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Dean-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dean 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dean-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dean 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Green-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hesse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hesse 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Howe 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langhammer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Langhammer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClellan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McClellan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozdemir-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdemir 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pollock-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pollock 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salbach-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salbach 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wade-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wade 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wellmon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wellmon 1997</LINK>). The stakeholder group then explored the descriptions of treatment components from these 30 trials. The aim was to include a variety of types and descriptions of physical rehabilitation approaches to allow examination of whether a range of treatment components could be identified and consensus over descriptions and categorisations; this was designed as an exploration, rather than as a comprehensive aggregation. The stakeholder group debated the treatment components described within these trials of physical rehabilitation approaches, reached consensus on key components, agreed on descriptions of these components and determined categorisation for synthesis of evidence within this update of the Cochrane review.</P>
<P>The stakeholder group identified and defined 27 treatment components based on the interventions described within the 30 explored trials. These were grouped into seven categories: functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskeletal intervention (passive), neurophysiological intervention, cardiopulmonary intervention, assistive device and modality. These categories were informed by the taxonomy described by <LINK REF="REF-DeJong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeJong 2004</LINK>. One hundred per cent of the stakeholder group agreed with these treatment component descriptions and categories. The agreed upon categories, treatment components and definitions are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2013 update</HEADING>
<P>For this update of this review, we identified 11,576 (8120 with duplicates removed) potentially relevant studies. We considered 108 full papers and included 96 trials (10,401 participants) (including the 20 within the 2007 version).</P>
<P>We identified two relevant ongoing studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>), and we had insufficient information to reach decisions on nine studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>). We excluded three studies that had been included in the 2007 version, as they used quasi-random assignment (<LINK REF="STD-Hesse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hesse 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozdemir-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdemir 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1970</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<P>We included a total of 96 studies (10,401 participants) in this review. Two studies divided participants according to type of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) before randomisation and presented results within these two groups: These have been entered as four separate studies: <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2007-haem" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2007 haem</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2007-isch" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2007 isch</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2007-isch" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2007 isch</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2007-haem" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2007 haem</LINK>. The data for Fang 2004 were presented in two groups, according to the age of participants, so these data have also been presented separately (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2004-old" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2004 old</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fang-2004-young" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2004 young</LINK>). Thus a total of 99 studies are referenced as included studies in this review. Details of these 99 studies are provided in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>The mean number of participants was 105 (SD 151). Ninety-two of the 99 studies included fewer than 200 participants. One study had more than 1000 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>; 1078 participants); and six had between 250 and 100 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bai-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bai 2008</LINK>, 364; <LINK REF="STD-Behrman-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Behrman 2011</LINK>, 408; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2007-haem" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2007 haem</LINK>, 352; <LINK REF="STD-Hu-2007-isch" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2007 isch</LINK>, 965; <LINK REF="STD-Kwakkel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kwakkel 2008</LINK>, 250; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2003</LINK>, 300).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intervention categories</HEADING>
<P>Details of the categories and treatment components of the active interventions are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Of the 99 studies, 23 investigated two active interventions (19 of which directly compared two active interventions; and four of which had three intervention groups, of which two were active interventions). Thus a total of 122 active interventions were studied (99 included studies plus 23 studies with a second active intervention).</P>
<P>The most common intervention category was functional task training, with 101 of the 122 active interventions categorised as including treatment components from functional task training.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Of these 101 interventions, 20 included only functional task training components.</LI>
<LI>Of these 101 interventions, 26 included functional task training plus one other category. The second category was neurophysiological for six interventions; modality for two interventions; musculoskeletal (passive) for nine interventions; musculoskeletal (active) for eight interventions and cardiopulmonary for one intervention.</LI>
<LI>Of these 101 interventions, 32 included functional task training plus two other categories. The other categories included neurophysiological for 11 interventions; musculoskeletal (active) and musculoskeletal (passive) for 13 interventions; musculoskeletal (active or passive) plus other categories for seven interventions; and cardiopulmonary and assistive devices for one intervention.</LI>
<LI>Of these 101 interventions, 19 included functional task training plus three other categories. The other categories were neurophysiological plus musculoskeletal (active) plus musculoskeletal (passive) for nine interventions; neurophysiological plus other categories for eight interventions; and musculoskeletal (active) plus musculoskeletal (passive) plus another category for two interventions.</LI>
<LI>Of these 101 interventions, four included functional task training plus four other categories. The other categories were modalities, musculoskeletal (passive), musculoskeletal (active) and neurophysiological for three interventions; assistive devices, musculoskeletal (passive), musculoskeletal (active) and neurophysiological for one intervention; and modalities, musculoskeletal (passive), musculoskeletal (active) and assistive devices for one intervention.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Of the remaining 21 of the 122 interventions, most (17 interventions) included components from the neurophysiological category.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Of these 17 interventions, only 12 implemented neurophysiological treatment components.</LI>
<LI>Of these 17 interventions, five implemented neurophysiological plus a combination of musculoskeletal (active), musculoskeletal (passive) and/or modalities.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Of the remaining four interventions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>one included musculoskeletal (active) and musculoskeletal (passive) components;</LI>
<LI>two included musculoskeletal (passive) components only; and</LI>
<LI>one included a modality only (this modality was acupuncture; <LINK REF="STD-Zhuang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuang 2012</LINK>).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison groups</HEADING>
<P>The studies included in this review compare an active intervention with:</P>
<OL>
<LI>no treatment (55 studies: see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> for further details);</LI>
<LI>usual care (19 studies) or attention control (11 studies) (see <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> for further details); or</LI>
<LI>another active intervention (23 studies: see <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK> for further details).</LI>
</OL>
<P>A total of 108 comparisons were performed, as five of the 99 studies contributed data on more than one comparison. Four studies contributed data on three comparisons: <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mudie-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mudie 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK> each compared two active treatments with usual care, and <LINK REF="STD-Baer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Baer 2007</LINK> compared two active treatments with no treatment. Of the 99 studies, one contributed data on two comparisons: <LINK REF="STD-Kwakkel-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kwakkel 2002</LINK> compared an active intervention with both an attention control group and a no treatment group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Definition of dose</HEADING>
<P>We preplanned subgroup analyses to explore the effect of dose of intervention. We defined <I>dose</I> as including the components of (1) length of a single treatment session, (2) frequency of treatment sessions and (3) duration of the intervention period. However, because of the availability of data and the complexities associated with variations in these three components, our subgroup analyses of dose explored only the combination of (1) length of a single treatment session and (2) frequency of treatment sessions. We also performed additional sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of (3) duration of intervention period on subgroup analysis results.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures for analysis</HEADING>
<P>The included trials used a large number of heterogeneous outcome measures. The many diverse outcome measures recorded in the included studies made it impossible for review authors to analyse all of the documented data. Based on the prestated groupings of relevant outcomes and the availability of data from specific measures in the included trials, the review authors for the previous version of the review made the decision to concentrate data analysis on independence in ADL,* motor function,* balance, muscle strength, gait velocity and length of rehabilitation stay. For this update, we decided to remove the muscle strength outcome, as this outcome was rarely reported in the included studies.</P>
<P>*Independence in ADL was called 'global dependency' and motor function was called 'functional independence in mobility' in previous versions of this review. See <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>.</P>
<P>Outcome measures were recorded at several different time points during and after the intervention period. For the analyses in the review, we classed 'immediate outcomes' as data that were recorded at the end of the treatment period or at the time point nearest to the end of the treatment period. If the intervention comprised a change in treatment throughout the whole of a participant's rehabilitation period, then data were recorded from the outcome measures noted at the time of discharge from rehabilitation or at the time point nearest to discharge. When studies also reported follow-up data, we included these as analysis of 'persisting outcome'. The time points at which data were recorded are clearly documented and stated for each trial in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>.</P>
<P>Of the 99 studies, 79 included outcome measures suitable for inclusion in an analysis of immediate outcomes, and 27 provided a follow-up outcome measure. Details of these outcome measures are provided below.</P>

<P>Studies listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table were limited to those for which discussions were required between review authors to reach consensus. Thirty-nine studies are listed; we considered a further 147 as full papers but excluded them, as we agreed that they clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. We needed to look at full papers because insufficient details were provided in the abstracts; the main reasons for excluding studies at this stage were that they were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or that they investigated a single specific treatment (such as electrical stimulation or treadmill training).</P>

<P>Details of the methodological quality of the studies are provided in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, and risk of bias is summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>. We assessed only 40 of the 99 studies to have low risk of bias for sequence generation; 29 of 99 for allocation concealment and 51 of 99 for blinding of outcome assessor. Poor reporting led to our assigning 'unclear' risk of bias in most cases, with 56 of 99, 59 of 99 and 39 of 99 studies having unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor, respectively. We assessed a larger proportion (72 of 99) to have low risk of bias for being 'free of systematic differences in baseline characteristics of groups,' as this information could generally be determined from tables of characteristics of participants. When no systematic differences in baseline characteristics of groups were noted, there was no need for study authors to adjust for baseline characteristics; this was also therefore assessed to show low risk of bias for a similar number of studies.</P>

Five of the studies investigated the effect of neurophysiological components only (<LINK REF="STD-Langhammer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Langhammer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhuang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhuang 2012</LINK>); two of the studies investigated neurophysiological components combined with functional task training (<LINK REF="STD-Bale-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bale 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1995</LINK>) and one investigated neurophysiological components combined with functional task training and passive musculoskeletal components (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2006</LINK>). In all eight studies, the neurophysiological component included components described as 'Bobath.' In seven of the studies, the alternative intervention included functional task training: functional task training only in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Langhammer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Langhammer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lincoln-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lincoln 2003</LINK>); functional task training plus musculoskeletal components in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bale-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bale 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2005</LINK>) and functional task training plus musculoskeletal components and modalities or assistive devices in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gelber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gelber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>This review included 96 studies (10,401 participants) that explored the effects of different physical rehabilitation approaches. More than half of the studies (50/99) were carried out in China. Fifty-one studies compared a physiotherapy intervention with no treatment; 42 of these studies were carried out in China. Twenty-seven studies compared a physiotherapy intervention with usual care or attention control. Twenty-four studies compared two different active physical rehabilitation approaches. Data were available for meta-analysis from 34 studies comparing intervention with no treatment; 16 studies comparing intervention with usual care or attention control and 14 studies comparing two different active interventions. Key findings arising from meta-analyses were as follows.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention versus no treatment</HEADING>
<OL>
<LI>Moderate-quality evidence showed a beneficial effect of physical rehabilitation on measures of independence in ADL and motor function. This finding was sustained at follow-up assessments, although the size of the benefit was reduced. Quality of reporting of studies within this comparison was generally poor, and risk of bias was frequently unclear for key methodological criteria.</LI>
<LI>There was insufficient evidence to support conclusions relating to the effect of physical rehabilitation on balance, gait velocity or length of stay.</LI>
<LI>A significant difference between subgroups based on time since stroke was noted, with an indication of benefit associated with shorter time since stroke.</LI>
<LI>A significant difference between subgroups based on geographical location was reported, but most studies were carried out in China with participants who were within 30 days post stroke. All studies carried out in China were assessed at high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>A significant difference between subgroups based on dose of intervention was noted, with an indication that a dose of between 30 and 60 minutes once per day for five to seven days a week was beneficial, but that more than once-daily intervention may provide even greater benefit. It was not possible to draw conclusions relating to duration of the intervention period, with substantial heterogeneity within analyses.</LI>
<LI>Significant differences between subgroups based on provider of intervention were noted, but it is difficult to reach generalised conclusions from these subgroup analyses.</LI>
<LI>Results of the subgroup analyses must be interpreted with caution, as a complex interrelationship between some of the subgroups is likely. For example, studies with the least time since stroke were carried out in China, meaning that reported effects attributed to geographical location may be related to time since stroke (and vice versa).</LI>
<LI>No significant differences were noted between studies that investigated different components or categories of intervention.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In summary, moderate-quality evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on independence in ADL and motor function after stroke, and that this effect persists beyond the end of the intervention period, when compared with no treatment. Evidence shows greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke. Evidence also suggests that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week is effective, and that more frequent or increased doses may provide even greater benefit. Substantial heterogeneity was observed between the studies included in these analyses, and most of the studies were at high or uncertain risk of bias.</P>
<P>This evidence principally arises from China, where a particular healthcare system and cultures and beliefs are associated with health and disease. In China, physiotherapy or rehabilitation traditionally has not been routinely provided within acute hospital settings; therefore this evidence is highly relevant to stroke care settings in China. Arguably this evidence does not have any direct implications for settings in which no treatment would not be considered to be an ethical alternative for hospitalised patients with stroke, but the indirect implications of this evidence base may have universal relevance. Evidence suggests that 30 to 60 minutes of physical rehabilitation per day, delivered five to seven days per week, is beneficial for recovery of function, but that no one individual approach to physical rehabilitation is better than any other approach.</P>

<LI>Moderate- to high-quality evidence shows a beneficial effect of physical rehabilitation on measures of motor function, balance and gait velocity. Moderate-quality evidence also shows that this beneficial effect was maintained at follow-up for gait velocity, but insufficient data were available at follow-up to permit conclusions for other outcomes.</LI>
<LI>No evidence was found of any benefit of intervention on measures of independence in ADL, but relatively few studies included data for this outcome.</LI>
<LI>A significant difference between subgroups was noted based on time since stroke, with an indication of benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke. No evidence of this effect was seen in follow-up data.</LI>
<LI>For measures of motor function, a significant difference between subgroups based on dose of intervention was observed, with an indication that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes five to seven days per week was significantly more beneficial than an intervention delivered three to four times per week. No difference between subgroups was described for measures of independence in ADL. It was not possible to draw conclusions relating to duration of the intervention period, with substantial heterogeneity within analyses.</LI>
<LI>No significant differences were reported between studies that investigated different components or categories of intervention.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In summary, moderate- to high-quality evidence shows that physical rehabilitation is more effective than usual care or attention control in improving motor function, balance and gait velocity. Evidence suggests greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke. Evidence also suggests that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes delivered five to seven days a week provides significant benefit. In particular, high-quality evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation has an impact on gait, with significant increases in gait velocity maintained at follow-up assessments. Some evidence suggests that benefit may be greater if rehabilitation is carried out earlier after stroke, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously. As with the comparison of intervention versus no treatment, this evidence suggests that no one individual approach to physical rehabilitation is better than any other approach for recovery of function or mobility.</P>

Very limited evidence indicates that interventions including neurophysiological components resulted in a longer hospital stay.</LI>
<LI>Low-quality evidence shows no differences between interventions that include components of functional task training and interventions that do not include components of functional task training. No evidence suggests that any specific functional task training components are more effective than other interventions.</LI>
<LI>Low-quality evidence shows no differences between interventions that include musculoskeletal components and interventions that do not include musculoskeletal components. No evidence suggests that any specific musculoskeletal components are more effective than other interventions.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In summary, evidence suggests that no one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective in promoting recovery of function or mobility after stroke than any other approach. These findings are supported by the subgroup analyses carried out for the comparisons of intervention versus no treatment or usual care, which found no significant effects of different treatment components or categories of intervention.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Physical rehabilitation approaches and components synthesised within this review</HEADING>
<P>This review synthesises evidence relating to the effectiveness of different physical rehabilitation approaches. The original focus of the comparisons within this review (2007 and earlier versions) was the effectiveness of different named approaches to physiotherapy, based on a historical perspective. The original review was carried out in direct response to a consultation exercise conducted in Scotland that aimed to identify the 'burning questions' of Scottish stroke rehabilitation workers, and that identified 'different (named) treatment approaches' to be amongst the most important questions posed by physiotherapists (<LINK REF="REF-Legg-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legg 2000</LINK>). Following consultation with key stakeholders (physiotherapists, stroke survivors and carers), the focus for this update of the review was determined to be the individual treatment components that constitute physical rehabilitation approaches. This is an important, albeit arguably subtle, shift, enabling synthesis of evidence based on different philosophies and from different cultures, with systematic categorisation of individual treatment components, regardless of their philosophical or theoretical origin. This change in focus is in line with recommendations made within the 2007 version of this review.</P>
<P>The studies within this review included 121 active interventions; most of these (99 interventions) included treatment components categorised as functional task training. Most of the interventions incorporated treatment components from at least two different categories of intervention, with only 33 interventions focusing on just one category of intervention (20 interventions focused on functional task training only; 13 focused on neurophysiological interventions only). The finding that most studies include a combination of different treatment components, generally arising from at least two of the different categories defined for this review, highlights this fact: Physiotherapists appear to be basing their interventions not on one single historical or philosophical approach, but rather on a pragmatic eclectic approach that utilises a range of different treatment components, often regardless of their historical or philosophical origins. This pragmatic approach, which adopts a mix of components from different approaches, was supported by the previous version of this review, which concluded that a mix of components from different approaches was significantly more effective than no treatment or placebo in recovery of functional independence following stroke, and provides justification for the decision to change the focus of the review for this update.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Identification of relevant trials</HEADING>
<P>The identification of all relevant trials was confounded by several factors.<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Inconsistent and poorly defined terminology: Electronic searching was difficult because the names given to different physiotherapy rehabilitation approaches are poorly documented, often have several derivations and have varied over time. Furthermore, the interventions were not always described as 'physiotherapy' or 'physical therapy,' but sometimes were described as 'rehabilitation,' 'training' or 'exercise.' This was particularly true for studies emerging from China, which frequently described interventions as 'early rehabilitation.' Studies investigating circuit training or exercise classes sometimes met the inclusion criteria for this review; again, identification of these was made difficult by lack of use of the term 'physiotherapy' or 'physical therapy.'</LI>
<LI>Change in focus of the review: As described above, for this update of the review, a subtle change in focus was applied&#8212;from 'named' rehabilitation approaches to the individual treatment components that constitute physical rehabilitation approaches. No change to the search strategy or to selection criteria was implemented, and we do not believe that any changes would be justified. It could be argued that decisions made relating to the exclusion of studies from the search results for previous versions of this review may be different in light of the changed focus. However, selection of relevant trials for this review has always been challenging, and we do not believe that the change in focus of the review has affected study selection in one direction or another.</LI>
<LI>Lack of detail within the abstracts: Lack of information on study methods, participants and interventions potentially increases the chance that a relevant trial may be excluded. However, when uncertainty arose, we obtained full papers.</LI>
<LI>Material published in journals not included in electronic databases, and unpublished material: Although substantial effort was made to identify unpublished material and material in journals not cited in the databases searched, relevant trials may not have been identified.</LI>
<LI>Material published in Chinese: A substantial number of the included studies were carried out in China and were published in Chinese. Our electronic searching successfully identified studies for which an abstract was available in Chinese, as well as a number of studies based on English titles. However, we believe it is likely that we will not have identified all relevant Chinese trials, in particular those for which only English titles were available and those not published in journals included in the electronic databases that we searched.</LI>
<LI>Different cultures and healthcare systems: Decisions were made to include some studies in which the provider of the intervention was not clearly a physiotherapist or a physical therapist; these decisions were often related to the fact that physiotherapists may not be routinely found in all healthcare settings around the world. This provided additional challenges in relation to determining whether a study was investigating a 'physical rehabilitation' approach. In particular, many studies in China simply referred to a 'therapist,' but in some instances, the provider was a doctor or a nurse. We carried out subgroup analyses to explore the effect of the stated intervention provider on outcome. However, many studies did not explicitly state this, which limited conclusions that could be made from this subgroup analysis.</LI>
</OL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness of published studies</HEADING>
<P>Many of the relevant trials that we included were published only as abstracts or as brief reports. This was frequently the case for studies published in Chinese, for which published versions were often less than two pages long. Although we contacted study authors, when possible, to confirm study eligibility, we did not have the time or resources to contact all study authors for further information on trial design or study results. Thus, in general the completeness of study information is low, resulting in a high number of studies for which risk of bias is classed as 'unclear' and a high number of studies that do not contribute data to the analyses.</P>
<P>Relatively few studies followed up with participants after the intervention had ended: Data were available immediately at the end of intervention for 49 studies for the independence in ADL outcome and for 50 studies for the motor function outcome, but only for 16 and 12 studies, respectively, for a longer-term follow-up outcome. Follow-up data from studies comparing intervention with no treatment demonstrate that significant benefit of intervention is maintained, but the size of the benefit was observed to lessen. In the comparison of intervention versus usual care or control, lack of follow-up data limits the ability of review authors to draw any generalisable conclusions relating to whether observed benefits are maintained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Descriptions of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Clear, concise documentation of complex physical interventions is exceptionally difficult to achieve. The written information provided by study authors regarding interventions administered in the included trials is included in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Although many of the included studies attempt to describe all administered interventions, the available documentation is often insufficient to allow confident and accurate repetition of the applied rehabilitation approach. Problems with documentation of interventions generally are not the fault of researchers or therapists, but rather are due to the fundamental problem of recording methods of physical handling skills and techniques, and the nature of the often intimate relationship between stroke survivor and physiotherapist. Documentation of this process would generally be complex and 'wordy'; therefore often it is not possible to present within research papers with limitations on length. These problems are confounded by the fact that treatments applied are often ultimately the decision of a single physiotherapist, based on an individual assessment of a unique stroke survivor's movement disorders.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the common basis of physical rehabilitation 'approaches' is that they are holistic. All body parts and movements can be assessed and treated based on the selected approach; however, a physiotherapist may select to concentrate on the treatment of one particular body part or movement during a treatment session. Subsequently, treatments given to specific stroke survivors by individual therapists may vary enormously. This review attempted to limit this variation slightly by excluding trials that had provided interventions only to the upper limb. Nevertheless, although we grouped together studies that included treatment components within similar categories, it is conceivable that substantial differences exist between the physical interventions given to participants within the same treatment group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Categorisation of treatment components within interventions</HEADING>
<P>The comparisons carried out within the review relied on categorisation of treatment components that were described within the published papers. Two independent review authors categorised the described treatments using agreed definitions of individual treatment components. This process relied on adequate descriptions within published papers. Papers that published only very brief descriptions of interventions therefore may have resulted in categorisations that were not truly reflective of the intervention delivered.</P>
<P>Furthermore, this process of categorisation was highly dependent on the language and terminology provided within a written description. For example, an author may state "activities aimed at improved gait." This description would result in categorisation only within the functional task training component of "walking." However, in practice, this intervention could have included components such as active or active-assisted movement, sensorimotor facilitation and muscle strengthening. Therefore our method of categorisation is likely to have underestimated rather than overestimated the numbers of treatment components and intervention categories. Hence, if any inaccuracy exists, the interventions are likely to be more "mixed" and eclectic than has been captured by our method of categorisation.</P>
<P>A number of difficulties were encountered in distinguishing between interventions that included only functional task training components and those that also included musculoskeletal (active) components. In particular, the review authors encountered difficulties in determining whether an intervention focused on a functional task might also include active or active-assisted movement. This reality was due to the fact that all functional task training necessitates active movement, and overlap between practice of an active-movement and practice of a functional task can be inevitable. This is an area that we recommend for further exploration in relation to the descriptions and definitions of treatment components proposed for this review.</P>
<P>Discussion also focused on whether the categories of 'assistive devices' and 'modalities' would be better combined into one joint category. The separate categories were agreed and defined by the stakeholder group participants, which is why they have been used within this review. However, we recommend that merging of these categories be explored before future updates of this review are prepared.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Treatment components within named approaches</HEADING>
<P>We were aware when developing the definitions for categorisation of described interventions that a number of studies have stated a named approach (e.g. 'Bobath,' 'Motor-relearning programme') without providing any description of the treatment components included within the approach. We therefore wrote definitions such that these studies could be captured by our system of categorisation of individual treatment components. However, including studies that have provided only the name of an approach without providing any descriptions potentially introduces a number of biases. These biases occur as a result of the fact that the content of named approaches potentially changes over time and in keeping with geographical or personal preferences and biases. In particular, several studies reported that the intervention was 'Bobath,' and much debate has surrounded the content of physiotherapy interventions based on the Bobath concept. This debate arises largely from the fact that the content of the Bobath approach has changed over time, published descriptions are limited, and the content of current therapy is variable (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DeJong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeJong 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhammer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhammer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayston 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nilsson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nilsson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1995</LINK>). A summary of the philosophy or theory of some of the key named approaches was drawn up for the first version of this review and is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Translation of descriptions of interventions</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-eight of the included full papers were published in languages other than English; all were published in Chinese. For these papers, we sought translation of the intervention description into English. In addition, several included studies were carried out in China and the papers published in English, but by authors for whom English clearly was not the first language. These translations provided a number of challenges in relation to interpretation of meanings and subsequent classification of treatment components. For example, in several papers, it was unclear whether 'standing up training' referred to activities carried out in standing (i.e. training to promote standing balance) or to sit-to-stand training. In these cases, decisions were made based on discussion between two review authors (one of whom was a Chinese-speaking physiotherapist (PLC)).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Geographical location of studies</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analyses found evidence of an association between effect size and geographical location, with an indication that studies carried out in China may have a greater effect size. This finding may be due to reporting biases and may reflect biases associated with publication, location, citation and language. This finding may also reflect a true difference in the effects of interventions carried out in different geographical locations, which may be a result of differences in culture, traditions, training and implementation of interventions. However, this difference may also be related to the comparison interventions, especially if they consist of no treatment or usual care. All studies that compared intervention against no treatment in the acute phase of stroke were carried out in China; this is a reflection of the fact that 'usual care' can comprise no rehabilitation within these geographical settings. Consequently, the finding that intervention is more effective than no treatment in improving independence in ADL and in motor function may, arguably, be applicable only to settings in China. Evidence shows that usual care can vary considerably, both regionally and nationally as well as internationally. Hence, geographical location could be a confounding variable in the comparison of intervention against usual care.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Risk of bias of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Judgement of quality of evidence was very difficult because of poor, incomplete or brief reporting of information. Less than 50% of the studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for selection, detection and attrition bias; however, for most of the studies, this information was unclear, and risk of bias was judged to be high in less than 10% of the studies. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore the effect of including studies with high or unclear risk of bias. These sensitivity analyses generally found that removal of studies with high or unclear risk of bias did not alter the direction (or significance) of the results. Thus, although the quality of most of the evidence included in this review remains uncertain, the fact that inclusion of these studies does not affect the direction of results gives us greater confidence in our findings. The main message arising from this review in relation to quality of the evidence is that it is essential that reporting of methodological features of RCTs of physiotherapy interventions is improved, and that studies are reported using the CONSORT guidelines for reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies that used quasi-random assignment were excluded from this update of the review (previous versions had included quasi-randomised trials). This led to exclusion of three studies that had been included in the 2007 version (<LINK REF="STD-Hesse-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hesse 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozdemir-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ozdemir 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stern-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Stern 1970</LINK>). However, we found information about the method of randomisation particularly difficult to judge in a number of studies included in this review, particularly studies published in Chinese, in which use of the term 'random' in English abstracts did not always reflect the descriptions provided in Chinese versions of the study. There is an urgent need for trialists to address the issue of adequate reporting of methods of randomisation. It is possible that we have inadvertently included in this review trials that used quasi-random assignment, rather than true random assignment.</P>
<P>In most studies, it was unclear whether participants were blinded to the study group and aims. The nature of rehabilitation interventions and the ethical requirement to obtain informed consent often make it difficult, if not impossible, to blind participants. If the aims and objectives of the study were apparent to the participants, this could confound the study results. It is generally impossible to blind the treating therapist because treating therapists have to be familiar with the intervention they are administering. Therapists who strongly favoured one approach over another could introduce performance bias. In several studies, the same therapist administered treatment to participants in both study groups; this potentially introduced considerable contamination between groups. The 'beliefs' of stroke survivors and therapists may further contribute to biases within many of these studies, and the large number of different geographical locations in which studies were carried out means that the studies were carried out with participants living in a wide variety of cultures, which could potentially impact the response to physical rehabilitation. Many of the included trials did not state that they used a blinded assessor. Lack of blinding of assessors potentially introduces considerable bias into the study results. This is particularly important in studies in which therapists often have strong beliefs in support of a particular approach.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Heterogeneity of included trials</HEADING>
<P>In addition to limitations of the study methods, the trials included in the review had considerable heterogeneity. The key areas of heterogeneity were related to interventions and to participants.<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Interventions: Although attempts have been made to categorise the interventions using a systematic, rigorous and valid method, considerable variation may still exist between studies that have used similar types of treatment components. Furthermore, substantial variations in dose and intensity and in length of the treatment period were noted. Also different is the fact that some interventions were carried out only when a therapist is present, whilst in other studies, independent practice of activities outside therapy sessions was encouraged.</LI>
<LI>Participants: The participant populations in the different included studies were heterogeneous. They varied from limited populations (e.g. pure motor stroke only) to those inclusive of all stroke survivors. Considerable variation in the time since stroke was also noted. The validity of combining results from such heterogeneous samples is debatable. We recommend that future updates consider subgroup analysis to explore the initial impairment of included participants.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Although we have carried out subgroup analyses to explore issues relating to the heterogeneity of both the interventions (i.e. dose, components) and the participants (time since stroke) and other issues (geographical location, provider of intervention), it is likely that a complex interrelationship exists between some of the subgroups that we have been unable to explore. For example, studies carried out in China tended to be those with the least time since stroke, meaning that effects found that have been attributed to geographical location could be due equally to time since stroke (and vice versa). We believe that this will be true for a number of other variables. We recommend that future updates of this review plan to explore issues associated with the interrelationship of these variables.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>As has been discussed above, the identification of all relevant trials was confounded by a number of factors, and, despite a rigorous search strategy, we are not fully confident that we will have successfully identified all studies. Consequently, this review may be biased towards particular types of studies and publications. For example, we are not confident that we will have successfully identified all relevant studies published in China, or in Chinese. Similarly, we may be missing other non-English studies or studies published in journals that are not included in the electronic databases that we searched.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Treatment components and categorisation of interventions</HEADING>
<P>We introduced a method of categorisation of interventions that was agreed by a stakeholder group of physiotherapists, stroke survivors and carers. This method of categorisation has not been tested or explored further, and such testing is necessary to confirm the relevance and validity of the identified categories. In the absence of any other suitable method of categorisation of treatment components, we believe that we have adopted a robust, justifiable method&#8212;based on consensus between physiotherapists, stroke survivors and carers. We argue that the involvement of this expert stakeholder group has considerably enhanced our review and is substantially advantageous compared with the alternative of having researchers make decisions over the categorisation of interventions and the structure of comparisons. Feedback from the stakeholder group members confirms that the group perceived that their input benefited the format of the review and made the review more clinically relevant. However, because of the limited nature of our resources, most members of the stakeholder group were based in Scotland. Given known differences in physiotherapy practice in different parts of the world, we recommend that the proposed categorises are explored and amended to reflect international practices in relation to stroke rehabilitation.</P>
<P>We recognise that the terminology used, particularly in the titles of the categories, may not be universally accepted or understood. We acknowledge that the appropriateness of terms such as 'functional,' 'neurophysiological' and 'musculoskeletal' can be debated when used in the way we have used them within this review. However, these terms were selected by the stakeholder group to have clinical meaning and were informed by the terminology used by <LINK REF="REF-DeJong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeJong 2004</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Appraisal of quality in non&#8211;English language papers</HEADING>
<P>Non-English (Chinese) papers included in the review were appraised and assessed for risk of bias by one review author with the language skills to translate relevant sections of the papers. This review author also possessed the necessary quality appraisal skills and had detailed expertise of physiotherapy and stroke rehabilitation. A second review author then considered the assessment of risk of bias by the first review author, based on the translations of relevant extracts provided by the first review author. Thus, although two review authors did consider the quality of these non&#8211;English language papers, the assessment of the second review author was based entirely on the translation provided by the first review author. This method means that if the first review author made any errors in translation, or missed information provided in the non-English text, the second review author will not have identified this. Thus, although having two review authors for these papers offers advantages, it does not provide the same level of 'independence' as the process of having two independent review authors for the English language papers. However, given the volume of non-English papers that we have included, and the available resources for this review, we believe that we have taken all steps available to us to minimise potential biases in this process.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Conclusions arising from this review</HEADING>
<P>Following completion of the analyses and results of this review, this information was presented to our stakeholder group, which comprised physiotherapists, stroke survivors and carers. For each of the three main comparisons and associated subgroup analyses, group members discussed the clinical implications and key messages arising from the results. The points discussed have been incorporated within the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CONCLUSIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Authors' conclusions</LINK> sections of this review. In particular, the stakeholder group members highlighted the need to specifically draw out information pertaining to the dose of interventions delivered within the studies, as this was believed to have important implications for clinical practice. We believe that this process of consultation considerably removes potential biases from the process of reaching conclusions from this review, as the conclusions reflect the views of expert clinicians, stroke survivors and carers, rather than the potentially biased viewpoints of researchers and academics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Previous versions of this review</HEADING>
<P>The previous (2007) version of this review concluded that "no one physiotherapy approach has been shown to be more advantageous to the promotion of recovery of lower limb function or postural control" and that "physiotherapy using a mix of components from different approaches is more beneficial than no treatment or placebo control for the recovery of functional independence after stroke." These findings supported the conclusion that "this evidence provides a sound scientific rationale for physiotherapists to use a selection of treatments, regardless of their philosophical or theoretical origin." This updated review agrees with, and adds considerable evidence to, these previous conclusions. Although the 2007 version concluded that evidence was insufficient to suggest that one approach was superior to another, this review can now conclude that moderate-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference between approaches.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other reviews</HEADING>
<P>A number of other published reviews agree with the conclusion that physiotherapists should not use compartmentalised, named approaches, but should select clearly defined and described techniques and task-specific treatments, regardless of their historical or philosophical origin (<LINK REF="REF-Kollen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhammer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhammer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayston 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomeroy-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomeroy 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is in agreement with a review of evidence relating specifically to the Bobath approach (<LINK REF="REF-Kollen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kollen 2009</LINK>), which concluded that there was "no evidence for the superiority of Bobath therapy or any other approach on sensorimotor control of the upper and lower limb, dexterity, mobility, ADL, HRQOL, and cost-effectiveness."</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK> recently completed a review that has similarities to our comparison of physiotherapy treatment versus no treatment. <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK> aimed specifically to review RCTs that compared rehabilitation versus standard care after stroke in China. This review pooled evidence from 31 trials (5220 participants) that reported independence in ADL (Barthel Index) and 27 trials (4501 participants) that reported motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment). In contrast, we identified and pooled the results of 27 studies (3423 participants) and 25 studies (4558 participants), respectively. (NB: Our figures also include non-Chinese studies.) We are unclear whether the differences in included trials reflected a more effective strategy for identification of Chinese studies by <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>; differences in selection criteria between reviews or a combination of these. Before future updates of our review, we plan to speak to the authors of <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK> to discuss differences in identification and selection of trials between the reviews. Despite differences in the numbers of trials included, the results and conclusions of our review were in agreement with those of <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK>, which concluded that "there is some evidence that rehabilitation post stroke is more effective than no rehabilitation, improving activities of daily living and reducing disability." Both <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2013</LINK> and our review highlight the limitations relating to low reporting quality and study heterogeneity.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Physical rehabilitation, using a mix of components from different approaches, is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Evidence relating to dose of physical rehabilitation is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions. However, there is some suggestion that treatment sessions of 30 to 60 minutes five to seven days a week may provide a beneficial effect, and more frequent sessions may provide added benefit. Evidence also suggests greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke. These hypotheses require robust evaluation before clinical recommendations can be made.</P>
<P>Current evidence indicates that no one approach to physical rehabilitation is more (or less) effective in promoting recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Therefore, clinical selection of the most appropriate physical treatments for individual stroke survivors should be undertaken using evidenced-based interventions and critical clinical reasoning. Members of the stakeholder group for this review agreed that key implications for practice arising from this evidence related to meeting the need for personnel involved in delivering stroke rehabilitation and educating therapists to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>select treatment components based on assessment of the individual stroke survivor, with consideration of the full range of treatment techniques that they have the skills and expertise to administer; and</LI>
<LI>implement evidence-based rehabilitation after stroke, with critical evaluation and awareness that the current evidence shows that no one approach is superior to any other.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In conclusion, this review provides evidence indicating that physical rehabilitation should not be limited to compartmentalised, named rehabilitation approaches, but should comprise clearly defined, well-described, evidence-based physical treatments regardless of historical or philosophical origin.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-08 13:35:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence now shows that physiotherapy using a mix of components from different approaches is more beneficial than no treatment, usual care or attention control, and that no single approach is more (or less) effective than any other. Researchers should add to this body of evidence by determining which individual treatment components contribute towards the beneficial effects. High-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are needed to determine the effectiveness of clearly described individual techniques and task-specific treatments, regardless of their historical or philosophical origin. Many Cochrane reviews have already been published that include a large body of trials exploring the effectiveness of specific single treatments, and it is important that researchers are familiar with this evidence and plan future research according to relevant recommendations within these reviews. Researchers should identify whether there are any gaps in this evidence base so that these can be addressed. It is important that the current Cochrane reviews are kept up-to-date. With a high volume of research being published in the Chinese literature, systematic reviewers must ensure that they have adequate resources to support review updates and to adequately address and explore the potential variations in clinical practice and trial design in studies arising from different geographical locations.</P>
<P>In addition to research evaluating single specific treatments, we recommend that researchers adopt pragmatic research designs to investigate the effectiveness of skilled physiotherapists in providing patient-centred interventions, for which treatment components are selected following individual patient assessment. Valid, reliable methods of systematic documentation and description of patient-centred physical rehabilitation must be explored, such that robust RCTs and systematic reviews are supported. We recommend evaluation and exploration of the classifications and definitions of treatment components used within this review, before future updates of this review are undertaken. Furthermore, we recommend that future research explores physical rehabilitation in relation to, and in combination with, other evidence-based non-physical interventions, such as medical and drug interventions (e.g. thrombolysis, Traditional Chinese Medicine, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)). Studies emerging from China have demonstrated the ability to include relatively large numbers of participants, and lessons should be learnt from these large clinical trials.</P>
<P>This review synthesises the evidence in relation to function and mobility after stroke. Research is needed to consider the full range of outcomes that may be associated with improved function and mobility. These outcomes include the clinical and cost benefits potentially associated with a reduction in falls or emergency hospital admissions, and the impact of community and social care teams and services. All benefits in relation to stroke survivor&#8211;perceived quality of life, psychological mood, social participation, return to work and carer strain and well-being should be considered. This review found that many RCTs did not assess long-term follow-up, and it is essential that future RCTs plan follow-up assessments as a key feature of their design. Adequate resources should be sought to ensure that follow-up assessments are possible. The observed reduction in effect size in the available follow-up data supports research that explores additional or longer-term physiotherapy or both. Furthermore, future research should consider the long-term benefits of physical rehabilitation interventions and should explore the effects of follow-up physiotherapy assessment, self-management and treatment in maintaining benefits and preventing deterioration. Self-referral systems that will enable stroke survivors to gain follow-up physiotherapy when they believe it is necessary should also be explored.</P>
<P>Improvement in the reporting of RCTs of physical rehabilitation interventions is urgently needed, and we urge researchers to follow the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). A wide variety of outcome measures are used to assess the effects of physical rehabilitation, and we recommend research that leads to consensus and standardisation of some core outcome measures for use within future RCTs. We urge researchers to follow the guidance offered by the <LINK REF="REF-COMET-Initiative" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMET Initiative</LINK> relating to the development and reporting of core outcomes.</P>
<P>A stakeholder group was central to this review update, and this update has demonstrated that user involvement in Cochrane reviews is feasible and valued and can significantly impact the review structure and methods. We recommend similar models of user involvement within other Cochrane reviews and evidence syntheses.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Stakeholder group</HEADING>
<P>The stakeholder group was formed specifically to support the current update of this review. The broad aims of the group were to (1) ensure that the review was clinically relevant; (2) reach consensus on decisions surrounding the incorporation of Chinese studies into the previous Western classification of rehabilitation approaches and (3) guide dissemination to ensure that the updated review impacts on practice. The stakeholder group met for three half-days throughout the period of this review update and responded to email requests in addition to this. The input of the stakeholder group was highly valuable and had considerable impact on this review update, in particular, regarding (1) decisions around updating the way of classifying rehabilitation approaches, and incorporating non-Western approaches, within the review, (2) development of the classification system and definitions of individual treatment components, (3) selection of items for subgroup analysis and (4) interpretation of the results and assessment of implications for clinical practice and future research.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Title</HEADING>
<P>For the protocol and for versions of the review published in 2007 and earlier, the title of this review was 'Physiotherapy treatment approaches for the recovery of postural control and lower limb function following stroke.' For the 2013 version of this review, the title was changed to 'Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke.' We made this change to reflect the more international perspective of this review update and the fact that 'physiotherapy' is not a universally adopted term, and to more accurately reflect the primary and secondary outcomes of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Objectives</HEADING>
<P>The objectives within the protocol and versions published in 2007 and earlier were focused on "the recovery of postural control and lower limb function." In this update, this has been amended to read "the recovery of function and mobility." This difference relates only to the terminology used, not to the selection of primary or secondary outcomes within the review.</P>
<P>The reason for originally highlighting the focus on postural control and lower limb function was specifically to highlight that this review excluded studies related to upper limb interventions and recovery only. However, feedback from stakeholder group members indicated that the original objectives were perceived to be misleading, as they did not incorporate the primary outcomes, which were measures of disability, and prestated relevant measures of disability such as (1) independence in ADL scales*; or (2) motor function scales.* The stakeholder group reached consensus that the phrase "function and mobility" was more correct and appropriate to reflect the focus of this review within the stated objective (and title).</P>
<P>The original protocol stated a number of hypotheses. These have been removed from this update. (Original text: "Hypotheses to be tested: (1) physiotherapy treatment based on neurophysiological principles results in better recovery of postural control and lower limb function than treatment based on motor learning principles, orthopaedic principles or a mixture of treatment principles in patients with stroke; and (2) physiotherapy treatment based on motor learning principles results in better recovery of postural control and lower limb function than treatment based on orthopaedic principles, or on a mixture of treatment principles in patients with stroke.")</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">* Names of measures of disability</HEADING>
<P>In the protocol and in previous versions of the review, the primary outcome of measures of disability was divided into two prestated subcategories of:</P>
<OL>
<LI>global dependency scales (including Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Modified Rankin Scale, Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, Rehabilitation Activities Profile); and</LI>
<LI>functional independence scales (including Motor Assessment Scale (MAS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (lower limb section); Rivermead Mobility Index; Rivermead Motor Assessment).</LI>
</OL>
<P>For this update, we changed the names of each of these two subcategories (but not the content) because we considered that the original names were now potentially confusing, as other terms are more usually used in published research. The replacement names are (1) independence in ADL and (2) motor function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The protocol defined secondary outcomes as measures of motor impairment, classifying them as measures of:</P>
<OL>
<LI>postural control and balance;</LI>
<LI>voluntary movement (including movement associated with gait);</LI>
<LI>tone or spasticity;</LI>
<LI>range of movement; and</LI>
<LI>strength.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The protocol also identified participation (handicap or quality of life) as an outcome of relevance to this review.</P>
<P>For the 2007 version of the review, the review authors documented and extracted descriptions and data from any outcomes falling into the groupings stated in the protocol. Based on the prestated groups of relevant outcomes and the availability of data from specific measures in the included trials, we discussed and reached consensus on which outcome measures should be included in the analysis. For this 2013 version of the review, the secondary outcomes remained the same as the outcomes analysed for the 2007 version (i.e. secondary outcomes).</P>
<OL>
<LI>Balance (Berg Balance Scale).</LI>
<LI>Gait velocity.</LI>
<LI>Length of stay.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the protocol and in previous versions of this review, we carried out analysis only on outcomes reported immediately after the end of the intervention. In this 2013 version, we have carried out analyses on both outcomes reported immediately after the end of the intervention and on follow-up outcomes.</P>

Treatment strategies were individualized and aimed at both reducing the severity of impairments where they impacted on function, and optimizing postural and movement strategies to improve efficiency and maximize function"</P>
<P>"The specific goal of therapy in this study was to improve the ability of the participant to walk safely in different environments, including components of endurance, walking on slopes, going up and down a single step and walking over rough ground. The session incorporated structured task practice (as described in intervention B) for 1/6 of the treatment time allocated"</P>

<P>Length of intervention period: two weeks</P>
<P>Number of sessions and length of individual sessions: "Participants in both groups received six one hour physiotherapy sessions over a two-week period. During the intervention period, participants did not receive any other physiotherapy aimed at improving mobility, posture, balance or lower limb function. Instead, the intervention sessions replaced the usual physiotherapy treatment for mobility. Additional physiotherapy was provided in sitting or lying for other rehabilitation goals, such as independence in bed mobility and recovery of upper limb function"</P>
<P>Intervention provider: "Both interventions were performed by physiotherapists with at least five years&#8217; postgraduate experience and at least two years&#8217; experience in the fields of rehabilitation or neurology. In addition, therapists providing Intervention A had to have also completed a Basic Bobath Course and at least two Advanced Bobath Courses (a minimum of 180 hours of formal training acquired over a minimum of three years)"</P>
<P>(2) Task practice intervention (n = 14)</P>
<P>"Participants receiving Intervention B undertook physiotherapy based on structured task practice. The supervised exercise programme aimed to provide repeated task specific practice of environmental contexts frequently encountered in walking outdoors. The tasks practised focused on increasing endurance, walking on slopes, going up and down a single step and walking over rough ground. Based on principles of motor learning, the therapist provided instruction in how to perform the task, including demonstration, verbal cueing to correct ineffective adaptive motor patterns and feedback on the performance of the task as specified by the study protocol, as well as supervision for safety. The therapist did not provide hands-on assistance or guidance during tasks. Half of the task practice component was conducted as repetitive practice using standardized equipment in the gymnasium, reflecting the closed skill stage of learning. The other half of the time was spent in environments outside the gymnasium, walking on varying surfaces indoors and outdoors, bringing in other environmental contexts, such as differing attentional demands and changes in direction"</P>

<P>Method of randomisation: "Random assignment of patients into the sequential function-based motor relearning group and the conventional therapy (control) group was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved arranging patients into a block of six participants and then forming the six into pairs by matching their age and gender; then, if possible, they were matched according to the level of intensity of physiotherapy and speech therapy received in the hospital. Patients who did not form a best-matched pair were automatically entered into the next block for further matching and randomization. The patients were excluded from the study if their characteristics were not matched by the end of the second round.

<P>"In the motor relearning programme, the intervention technique followed four sequential steps: identification of the missing performance components (step 1), training using remedial exercises (step 2), training using functional task components (step 3), and transfer of skills to functional task performance (step 4). A total of 24 remedial tasks (used in step 2) and 10 functional tasks (used in step 4) were designed to cover deficits in static and dynamic sitting balance, and static and dynamic standing balance. Throughout the training session, the therapist stressed the importance of relating the training processes taking place in steps 2 and 3 to practices in step 4. The training progressed by advancing from a sitting to a standing position, and from static to dynamic balancing.

Active ranging exercises had to obey: (i) Active ranging exercises performed on the foundation of passive ranging exercises, in order not to induce tiredness and pain; (ii) Among the exercises, more practice done for relaxation of tensed muscles; (iii) First simple movements, then complicated movements; (iv) During practice, same actions done for non-affected limbs, to aid in recovery of function of paralysed limbs. During the process of active ranging exercise, coordination practice must be emphasised, to gradually improve level of coordination through a long period of training. From individual joints, and uni-directional simple exercises to complex coordinated movements, movement complexity and precision [were] gradually increased; starting from exercises symmetrical to both sides of body; during gait training, initial requirement was for gait to be stable, accurate and natural, and afterwards practised walking forwards in a straight line and crossing obstacles etc. Repeated practice of a single movement, in order to develop the biological foundation of a habit, and form a new neural pathway"</P>

<P>"Both groups received conventional therapy and nursing care in the Department of Neurology"</P>
<P>"The intervention group were also given ADL system intervention. The team looking after the intervention group comprised therapists and rehabilitation nurses. The therapists used Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery to deliver the intervention training, the rehabilitation nurses provided guidance on patient self-care, based on the assessment of patient self-care needs and self-care ability, through 3 care systems, using the methods of full substitution, guidance, encouragement and provision of environment and education to improve the patients&#8217; ADL ability"</P>
<P>"ADL system intervention content:</P>
<P>(a) Acute phase (flaccid paralysis phase):</P>
<P>The aim of training is to prevent disuse, prevent possible complications so as to create the conditions for initial training. Initial bedside activities for ADL training include: maintaining positions which prevent spasms; changing body positions; passive ranging exercises through normal joint ranges of motion; passive massages; active bed training: mainly focused on training of truncal muscles, including bridging exercises, leg exercises, hip exercises, self-assisted upper limb extensor exercises, shoulder exercises, rolling to both sides, sitting up from non-affected and affected sides etc.</P>
<P>(b) Early recovery phase (spastic phase):</P>
<P>The aim of training is to reduce muscle tension, resolve spasticity and exercise in isolated movements, detailed content includes: sitting balance training at levels 1, 2, 3; sit-stand training; sitting knee and ankle dorsiflexion exercises; standing balance training at levels 1, 2, 3; supported and assisted stepping exercises</P>
<P>(c) Middle and late recovery phase (equivalent to recovery phase):</P>
<P>When spasms are more or less under control, the aim of training is to generate fine, co-ordinate, quick random movements. Detailed content includes: continuation of gait re-education and postural correction, so as to allow further improvement of body function; upper limb and hand isolated movement training"</P>

<P>(1) Treated group (n = 42)</P>
<P>"Therapists delivering the rehabilitative treatment all underwent the same training. For acute stroke patients, up to one month after stroke, the first phase of treatment was undertaken, mainly carried out in the Department of Neurology ward, and while given conventional medical treatment, these patients were given early bedside rehabilitative treatment after becoming medically stable, focusing on physiotherapy, with rehabilitative treatment commencing within 1 week after patients were medically stable; for subacute stroke patients, the second (beyond 1 to 3 months after stroke) and third phase (beyond 3 to 6 months after stroke) of treatment [were] undertaken, and based on the patient&#8217;s condition and level of functional recovery, patients were transferred to rehabilitation ward/centre for further rehabilitation, or discharged home, where a therapist would conduct home visits to guide the patient, and help the patient conduct necessary functional training, until the end of follow-up. Here, &#8216;stage one rehabilitation' referred to the patient&#8217;s early conventional medicine treatment at the hospital&#8217;s emergency or Department of Neurology ward, as well as early stage rehabilitative treatment, 'stage two rehabilitation' referred to the patient&#8217;s rehabilitative treatment at the rehabilitation ward/centre, 'stage three rehabilitation' referred to the continuation of rehabilitative treatment at the community or home setting.</P>
<P>The rehabilitative treatment method combined physiotherapy and occupational therapy into a holistic method: early stage of treatment was focused on physiotherapy, progressing to occupational therapy. Physiotherapy treatment included: (1) supine and sitting positions to combat spasticity; (2) passive ranging exercise of all affected limb joints, including mobilisation of the shoulder girdle, starting from small to large ranges of motion, to avoid causing pain to the patient; (3) rolling practice (from affected and non-affected sides); (4) bridging exercises; (5) exercises in ankle dorsiflexion and wrist extension; (6) outwith therapy time, sitting practice: headrest of bed lifted to 30 degrees, and, if participant could tolerate the angle for longer than 30 minutes, the angle was increased by another 10 degrees the following day, until participant could tolerate 90 degrees for longer than 30 minutes, which would then be followed by lying-to-sitting up training (from non-affected and affected sides); (7) sitting balance training (sitting on edge of bed); (8) sit-to-stand training; (9) standing balance training; (10) gait training, etc. During the flaccid phase, focus was on postural correction, passive activities and active/passive practice, rolling, lying-to-sitting on edge of bed. During the spasticity phase, focus was on relaxation practice for spastic muscles, antispasticity manual techniques and muscle training for non-spastic muscles, as well as practising exercises in isolated movements. Occupational therapy treatment was based largely on the participant's functional ability at each stage; the appropriate intervention would be given, namely, feeding, grooming, donning, bed-to-wheelchair and wheelchair-to-bed transfer and other ADLs, as well as practice of woodwork, sewing and other handicrafts and ring-insertion games, jigsaws and other leisure activities.</P>
<P>Stage one rehabilitation included antispasticity positioning, passive training of limbs, active training of non-affected limbs under guidance and deep breathing, as well as training of abdominal muscles, sitting up from lying, sitting balance and standing up training, etc, to train the participant's ability to get up from the bed (treatment was done), one/d, 45 minutes/session, five/wk, during the training period, the participant's family or nursing workers were taught the correct supplementary exercises and methods of care concurrently, to achieve partial training out with therapy times, while reducing the damage to affected limbs due to inappropriate nursing care; stage two rehabilitation mainly consisted of standing training, standing balance, single-leg standing, gait training and up-and-down stair training etc, to train the participant's ability to ambulate (treatment was done) 2x/day, 30-45 minutes/session, 5x/week; stage three rehabilitation mainly consisted of feeding, donning, grooming, personal hygiene management and other ADL ability training (treatment was done) 2x/day, 30-45 minutes/session, five to seven days/wk. Stage one early rehabilitation and stage two rehabilitation within rehabilitation ward/centre were delivered by therapists, while concurrently teaching participant's family or nursing workers how to assist the participant in training; during stage three community rehabilitation, therapists conducted fortnightly home visits, and while delivering occupational therapy and necessary physiotherapy, also taught the participant's family or nursing workers how to help the participant train, leaving them to assist the participant in completing the remaining daily necessary training."</P>

<P>(1) Rehabilitation group (n = 25)</P>
<P>"Both groups received routine treatment (such as medicine). For the participants in the treatment group, exercise therapy combined Bobath, Rood, Motor Relearning Program and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques; in terms of electrotherapy, early use of electrical stimulation, acupuncture is carried out, with additional appropriate electrical stimulation for participants with shoulder-hand syndrome. Recovery of each motor function was targeted by using sequential and progressive therapy, using the following methods: (i) correct positioning: teaching patient&#8217;s family and caregivers the correct limb positioning of limbs in supine position, lateral position with affected limbs at lower side and healthy limbs at upper side, and lateral position with affected limbs at upper side and healthy limbs at lower side, requesting changing of body position every two hours. (ii) Rolling practice: with both hands intertwined and both elbows extended in front of the body, participants practised rolling to the left and right, with knees in flexion. (iii) Self-assisted bed exercises: with both hands intertwined, participants extended both elbows in front of the body, overhead, to the left and right, touched the nose and did bridging exercises etc. (iv) Passive ranging bed exercises: upper limb: scapula, shoulder, elbow, wrist joints; truncal extension, shoulder retraction: lower limb: hip, knee, talo-crural, metatarsal joints. (v) Techniques to facilitate muscle contractions. (vi) Lung clearance: percussions to the posterior segments of the lungs. (vii) Upright sitting training: gradually increasing the inclining angle of the bed, participants sat upright for 30 minutes. Once this was accomplished, the inclining angle is increased by 10 degrees until the participant could sit on the edge of bed. (viii) Stimulation to the muscles of the face, tongue and lips: opening of mouth, bulging of cheeks, gritting of teeth, extending the tongue, placing the tongue on the upper palate, iced cotton swabs (or placing ice cubes in the buccal cavity) and stimulation of taste. (ix) Breathing control practice: participants were requested to take a deep breath, slowly exhale and then relax. (x) Sitting on the edge of bed training: participants practised pushing up from side lying to sitting on the edge of bed without the inclining angle of the bed increased to 90 degrees. (xi) Sitting balance: postural correction, balance training while sitting on the edge of bed, including perturbations to the front, back, left and right. (xii) Exercises in sitting: to further train sitting balance, participants reached forwards, sideways, touched the nose, pointed to objects with intertwined hands and extended arms; lower limb strengthening exercises, taught to participant&#8217;s family and caregivers so they could supervise practice of the exercises several times a day. (xiii) Positioning from bed to wheelchair (or chair) training. (xiv) Sit to stand practice: Training of standing tolerance (beside the bed) commenced early to allow re-gaining of gravitational sense, re-gaining of control of muscles working against gravity, normalisation of blood pressure, correct standing balance as well as to overcome postural hypotension. Typically, participants with ischemic stroke were expected to be able to sit on the edge of bed within 3-4 days of rehabilitation, commence standing training within 2 weeks, with the level of assistance given depending on the medical status of the participants; participants with haemorrhagic stroke should aim to sit on the edge of bed within 2 weeks of rehabilitation and commencement of standing training within 4 weeks. (xv) Participants with contractures were treated accordingly. (xvi) Neuromuscular facilitation techniques. (xvii) Gait training. (xviii) Stair practice (up and down)"</P>

<P>"During acute phase, turning over every 1-2 hours was practiced under supine position. Lateral recumbent position was avoided to prevent compression of limbs. During lateral position, pillow was used to support the affected side and the health upper limbs and raise elbow. During the lateral position with the health side, elbow joint was stretched with palm toward health side, and the lower health limbs were extended backwardly. Exercise of limbs included the gentle pressing, massage, malaxtion from the distal end to proximal end twice a day, 20 min each time. Massage with safflower of regions surrounding should joint and from forearms to fingers was performed. Doctors should make patients believe their limbs were capable of moving for patients who were clear. The active movement dominated by the big nerves was suggested when patients showed signs of limbs activity, including raising hands, shoulder and leg and antielbow extension, hitting palms along the diagonal direction"</P>
<P>"During rehabilitation phase, patients were asked to sit by the bed with the health hands holding the bed, and legs dropping, and nurses standing by the affected side to prevent inclination toward the affected side. Once patients were capable of sitting stably by self, sitting exercise was initiated with body against bed, health hands holding bed, and nurses sitting by the side. Sitting exercises lasted from a few seconds to minutes, during which, patients were asked to swing affected limbs, 5 min each time and times and duration can be increased gradually. Walking exercise was initiated if patients were capable of sitting for 10-15 min without assistance. First patients were asked to do stepping on under the help of crutches. During exercise, center of gravity was gradually shifted to the affected side.

<P>"Treatment intervention: (i) Regular change in bed position: for participants not able to turn in bed independently, turning was done every two hours in the supine position, lateral position with affected limbs at lower side and healthy limbs at upper side, and lateral position with affected limbs at upper side and healthy limbs at lower side. (ii) Optimal placement of limbs in functional positions. (iii) Joint movement: Daily movement of each joint 2-3 times/day, 5-10 times/session. Upon gaining consciousness, participants were encouraged to do active assisted exercises of shoulder flexion with intertwined hands and lower limb bridging exercises with attention to pelvic control, until participants were able to do the exercises actively. (iv) Lying to sitting and sitting balance training: participants first shifted to edge of bed, dangled both legs off the bed with the unaffected leg supported the top affected leg, and pushed into sitting position with the unaffected arm. For sitting balance training, participants practised reaching for/placing objects from one side to another, increasing the amount of reach as much as possible. Participants were also trained to self-correct their sitting balance by subjecting them to perturbations in all directions. (v) Sit to stand and standing balance training: participants adopted the Bobath method of intertwining both arms, forward extension of arms, head and trunk, shifted body weight to the arms in order to lift the pelvis, hips, knee and stand up. If needed, therapist assisted by pushing the affected knee forward and putting one hand on the unaffected pelvis to help lift it. Participants stood in parallel bars, supporting with the unaffected arm and with assistance from the doctor or family, and gradually increased the time in standing until 30 mins could be attained. Participants progressed to sit to stand practice from using a high chair to a low chair for added challenge. (vi) Gait re-education and stair training (up and down).

<P>(1) Combined exercise training group (n = 11)</P>
<P>"Exercise combined with aerobic and functional strengthening exercises for balance"</P>
<P>"The first exercise was 30 min of functional strength training, consisting of six sub-categories: bridge exercise, lifting toes, and ankles, sitting and standing, stretching out the arms while standing, step exercise, and stairs exercise. Bridge exercise is lifting pelvis using the legs, from bending hips and knees with supine. Lifting toes and ankles is dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the hemiplegic leg in the sitting position. Sitting and standing is standing from sitting and sitting again until the hip touches chair. Stretching out the arms while standing is stretching out the arms upward, downward, right-side, left-side and diagonally. Step exercise is shifting of weight bearing to a leg on a step. The hemiplegic leg and non-hemiplegic leg are placed in turn on the step and the location of step alternates from the front to one side of the subject. Stairs exercise is walking up stairs with the hemiplegic leg supporting the body weight and walking down stairs with the non-hemiplegic leg support body weight. Before exercise, 5 minutes warming-up exercise of breathing exercise and stretching were conducted. Each exercise was repeated at medium intensity without fatigue ten to fifteen times. The second exercise for the combined exercise training group was aerobic exercise. Treadmill walking and riding a bicycle were conducted for fifteen minutes each. Treadmill walking started at 0.5 m/s and the initial 5 minutes was on adaption period. In the next 10 minutes walking velocity increased or walking was done with less support from the hand-rail. A stationary bicycle was used for the bicycle riding exercise. At the beginning a patient started with a velocity which he/she could feel comfortable with. As time went by the velocity was increased. The intensity of the two aerobic exercises was determined by checking the heart rate"</P>

<P>(2) Conventional exercise group (n = 10)</P>
<P>"Special instructions were not given to the physical therapist in charge, and the conventional training was done as usual. The therapist focused on re-educating normal movement during functional activities that were meaningful to the patients. Training was composed of balance exercise, posture control exercise, and gait exercise. Keeping normal movement of the pelvis for balance and posture control was emphasized. The therapist judged that working on increasing anterior and posterior pelvic tilt would improve weight transfer and hip extension during gait, leading to improvements in selective distal control of the knee and the foot. Trunk control and alignment can affect muscle tone, range of motion, and control of the limb. For the upper limbs, treatment was conducted focusing on movement of the scapular. For balance exercise, weight transfer exercise and reaching exercise were alternately performed on the affected side and the unaffected side in the sitting or standing position. Bridging exercise was performed to strengthen the trunk muscles. Selective movement of each joint of the shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle joint was performed to facilitate upper and lower limb movement. For gait exercise, training in weight transfer during gait was conducted by planting the unaffected side foot at the front and back of the body. Gait training was divided between the stance phase and the swing phase, and exercises for each phase were performed. In addition, stair climbing practice and gait training for crossing obstacles were conducted. Patients did not do the same exercise every training day but suitable exercises were selected according to the goals of each patient and the therapist. The intensity of each exercise was decided by the therapist considering each patient&#8217;s capacity for exercise"</P>

<P>(1) Observation group (n = 35)</P>
<P>"Both groups received standard pharmacotherapy and motor function training using mainly Bobath method: including positioning of non-affected limbs and training on bed; transfer training; stepping training and gait re-education; occupational training and ADL training. In addition, the observation group also received sensory function training</P>
<P>Superficial sensation training: (i) Using tip of large-headed pin with constant force to lightly poke the skin on affected side, and compare with non-affected side; (ii) Using cotton swab to lightly touch the affected side&#8217;s skin and mucosa; (iii) Using towel soaked in hot water (40°C &#8211; 50°C) and cold water (5°C &#8211; 10°C) to wipe and train sensation of temperature; (iv) During the early period especially during flaccid paralysis period, light tapping, hitting, light touching, rapid brushing, etc, performed on affected limbs. Training could be done initially with eyes closed, but if there was obvious difficulty, could be trained with eyes opened instead, with training done with eyes closed after there is improvement, such that there is repeated training, following eyes closed -&gt; eyes opened -&gt; eyes closed sequence"</P>
<P>"Deep sensation training: (i) Maintenance of non-affected limb position during early period, with appropriate increase in time spent lying on affected side, giving extra protection of affected limbs when changing position; (ii) Using fingers, therapist lightly held patient&#8217;s affected side&#8217;s finger or toe to perform passive ranging exercises, or placed affected limbs in a particular position, to allow patient to feel the position of his limbs, while staying motionless, training repeatedly until the patient himself could complete certain movements with affected limb, being especially useful for low muscle tone and poor control of lower limbs; (iii) While sitting or standing, paying attention to weight borne by affected limbs, and while performing active or passive ranging exercises, could also use an elastic strap to wrap and place pressure on joint being moved"</P>
<P>"Touch sensation training: once patient had recovered sensation on fingers, this training could immediately commence. (i) Patient closed eyes and used touch to identify common objects such as key, pen, toothbrush, button, etc, and if unable to identify, could also allow touching with eyes opened or using non-affected hand to touch; (ii) Plastic pieces, paper, cloth and fur, etc, were mixed together, for patient to identify using touch with eyes closed, and if there is error in identification, could similarly use non-affected hand or open eyes; (iii) Patient showed a picture, and then asked to find a similar object in a black box"</P>
<P>"Balance training: using balance assessment training system, based on patient&#8217;s condition, either sitting or standing position was used, initially using corresponding pressure sensor, patient focused on the display unit during training, adjusted their own position according to change in display lights on display unit, to undergo training on maintenance of centre of gravity, shifting of centre of gravity, single-leg weight-bearing, etc. After becoming stable with eyes opened, this training could also be performed with eyes closed"</P>

<P>(1) Strategy one (S1) (n = 59)</P>
<P>"The team of two trained nurses (see notes) applied one of the two rehabilitation strategies to each patient, beginning 72 hours after initial hospitalisation, when the patient&#8217;s clinical condition had been stabilised"</P>
<P>"The first strategy (S1) included two parts: education and physiotherapy. The education portion consisted of providing information on general care such as feeding, hygiene and mobilisation through a Manual of Physical Rehabilitation for the patient with Stroke and also verbally and through a practical rehabilitation training session provided by the nurse to the caregiver. This was an individual plan of daily rehabilitation according to the stage of Brunnstrom&#8217;s classification that the caregiver had to perform. The Manual was drafted by the research group, especially for this study. The physiotherapy part of the strategy was designed and applied based on the basal condition of the patients and their stage of physical recovery. The latter was defined using the Brunnstrom scale (I&#8211;III) , which reflects voluntary activity, movement, coordination, postural stability, muscular tonicity and sphincter control (further details supplied in Table 1). The physiotherapy provided by nurse was divided into three phases. The intensive phase consisted of daily physical therapy initiated at the hospital and continued for two weeks postdischarge through in-home visits. The intermediate phase consisted of bi-weekly in-home visits during the following two weeks (weeks three and four postdischarge). Finally, the support phase consisted of weekly in-home visits during the following three months, up to four months postdischarge"</P>

<P>"Patients in the experimental and control groups received the conventional multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation program provided by the rehabilitation center"</P>
<P>"In addition to the conventional treatment, patients from the experimental group received 30 minutes of extra training, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. In total, 10 hours of additional training were given. The additional exercises consisted of selective movements of the upper and lower part of the trunk in supine and sitting. Supine exercises, with the legs bent and the feet resting on the treatment table, included selective anterior-posterior movements of the pelvis, extension of the hips (bridging), and rotation of the trunk initiated from the upper and lower part of the trunk. Exercises in a sitting position included: flexion and extension of the trunk (the patient flexes and extends the trunk without moving the trunk forwards or backwards); flexion and extension of the lumbar part of the spine (this involves selective anteflexion and retroflexion of the lower part of the trunk); flexion and extension of the hips with the trunk extended (with an extended trunk, the movement is initiated in the hips and the patient brings the extended trunk forwards and backwards); lateral flexion of the trunk initiated from the shoulder and pelvic girdle (from the shoulder girdle means that the patient touches the exercise table with one elbow and returns to the starting position, from the pelvic girdle means that the patient lifts one side of the pelvis and returns to the starting position); rotation from the upper and lower part of the trunk (from the upper part of the trunk means that the patient moves each shoulder forwards and backwards, from the lower part of the trunk means that the patient, while sitting in the upright position, moves each knee forwards and backwards); and finally shuffling forwards and backwards on an exercise table (the participant shifts the weight from one side to the other and moves forwards and backwards on the exercise table). Exercises were gradually introduced and the number of repetitions was determined by the therapist on the basis of the patients' performance"</P>

<P>"Both groups were given routine drug treatment and basic rehabilitative training, looking over brain circulation, anti-coagulation, nutrition and rest, electrolyte balance, prevention of various secondary complications; maintaining optimal limb positioning, passive and active joint range of motion, tissue massage etc. Patients in the treatment group had additional neural facilitation combined with the use of the muscular spasm machine, following the characteristics of the stages of spasticity. Prior to neural facilitation, patients had to undergo relaxation. Neural facilitation training included prone positioning, slow traction to relax tensed muscles; striking spastic muscles including both agonists and antagonists to restore the appropriate muscular balance; traction to muscles and gentle striking to the muscle belly, guiding the affected limbs to exercise, so as to stimulate a balancing reaction, overcoming over activated muscles and compensatory movements; using co-contraction principles, allowing resistive forces exerted during flexion and extension of the non-affected upper limb to illicit flexion and extension of the affected upper limb, and assisting or encouraging the patient to actively flex and extend the limb; making use of asymmetric tonic neck reflex mechanisms, reducing the tone in both upper and lower limbs and stimulating limb movement by rotating the patient&#8217;s neck, holding on to the lower limbs while moving them with momentum, or through reverse action by moving the non-affected shoulder and elbow joints rhythmically so as to reduce muscle tension; making use of body weight to optimise ankle joint integrity; stretching the thumb and externally rotating the forearm to reduce tension in the wrist joint and finger flexors; using cold and hot sensations etc to stimulate and activate contraction of relevant muscles, suppress spasticity etc, compressing the joint to reduce tension, reducing spasticity etc. Low-frequency pulse current treatment: using a Beijing manufactured KX-3A model for spasticity treatment"</P>

Standardised rehabilitation training commenced after the patients were cognitively and medically stable for 48 hours with no aggravation of existing stroke symptoms (within 21 days of stroke, as stage 1 rehabilitation); rehabilitation treatment from early recovery to transfer to Rehabilitation ward (within 3 months of stroke, as stage 2 rehabilitation); community rehabilitation (e.g. home ward) from middle to late recovery (within 4-6 months after stroke, as stage 3 rehabilitation), with the following method:</P>
<P>Prevention and treatment of spasticity: (i) appropriate positioning. (ii) Bobath method of holding hands: both hands intertwined, use the non-affected fingers to lock the affected fingers, with the affected thumb at the top, stretch forward, flex shoulders, lift arms to touch the forehead, hold for a few seconds before returning to original position, practising multiple times daily. (iii) active stretch: extend affected fingers, place 20cm from body on a support, use body weight to stretch spastic muscles, for 3-5minutes per stretch, practising multiple times daily. (iv) Traction: apply traction techniques to affected spastic joints, on feeling resistance, continue with technique for at least 2-3 minutes on the same spot, relax, and repeat. (v) standing bed training: stand on a sloped plank in front of a ladder wall, correct foot inversion and foot, target lower limb spasticity, 5-8 minutes daily. (vi) critical control of Bobath technique, PNF&#8217;s technique of upper limb stretch and lower limb flexion; both tonic labyrinthine reflex and the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex were also used in the rehabilitation process"</P>

<P>(1) Rehabilitation group (n = 40)</P>
<P>"Both groups of patients received conventional neurological drug treatment, treatment group after initial assessment commenced rehabilitative treatment procedure. The rehabilitative training procedure was as follows: based on the extent of the patient&#8217;s hemiplegia and affected limbs&#8217; functional status, procedure was divided into 3 phases: early phase, rehabilitative treatment on bed, and rehabilitative treatment after leaving the bed"</P>
<P>"(i) Early phase: commenced 48 h after patient was medically stable and neurological symptoms stopped progressing. Healthy limbs: therapists should be familiar with positioning of healthy limbs, and let family members understand the reason for doing so and to master these techniques. Upper limb: a pillow slightly higher than torso was placed below extended upper limb and maintained upper limb in supine position; Pelvis and lower limb: those with tendency for lower limb to buckle, while in lying position should have a pillow supporting the affected side of the limb to prevent excessive flexion. Pillows were used to prevent excessive abduction, external rotation. Participants with excessive ankle curvature or inversion used a splint board for positioning. Passive joint range of motion: from distal to proximal, 10x/joint, 2/day. Movement should be of ease, of short duration, used Brunnstrom technique&#8217;s rapid traction, stimulation through overpressuring of joints, 2/day, 15min/session"</P>
<P>"(ii) rehabilitative treatment on bed: This phase commenced when participants possessed good sense of awareness and communication ability: using Bobath method of holding hands, with elbow extension, shoulder elevation to 90 degrees, using both upper limbs to lead during rolling, before turning the hips. After gaining independence in rolling, participants can commence bridging exercises, ankle dorsiflexion exercises. Sitting up from bed training: increase angle of bed to 30 degrees, once participants could tolerate longer than 30mins in the angle, the angle of bed is increased by 10 degrees, until participants can maintain at 90 degrees for 30 mins. Lying to sitting and sitting balance training. The above were practised 2/day, 30 min/session, increasing to 3-4/day if participants had no discomfort"</P>
<P>"(iii) Rehabilitative treatment after leaving the bed: In the rehabilitation centre, standing upright training -&gt; forward, backward, left and right weight shifting training -&gt; training by using the affected lower limb to support (single leg standing) -&gt; limb loading of the affected lower limb (rising training, sitting down training, sit to stand training) -&gt; ankle dorsiflexion -&gt; anterior, posterior pelvic tilt training -&gt; gait training with pelvic stabilisation (parallel bar -&gt; flat ground -&gt; slope -&gt; stairs), 2/day, 1hr/session.

Patients in the control group discharged home after 28 days of routine treatment and early rehabilitation, were given pre-arranged guidance from professionals, and undertook rehabilitative training on their own or with assistance from their family. Community rehabilitation in certain regions was not developed, were unable to provide community rehabilitation, thus patients had to return to the tertiary rehabilitation network Department of Rehabilitation to continue training. Each tertiary rehabilitation network utilised uniform inclusion criteria to select patients, with randomisation to the rehabilitation or control group. Personnel involved in the tertiary rehabilitation network included doctors, therapists, assessors who undertook training sessions to ensure uniformity at all centres. All tertiary rehabilitation network centres used a uniform rehabilitation training method and outcome assessment"</P>
<P>"Tertiary rehabilitation network treatment: Treatment during the critical phase was guided by Zhonghua Medical Association&#8217;s recommendations. Rehabilitative training focused on physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), with speech and language therapy and psychological therapy given at centres with the capabilities. Physiotherapists delivered therapy uniformly, using Bobath techniques and methods from the motor relearning program mainly, with added use of PNF techniques, Brunnstrom etc. Therapy and training followed the patient&#8217;s stroke recovery characteristics, adjusting to the patient&#8217;s actual functional status, and delivered systematically and progressively"</P>
<P>"Training content: During the period when patient was confined in bed, passive ranging, optimal limb positioning, rolling, sitting up, bridging exercises in bed, sitting on bed, sitting balance training etc was given. When patient could achieve sitting for 30 min without postural hypotension or other symptoms, the patient could use a wheelchair to undertake training in the gym. Training content mainly included: active-passive exercises, standing and standing balance training, lower limb weight training and shifting of centre of mass training, stepping practice and gait correction, ankle dorsiflexion, forearm pronation and supination, finger grasping etc. Family members were taught rehabilitative training methods, and at the same time, patient and family underwent health counselling, given a health education booklet, shown a video on neurological recovery etc, with the aim of furthering the patient&#8217;s recovery"</P>

(ii) From start of 2nd month till end of 3rd month after onset of stroke, focus was on standing training, including standing-balance training, single-leg weight bearing, gait and stair climbing/descending, and other trainings, while providing guidance on toileting, bed-chair transferring, indoors or outdoors walking, use of stairs, washing and other practical ADLs; twice a day, 45 min each time, 5 days a week. Because muscle tone could increase gradually during this period, it was necessary to increase the intensity of trainings to reduce muscle tone and inhibit abnormal exercise patterns. For some patients who returned to community setting, therapists would conduct weekly home-visits to guide the patient on rehabilitative treatment. (iii) Once training had commenced, therapists concurrently taught the patients&#8217; family members or caregiver on the correct assistive training methods and care methods, such that they could provide some training outwith therapy time, while also reducing the secondary damage due to inappropriate care.

<P>"Well-trained, qualified, experienced acupuncturists performed the acupuncture treatments, with participants in the supine position.

<P>"Random assignment of patients into the sequential function-based motor relearning group and the conventional therapy (control) group was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved arranging patients into a block of six participants and then forming the six into pairs by matching their age and gender; then, if possible, they were matched according to the level of intensity of physiotherapy and speech therapy received in the hospital. Patients who did not form a best-matched pair were automatically entered into the next block for further matching and randomization. The patients were excluded from the study if their characteristics were not matched by the end of the second round. The second stage involved randomly assigning the two patients in each of the best-matched pairs to either the motor relearning or the control groups by drawing one of two sealed envelopes designating the group membership"</P>

<P>The figure summarises the process undertaken by the stakeholder group, which met on three occasions (green circles). The nominal group technique was used to achieve all decisions. The blue circles represent the 'preparation phase,' which included drafting role descriptors for the SG; obtaining local University ethics and recruiting the SG and data extraction exercise of the sample of Chinese studies (n = 10) that had previously been identified in the 2007 version of this review. Purple circles represent the months dedicated to undertaking the systematic review.</P>
