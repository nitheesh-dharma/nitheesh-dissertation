<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Which approach is most effective at maintaining teeth in their new position after the end of treatment with orthodontic braces?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Once people finish having their teeth straightened with orthodontic braces, the teeth will tend to get crooked again. Orthodontists try to prevent this by using different retention procedures. Retention procedures can include either wearing retainers, which fit over or around teeth, or stick onto the back of teeth, or by using something called 'adjunctive procedures'. Adjunctive procedures either change the shape of the contacts between teeth, or involve a very small procedure to cut the connection between the gum and the neck of the tooth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases to find all the new evidence up to 26 January 2016. This review updates a previous one published in 2006. We included 15 studies that compared different types of fixed and removable retainers and different durations of wear. There were 1722 participants including adults and children. Nine studies took place in a hospital or university setting, five studies in specialist practice and one in a National Health Service Clinic.</P>
<P>The studies evaluated four comparisons: removable retainers versus fixed retainers (three studies); different types of fixed retainers (four studies); different types of removable retainers (eight studies); and one study compared a combination of removable and fixed retainers, use of an adjunctive procedure and a positioner.</P>
<P>We also found four ongoing studies and four studies await classification.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the evidence was of low quality. One small but well conducted study that compared full-time and part-time wear of thermoplastic retainers did not find evidence of a difference in stability (moderate quality evidence). </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>There is not enough high quality evidence to recommend any one approach to retention over another. Further high-quality studies are needed.</P>

<P>We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 26 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to 26 January 2016) and EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 26 January 2016). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (<A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We applied no language or date restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases. We contacted authors of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to help identify any unpublished trials.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-25 16:42:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened eligible studies, assessed the risk of bias in the trials and extracted data. The outcomes of interest were: how well the teeth were stabilised, failure of retainers, adverse effects on oral health and participant satisfaction. We calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. We conducted meta-analyses when studies with similar methodology reported the same outcome. We prioritised reporting of Little's Irregularity Index to measure relapse.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:13:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 studies (1722 participants) in the review. There are also four ongoing studies and four studies await classification. The 15 included studies evaluated four comparisons: removable retainers versus fixed retainers (three studies); different types of fixed retainers (four studies); different types of removable retainers (eight studies); and one study compared a combination of upper thermoplastic and lower bonded versus upper thermoplastic with lower adjunctive procedures versus positioner. Four studies had a low risk of bias, four studies had an unclear risk of bias and seven studies had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<I>Removable versus fixed retainers </I>
</P>
<P>Thermoplastic removable retainers provided slightly poorer stability in the lower arch than multistrand fixed retainers: MD (Little's Irregularity Index, 0 mm is stable) 0.6 mm (95% CI 0.17 to 1.03). This was based on one trial with 84 participants that was at high risk of bias; it was low quality evidence. Results on retainer failure were inconsistent. There was evidence of less gingival bleeding with removable retainers: RR 0.53 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.88; one trial, 84 participants, high risk of bias, low quality evidence), but participants found fixed retainers more acceptable to wear, with a mean difference on a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 to 100; 100 being very satisfied) of -12.84 (95% CI -7.09 to -18.60).</P>
<P>
<I>Fixed versus fixed retainers</I>
</P>
<P>The studies did not report stability, adverse effects or participant satisfaction. It was possible to pool the data on retention failure from three trials that compared polyethylene ribbon bonded retainer versus multistrand retainer in the lower arch with an RR of 1.10 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.57; moderate heterogeneity; three trials, 228 participants, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in failure rates. It was also possible to pool the data from two trials that compared the same types of upper fixed retainers, with a similar finding: RR 1.25 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.78; low heterogeneity; two trials, 174 participants, low quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<I>Removable versus removable retainers</I>
</P>
<P>One study at low risk of bias comparing upper and lower part-time thermoplastic versus full-time thermoplastic retainer showed no evidence of a difference in relapse (graded moderate quality evidence). Another study, comparing part-time and full-time wear of lower Hawley retainers, found no evidence of any difference in relapse (low quality evidence). Two studies at high risk of bias suggested that stability was better in the lower arch for thermoplastic retainers versus Hawley, and for thermoplastic full-time versus Begg (full-time) (both low quality evidence).</P>
<P>In one study, participants wearing Hawley retainers reported more embarrassment more often than participants wearing thermoplastic retainers: RR 2.42 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.49; one trial, 348 participants, high risk of bias, low quality evidence). They also found Hawley retainers harder to wear. There was conflicting evidence about survival rates of Hawley and thermoplastic retainers.</P>
<P>
<I>Other retainer comparisons</I>
</P>
<P>Another study with a low risk of bias looked at three different approaches to retention for people with crowding, but normal jaw relationships. The study found that there was no evidence of a difference in relapse between the combination of an upper thermoplastic and lower canine to canine bonded retainer and the combination of an upper thermoplastic retainer and lower interproximal stripping, without a lower retainer. Both these approaches are better than using a positioner as a retainer.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:02:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any evidence that wearing thermoplastic retainers full-time provides greater stability than wearing them part-time, but this was assessed in only a small number of participants.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:32:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:32:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retention is the phase of orthodontic treatment that attempts to keep teeth in the corrected positions after correction with orthodontic (dental) braces. Without retention there is a tendency for the teeth to return to their initial position. This unfavourable change from the corrected position is known as relapse. The causes of relapse are not fully understood, but are felt to relate to recoil of the fibres that hold the teeth in the jaw bone; pressures from the lips, cheeks and tongue; further growth and the way the teeth meet together (<LINK REF="REF-Melrose-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melrose 1998</LINK>). To minimise relapse almost every person who has orthodontic treatment will require some type of retention. </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:28:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retention can be achieved by placing appliances, called retainers, on the teeth, or by undertaking additional or 'adjunctive' procedures to the teeth or the surrounding structures.</P>
<P>The retainers can either be removable, so that the person can take them out to clean, or they can be fixed to the teeth (<LINK REF="STD-Atack-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Atack 2007</LINK>). Bonded retainers are usually glued or 'bonded' on the back (inside) of the front teeth. These bonded retainers are sometimes referred to as 'fixed retainers'. Some clinicians use an appliance called a positioner after treatment is completed: this helps to 'fine-tune' the result and can then be worn part-time to help reduce relapse. <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> contains a glossary of terms to help describe some of the common type of retainers and adjunctive procedures that are described in this review.</P>
<P>There is no recognised duration for the time that retainers need to be worn. It has been shown that if people stop wearing retainers after one to two years there is a risk of long-term relapse of the teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Little-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1988</LINK>). Therefore, some clinicians prefer to retain for longer periods, sometimes indefinitely. It is also not clear how many hours a day removable retainers need to be worn: some people are asked to wear their retainer full-time (24 hours a day), while other people are only asked to wear them part-time (less than 24 hours a day).</P>
<P>Clinicians may also try to reduce relapse by using 'adjunctive' procedures to the teeth (hard tissues) or the surrounding gum (soft tissues). This can involve reshaping of the contact points between teeth known as interproximal reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Aasen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aasen 2005</LINK>), or cutting the fibres around the neck of the tooth, that hold the tooth in the jaw bone, known as pericision (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1988</LINK>). The glossary of terms in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> provides more information on this.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-27 17:31:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retainers or adjunctive procedures aim to maintain the teeth in the position they were in at the end of orthodontic treatment. Retainers fit over or around the teeth, and prevent them moving away from their final position. Adjunctive procedures may work by improving the contacts between teeth (interproximal reduction) or by cutting fibres that connect the teeth to the gum around the neck of the teeth. These fibres may pull the teeth back towards their original position.</P>
<P>In order for retainers to work, they must keep the teeth in position without doing any harm and be comfortable and acceptable for people to wear. Potentially they could cause damage to the teeth by collecting plaque and calculus, and by making it difficult for people to keep their teeth clean. This build-up of plaque may cause decay (caries) or inflammation and damage to the surrounding gum. This damage to the gum can cause gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) or periodontal disease (loss of attachment of the tooth to its surrounding gum and bony socket).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-25 16:47:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group undertook an extensive prioritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were the most clinically important ones to maintain on <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Worthington-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worthington 2015</LINK>). Consequently, the orthodontic expert panel identified this review as a priority title (<A HREF="http://ohg.cochrane.org/priority-reviews">Cochrane OHG priority review portfolio</A>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Retention is a key part of orthodontic treatment. Unless we can maintain the teeth in position after orthodontic treatment, the beneficial effects of the treatment can disappear. There are currently many different types of removable and fixed retainers and it is unclear which retainers are the best, and how long they should be used for. There is also little known about the possible benefits and risks of adjunctive procedures aimed at reducing relapse.</P>
<P>This review investigated the effectiveness of different retention strategies used to stabilise tooth position after treatment with orthodontic braces. It did not attempt to identify the causes of relapse. This review looked at the effects of retainers while in place, not the long-term effects after they are no longer in use.</P>

<P>This could be assessed by an index of tooth irregularity, for example, Little's Irregularity Index (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1981</LINK>), which measures how crooked anterior teeth are or by crowding (see glossary of terms in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). It can also be assessed by a change in the shape or size of each arch: this can be measured by intercanine width, intermolar width or arch length. The way the teeth meet together (occlusion) can also be assessed using measurements such as overjet, overbite and assessing the quality of the final results using an index such as the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR index) (<LINK REF="REF-Richmond-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 1992</LINK>) (see glossary of terms in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>Blinding of participants and clinicians is usually not possible in retention research, due to the nature of the intervention. This is because it is not possible to hide either the retainer type or adjunctive procedure. Therefore, the blinding of participants and clinicians was not included in the 'Risk of bias' tables for each study. The lack of ability to blind the participants and clinicians could potentially bias this type of research and should be noted when interpreting the findings.</P>
<P>However, blinding of the assessors is often possible, particularly when assessing stability on study models (except where bonded retainers are still in place). Blinding of the assessors is also possible when assessing the results of participant satisfaction questionnaires.

The difference in the lower arch may be clinically significant if the irregularity was restricted to one tooth contact.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Rohaya-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rohaya 2006</LINK> study investigated the ability to maintain previously rotated teeth in a stable position, comparing Hawley retainers and thermoplastic retainers. They found that people wearing thermoplastic retainers were 4.88 times more likely to hold derotated teeth stable than people who wore Hawley retainers (95% CI 1.13 to 21.07; P value = 0.03) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.13</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK> compared failure rates of Hawley retainers with thermoplastic retainers. They assessed failure rates by recording how many retainers broke and how many were lost. Hawley retainers were more likely to break (32 Hawley retainers broke compared with 12 thermoplastic retainers) giving an RR of 2.96 (95% CI 1.58 to 5.55; P value = 0.000072), which is clinically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.15</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2011</LINK> also compared the failure rate of Hawley retainers and thermoplastic retainers. A retainer was assessed as failed if it fractured, no longer fit, showed local serious abrasion causing holes in the retainer, or loss of retainers. Failure rate was assessed separately for upper and lower retainers. <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2011</LINK> showed no difference in failure rates in the upper arch (<LINK REF="CMP-003.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.17</LINK>). However, in the lower arch there was a statistically significant chance of thermoplastic retainers failing compared with Hawley retainers (25 Hawley compared with 41 thermoplastic). The RR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.83; P value = 0.0023), which is clinically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-003.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.18</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hawley retainers versus thermoplastic retainers</HEADING>
<P>There was limited evidence to suggest that thermoplastic retainers offer better retention in the lower arch than Hawley retainers. <LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK> showed a small increase in irregularity in the lower arch with Hawley retainers, although this was unlikely to be significant unless the irregularity was restricted to one tooth contact. One study showed that thermoplastic retainers prevented relapse of previously rotated teeth in the upper arch better than Hawley retainers (<LINK REF="STD-Rohaya-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rohaya 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>We found limited evidence from two studies looking at failure rates of these two types of retainers (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2011</LINK>). The studies could not be combined due to the marked difference in materials and methodology, in particular that in one study the retainers were worn for long periods on a part-time basis (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK>), and in the other study they were worn full-time except at meal times (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2011</LINK>). When Hawley retainers were worn three months full-time, then nine months part-time, and the vacuum-formed retainers were worn part-time, there were more breakages in the Hawley retainers (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK>). When both sets of retainers were worn full-time except at meal times, there were more failures in the thermoplastic retainer group (<LINK REF="STD-Sun-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Sun 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was limited evidence of a greater level of patient satisfaction with thermoplastic retainers than Hawley retainers (<LINK REF="STD-Rowland-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rowland 2007</LINK>). Participants wearing thermoplastic retainers reported less embarrassment at wearing them than reported by participants wearing Hawley retainers.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Upper removable and fixed retainer versus upper removable and lower adjunctive procedure versus positioner</HEADING>
<P>Based on the results of one study, all three approaches maintained the teeth in a reasonably stable position for the first year (<LINK REF="STD-Edman-Tynelius-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Edman Tynelius 2015</LINK>). However, after two years, there was greater irregularity in the lower arch with the positioner, which could be clinically significant. The fact that adequate stability was maintained in the group with adjunctive procedure but no lower retainer is interesting, because in recent decades it has been presumed that all participants had to wear some sort of retainer to maintain stability. It is important to emphasise that the participants initially presented with normal jaw relationships in all three dimensions (anteroposterior, vertical and transverse proportions), and so were essentially Class I crowding cases. Typically, teeth do not need to be moved as far in these cases. When trying to straighten teeth and obtain a good bite when the jaws do not meet together well, teeth need to be moved further to compensate for this. As a result, it may not be possible to extrapolate these results to most people requiring orthodontic treatment.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-01-27 14:04:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, we included 15 studies investigating different approaches to retention and with multiple outcomes in this review. Three studies compared different removable retainers with fixed retainers. Four studies compared different types of fixed retainers. Eight studies compared different types of removable retainers.</P>
<P>One further study, compared a combination of upper thermoplastic and lower bonded versus upper thermoplastic with lower adjunctive procedures versus positioner (<LINK REF="STD-Edman-Tynelius-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Edman Tynelius 2015</LINK>). It is important to note that there were very strict inclusion criteria for this study and, while the study was well conducted with a low risk of bias, it is important to recognise that the findings may only be applicable to people with similar malocclusions (crowded cases with normal positions of the jaws in all three dimensions).</P>
<P>Only three of the 15 studies reported outcomes beyond two years. This is important as it is felt that retainers may be needed indefinitely to reduce the chances of relapse, so the findings of this review predominantly will inform clinicians of the effects of different approaches to retention in the short term.</P>
<P>When interpreting the results of this review, it is important to remember that the results of the studies may be affected by the age of the participants, initial malocclusions, treatment procedure, amount and type of tooth movement, along with other possible factors that may affect relapse. The impact of these areas is still not fully understood, and is beyond the scope of this review. However, the broader context should always be considered when interpreting studies reporting the stabilising effects of retainers and adjunctive techniques.</P>
<P>There is no agreed Core Outcome Measure in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) for relapse studies in orthodontics at the present time. Therefore, the review authors have prioritised reporting Little's Irregularity Index as the preferred outcome for this review.</P>

<P>There was low quality evidence to assess stability, in the lower arch, adverse effects on health and patient satisfaction. We downgraded the evidence due to high risk of bias and imprecision. There was very low evidence for failure of retainers, with the quality of evidence downgraded three times due to high risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. This low quality, or very low quality, of evidence means that future research is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and likely to change the estimate.</P>

<P>There was moderate quality evidence comparing full-time wear with part-time wear of thermoplastic retainers. The results were based on only one study and we downgraded this evidence once due to imprecision. Moderate quality evidence means that further research in this area is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate.</P>
<P>There was low quality evidence in further studies comparing different types of removable retainers: part-time versus full-time wear of Hawley retainers; Hawley versus thermoplastic retainers and Begg versus thermoplastic retainers. We downgraded all these low quality studies twice due to high risk of bias and imprecision. Low quality evidence means that future research in these areas is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and likely to change the estimate.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-26 09:04:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have used a broad sensitive search strategy of multiple databases, and also searched for unpublished studies and data, without language restrictions. Therefore, we hope that potential bias in the review process has been minimised. We could not analyse two of the studies in Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), as the data were reported as medians (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Rourke-_x005b_pers-comm_x005d_" TYPE="STUDY">O'Rourke [pers comm]</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thickett-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Thickett 2010</LINK>). Therefore, we can only report the findings of the authors and so we have not included their findings in our final conclusions.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Mai-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mai 2014</LINK> is a systematic review that investigated Hawley retainers compared to thermoplastic retainers. They identified seven studies to include, but this was because, in addition to randomised controlled clinical trials, they included quasi-randomised and controlled clinical trials. They reported that there was some evidence to suggest "that there are no differences with respect to changes in intercanine and intermolar widths between Hawley retainers and vacuum-formed retainers after orthodontic retention". This finding is different to our conclusions, but this was due to different inclusion criteria to our review. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-01-28 10:14:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-01-28 10:14:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any evidence that wearing thermoplastic retainers full-time provides greater stability than wearing them part-time, but this was assessed in only a small number of participants.</P>
<P>Overall, there is insufficient high quality evidence to make recommendations on retention procedures for stabilising tooth position after treatment with orthodontic braces. Further high quality RCTs are needed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-01-27 14:05:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Retention studies are not easy to undertake, but several randomised controlled clinical trials have now been completed showing that this research is feasible. Relapse is a long-term problem and long-term follow-up of participants is practically difficult and financially demanding. However, given that the vast majority of people requiring orthodontic treatment undergo a phase of retention, this vital area of orthodontic research should continue to be given priority. To minimise the risk of bias, future studies in this field should address the following features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate allocation concealment and appropriate generation of randomisation;</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>adequate reporting and analysis of withdrawals and drop-outs;</LI>
<LI>reporting of all data that are collected;</LI>
<LI>a priori sample size calculations;</LI>
<LI>clear inclusion and exclusion criteria;</LI>
<LI>ideally follow-up for a number of years, given the long-term nature of the problem of relapse.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Although some RCTs have addressed aspects of retention given below, further high quality studies in these areas are needed to increase the evidence base:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to compare different types of retainers (fixed and removable);</LI>
<LI>to investigate the effects of different adjunctive techniques, such as pericision and interproximal reduction;</LI>
<LI>to further investigate whether adjunctive techniques, for example interproximal reduction, may be sufficient without retainers to provide adequate retention;</LI>
<LI>to investigate levels of patient satisfaction to different retention regimens, including no retention.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Appropriate outcomes to investigate include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>stability;</LI>
<LI>survival of retainers;</LI>
<LI>adverse effects on oral health;</LI>
<LI>patient satisfaction assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In particular, it would be useful to assess these outcomes over the long term.</P>

<P>After careful consideration, we decided to exclude quasi-randomised studies in updates of our original Cochrane review, to reduce the risk of bias. This has resulted in the exclusion of three previously included studies from this updated 2015 review (<LINK REF="STD-Edwards-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Edwards 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sauget-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sauget 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taner-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Taner 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, we changed the term 'quality of life' from the original protocol to 'patient satisfaction' in this updated 2015 review. This is because it better reflects the outcome being described.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">A. Removable retainers in this review</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Hawley retainer</B>
</P>
<P>This is the oldest reported removable retainer, first described in 1919. It consists of an acrylic baseplate that covers the palate or lies behind the lower teeth, and is usually held in place by attachments known as Adam's clasps that clip onto the first molar tooth that is present in each quadrant. There is typically a labial bow that crosses the labial surfaces of the anterior teeth, which acts to hold the retainer in place, and maintain the stability of the front teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Thermoplastic retainer</B>
</P>
<P>This is a clear plastic retainer that typically cover all the teeth. It is formed by heating up a sheet of plastic and moulding this around a model of the patient&#8217;s teeth after the treatment is complete. This moulding can be by 'vacuum-forming' (when the retainers are often referred to as vacuum-formed retainers), or by pressure. It can be modified to change the amount of occlusal coverage they have.</P>
<P>
<B>Begg retainer</B>
</P>
<P>This is a removable retainer that is similar to a Hawley retainer. It also has an acrylic baseplate that covers the palate, or lies behind the lower teeth, but does not have clasps covering the occlusal (biting) surfaces. It is retained principally by the labial bow wire, which runs on the outside of all the teeth. The aim is to allow more occlusal settling, but retention of the appliance may not be as good as Hawley retainers due to the lack of specific clasps attached to teeth.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">B. Fixed retainers in this review</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Multistrand wire fixed retainer</B>
</P>
<P>Multistrand wire is a flexible wire made up of smaller diameter stainless steel wires wound together like a piece of rope. It is typically bonded to every tooth in the labial segment. It is usually bonded with composite resin adhesive.</P>
<P>
<B>Thick canine to canine retainer</B>
</P>
<P>This fixed retainer is made of stainless steel, but is of a thicker diameter than the multistrand and, therefore, more rigid. It is typically bonded only to the canines (hence the name). It is used to allow easier cleaning of the incisors. The other potential advantage that is claimed is that if either attachment fails, the person will know about it (this may not be the case if one of the attachments on the multistrand fails). However, it does not bond to the incisors, so some operators feel there may be the potential for relapse of these teeth.</P>
<P>
<B>Polyethylene ribbon retainer</B>
</P>
<P>This is a plasma-treated polyethylene woven ribbon that can be adapted to the lingual surfaces of the teeth, and then bonded using composite resin. Once composite resin adhesive is added, the retainer becomes more rigid and helps to splint the teeth together. It has the potential advantages of being easily adapted to the lingual surfaces of the teeth, biocompatible and aesthetic. Some operators worry that the increased rigidity of this type of retainer may make it more prone to failure as teeth move differentially in normal function.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">C. Positioner</HEADING>
<P>A positioner is an appliance that is used to improve the interdigitation of the teeth at the end of treatment. It is typically a single piece of plastic that has been created in the laboratory to guide a person's upper and lower teeth into the ideal position. Although it is really used to 'position' the teeth, it has been used to hold the teeth in position after it has completed its positioning role. The person usually wears it only at night for a defined period.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">D. Adjunctive procedures to reduce relapse</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Interproximal reduction</B>
</P>
<P>Also known as interproximal stripping, this is a process of reshaping the contacts between adjacent teeth to make them broader and flatter. It is hoped that this will make the teeth more stable and less likely to relapse. The reshaping can be undertaken with small abrasive strips that are placed between the teeth, either by hand or on a dental handpiece. It is usually not painful and no anaesthetic is required before, during or after. A minimal amount of enamel is removed.</P>
<P>
<B>Pericision</B>
</P>
<P>Also known as circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy, this is a process where the fibres around the neck of the teeth are cut to reduce the chances of relapse. These can be cut with a sharp blade under local anaesthetic.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">E. Additional terms used in this retention review</HEADING>
<P>
<B>Little's Irregularity Index (LII)</B>
</P>
<P>This is an index described by a UK orthodontist called Bob Little (<LINK REF="REF-Little-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Little 1981</LINK>). It is used to describe the irregularity of the anterior six teeth. The index measures the distance, in millimetres, between the contact points of crooked teeth, and then adds them together. Therefore, the Irregularity Index is the sum of all the displaced contacts between the anterior teeth (canine to canine).</P>
<P>
<B>Peer Assessment Rating (PAR)</B>
</P>
<P>This is an index used to provide an objective measurement of orthodontic treatment outcome. Described by <LINK REF="REF-Richmond-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richmond 1992</LINK>, it provides a score measuring any abnormalities in the occlusion - the smaller the score, the better the quality of the result.</P>
<P>
<B>Settling</B>
</P>
<P>Sometimes referred to as 'occlusal settling', this is a process where the quality of the person's bite improves after orthodontic treatment, with more and better quality contacts between opposing teeth. Retainers are sometimes designed or prescribed to try and improve settling after treatment. This means that they encourage a subtle change (rather than holding teeth exactly still) to improve the result at the end of treatment. It is really a controlled way of allowing teeth to move together after treatment, and in fact involves a deliberate reduction in stability to improve the final result.</P>
