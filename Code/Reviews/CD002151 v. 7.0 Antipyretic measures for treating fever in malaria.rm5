<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:12:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fever is a common symptom of malaria. Antipyretic drugs (fever-relieving medicines) and physical measures (such as tepid sponging) are widely used by caregivers and health care workers to treat fever in adults and children with malaria. Some researchers have questioned the belief that treating fever with antipyretic drugs is beneficial. They suggest that it may actually prolong the time taken for the malaria parasite to be cleared from the blood system. This review looked for evidence from appropriate types of research that addressed these issues. We found only a few small trials and could not obtain sufficient information from these trials to reach a conclusion on whether the antipyretic drugs actually help to resolve malaria symptoms or prolong the illness.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:01:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:01:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Malaria is a common public health problem in the developing countries of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Oceania. An estimated 250 million cases of malaria occur annually, with more than 80% of the cases found in endemic regions of Africa and Asia (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). The disease accounts for about one million deaths annually, of which more than 90% are in Africa and 85% in African children below the age of five years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The common symptoms of malaria include fever, poor appetite, vomiting, malaise and convulsions. Fever is the most common of the symptoms of malaria. The fear of fever-induced convulsions (febrile convulsions) is a common reason why caregivers of young children use various forms of fever remedies. Simple febrile convulsions are generally known not to cause serious morbidity or fatality. However, some other forms of malaria-induced convulsions arise from potentially fatal complications, notably cerebral malaria, malaria induced hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis (<LINK REF="REF-Strengell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strengell 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fever in malaria is believed to be associated with release of toxins and antigenic substances which induce the release of cytokines by white blood cells. The cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, in turn activate the cyclooxygenase pathway leading to the production of prostaglandin E<SUB>2. </SUB>In the thermoregulatory centre of the brain, prostaglandin E<SUB>2 </SUB>acts on thermosensitive cells to induce fever. Fever is postulated to be a host response to curb infections and achieve recovery but its role in defence against malaria is unclear. It has been suggested that fever and associated cytokines may have beneficial roles in malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Dodoo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodoo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mordm_x00fc_ller-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mordmüller 1997</LINK>). Thus more harm than good may be done by blunting the febrile host response by administering antipyretic drugs to people with fever due to malaria.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:01:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of treating malaria is to eliminate the malaria parasites with effective anti-malarial agents. However, other treatments are often required to ameliorate the symptoms of malaria and its complications. Fever, aches, convulsions and dehydration are some of the symptoms and signs of malaria that often require treatment. Common treatment modalities for fever include anti-pyretic drugs (such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammmatory drugs (NSAIDs)) and physical methods (including sponging with tepid water, fanning and use of cooling blankets) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Measures to treat fever are thought to make the patients feel better and prevent febrile convulsions in children. Physical methods especially tepid sponging, are sometimes used in combination with anti-pyretic drugs to treat fever in malaria.</P>
<P>Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is an antipyretic drug commonly used in children (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2000</LINK>) and for treating fever in malaria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>). It also has analgesic effects. It is derived from the parent compound, N-acetyl-p aminophenol, 4-hydroxyacetanilide, which is an active metabolite of phenacetin. It is administered via the enteral and parenteral routes. Its side effects include vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. In overdose, paracetamol causes hepatotoxicity which can rapidly progress to hepatic failure if appropriate treatment is not commenced early (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>NSAIDs are another group of antipyretic drugs used in treating fever due to malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Matsegui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Matsegui 2008</LINK>). They are weak organic acids with wide chemical diversity and include aspirin, ibuprofen, metamizol, naproxen etc. Adverse effects associated with the use of NSAIDs include gastric irritation and anti-platelet effects, which can cause prolonged bleeding and renal damage. Reye's syndrome is associated with aspirin use in paediatric age groups.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:01:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence from previous systematic reviews that both physical methods and common antipyretic drugs (notably paracetamol and ibuprofen) lead to short-lived reduction in body temperature in feverish conditions caused by infections (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2003</LINK>). Physical antipyretic measures such as tepid sponging, fanning and cooling blankets induce reduction in body temperature by conduction, convection or by evaporation. Antipyretic effects of physical methods tend to be more short-lived necessitating frequent application, which tends to increase discomforting effects such as shivering with goose pimples (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Paracetamol is the most commonly used antipyretic agent. The World Health Organization (WHO) malaria treatment guideline recommends paracetamol, ibuprofen and tepid sponging as measures for treating fever in malaria (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). The mode of action of paracetamol is poorly understood, but it is thought to achieve this effect by blocking the effects of endogenous pyrogens on the hypothalamus (<LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2000</LINK>). NSAIDs exert their antipyretic effect by deactivating the cycloxygenase pathway with subsequent inhibition of prostaglandin production (<LINK REF="STD-Lell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In recent times, the role of antipyretic measures in treatment of infections has been called into question (<LINK REF="REF-Warwick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warwick 2008</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1991</LINK>). This is particularly important in malaria cases as there is evidence that febrile temperatures inhibit in vitro growth of <I>Plasmodium falciparum</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Long-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2001</LINK>). A study of people infected with malaria showed that paracetamol prolonged parasitaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Brandts-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandts 1997</LINK>). Recent studies have shown that although NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, metamizol and naproxen reduce fever peaks, they do not play a significant role in reducing fever clearance time in malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Matsegui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Matsegui 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lell 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevention of febrile convulsions is one of the reasons practitioners use antipyretic measures, but there is no evidence to show that antipyretic drugs prevent febrile convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Strengell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strengell 2009</LINK>). A study of African children with malaria showed that 54% of convulsions occurred at rectal temperatures below 38°C, indicating that factors other than high grade fever account for the majority of convulsions in children with malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Waruiru-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waruiru 1996</LINK>). It has been postulated that the convulsions associated with fever in malaria may be due to systemic pathophysiological changes caused by these infections (<LINK REF="REF-Waruiru-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waruiru 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:01:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Paracetamol and ibuprofen are widely used in fever management, and have been recommended by the WHO malaria treatment guideline group (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Paracetamol is generally known to be safe and well tolerated when used in the recommended doses but the controversies regarding observations that antipyresis may prolong malaria parasitaemia remain unresolved (<LINK REF="REF-Hayward-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayward 1999</LINK>). The first version of this systematic review aimed to test the null hypothesis that paracetamol and other fever control measures do not prolong malaria illness (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2000</LINK>). This review found insufficient data to confirm or refute an impact of antipyretic measures on parasitaemia or malarial illness (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2000</LINK>) and did not make a head to head comparison of the effects of paracetamol and NSAIDs. Since the completion of that review, more studies that addressed this question have been conducted. The WHO malaria treatment guideline recommends ibuprofen along with paracetamol for treating fever in malaria but acknowledges the fact that experience with use of ibuprofen is limited (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Considering that available evidence of any advantage of one antipyretic measure over the other is inconclusive, we have decided in the update of this systematic review to also study the comparative effectiveness of the various antipyretic measures on the treatment of malaria.</P>

Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 1993</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kofoed-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kofoed 2011</LINK>) were funded by the pharmaceutical companies who manufactured the drugs used for the trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Krudsood-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Krudsood 2010</LINK>, the funders played a role in trial design, data collection and analysis as well as approval of the published report although the authors claim autonomy to the contents of the report. We have judged this as high risk in these two trials.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-25 11:52:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The major objective of this review was to ascertain from reliable research whether antipyretic measures impact on the treatment of malaria. Biological theory led researchers to ask if fever control could prolong parasitaemia and do harm in patients with malaria. We set out to confirm or refute our apriori hypotheses.</P>
<P>We were unable to demonstrate a clinically meaningful or statistically significant effect of the antipyretic drugs under review on FCT and PCT. This was mainly due to the small size of the studies, and the level of heterogeneity between them.</P>
<P>For FCT (ie time to sustained resolution of fever during an episode of malaria), most trials did not detect an impact of antipyretic drugs on this outcome. Antipyretic drugs induced short-lived relief of fever with each dose of treatment but did not contribute significantly to sustained resolution of fever in malaria.</P>
<P>As regards our hypothesis that antipyretic measures do not prolong malaria parasitemia, we are unable to make any meaningful conclusion as we found an inconsistent pattern of the effects of antipyretics on this outcome. Some of the trials reported no significant difference in PCT while others found a significant difference due to the fact that antipyretics prolonged PCT. Also statistical and clinical heterogeneity made it inappropriate to pool data from the included studies.</P>
<P>Many clinicians treat febrile children with antipyretics because of the risk of febrile convulsions (<LINK REF="REF-Strengell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strengell 2009</LINK>), and we had hoped to inform this practice by seeking data that would either support or discourage this practice. However, trials were too small to examine the incidence of febrile convulsions and most of the included trials did not report this outcome. In <LINK REF="STD-Kofoed-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kofoed 2011</LINK>, more patients in the placebo arm had convulsions but this was not statistically significant. Only one participant in the <LINK REF="STD-Matsegui-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Matsegui 2008</LINK> trial had a convulsion.</P>
<P>We found insufficient data to show whether the antipyretic effects of ibuprofen and paracetamol differed significantly when used to treat fever in patients with malaria. Only one trial with few participants reported this comparison; there is a need for this to be replicated in larger, better powered trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:08:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies we included in this review were mostly for patients with uncomplicated<I> P. falciparum</I> malaria. The studies did not assess the effect of antipyretics in severe malaria, as severe illness was an exclusion criteria in almost all of the studies. We therefore cannot answer the question as to the benefit or otherwise of antipyretic intervention in this group of patients.</P>
<P>We also did not find any trial that performed a head-to-head comparison of antipyretic drugs versus physical methods. Therefore, we are unable to comment on the superiority or otherwise of antipyretic drugs over physical methods or vice versa. Some of the trials used physical methods in both the treatment and control arms as the baseline standard of care.</P>

<P>Fever management in malaria with antipyretic drugs remains a common practice in both mild and severe disease. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend a change in practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-04 11:11:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows that evidence on potential harms of using antipyretic drugs in the treatment of malaria is scanty. It highlights a significant gap in knowledge and lack of reliable data to inform a common clinical practice for a disease that affects several millions of people every year. Additional research evidence will be needed to draw reliable conclusions on the questions addressed in this review. There is also a need for primary research to assess the effects of antipyretic measures on the treatment of fever in severe malaria. The absence of data to make a direct head-to-head comparison of antipyretic drugs and physical methods calls for the design of randomised control trials to assess these treatment options. An important outcome to incoporate into these trials would be the patients' views with regard to antipyretics leading to faster resolution of symptoms.</P>
<P>Additional information could also be obtained from trials designed to examine fever control in all patients (especially children) with fever living in a malarious area, regardless of the aetiology, and explore malaria infection as a dominant sub-group.</P>
