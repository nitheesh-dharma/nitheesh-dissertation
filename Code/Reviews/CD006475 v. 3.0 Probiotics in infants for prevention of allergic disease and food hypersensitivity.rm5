<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food reactions. Reactions to foods and allergies (including asthma, eczema and hay fever) are common and may be increasing in developed countries. Many infants become sensitised to foods, including infant formula, through their gastrointestinal tract, a process that may be affected by the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Attempts to promote the growth of normal gastrointestinal bacteria and prevent sensitisation to foods have included the use of probiotics. Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and provide a health benefit to the host. This review found that probiotics added to infant feeds may help prevent infant eczema, with one study suggesting the benefit may persist to four years of age. However, concerns regarding the quality of studies, inconsistency of findings between studies, and the fact that the benefits did not persist if restricted to infants with evidence of sensitisation to allergens, suggests that further studies are needed to confirm these results.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The composition of the intestinal microflora may be different in individuals with atopic eczema from those without this condition, and such differences may precede the development of eczema. Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and provide a health benefit to the host. Probiotics added to infant feeds have the potential to prevent sensitisation of infants to dietary allergens. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effect of probiotics given to infants for the prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), EMBASE, PREMEDLINE, abstracts of conference proceedings and citations of published articles, and expert informants. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compare the use of a probiotic to no probiotic; or the use a specific probiotic compared to a different probiotic; or a probiotic with added prebiotic to control. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion. Allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity outcomes were assessed by 6 studies enrolling 2080 infants, but outcomes for only 1549 infants were reported. Studies generally had adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of treatment. However, the findings of this review should be treated with caution due to excess losses in patient follow-up (17% to 61%). Meta-analysis of five studies reporting the outcomes of 1477 infants found a significant reduction in infant eczema (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70, 0.95). However, there was significant and substantial heterogeneity between studies. One study reported that the difference in eczema between groups persisted to 4 years age. When the analysis was restricted to studies reporting atopic eczema (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE), the findings were no longer significant (typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62, 1.02). All studies reporting significant benefits used probiotic supplements containing L. rhamnosus and enrolled infants at high risk of allergy. No other benefits were reported for any other allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcome. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Although there was a reduction in clinical eczema in infants, this effect was not consistent between studies and caution is advised in view of methodological concerns regarding included studies. Further studies are required to determine whether the findings are reproducible. </P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Food hypersensitivity and allergic disease are prevalent and represent a substantial health problem that may be increasing in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-Burr-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burr 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prescott-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prescott 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-Larsen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz Larsen 1996</LINK>). Genetic susceptibility plays a large role in the development of food allergy. Although less than half of those who develop childhood allergic disease have a first degree relative with a history of allergy, the risk of development of allergic diseases increases substantially with a positive family history of allergy. Approximately 10% of children without an allergic first degree relative develop allergic disease compared to 20 - 30% with an allergic first degree relative (parent or sibling) and 40 - 50% with two affected relatives (<LINK REF="REF-Arshad-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arshad 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergmann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergmann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjellman-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjellman 1977</LINK>). The manifestations of allergic disease are age dependent. Infants commonly present with symptoms and signs of atopic eczema, gastrointestinal symptoms and recurrent wheezing. Asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis become prevalent in later childhood. Sensitization to allergens tends to follow a characteristic pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>), with sensitization to food allergens in the first two to three years of life, followed by indoor allergens (e.g. house dust mite and pets) and subsequently outdoor allergens (e.g. rye and timothy grass). The cumulative prevalence of allergic disease in childhood is high, with up to 7 - 8% developing a food allergy, 15 - 20% atopic eczema, and 31 - 34% developing asthma or recurrent wheezing (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). Of these, 7 - 10% will continue to have asthma symptoms beyond five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). Food hypersensitivities affect approximately 6% of infants less than three years of age, with the prevalence decreasing over the first decade (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osterballe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osterballe 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>A major focus of current research is the mechanisms for the development of immune tolerance and allergen sensitization in the fetus and newborn and primary prevention strategies. This review focuses on the evidence for use of probiotics in infants for the prevention of food hypersensitivity and allergic disease. A separate review examines the effects of prebiotics compared to no prebiotics in infants for prevention of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity. Probiotics are live bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and provide a health benefit to the host. They have been defined as "living micro-organisms, which upon ingestion in certain numbers, exert health benefits beyond inherent general nutrition" (<LINK REF="REF-Guarner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarner 1998</LINK>). Probiotics have been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties associated with changes in cytokine expression that could potentially facilitate T1-helper cell immune response (<LINK REF="REF-Heller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudo 1997</LINK>), which could inhibit the development of allergic T2-helper cell response and allergic (IgE) antibody production. Benefits from the use of probiotic bacteria have been found in systematic review of randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2004</LINK>) for the treatment of infectious diarrhoea. Several randomised studies have now demonstrated efficacy from the use of probiotics in infants with active eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Majamaa-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Majamaa 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isolauri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Isolauri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosenfeldt-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenfeldt 2003</LINK>), although not all studies have shown conclusive benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Viljanen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Viljanen 2005</LINK>). Although rare, anecdotal case reports have described infants with sepsis from lactobacillus attributable to probiotic supplementation (<LINK REF="REF-Hammerman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammerman 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>An altered microbial exposure in the gastrointestinal tract may be partly responsible for the increase of allergic diseases in populations with a western lifestyle (<LINK REF="REF-Holt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holt 1997</LINK>). Differences in intestinal microflora are found in infants delivered by caesarean section compared to those delivered vaginally, and in breast fed versus formula fed infants (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>). Breast feeding promotes the colonization of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli that inhibit growth of pathogenic microorganisms and compete with potentially pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and epithelial adhesion sites. The gastrointestinal flora may modulate mucosal physiology, barrier function and systemic immunologic and inflammatory responses (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sudo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudo 1997</LINK>). Food allergy is a manifestation of an abnormal mucosal immune response to ingested dietary antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK> ). The gastrointestinal barrier is a complex physiochemical and cellular barrier. However, some ingested food antigens are absorbed. The efficiency of this gastrointestinal barrier is reduced in the newborn period (<LINK REF="REF-Sampson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sampson 2004</LINK>). Perinatal risk factors reported for asthma and / or allergic disease have included prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Bernsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jaakkola-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaakkola 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raby-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raby 2004</LINK>) and fetal growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Bernsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernsen 2005</LINK>), both of which are associated with an immature and potentially injured gastrointestinal mucosal barrier. The composition of the intestinal microflora may be different in those with atopic eczema, and such differences may precede the development of eczema. The most consistent finding in such studies is a reduced proportion of bifidobacteria species in the faeces of infants with eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Bjorksten-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjorksten 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>) and atopic sensitization (<LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2001a</LINK>), but not in the faeces of children with symptoms of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2005</LINK>). The recognition of the importance of intestinal flora has led to the development of strategies aimed at manipulating bacterial colonization in formula fed infants, including the use of prebiotics and probiotics. </P>
<P>Prevention of allergic disease is divided into primary prevention, the prevention of immunological sensitization (development of IgE antibodies); and secondary prevention, the prevention of allergic disease following sensitization (<LINK REF="REF-Asher-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asher 2004</LINK>). A substantial proportion of infants who develop sensitization will not go on to develop clinical manifestations of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity (<LINK REF="REF-Halken-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halken 2004</LINK>). This review focuses on the prevention of clinical allergic disease (including asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis) and food hypersensitivity, not just sensitization (IgE responses). Since the risk of allergy and food hypersensitivity is affected by heredity, subgroup analysis will examine the effect of probiotics in populations of infants at high risk of allergy or food hypersensitivity separately to infants at low risk or not selected on the basis of heredity. Since breast feeding promotes the colonization of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (<LINK REF="REF-Agostoni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agostoni 2004</LINK>), subgroup analysis will examine the effect of probiotics in human milk fed infants separately to probiotics in formula fed infants. Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth or activity of bacteria in the colon. They can be added to infant formula. In infants, studies have demonstrated significant increases in faecal bifidobacteria in response to formula supplementation with oligosaccharides (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmelzle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmelzle 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Decsi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decsi 2005</LINK>), with one study also demonstrating an increase in lactobacilli (<LINK REF="REF-Moro-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 2002</LINK>). Subgroup analyses was performed to determine if the effect of probiotics is modified by the addition of a prebiotic to infant feeds. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>See: Neonatal Review Group search strategy. The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - February 2007), EMBASE (1980 - February 2007) and CINAHL (1982 - February 2007) and previous reviews including cross references (all articles referenced), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences (Pediatric Academic Societies 1998 - 2007; Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand 1998 - 2007). The MEDLINE search strategy included the following keywords, using the search fields of abstract, MeSH subject headings, exploded subject heading, publication type, subject heading word, text word, and title: A search on all fields for [infant* OR newborn* OR neonat* OR pediatric* OR paediatric*] AND [probiotic* OR Lactobacillus OR Bifidobacterium] was conducted. The search was limited to: [random* OR trial* OR comparative study OR controlled study]. EMBASE was searched using the following terms: 'probiotic$.mp OR Probiotic Agent/exp OR Lactobacillus/exp OR lactobacillus.mp OR Bifidobacterium/exp OR bifidobacterium.mp'. CINAHL was searched using the following terms: '[(probiotic$.mp OR lactobacillus/exp OR lactobacillus.mp OR bifidobacterium/exp OR bifidobacterium.mp) AND (infants OR newborn) AND (clinical trial OR random)]'. No language restrictions were applied. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligibility of studies for inclusion was assessed independently by each review author. The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of the included trials. Quality of the included trials were evaluated in terms of adequacy of randomisation and allocation concealment, blinding of parents or carers and assessors to intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. Each review author extracted the data separately. Data were compared and differences resolved by consensus. The standard methods of the Neonatal Review Group were used to synthesise the data. Effects are expressed as relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data, and weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for continuous data. Data was examined for heterogeneity using the chi-square test for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. The fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis where enrolled infants and interventions are similar and no significant heterogeneity was found. Sources of heterogeneity were explored in subgroup analysis. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The primary outcomes of this review were all manifestations of allergic disease and food hypersensitivity with one study reporting no significant difference in all allergic disease. No studies reported all manifestations of food hypersensitivity. For specific allergies in infants, no significant difference was found overall for gastrointestinal manifestations of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE), cow's milk protein hypersensitivity, cow's milk protein allergy, and urticaria. Meta-analysis of five studies reporting the outcomes of 1477 infants found a significant reduction in infant eczema. However, there was significant and substantial heterogeneity between studies. When the analysis was restricted to studies reporting atopic eczema (confirmed by skin prick test or specific IgE) the findings were no longer significant. One study assessed outcomes up to four years of age and reported that difference in eczema persisted, but there was no significant difference in asthma, allergic rhinitis or cow's milk protein hypersensitivity. Although most studies had adequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinded intervention, nearly all studies had substantial losses to follow up. No study was eligible for inclusion in the prespecified analysis of studies of adequate methodology. </P>
<P>In subgroup analyses, all studies reporting infant and childhood eczema enrolled infants at high risk of allergy and/or food hypersensitivity. No other outcome became significant when analysis was restricted to high risk infants. Only one study reported allergic disease or food hypersensitivity outcomes in infants not selected on the basis of risk for allergy and food hypersensitivity, with no benefits reported for atopic eczema, cow's protein hypersensitivity and cow's protein allergy. One study reported a significant reduction in eczema in exclusively breast fed high risk infants. In infants fed cow's milk formula, significant reductions were reported by one study for eczema and meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in atopic eczema. One study reported no significant difference in any specific allergic disease or food hypersensitivity for infants fed breast milk or an extensively hydrolysed formula. One study reported a significant reduction in eczema and atopic eczema for infants fed a combination of probiotic with prebiotic. Two studies independently reported a significant reductions in eczema in infants for probiotics including L. rhamnosus. One of these studies also reported a significant reduction of eczema in children. One study also reported a significant reduction in infant eczema from a mixture of L. rhamnosus, B. breve, P. propionibacterium and prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide. The incidence of atopic eczema (sensitisation confirmed), but not all clinical eczema, was increased in one study using the probiotic L. acidophillus. No other benefits or harms were reported for specific probiotics. However, the interpretation of results is made more difficult by the different dosing strategies used by different studies. Control group event rates for all allergic disease and eczema were 35%, a rate that is consistent with use of high risk selection criteria based on having a first degree relative with a history of allergy. The review is powered to detect differences in event rates between treatment groups of approximately 5%. Contrary to expectations, the only study enrolling infants that were exclusively breast fed had the highest control group event rate (47%) and reported the highest absolute reduction in eczema (32%). As this study excluded a substantial proportion of infants post-randomisation who were not exclusively breast fed, the results of this analysis should be viewed with caution. Since most other studies included infants both breast and formula fed, no firm conclusions regarding the effect of probiotics in solely formula fed infants can be made. <BR/>
<BR/>No consistent adverse effects on infant growth when on probiotics were reported. No other adverse effects attributable to probiotics were reported. One study in preterm infants reported no episodes of sepsis with probiotic bacteria. To date, treatment with probiotic bacteria appears to be safe, although the studies included in this review have insufficient power to detect uncommon outcomes including sepsis with probiotic bacteria. </P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to infant feeds for prevention of allergic disease or food hypersensitivity. Although there was a reduction in clinical eczema in infants, not all studies showed a benefit and caution is advised in view of methodological concerns regarding the studies. To date, studies using L. rhamnosus have been the most homogenous in reporting beneficial outcomes. Further studies are required to determine whether the finding of reduced eczema persists over a longer period of time, applies to other manifestations of allergic disease and / or food hypersensitivity, is associated with reductions in allergen sensitisation, and is reproducible. Future studies should enrol infants at high risk of allergy or food hypersensitivity, consider using preparations of probiotics that have been reported to produce a reduction in infant eczema and compare groups with and without an added prebiotic. </P>
