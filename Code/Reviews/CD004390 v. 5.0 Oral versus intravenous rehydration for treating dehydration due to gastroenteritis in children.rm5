<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Children with dehydration due to gastroenteritis need to be rehydrated, and this review did not show any important differences between giving fluids orally or intravenously</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Dehydration is when body water content is reduced causing dry skin, headaches, sunken eyes, dizziness, confusion, and sometimes death. Children with dehydration due to gastroenteritis need rehydrating either by liquids given by mouth or a tube through the nose, or intravenously. The review of 17 trials (some funded by drug companies) found that the trials were not of high quality; however the evidence suggested that there are no clinically important differences between giving fluids orally or intravenously. For every 25 children treated with fluids given orally, one child would fail and require intravenous rehydration. Further, the results for low osmolarity solutions, the currently recommended treatment by the World Health Organization, showed a lower failure rate for oral rehydration that was not significantly different from that of intravenous rehydration. Oral rehydration should be the first line of treatment in children with mild to moderate dehydration with intravenous therapy being used if the oral route fails. The evidence showed that there may be a higher risk of paralytic ileus with oral rehydration while intravenous therapy carries the risk of phlebitis (ie inflammation of the veins).</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dehydration associated with gastroenteritis is a serious complication. Oral rehydration is an effective and inexpensive treatment, but some physicians prefer intravenous methods.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare oral with intravenous therapy for treating dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis in children.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (March 2006), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006), EMBASE (1974 to March 2006), LILACS (1982 to March 2006), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and relevant organizations.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT) with oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in children up to 18 years of age with acute gastroenteritis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:51:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Jadad score. We expressed dichotomous data as a risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT), and continuous data as a mean difference (MD). We used meta-regression for subgroup analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventeen trials (1811 participants), of poor to moderate quality, were included. There were more treatment failures with ORT (RD 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 7, random-effects model; 1811 participants, 18 trials; NNT = 25). Six deaths occurred in the IVT group and two in the ORT groups (4 trials). There were no significant differences in weight gain (369 participants, 6 trials), hyponatremia (248 participants, 2 trials) or hypernatremia (1062 participants, 10 trials), duration of diarrhea (960 participants, 8 trials), or total fluid intake at six hours (985 participants, 8 trials) and 24 hours (835 participants, 7 trials). Shorter hospital stays were reported for the ORT group (WMD -1.20 days, 95% CI -2.38 to -0.02 days; 526 participants, 6 trials). Phlebitis occurred more often in the IVT group (NNT 50, 95% CI 25 to 100) and paralytic ileus more often in the ORT group (NNT 33, 95% CI 20 to 100, fixed-effect model), but there was no significant difference between ORT using the low osmolarity solutions recommended by the World Health Organization and IVT (729 participants, 6 trials).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Although no clinically important differences between ORT and IVT, the ORT group did have a higher risk of paralytic ileus, and the IVT group was exposed to risks of intravenous therapy. For every 25 children (95% CI 14 to 100) treated with ORT one would fail and require IVT.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gastroenteritis is an illness characterized by the acute onset of diarrhea, which may or may not be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>). It can be caused by a variety of infectious agents including bacteria and viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Armon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 2000</LINK>). Acute diarrhea refers to the passage of loose or watery stools, usually at least three times per 24 hours, and lasting less than 14 days; the consistency of stools being more important than the frequency.</P>
<P>Mild cases of gastroenteritis are usually self-limiting and may cause mild dehydration, which can be treated or prevented by continued feeding and drinking more fluids. Children who lose a large volume of liquid stool may develop moderate or severe dehydration; in the most severe cases this can lead to death. These children should be given rehydration therapy in order to restore the lost fluids and electrolytes.</P>
<P>Worldwide, 12% of deaths among children less than five years are due to diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2000</LINK>). In low-income and middle-income countries, an estimated 1.8 million children below the age of five years die of diarrhea each year (<LINK REF="REF-Bern-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bern 1992</LINK>). Almost 50% of these deaths are due to dehydration and most affect children less than one year of age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>). Children in high-income countries are also affected by diarrhea. In the USA, for example, each year there are roughly 21.5 to 38 million episodes of diarrhea among the 16.5 million children under the age of five years (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1991</LINK>). Diarrhea accounts for an estimated 2.1 to 3.7 million physician visits per year (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1991</LINK>) and 9% to 10% of all hospital admissions of children under the age of 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gangarosa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gangarosa 1992</LINK>). Approximately one per 15,000 children born in the USA or one per 500 children hospitalized with gastrointestinal illness will die of their illness (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Widespread use of oral rehydration salt (ORS) solutions began in the 1970s as an effective and inexpensive method of treating diarrhea in low-income and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1992</LINK>). The basis for their use lies in the knowledge that glucose enhances sodium and water absorption in the bowel, even during diarrhea (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1992</LINK>). There are a number of ORS solutions that vary in terms of their electrolyte and carbohydrate concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Santosham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 1991</LINK>). The World Health Organization recommends a specific formulation of ORS solution for both rehydration and maintenance of hydration (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2002</LINK>). It has an osmolarity similar to that of plasma and contains citrate to correct metabolic acidosis and a glucose concentration that allows maximum absorption of sodium and water.</P>
<P>Despite its success and proven efficacy (<LINK REF="STD-Gavin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gavin 1996</LINK>), and recommendations for use by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>), oral rehydration therapy (ORT) continues to be less frequently used by family physicians and pediatricians in North America, where intravenous therapy (IVT) is more in vogue (<LINK REF="REF-Snyder-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snyder 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ozuah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ozuah 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>IVT, usually with normal saline or Ringer's lactate (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>), is familiar to physicians and is rapid and effective in promptly reversing cases of hypovolemic (low blood volume) shock. Since it must be administered in an outpatient or inpatient setting by specially trained staff, it is expensive in terms of money and human resources. In addition, IVT is a traumatic experience for most children and is known to have complications related to rapid over correction of electrolyte imbalances (WHO 1995), leaking of solutions into surrounding tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1992</LINK>), and infection or inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Garland-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garland 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>ORT is colloquially used in the literature as a substitute for the perhaps more appropriate term enteral rehydration therapy. It is important to note that rehydration can be provided enterally in two manners: orally or via nasogastric tube. Although ORT is not widely popular in developed countries because it is thought to take extra time and effort (<LINK REF="REF-Goepp-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goepp 1993</LINK>), it has many advantages. If administered by mouth, it is less traumatic to the child and can be administered by caregivers in a variety of settings including the home (<LINK REF="STD-Mackenzie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mackenzie 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>). Research has shown ORT to be less expensive than IVT and to be associated with lower hospital admission rates and shorter lengths of stay (<LINK REF="STD-Listernick-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Listernick 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gremse-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gremse 1995</LINK>). ORT is not recommended if the child has paralytic ileus or glucose malabsorption (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1992</LINK>; WHO 1995), which are rare events. In both these clinical scenarios, fluid remains in the gut lumen rather than being absorbed into the intravascular space where the body can use it. Further delivery of fluid then just causes abdominal distention.</P>
<P>In 1996, Gavin and colleagues published the results of a meta-analysis that evaluated the efficacy of glucose-based ORT among well-nourished children in developed countries (<LINK REF="STD-Gavin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gavin 1996</LINK>). The review included six studies that compared ORT with IVT and seven studies that compared ORS solutions with different sodium contents. They found that failure of ORT (defined as the need to revert to IVT) varied among trials, ranging from 0% to 18.8% with an overall failure rate of 3.6% (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 5.8). They found no significant difference in failure between different ORS solutions. They also found no higher risk of iatrogenic hypernatremia or hyponatremia with ORT compared with IVT and no significant differences in failure rates between inpatients and outpatients. The authors suggested that ORT may, in fact, be associated with more favourable outcomes such as increased weight gain and shorter duration of diarrhea.</P>
<P>The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) at the University of York, England critically appraised the <LINK REF="STD-Gavin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gavin 1996</LINK> review. While there was little detail in the paper on the individual studies reviewed and some aspects of the methods used for the review, the appraisal concluded that sufficient information was presented to suggest that the findings were likely reliable (<LINK REF="REF-DARE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DARE 2002</LINK>). In addition, we evaluated the review by applying Oxman and Guyatt's index of the scientific quality of research overviews (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1991</LINK>). The weaknesses identified by the Oxman and Guyatt index included the limited search (MEDLINE up to 1993 and contact with organizations and content experts; English language articles only) and the lack of assessment and consideration of the validity of the included studies. The purpose of the present review is to update and build on the work started by Gavin and colleagues by increasing the scope (countries of all income levels, method of administration of ORT) and comprehensiveness (broader search strategy, inclusion not limited by language of publication or publication status), and by assessing the risk of bias in the included studies.</P>

<P>Acute gastroenteritis was defined as the rapid onset of diarrhea (lasting less than 14 days) with or without nausea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>). Diarrhea is the passage of loose or watery stools, usually with increased frequency and volume (<LINK REF="REF-Baldassano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baldassano 1991</LINK>). Dehydration due to diarrhea is a "deficiency of water and salt" (<LINK REF="REF-Santosham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santosham 1991</LINK>), and is most often assessed in terms of the percentage of weight lost during the dehydrating episode (<LINK REF="REF-Armon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armon 2000</LINK>). The severity of dehydration can be classified as mild (3% to 5%), moderate (6% to 9%), or severe (10% or greater) (<LINK REF="REF-Duggan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duggan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-AAP-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1996</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since we had frequent zero event rates (per group, per trial), we expressed dichotomous data (eg failure of treatment) as a risk difference (RD) rather than using a relative measure that would force the trial data to be omitted or approximated (adding ½ to each 2 x 2 table cell) (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005a</LINK>). We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to help clarify the degree of benefit for the baseline intravenous risk. We calculated baseline risks using the same weights calculated from the risk difference analyses. We converted continuous data to a mean difference and then calculated an overall mean difference. We analyzed the results in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-4.2" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 4.2</LINK> using a random-effects model and presented all estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analyzed the longitudinal outcome of total fluid intake for two time points: six and 24 hours. One trial assessed total fluid intake at four hours (<LINK REF="STD-Spandorfer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Spandorfer 2005</LINK>), while two trials assessed total fluid intake at eight hours (<LINK REF="STD-Santosham-1982i" TYPE="STUDY">Santosham 1982i</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santosham-1982ii" TYPE="STUDY">Santosham 1982ii</LINK>); these trials were included in the analysis for total fluid intake at six hours.</P>
<P>We quantified statistical heterogeneity using the <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We assessed possible sources of heterogeneity by subgroup analyses meta-regressing (using <LINK REF="REF-Stata-7.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 7.0</LINK>) on the primary outcome measure (failure to rehydrate). We examined several participant subgroups: inpatient or outpatient status; participant age; state of nourishment; extent of dehydration; country's income status; route of administration (oral versus nasogastric); and type of ORS solution. We also examined several other subgroups: Jadad score; allocation concealment; funding source; and intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>The relationship between the osmolarity of the ORT solution and failure to rehydrate was explored using a chi-square subgroup test (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>). We calculated osmolarity based on the reported constituent concentrations in the solutions (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). We also examined the choice of model for sensitivity to the results (eg Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model). We performed intention-to-treat analyses for our primary outcome measure (failure to rehydrate). After viewing the trials, we created a more homogeneous failure definition and applied it to each article in order to check the robustness of the primary results (ie using failure to rehydrate as defined in the trials). The decision to examine persistent vomiting as an exclusion criterion was selected post hoc for subgroup analysis; all other subgroups were specified a priori. We identified and explored all statistical outliers.</P>
<P>We tested for publication bias using the funnel plot visually and quantitatively using the rank correlation test (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>), weighted regression (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), and the trim-and-fill method (<LINK REF="REF-Duval-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duval 2001</LINK>) in <LINK REF="REF-Stata-7.0" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 7.0</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup and sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We explored participant status (inpatient versus outpatient), state of nourishment (well nourished versus some malnourished), country's income (low-middle income versus high-income; <LINK REF="REF-UN-Statistics" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN Statistics</LINK>), funding source (funded versus not reported), allocation concealment (adequate versus unclear), and Jadad scores (0, 1, 2) in a meta-regression using failure to rehydrate as the dependent variable. None were found to be statistically significant (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). The remaining a priori subgroup comparisons were not reported by subgroup (age and extent of dehydration) and could not be analyzed. Although two trials reported that more than 20% of participants were severely dehydrated (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tamer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tamer 1985</LINK>), neither was considered an outlier.</P>
<P>The definition of "failure" varied by study. We evaluated the sensitivity of a more homogeneous definition in which we limited failures to children with persistent vomiting, having some level of dehydration persisting, and experiencing shock or seizures. (We excluded children with paralytic ileus, intussusception, cerebral palsy, septicemia, urinary tract infection, and duodenal ulcer from this analysis.) This post hoc failure definition was statistically significant and favoured IVT for the fixed-effect model (RD 2%, 95% CI +0 to 4) but not for the random-effects model (RD 2%, 95% CI -0 to 4) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The heterogeneity was also reduced using our homogeneous definition (from 70% to 37%). Subsequently participants who had withdrawn or dropped out (only ORT participants) were reclassified as failures, as in a worst-case intention-to-treat analysis. With this analysis, there were statistically significant differences in failure rate between treatment groups that favored the IVT group when analyzed using the fixed-effect model (RD 3%, 95% CI 1 to 5) and the random-effects model (RD 3%, 95% CI 0 to 5) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Heterogeneity was also reduced using this intention-to-treat analysis (from 70% to 48.1%).</P>
<P>Since one of the assumptions for performing a meta-regression was not met (ie the constant variance assumption), we did not explore the osmolarity subgroups with this method. Instead, we divided the trials into low osmolarity (range 208 to 270 mOsmol/L) and high osmolarity (range 299 to 331 mOsmol/L) subgroups; these cut-offs were defined post hoc based on those used in another review (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2001</LINK>). The difference found by the chi-square subgroup test (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2001</LINK>) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001). The risk difference for the low osmolarity group was 1% (95% CI -1 to 2) and it was homogeneous (<I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> 0%); for the high osmolarity group, the risk difference was 5% (95% CI 1 to 8) and had some heterogeneity (<I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> 31.7%) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>We used meta-regression to examine further subgroups: inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants with persistent vomiting (post-hoc) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) as well as the route of ORT administration (nasogastric versus oral versus a combination) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). Neither analysis resulted in statistically significant differences, although the analysis stratified by whether or not the trial excluded participants with persistent vomiting suggests that there may be differences given sufficient power.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>The rank correlation test did not indicate any publication bias (r = 23, P = 0.41). The weighted regression analysis did show a significant indication of funnel plot asymmetry (bias = 0.9, P = 0.02). The trim-and-fill method indicated five missing studies; the adjustment to overall effect size rendered the new estimate non-significant by moving it closer to the null (RD 2%, 95% CI -1 to 4). The funnel plot appears somewhat asymmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>); publication bias may be present suggesting that missing studies are more likely to favour ORT.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:54:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most conservative model showed no important clinical differences in failure to rehydrate between ORT and IVT in terms of efficacy (RD 4%, fixed-effect model). For every 25 children treated with ORT, one would fail and require IVT (ie NNT = 25, CI 14 to 100). These overall findings are similar to those found in an earlier review (<LINK REF="STD-Gavin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gavin 1996</LINK>). The results were consistent among different populations, such as children with different states of nourishment. Moreover the results for low osmolarity solutions, the currently recommended treatment by the World Health Organization, showed a lower failure rate for ORT that was not significantly different from the failure rate of IVT (RD 1%, NNT = 100). These results support existing practice guidelines recommending ORT with a low osmolarity solution as the first course of treatment in children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis. A cumulative meta-graph, which adds studies by ascending year, showed that the overall estimate is unlikely to change substantially with further trials (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Overall we studied more than 1800 children providing adequate power to support the observed results.</P>
<P>Most trials were small and of poor to moderate quality. The median quality score according to the Jadad scale was two. Because it is impossible to double blind studies on this topic, the quality of studies was limited to a maximum of three (rather than five). It is important to note that studies that are not double blind can lead to an overestimate of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Colditz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colditz 1989</LINK>) and that this is an inherent limitation in this body of literature. While double blinding is probably not feasible in a trial comparing IVT and ORT, allocation can always be properly concealed. Allocation concealment was unclear in all but two trials; this can lead to an overestimate of treatment effects by as much as 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). These factors could skew the results in favour of either ORT or IVT depending on the biases of the investigators.</P>
<P>Additionally, adverse events were not systematically sought in most of the trials. Though this meta-analysis had adequate power to support the efficacy of ORT, it lacks the power to detect serious but rare adverse events in either treatment group. However, analysis of the currently available data suggests that ORT and IVT are similar in safety profiles. Based on two trials, paralytic ileus occurred significantly more often in the ORT group (using the fixed-effect but not random-effects model); however it would not be deemed common enough to discourage the use of ORT. Further there was a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of phlebitis, but phlebitis cannot occur when an IV is not used, thus the statistical significance does not equate to a clinically important difference.<BR/>
<BR/>In applying the evidence to clinical practice, the objective output of the meta-analysis must be weighed with other less easily measured factors that support the use of ORT. On a theoretical basis, IVT should be able to replace the fluid already lost, as well as keep up with the ongoing losses even if those losses are through vomiting, diarrhea, or third spacing within the lumen of the gut. For IVT to be effective, the correct fluid and rate needs to be chosen, for errors in either of these parameters can lead to harm as severe as death. IVT is viewed as the gold standard for children in shock or with severe dehydration, and most of the papers reviewed excluded children from their studies on this basis. Besides the complication of IVT fluid type and rate, starting an intravenous intervention causes pain, the attempt can be unsuccessful, phlebitis (inflammation of the vein) can occur, a cellulitis can result and the intravenous can go interstitial resulting in the intravenous fluid going into the immediate surrounding tissue rather than into the vein and therefore the intravascular space. ORT can be performed by almost anyone with very little training and has the advantage that a child's thirst can moderate the quantity and rate of fluid administration. It does not work if the fluid is not being absorbed by the gut (paralytic ileus), and in some cases, the rate of diarrhea increases as oral fluid rate increases so that the child remains in a net negative fluid balance. Once the ORT is administered via a nasogastric tube, some of the theoretical advantages of ORT disappear, and some theoretical disadvantages need to be considered. The child is no longer able to control the rate or amount of fluid intake and so operator errors may occur just as they do with IVT. Errors in placement of the nasogastric tube can occur; the most severe of these is passing the nasogastric tube into the trachea so that the fluid is going into the lungs rather than the stomach. The passing of a nasogastric tube can result in a bleeding nose and discomfort. The tube does not always pass easily on the first attempt. There is evidence to suggest that ORT is less costly than IVT and can be administered as rapidly (<LINK REF="STD-Nager-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Nager 2002</LINK>). A randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that the use of ORT in a high-income country pediatric emergency department resulted in statistically significantly lower costs, less time spent in the emergency department, and a more favorable impression of caregivers for this form of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Atherly_x002d_John-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Atherly-John 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Though there was little statistical heterogeneity between trials on failure to rehydrate when the outlying trial was omitted (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1988</LINK>) (<I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> 43%), there were important clinical variations and large heterogeneity in most of the secondary outcomes. Rehydration was accomplished at different rates, by different routes, and with various solutions in different populations. Comparisons of different oral rehydration solutions have been the subject of other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2001</LINK>). A meta-analysis comparing reduced osmolarity ORT (&lt; 270 mOsmol/L) with the standard solution (311 mOsmol/L) showed that unscheduled intravenous infusion was statistically significantly less in the reduced osmolarity group (odds ratio 0.59, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.79) (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2001</LINK>). Our post-hoc (between-study) analysis comparing low and high osmolarity solutions supported these findings.</P>
<P>Another source of variation was the definition of "treatment failure". We examined the effect of different treatment failure definitions through a post hoc refined definition analysis and found that it reduced heterogeneity and the therapeutic benefits of IVT as compared with ORT (from 4% to 2%). The intention-to-treat version of this model involved reclassifying seven ORT withdrawals as failures; this model also reduced heterogeneity and benefits for IVT (from 4% to 3%). If the seven withdrawals were systematically related to treatment benefit, then this intention-to-treat analysis is less biased.</P>
<P>One trial had a statistically significantly greater failure rate (<LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1988</LINK>). The trial authors attributed it to the fact that many of the children who failed were younger than six months of age. (This trial was the only one to include neonates.) The authors argued that the burden of illness can be more severe in younger infants. Our data neither prove nor disprove this statement. When we removed this trial from the analysis, the remaining trial results were homogeneous and the overall risk difference shifted towards the null.</P>
<P>The results may not be generalizable to all children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis but may be generalizable only to those with dehydration secondary to diarrhea. The reader must also recognize that most of the trials excluded children in shock, severe dehydration, and paralytic ileus since IVT is the indicated treatment for these clinical scenarios. A post hoc look between trials with different inclusion and exclusion criteria suggests that there may be an important difference in response to ORT among participants that vomited and did not vomit. The risk difference for trials that excluded participants with persistent vomiting was 0% (95% CI -3 to 3) as compared with 4% (95% CI -5 to 13) in trials that did not exclude such participants (Analysis 01.17). The issue of how vomiting affects the efficacy of ORT needs further study. However, in practice treatment failure only means than one switches to IVT.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There were no important clinical differences between ORT and IVT for rehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis in children. It seems reasonable that children presenting for medical care with mild to moderate dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis should initially be treated with ORT. Should treatment fail, then IVT may be used. In children who have persistent vomiting, ORT may be used, but the child must be closely observed for proof of successful treatment. </P>
<P>For every 25 children treated with ORT, one would fail and require IVT. Clinicians and families need to apply this evidence to individual situations in order to decide whether they are willing to accept this minimal risk.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research comparing ORT and IVT for children with dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis is not warranted and may be unethical. If undertaken, further research should focus on evaluating the efficacy of nasogastric rehydration in children who have persistent vomiting.</P>

<LI>We used risk difference for our primary outcome instead of risk ratio because we have too many trials with zeros in both treatment groups; we did say how we would calculate baseline risk in the protocol, and we are simply expanding upon this.</LI>
<LI>Our primary analysis changed from using the fixed-effect model to the random-effects model before we looked at the data; this change was based on the comments from statisticians in Cochrane's Statistical Methods Group.</LI>
<LI>We chose to use the I-squared statistic rather than the chi-square test for heterogeneity based on comments from statisticians in Cochrane's Statistical Methods Group.</LI>
<LI>Heterogeneity is always present, but it may not always be quantifiable (too small). We used the fixed-effect model in the sensitivity analyses to give a sense of whether the treatment effect may ever be significant, because the random-effects model may be biased when there is funnel plot asymmetry, and for a conservative approach to an equivalence hypothesis if there could be one.</LI>
<LI>Omitting the trim-and-fill method from the protocol was an oversight.</LI>
<LI>We added the participant subgroup inpatient/outpatient status before looking at the data, but after the protocol was published.</LI>
<LI>We added 'sodium intake and sodium levels' as an outcome measure; since hyponatremia and hypernatremia were part of the protocol, this makes sodium levels and intake relevant, and we therefore chose to include this outcome measure post-hoc as it was frequently reported in the included trials.</LI>
