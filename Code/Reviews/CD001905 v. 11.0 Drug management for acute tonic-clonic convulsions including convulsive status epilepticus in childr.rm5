The review also investigated whether different anticonvulsant drugs were accompanied by less frequent or different serious side effects.</P><P><B>Background</B></P><P>Tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus are medical emergencies. In children, the first anticonvulsant drug is usually given in the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Department of a hospital. This drug may be administered in a number of ways, including into a vein (intravenously), into the mouth and between the cheeks (buccally), into the nostrils (intranasally) or into the rectum (rectally). The first-choice drug should be effective, work rapidly and not be associated with any serious adverse effects. Research is important to try and find the most effective and the safest anticonvulsant drug in this clinical situation.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We carried out a review of all available and relevant evidence on the effectiveness and safety of anticonvulsant drugs used in the first-line treatment of tonic-clonic convulsions in children who attended hospital A&amp;E departments. This review examined data from 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs); RCTs provide the most reliable evidence. They investigated the use of different anticonvulsant drugs and given by different routes.</P><P><B>Key Results </B></P><P>The review included 18 RCTs involving 2199 children, and investigated many different anticonvulsant drugs, doses of the drugs and routes of administration of the drugs. The studies also had some differences in their designs, their settings and the populations of children included, in terms of their ages and their clinical situation (such as how long their convulsion had been going on when they were recruited into the trial).</P><P>Analysis of two trials found no clear evidence of a different effect between intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam in stopping a tonic-clonic convulsion taken to an Emergency Department. There is uncertainty about whether buccal midazolam is more effective than rectal diazepam as the first management of a tonic-clonic convulsion or convulsive status epilepticus when intravenous access is unavailable. There is no good evidence that the intranasal route is as effective as the intravenous route. Consequently there is no evidence that it can be used as an alternative route of administration.</P><P>Although medications such as midazolam, lorazepam and paraldehyde can reduce breathing rates, this is not a common complication and was not seen very often in the included studies. Rates of serious side effects of these medications are generally very low.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Many of the trials used different drugs, different dosages and different routes of administration. This has to be taken into account when looking at the overall conclusion of this review. Most of the trials took place in large children&#8217;s hospitals or in large children&#8217;s departments in a general hospital. This means that the results found in this review are probably relevant for similar clinical situations throughout the world.</P><P>The quality of the evidence provided in this review ranged from very low to high. The quality of the evidence provided for some outcomes is low to very low, due to imprecise results where limited information was available for analysis. There were also variability and problems within the designs of some studies, which may have influenced the findings. The quality of evidence was lower in some study settings which were specific to the country in which they were conducted, so the results may not reflect clinical practice worldwide.</P><P>The evidence is current to May 2017.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-11-30 10:34:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-14 12:29:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus (currently defined as a tonic-clonic convulsion lasting at least 30 minutes) are medical emergencies and require urgent and appropriate anticonvulsant treatment. International consensus is that an anticonvulsant drug should be administered for any tonic-clonic convulsion that has been continuing for at least five minutes. Benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam) are traditionally regarded as first-line drugs and phenobarbital, phenytoin and paraldehyde as second-line drugs.

We contacted study authors for additional information.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-11-30 10:34:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The review includes 18 randomised trials involving 2199 participants, and a range of drug treatment options, doses and routes of administration (rectal, buccal, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous). The studies vary by design, setting and population, both in terms of their ages and also in their clinical situation. We have made many comparisons of drugs and of routes of administration of drugs in this review; our key findings are as follows:</P><P>(1) This review provides only low- to very low-quality evidence comparing buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam for the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions (risk ratio (RR) for seizure cessation 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.38; 4 trials; 690 children). However, there is uncertainty about the effect and therefore insufficient evidence to support its use. There were no included studies which compare intranasal and buccal midazolam.</P><P>(2) Buccal and intranasal anticonvulsants were shown to lead to similar rates of seizure cessation as intravenous anticonvulsants, e.g. intranasal lorazepam appears to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13; 1 trial; 141 children; high-quality evidence) and intranasal midazolam was equivalent to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; 2 trials; 122 children; moderate-quality evidence). </P><P>(3) Intramuscular midazolam also showed a similar rate of seizure cessation to intravenous diazepam (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09; 2 trials; 105 children; low-quality evidence). </P><P>(4) For intravenous routes of administration, lorazepam appears to be as effective as diazepam in stopping acute tonic clonic convulsions: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; 3 trials; 414 children; low-quality evidence. Furthermore, we found no statistically significant or clinically important differences between intravenous midazolam and diazepam (RR for seizure cessation 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.21; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence) or intravenous midazolam and lorazepam (RR for seizure cessation 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; 1 trial; 80 children; moderate-quality evidence). In general, intravenously-administered anticonvulsants led to more rapid seizure cessation but this was usually compromised by the time taken to establish intravenous access.<BR/><BR/>(5) There is limited evidence from a single trial to suggest that intranasal lorazepam may be more effective than intramuscular paraldehyde in stopping acute tonic-clonic convulsions (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.52; 160 children; moderate-quality evidence).</P><P>(6) Adverse side effects were observed and reported very infrequently in the included studies. Respiratory depression was the most common and most clinically relevant side effect and, where reported, the frequency of this adverse event was observed in 0% to up to 18% of children. None of the studies individually demonstrated any difference in the rates of respiratory depression between the different anticonvulsants or their different routes of administration; but when pooled, three studies (439 children) provided moderate-quality evidence that lorazepam was significantly associated with fewer occurrences of respiratory depression than diazepam (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93).</P><P>Much of the evidence provided in this review is of mostly moderate to high quality. However, the quality of the evidence provided for some important outcomes is low to very low, particularly for comparisons of non-intravenous routes of drug administration. Low- to very low-quality evidence was provided where limited data and imprecise results were available for analysis, methodological inadequacies were present in some studies which may have introduced bias into the results, study settings were not applicable to wider clinical practice, and where inconsistency was present in some pooled analyses.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-14 12:38:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We have not identified any new high-quality evidence on the efficacy or safety of an anticonvulsant in stopping an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that would inform clinical practice. There appears to be a very low risk of adverse events, specifically respiratory depression. Intravenous lorazepam and diazepam appear to be associated with similar rates of seizure cessation and respiratory depression. Although intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam lead to more rapid seizure cessation, the time taken to obtain intravenous access may undermine this effect. In the absence of intravenous access, buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam are therefore acceptable first-line anticonvulsants for the treatment of an acute tonic-clonic convulsion that has lasted at least five minutes. There is no evidence provided by this review to support the use of intranasal midazolam or lorazepam as alternatives to buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2017-12-19 11:54:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-11-14 15:54:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 3, 2008; <LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2008</LINK>).</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-11-14 15:54:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) is a medical and neurological emergency and if under- or inappropriately treated may result in death or significant morbidity. Convulsive status epilepticus is defined as more than 30 minutes of either continuous seizure activity or two or more sequential seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2016</LINK>). The 30-minute definition is based on the duration of convulsive status epilepticus that may lead to irreversible neuronal injury. Since most seizures are brief, and once a seizure lasts more than five minutes it is likely to be prolonged (<LINK REF="REF-Shinnar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinnar 2001</LINK>), status treatment protocols are based on a five-minute definition to minimise both the risk of seizures reaching 30 minutes and potential adverse outcomes associated with treating brief, self-resolving tonic-clonic convulsions. It is generally believed that the longer the episode of CSE, the more difficult it is to stop.</P><P>When the exact time of onset or duration of the convulsion is not known, any person presenting to the A&amp;E department in an acute tonic-clonic convulsion tends to be managed according to the definition of status epilepticus, with the primary objective of stopping the convulsion, irrespective of its duration. Most published national and international guidance, including from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>), the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) (<LINK REF="REF-Trinka-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trinka 2015</LINK>) and the American Epilepsy Society (AES) (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2016</LINK>), recommend treating a tonic-clonic seizure after five minutes. This is because in over 90% of cases a tonic-clonic seizure will end spontaneously within four minutes; it is assumed and likely that a seizure that has continued for more than four minutes will not stop spontaneously.</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-11-14 15:54:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Twenty-five years ago, the first drug used to treat an acute tonic-clonic convulsion in children was usually administered in the A&amp;E department (<LINK REF="REF-Garr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garr 1999</LINK>). However it is now more common that parents/carers of children with either prolonged or recurrent (serial) convulsions are prescribed &#8216;rescue&#8217; medications, such as rectal diazepam or buccal/intranasal midazolam to administer at home (or even at school). An epidemiological study published in 2008 demonstrated that 61% of episodes of convulsive status epilepticus in children were treated with pre-hospital emergency medication and predominantly rectal diazepam (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2008</LINK>). Over-treatment may be as potentially damaging as under-treatment by causing respiratory depression/arrest (with a risk of consequent cerebral hypoxia) or a potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-11-14 12:44:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Convulsive status epilepticus is a medical and neurological emergency that may result in death or significant morbidity.

The study was carried out in Malawi, Africa. Intramuscular paraldehyde is commonly used as a first-line treatment for acute tonic-clonic seizures in sub-Saharan Africa but is associated with injury around the injection site, sterile abscesses and is incompatible with plastics. Patient demographics were similar in each group. Because of the geographical location of this study most of the children had acute symptomatic seizures, mainly due to acute brain infection (cerebral malaria or bacterial meningitis in two-thirds of each of the two study groups). Randomisation was allocated in advance by computer in blocks of 10; after identification and treatment of children with hypoglycaemic seizures, investigators opened an unmarked envelope which contained details of treatment allocation. Primary outcome was the clinical cessation of the seizure within 10 minutes of drug administration. Children with features of hepatic or hypertensive encephalopathy or organophosphate poisoning were excluded, as were children who had received an anticonvulsant agent within one hour of presentation. For children in whom clinical seizure activity continued after 10 minutes, investigators followed a locally-agreed protocol. The study evaluated 160 children of both sexes.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1995</LINK> was a one-year open, quasi-randomised study, comparing lorazepam and diazepam, with the drugs given either intravenously or rectally depending on ease of venous access. This study evaluated 102 children, aged between one month and 16 years, of both sexes, presenting with an acute tonic-clonic convulsion including established convulsive status epilepticus to an A&amp;E department of a large children's hospital. The study accepted all causes of the convulsion or status, including symptomatic and idiopathic. No child had evidence of acute head trauma, metabolic encephalopathy, bacterial meningitis or herpes simplex encephalitis as a cause of their presenting convulsion. No children were included with known pseudo-tonic-clonic convulsions or pseudo-convulsive, absence or complex partial status. The demography of the two treatment groups was very similar (age; sex; numbers with pre-existing epilepsy; numbers with a pre-existing neurological disorder and duration of the presenting convulsion prior to treatment with the two study drugs). Cessation of the seizure was defined as the seizure or episode of status stopping within seven or eight minutes of administration of the first dose of the study anticonvulsant. If the presenting convulsion had not stopped by eight minutes, then a second dose of either lorazepam or diazepam would be given. If this seizure persisted, then an additional anticonvulsant would be given, based on the hospital's protocol for managing convulsive status epilepticus (<LINK REF="REF-Garr-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garr 1999</LINK>).</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Arya-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2011</LINK> was a randomised controlled trial comparing intranasal and intravenous (IV) lorazepam for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children. The trial took place in the emergency room of a hospital in New Delhi, India. Inclusion criteria were children aged six to 14 years who presented convulsing or who developed a seizure during the emergency room attendance. Exclusion criteria were receipt of any anti-epileptic drug (AED) within one hour of enrolment, the presence of severe cardiovascular compromise, and the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhoea or upper respiratory infection severe enough to prevent intranasal administration. Fifty-eight children (41%) had GTC, 77 (54%) had partial seizures and six were described as having "others/unclear". The groups were evenly matched for age, gender, seizure type and prior AED administration. The primary outcome measure was cessation of visible motor activity by 10 minutes. Secondary outcome measures were persistent cessation of seizure activity at one hour, time to IV access, time from drug administration to stopping of the seizure and development of hypotension/respiratory depression. Further seizures were treated with intravenous phenytoin.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Ashrafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ashrafi 2010</LINK> was a randomised controlled trial conducted in two large hospitals in Tehran, Iran, comparing buccal midazolam and rectal diazepam for the control of acute convulsive seizures. Ninety-eight children aged more than three months with an acute prolonged seizure lasting more than five minutes and those convulsing while attending the emergency rooms were enrolled, irrespective of the cause of the seizure. Patients who already had intravenous access or who were younger than three months were excluded. Most (84 patients or 86%) had GTC, with the remainder being myoclonic, focal clonic and focal tonic seizures. There was no significant difference between the two groups for age, sex or seizure type. Randomisation was by a random-number table to either buccal midazolam (0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg) or rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). The primary outcome measure was cessation of all motor activity in less than five minutes, without respiratory depression and without another seizure. Further seizures were treated with intravenous diazepam. The outcome measures were further defined as treatment initiation time and drug effect time. The authors also examined the convenience of drug use and parental acceptance of the drug/route of administration for each group.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Baysun-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Baysun 2005</LINK> was a prospective randomised study of all children attending the emergency room of a children's hospital in Turkey with a seizure, regardless of type, aetiology and whether the seizure was prolonged (this was assumed). No exclusion criteria were stated. Forty-three children ranging in age from two months to 12 years were recruited and randomised to buccal midazolam (0.25 mg/kg) on even days of the month and rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg for under-fives and 0.3 mg/kg for those aged six or more) on odd days of the month. The two groups did not differ significantly by sex, age, type of seizures or anti-epileptic drug used. Ten children in the midazolam group and 10 in the diazepam group had GTC. The remaining participants presented with generalised tonic, simple partial and complex partial seizures. Outcome measures were cessation of convulsive seizure activity within 10 minutes, time to response, and need for a second drug. Those who did not respond within 10 minutes were given the alternative drug, i.e. midazolam given to those who had already received diazepam and vice versa.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1997</LINK> was a prospective, open randomised study of the management of children aged 0 to 18 years presenting to the emergency department of two large hospitals in the USA, with motor seizures of at least 10 minutes' duration (all had tonic-clonic or clonic seizures - clarified in personal communication). The study compared intramuscular midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) with intravenous diazepam (0.3 mg/kg). Children who had established intravenous access or who had already received treatment for this seizure episode were excluded. Primary outcome measures were seizure cessation within five minutes of administration, seizure cessation between five and 10 minutes after administration (defined as delayed seizure control), and treatment failure (lack of cessation by 10 minutes). Those who had treatment failure were subsequently given intravenous diazepam or phenytoin. Other outcome measures included recurrence of seizures, defined as early recurrence if within 15 minutes, or recurrence if within 60 minutes. Twenty-eight children were identified for enrolment, but three were excluded as their seizures did not persist beyond 10 minutes. One child who was randomised to diazepam was a protocol violation due to failure to establish intravenous access, necessitating treatment with intramuscular midazolam. Twenty-three children with 24 seizure episodes were studied (one child had two episodes and appears in the study twice, once in each group). The demographics were similar between the two groups.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 2014</LINK> was a large multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted in the emergency departments of 11 North American hospitals, comparing intravenous lorazepam with intravenous diazepam for convulsive status epilepticus in children. Inclusion criteria were children aged three months to 18 years with generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus. This was defined as three or more seizures in the previous hour, two or more successive seizures with no recovery of consciousness with an ongoing seizure, or an ongoing seizure lasting at least five minutes. Children who had initial focal seizures rapidly evolving to bilaterally convulsive seizures were included. Patients with the following factors were excluded: known pregnancy, significant cardiac arrhythmia, urgent need for surgical intervention and anaesthesia, known contraindication to benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine use in the previous seven days (including pre-hospital use by ambulance personnel). "Early terminators" were children removed from the study following administration of the study drug due to discovery of an exclusion factor or a refusal to participate by the family. The study assessed 11,630 patients for eligibility, of whom 11,320 were excluded, mainly because they were not having an acute seizure or did not meet the inclusion criteria. The study randomised 310 children to one of the two study drugs. Twenty-two and 15 children were early terminators from each treatment arm respectively, and were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Further exclusions largely due to protocol deviations resulted in 102 and 107 children being available for per protocol analysis in each treatment arm. The participants in each treatment arm were well-matched in demographics and seizure aetiology. Primary efficacy outcome measures were cessation of status epilepticus (defined as cessation of generalised convulsive activity with return of consciousness within the four-hour observation period) within 10 minutes of the initial dose, and seizure freedom for 30 minutes. Secondary outcome measures included latency of drug response (time to cessation of convulsions), need for a dose of study medication, need for further anticonvulsants and sustained seizure freedom for 60 minutes and four hours. Primary safety outcomes were severe respiratory depression (needing assisted ventilation) within four hours of the study drug administration; secondary safety outcomes were aspiration pneumonia, any degree of respiratory depression, time required to return to baseline mental status, and degree of sedation or agitation as measured by the Riker Sedation-Agitation scale.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Fi_x015f_gin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fi&#351;gin 2002</LINK> was a prospective, randomised, single-centre study of children aged between one month and 13 years, presenting with an acute seizure to the emergency room of a children's hospital in Turkey. All children who were seizing on arrival were included, as it was presumed that their seizure had been ongoing for at least five minutes.No exclusion criteria are stated and the aetiology of the seizures is not given. Of 45 enrolled in the study, 28 children (14 per treatment group) had generalised tonic-clonic seizures, the rest presenting with simple focal (10), secondarily generalised (4), tonic (1) and myoclonic (2) seizures. Both febrile and afebrile seizures were included, although only 10% of the participants had a febrile seizure, and were equally distributed between the two groups. Children were randomised on alternate days to rectal diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) or nasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg). If the seizure continued beyond 10 minutes, the alternative drug was given, i.e. there was cross-over between the two groups. Persistent convulsions (not clearly defined) were treated with intravenous midazolam by bolus, then infusion. Outcome measures were stopping of the seizure within 10 minutes, response time, and necessity for a second drug. There was no significant difference between the two groups for age or seizure type.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Gathwala-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gathwala 2012</LINK> was a randomised controlled trial undertaken in an Indian teaching hospital, comparing intravenous diazepam, midazolam and lorazepam for the treatment of acute convulsive seizures in children. Children aged six months to 14 years presenting with a convulsion to the emergency department were recruited. Children with liver or renal disease, cardiovascular abnormalities, head injury, diabetes mellitus or hypoglycaemia were excluded, as were those whose seizure had already stopped or where intravenous access could not be established. The study assessed 185 children for inclusion, of whom 65 were excluded; 55 did not meet the inclusion criteria, seven declined, and intravenous access could not be established in three. Participants were randomised into three treatment groups, which were evenly matched for demographics, mean duration of seizure, prolonged seizures, those presenting with first episode, and cause of seizure. The primary outcome measure was time to seizure cessation, defined as cessation of visible epileptic phenomena or return of purposeful response to external stimuli within 15 minutes of drug administration. The secondary outcomes were the effects of the drugs, i.e. vomiting, apnoea, somnolence, respiratory depression and requirement for mechanical ventilation. Other secondary outcomes were the number of participants with seizure recurrence, requirement for a second dose of medication, uncontrolled seizures, and the time to seizure recurrence.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Javadzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Javadzadeh 2012</LINK> was a randomised unblinded study of 60 children aged between two months and 15 years, presenting to the emergency department with an acute seizure. Exclusion criteria were patients with prior IV access, previous anticonvulsant treatment, or concurrent respiratory tract infection. Participants were randomised to intranasal midazolam or intravenous diazepam, although all patients were cannulated on arrival. Outcome measures included time needed to control seizure, oxygen saturations, and heart rate pre- and post-treatment.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Lahat-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lahat 2000</LINK> was a 12-month single-centre randomised study comparing intranasal midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and intravenous diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) in the treatment of prolonged febrile seizures (a seizure of at least 10 minutes duration) in children aged six months to five years. The study was carried out in a paediatric emergency department within a general hospital. Patient demographics were similar in both groups. Treatment was successful if the clinical features of the seizure stopped within five minutes. If the seizure stopped at between five and 10 minutes, this was identified as a delayed but successful treatment. Treatment failures (continued seizure activity after 10 minutes) received intravenous diazepam and then phenobarbital in accordance with local guidelines. Randomisation was allocated in advance by a random-number table, with investigators receiving an opaque envelope with each allocation at the time of administration. Forty-four children of both sexes were evaluated, with a total of 52 seizure episodes. Children who had received an anticonvulsant or had an intravenous line sited by paramedics prior to hospital attendance were excluded from the study.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Mahmoudian-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoudian 2004</LINK> is a prospective randomised study of children aged two months to 15 years, presenting with an acute seizure to the paediatric emergency department of a general hospital in Iran over a two-month period. Seventy children who presented with an acute seizure (length not specified) were randomised by an odd- and even-number table to receive 0.2 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam or 0.2 mg/kg of intranasal midazolam. Fifty children presented with GTC, six with simple partial seizures, twelve with complex partial seizures and five with myoclonic seizures (note that multiple seizure types can occur in a single child). Outcome measures were time from treatment to cessation of seizure, with treatment considered successful if the seizure stopped within 10 minutes. Seizures that did not stop within 10 minutes were defined as treatment failures. Treatment failures in the midazolam group were given intravenous diazepam and those in the diazepam group were given intravenous phenobarbitone. Aetiologies of the seizures were reported, and were not evenly distributed between the groups; 14 of the midazolam group versus one of the diazepam group had febrile convulsions, and 10 of the diazepam group versus four in the midazolam group had central nervous system (CNS) infection.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2005</LINK> was a 40-month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial comparing buccal midazolam (approximately 0.5 mg/kg) with rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) as the first-line treatment of children aged six months to 15 years, presenting to a paediatric A&amp;E department with active seizures.The primary outcome measure was clinical cessation of the seizure within 10 minutes of drug administration, without seizure recurrence within one hour and without respiratory depression. Children with partial seizures or non-convulsive status epilepticus were excluded from the trial. Weekly blocks of treatment of either buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam were randomly selected in each of the four participating centres. Participant demographics were similar between groups. Locally-agreed guidelines were followed in the event of continued seizure activity after the 10-minute period. The study evaluated 219 seizure episodes in 177 children of both sexes. Separate results were reported both for total episodes and for first presenting episodes, to minimise potential bias of children with multiple entries. In contrast with the other studies included in the previous review, children were not excluded if they had received anticonvulsant agents prior to their attendance at the A&amp;E department.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Momen-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Momen 2015</LINK> was an unblinded randomised trial of 100 children aged one month to 16 years. Inclusion criteria were children older than one month who were convulsing on arrival. The length of the ongoing seizure was not taken into account, so children with relatively short-lived seizure may have been included. Exclusion criteria were established IV access, prior administration of rectal or nasal benzodiazepines, lack of consent or serial seizures with no recovery of consciousness. In addition, a history of serious adverse reactions to either of the study medications was an exclusion criterion. Participants were randomised to intramuscular midazolam or rectal diazepam. The main outcome measure was seizure cessation without recurrence within 60 minutes. Respiratory rate and blood pressure were also monitored.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Mpimbaza-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mpimbaza 2008</LINK> was a single-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial in a paediatric emergency unit in Kampala, Uganda. The inclusion criteria were children aged three months to 12 years who presented while convulsing or who experienced a seizure that lasted more than five minutes while in the unit, and who had no documented evidence of having received intravenous diazepam or phenobarbitone in the 24 hours before presentation. Children aged less than three months or more than 12 years, who had evidence of prior treatment or whose convulsion stopped prior to treatment, were excluded. The study recruited 330 participants (note that multiple seizure types can occur in a single participant): 269 (82%) had generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 18 had tonic seizures, 61 had focal seizures and three had myoclonic seizures. Participants were randomised by a random-number table to 0.5 mg/kg of rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam. A placebo which was identical in volume and similar in colour was simultaneously given with the study drug. The participants were well-balanced by age, sex, and type of seizure between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes, without recurrence in the subsequent hour. If the convulsion lasted longer than 10 minutes or recurred within one hour, this was considered a treatment failure and the child was given intravenous diazepam. Secondary outcome measures were the proportion with cessation of convulsions within 10 minutes, the proportion with recurrence in the next hour and within 24 hours of initial control, and time to recurrence within these periods.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Shah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2005</LINK> was a prospective controlled quasi-randomised study of the treatment of acute seizures in children in a tertiary general hospital in Mumbai, India, including children presenting to the emergency department and those who were already admitted to the ward or intensive care unit (ICU). The study enrolled 115 children with an acute seizure (definition unclear) over a one-year period in a single centre. Those who had already had treatment for the seizure were excluded. Participants who already had intravenous access were treated with 0.2 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. Those without were randomised to treatment with 0.2 mg/kg of intramuscular midazolam or to the establishment of intravenous access and treatment with intravenous diazepam. Sixty-three children had generalised tonic-clonic seizures, and were equally divided between the two treatment groups. Of the remaining participants, 47 had focal, four had tonic and one had clonic seizures. Outcome measures were mean time to cessation of seizures and the presence of adverse effects. Those who did not respond after five minutes were treated with other "anticonvulsants" (not specified).</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Sreenath-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sreenath 2010</LINK> was a randomised controlled study of the management of convulsive status epilepticus (defined as continuous convulsive activity lasting for five minutes or more) in children presenting to a single centre in North India. Exclusion criteria were treatment with any anti-epileptic medication in the preceding four weeks, acute head trauma, history of poisoning and jaundice, suspected renal failure, or diarrhoea presenting with seizures. The study randomised 178 children aged one to 12 years by computer-generated table to receive lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg or diazepam 0.2 mg/kg. If intravenous access was not present, the drug was given rectally at the same dose. If the seizures recurred within an undefined time frame, a second dose of the same drug was given. The diazepam group were given a loading dose of 18 mg/kg of phenytoin after 15 to 30 minutes, regardless of whether the seizure had recurred. Sixty-three per cent had generalised tonic-clonic seizures, while the rest were tonic (10%), clonic (10%), myoclonic (0.5%), simple partial (2%), complex partial (10%), and partial with secondary generalisation (4%). The majority were therefore generalised convulsive or motor seizures. The primary outcome measure was cessation of seizure activity, with treatment considered successful if this occurred within 10 minutes of the first intervention and without recurrence over the next 18 hours. Secondary outcomes were time taken for initial (presenting) convulsion to stop after administration of the first drug, the number of doses of study drug required to treat the initial convulsion, the use of an additional anti-epileptic drug, the total number of seizures occurring in the first 18 hours following administration of the study drug, the development of respiratory depression, the number of participants requiring transfer to ICU for mechanical ventilation, and the number of participants requiring cross-over to an alternative regimen (i.e. from diazepam to lorazepam and vice versa).</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Talukdar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Talukdar 2009</LINK> was a prospective randomised study of 120 children who attended the paediatric emergency department of a Delhi hospital with a seizure, the length of which was not defined. Those with myoclonic, absence and atonic seizures were excluded. The mean age of the participants was 3.2 years, with 73.3% under five years of age and 53.3% under one year. Seventy-four per cent of the children presented with GTC, while the rest were complex partial or tonic seizures. The groups were not significantly different in age, sex, seizure type or underlying aetiology. Participants were allocated by a random-number table to 0.2 mg/kg of buccal midazolam or 0.3 mg/kg of intravenous diazepam. The primary outcome measure was cessation of all motor activity within or by five minutes of administration of the drug. The drug response was further analysed as treatment initiation time (time from noting seizure to drug administration), drug effect time (time from drug administration to effect) and total controlling time, a combination of the previous two.</P></INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR><EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:38:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We excluded 20 studies from the review for the following reasons (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> for further information):</P><UL><LI>The study evaluated refractory status epilepticus (i.e. children who have failed a first or second treatment for status epilepticus) rather than acute status epilepticus (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arpita-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Arpita 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoudian-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoudian 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehta-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mehta 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mittal-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Mittal 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rosati-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Rosati 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singhi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Singhi 2002</LINK>).</LI></UL><UL><LI>The study was not randomised or did not have a control group, or both (<LINK REF="STD-Kutlu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kutlu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morton-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morton 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Qureshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Qureshi 2002</LINK>).</LI></UL><UL><LI>Fewer than 70% of included participants had GTCs (or it was unclear how many participants had GTCs) (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharyya-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharyya 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonekaboni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Tonekaboni 2012</LINK>).</LI></UL><UL><LI>The study examined drug management for the long-term prevention of recurring febrile seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Camfield-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Camfield 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heckmatt-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Heckmatt 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strengell-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Strengell 2009</LINK>) or clusters of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Cereghino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cereghino 1998</LINK>), rather than management of acute convulsions.</LI></UL><UL><LI>The study was not conducted in a hospital setting (<LINK REF="STD-Holsti-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Holsti 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silbergleit-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Silbergleit 2012</LINK>).</LI></UL><UL><LI>The study was published only as a conference abstract and we could not contact the authors for additional information to assess eligibility (<LINK REF="STD-McCormick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">McCormick 1999</LINK>).</LI></UL></EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR></STUDY_DESCRIPTION><STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:38:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The results of our 'Risk of bias' evaluations are summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>.</P><ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Fourteen studies reported adequate methods for random sequence generation (e.g. computer-generated randomisation, block randomisation, etc.) and we judged them to be at low risk of bias.

A number of the new studies have evaluated and emphasised the use of non-intravenous routes. These have included intranasal, intramuscular and buccal routes. The role of the intramuscular route in children is uncertain, particularly in view of its relatively invasive nature as well as potentially serious complications, including trauma to the sciatic nerve.</P><P>The 18 studies included in this review vary by design, setting and populations, in their ages and also in their clinical situation. We have conducted many comparisons of drugs and of routes of administration of drugs in this review, with the quality of the evidence for each comparison varying from high to very low, depending on the homogeneity and quality of design of the studies contributing to the comparison.</P><P>This update has shown that for intravenous administration, lorazepam and diazepam seem to be associated with similar rates of seizure cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Appleton-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Appleton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gathwala-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Gathwala 2012</LINK>), but risks of bias in the included studies and heterogeneity of design may have confounded the results.</P><P>Two studies in this update have shown that buccal midazolam may be associated with a higher rate of seizure cessation than rectal diazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Ashrafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ashrafi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mpimbaza-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mpimbaza 2008</LINK>). However, we are very uncertain about the estimate of this effect. In part, this reflects the different range of doses of buccal midazolam used in these studies and the different characteristics of their participants. A single study also provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that buccal midazolam may be associated with a higher rate of seizure cessation than intravenous diazepam (<LINK REF="STD-Talukdar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Talukdar 2009</LINK>). However, as for all studies included within this review, with different routes of administration, time to cessation of seizures was influenced by the way it was delivered.</P><P>There are currently insufficient data to determine whether there are any significant or clinically important differences in efficacy or safety between the buccal and intranasal routes of administration of midazolam; this issue will only be resolved by at least one robust RCT that compares buccal to intranasal midazolam. The intranasal route of administration was used in five studies and was compared with rectal or intravenous routes (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arya-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fi_x015f_gin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fi&#351;gin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javadzadeh-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Javadzadeh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoudian-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoudian 2004</LINK>). Generally, the intranasal/buccal/intramuscular routes appear to show similar rates of the most common (and most clinically important) primary outcome, seizure cessation, compared to intravenous routes of administration. However, the rapid action of the intravenously-administered drug is compromised by the time taken to achieve intravenous access. This was particularly demonstrated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arya-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talukdar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Talukdar 2009</LINK>). This is an important issue, particularly in infants but also in older children who are in shock with circulatory collapse, and where intravenous access is likely to be more difficult and therefore delay effective anticonvulsive treatment.</P><P>Adverse side effects were observed very infrequently in the included studies. Respiratory depression was the most common and most clinically relevant side effect. Where reported in the study, the frequency ranged from none (<LINK REF="STD-Ashrafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ashrafi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fi_x015f_gin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fi&#351;gin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoudian-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoudian 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Talukdar-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Talukdar 2009</LINK>), to 1% to 2% (<LINK REF="STD-Arya-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Arya 2011</LINK>), almost 6% (<LINK REF="STD-Sreenath-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sreenath 2010</LINK>) and up to almost 18% (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 2014</LINK>). The latter study defined respiratory depression as &#8216;assisted ventilation&#8217;; the incidence of respiratory depression is considerably higher than in the other studies that reported this outcome. None of the studies individually demonstrated any difference in the rates of respiratory depression between the different anticonvulsants or their different routes of administration; but when pooled, three studies provided moderate-quality evidence that lorazepam was significantly associated with fewer occurrences of respiratory depression than diazepam (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93).</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:49:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The evidence presented in previous versions of the review has supported previously-published open, anecdotal data. Buccal midazolam has become established as the first-line non-intravenous drug, and intravenous lorazepam has become established as the first-line intravenous drug in treating an acute tonic-clonic convulsion (and established convulsive status epilepticus) in children. The evidence has contributed to the evidence base for the Status Epilepticus Working Group to revise the convulsive status epilepticus guideline which was first published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Working-Party-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Working Party 2000</LINK>) and has been incorporated into the partially revised and updated National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline in Epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>) and the Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-APLS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">APLS 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Most studies were undertaken in unselected populations of children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of a single centre, or a group of centres (between three and 11) based either in a general or a children&#8217;s hospital. Consequently, these data are likely to be generalisable and applicable to other children with acute tonic-clonic convulsions in this clinical situation. However, there were two studies undertaken in a very specific population, of African children, in whom cerebral malaria was the cause of the convulsion in 49% to 67% (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mpimbaza-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mpimbaza 2008</LINK> respectively). The treatment arms in <LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2006</LINK> were somewhat unusual, comprising intranasal lorazepam and intramuscular paraldehyde; no other study used these treatments. The authors justified the use of paraldehyde on the basis of it's being the &#8220;first or second-line anticonvulsant agent in much of sub-Saharan Africa because of its favourable safety and efficacy profile&#8221;. Paraldehyde has been used as an anticonvulsant for over 50 years. It is currently used when other anticonvulsants, including benzodiazepines or phenytoin and phenobarbital, have failed to stop an acute tonic&#8211;clonic convulsion and is often effective (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 2009</LINK>). The rectal route is preferred, because of the risk of sterile abscesses and damage to the sciatic nerve with the intramuscular route. Rectal paraldehyde is included in the UK&#8217;s APLS algorithm (<LINK REF="REF-APLS-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">APLS 2016</LINK>) for the management of status epilepticus.</P><P>Two early studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chamberlain-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chamberlain 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahat-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lahat 2000</LINK>) used a seizure duration of 10 rather than five minutes as the time to institute emergency treatment; all other studies used five or "at least 5" minutes, which is standard international practice.</P><P>The age range of the children in the 18 studies varied between birth and under 18 years. Most assessed children aged two months to 12 or 15 years, although two assessed a much narrower age range from two months to approximately five years (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahat-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lahat 2000</LINK>). Most epidemiological studies have demonstrated that more than 80% of children who present with an acute tonic-clonic convulsion, including convulsive status epilepticus, are under 10 years of age, and of these most will be under five years of age. In addition, most causes of convulsive status epilepticus in children under five will be febrile status or due to an acute symptomatic cause. Consequently, this might introduce some bias in those studies that assessed only young children.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 15:14:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The extent of the evidence provided by this updated review, both in terms of the 14 new studies (making a total of 18 and comprising 2199 participants) and their scientific robustness, has strengthened its quality and its conclusions. We have consequently achieved some of the objectives of the review.</P><P>Much of the evidence provided in this review is of moderate to high quality. However, the quality of the evidence provided for some important outcomes is low to very low, particularly for comparisons of non-intravenous routes of drug administration. We downgraded the quality of the evidence due to imprecise results where limited data were available for analysis or where confidence intervals of effect sizes were wide, making interpretation of results difficult. Quality of the evidence was also downgraded due to the methodological inadequacies of some studies which may have introduced bias into the results, to study settings which were not applicable to wider clinical practice, and to inconsistency in some pooled analyses.</P><P>The dose of lorazepam in all preparations (predominantly intravenous, but also rectal and intranasal) was the same in all six studies where it was a treatment arm (0.1 mg/kg). In contrast, the dose of midazolam (in predominantly buccal but also intranasal preparation) ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg, and the dose of either rectal or intravenous diazepam varied from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg. The reasons for the wide range of doses are not clear. Previous studies had not suggested that respiratory depression was a significant problem with doses of buccal midazolam of 0.5 mg/kg (<LINK REF="STD-McIntyre-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McIntyre 2005</LINK>), and the methodology and findings of this large study would have helped to inform subsequent studies on an effective and safe dose.</P><P>One potential bias throughout all the studies is how the original trial authors defined cessation of the seizure or convulsion following the intervention. Observer variation and inconsistency is well recognised when deciding when a tonic-clonic convulsion has stopped. A proposed definition by Appleton (personal opinion) is that a tonic-clonic convulsion has stopped when there is &#8220;no visible sign of ongoing rhythmic clonic activity&#8221;. The included studies' definitions of seizure cessation ranged from no definition to &#8220;the practitioner&#8217;s clinical judgement&#8221; to &#8220;generalized convulsions have stopped&#8221;, &#8220;cessation of all visible convulsive activity&#8221;, &#8220;cessation of all visible motor seizure activity&#8221; or &#8220;cessation of all motor activity&#8221;. The use of &#8216;motor activity&#8217; is arguably too vague, as the brief, asymmetric and asynchronous myoclonus that commonly follows a tonic-clonic seizure may be misinterpreted as &#8220;ongoing motor activity&#8221;; this is likely to impact on the efficacy result and lead to bias between studies.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:50:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>It is unlikely that the methods used in this updated review will have introduced any significant bias. We successfully addressed outstanding queries and resolved them in most cases by personal contact with the leading or corresponding authors of the included studies.</P><P>We identified all relevant new studies, as far as we could ascertain. The methodology of most of the new studies was more robust than those included in the first review. However, there was some variation in methodology and the reporting of results between these studies, as detailed earlier in the review. Two of the 18 studies reported 100% seizure cessation in both treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Mahmoudian-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoudian 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sreenath-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Sreenath 2010</LINK>), and in one treatment arm (<LINK REF="STD-Ashrafi-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ashrafi 2010</LINK>), which is unusual as the median seizure-cessation rate was approximately 75% in all other studies. In addition, the dose of intravenous diazepam in the two studies that reported 100% seizure cessation in both was the lowest used throughout the included studies (0.2 mg/kg).</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-12-14 10:14:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review is in broad general agreement with the recently-published <I>Evidence-based guideline </I>on the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults, published by the Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society (<LINK REF="REF-Glauser-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glauser 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Our findings are also consistent with a recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-McMullan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMullan 2010</LINK>) of midazolam versus diazepam in children and young adults which included many of the studies in this review. They also concluded that non-intravenous midazolam was as effective as intravenous diazepam and that buccal midazolam was superior to rectal diazepam.</P><P>The above studies would appear to have been subjected to a similar systematic review process.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-16 14:29:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-11-16 14:29:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This updated review provides limited and low- or very-low quality evidence regarding the use of buccal midazolam as the first-line treatment for an acute tonic-clonic convulsion and convulsive status epilepticus in children where intravenous access is not available. Limited new data, of moderate to low quality, shows no clear differences between intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam as the first-line intravenous drug in the management of acute tonic-clonic convulsions in children. The review provides limited and low-quality evidence that the intranasal route, using either lorazepam or midazolam, may be an effective alternative non-intravenous route of administration to stop tonic-clonic seizures. This is of particular importance in countries with a high incidence of central nervous system infectious diseases, where children often present late and in shock, making it difficult to obtain rapid intravenous access, and where intravenous cannulae and equipment are likely to be in limited supply.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:50:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>This review has identified a large number of new randomised clinical trials since 2007. Despite these new data, much was of low quality for important comparisons. Consequently, there is a clear need for additional paediatric randomised controlled trials of the treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions and convulsive status epilepticus. Potential areas for research and specifically for randomised controlled trials include:</P><UL><LI>Efficacy of commonly-used first-line treatments such as lorazepam and midazolam, mode of delivery including data on optimal drug doses, and timing of interventions. The most appropriate randomised control trial would use a factorial design to compare drugs and modes of delivery efficiently.</LI><LI>Role and efficacy of pre-hospital medications, usually benzodiazepines, administered by parents, carers or paramedical staff.</LI><LI>Efficacy and safety of second-line treatments, including fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, phenytoin and sodium valproate.</LI><LI>The role of rectal paraldehyde.</LI><LI>The potential efficacy and safety of newer anticonvulsants, including intravenous levetiracetam and lacosamide.</LI></UL><P>The pre-hospital treatment of acute tonic-clonic convulsions is not within the remit of this review. However, it seems appropriate to comment on possible future research initiatives. Traditionally, rectal diazepam has been the preferred pre-hospital rescue (emergency) medication, but this has now been replaced by buccal midazolam in routine clinical practice in the UK and the rest of Europe. This has been on the basis of midazolam&#8217;s perceived similar or slightly superior efficacy to diazepam, and its easier and more acceptable route of administration by carers, school nurses and teaching staff. More recently, pre-hospital randomised controlled trials have examined the role of intramuscular midazolam administered by paramedics in acute tonic-clonic convulsions, including status epilepticus. The Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial (RAMPART) was a double-blind randomised, non-inferiority clinical trial of the efficacy of intramuscular midazolam versus intravenous lorazepam in the pre-hospital treatment of status epilepticus by paramedics (<LINK REF="REF-Silbergleit-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silbergleit 2013</LINK>). A secondary analysis of the RAMPART study undertaken in children aged under 18 (<LINK REF="REF-Welch-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welch 2015</LINK>) showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms in achieving the study&#8217;s primary outcome, namely seizure cessation prior to arrival in the emergency department. Although intramuscular midazolam might become the preferred pre-hospital, first-line emergency medication by paramedic staff (as intravenous access may be difficult), this route is unlikely to be adopted by carers, school nurses and teachers who administer most pre-hospital rescue medications. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to undertake an RCT of intramuscular midazolam and buccal midazolam amongst paramedics.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><P>Ms Anita Aindow, Pharmacy Department, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, UK.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:52:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Richard Appleton is the lead investigator of the study included in the original review and is a co-author of another study included in this update. <BR/>Tim Martland is a co-author of one of the studies included in this review.<BR/>Amy McTague has no known declarations of interests.</P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:50:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Amy McTague undertook the literature review, performed the data extraction and wrote the review.<BR/>Richard Appleton undertook the literature review, reviewed the included and excluded studies and commented on the draft review.<BR/>Tim Martland commented on the draft review.</P></CONTRIBUTIONS><PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-11-14 14:52:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The protocol was published in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2000</LINK>), and the review was last updated in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Appleton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appleton 2008</LINK>).

All seizure episodes must have been lasting for a minimum continuous period of five minutes. Most of the 79 seizure episodes (46 of the 79) were tonic-clonic seizures; however, it was not explicit as to how many of the 11 paediatric patients in this study had experienced tonic-clonic seizures and it was therefore impossible to know how many of these patients would have fulfilled the criteria for an 'included study' in this Review (as the seizure type was restricted to a tonic-clonic seizure).
