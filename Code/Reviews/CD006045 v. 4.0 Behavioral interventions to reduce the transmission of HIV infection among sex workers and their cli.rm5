<P>Behavioural interventions, such as individual counselling, voluntary counselling and testing, peer education, negotiation skills for using a condom with their clients, assertiveness and relationship support, discussing attitudes and beliefs, videos and role-playing, may reduce the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI ) and improve the knowledge of HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials that test for the identification of effective interventions for HIV prevention with outcomes of biological endpoints, such as HIV incidence or prevalence, are needed for these neglected populations. More research is also needed for male or transgender sex workers and their clients in high-income countries.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-23 13:22:48 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Windy Mariane Virenia Wariki">
<P>A total of four studies were included, comprising two randomised controlled trials and two quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trials with control groups involving 1795 participants. No trials reported HIV prevalence/incidence as outcomes.</P>
<P>Overall, the effects of behavioural interventions for sex workers in high-income countries on STI incidence did not differ significantly among two studies using a random effects model (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 1.98). Only one study found that the self-reported STI prevalence in clients of female sex workers was statistically significant (RR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.72, P=0.02). There was no significant difference after behavioural intervention for condom use. Two studies demonstrated the effectiveness of intervention for knowledge of HIV transmission among sex workers (RR 1.82, 95%CI 1.55 to 2.14) and clients of sex workers (RR 1.93, 95%CI 1.46 to 2.55).</P>

<P>There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries. Further randomised controlled trials are very likely to have important impacts on our confidence in the estimates of the effects, and are likely to change the estimates for effective interventions with outcomes of HIV incidence or prevalence and a variety of different settings among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries. Randomised controlled trials that test for the identification of effective interventions for HIV prevention with outcomes of biological endpoints, such as HIV incidence or prevalence, are needed for these neglected populations. More research is also needed for male or transgender sex workers and their clients in high-income countries.</P>

<P>
<B>Description of the condition </B>
</P>
<P>The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to expand worldwide. Globally, there were an estimated 33.3 million people (range 31.4 million to 35.3 million) living with HIV in 2009, and the annual number of new HIV infections declined from 3.0 million (range 2.6 million to 3.5 million) in 2001 to 2.6 million (2.3 million to 2.8 million) in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2010</LINK>). Overall, 1.8 million people (range 1.6 million to 2.1 million) died from AIDS in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some of the most worrisome increases in new infections are now occurring in various high-income countries, such as those in Western Europe (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2009</LINK>). The rate of newly reported HIV infections in Europe nearly doubled between 2000 and 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-van-de-Laar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">van de Laar 2008</LINK>). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the annual HIV incidence has remained relatively stable since the early 1990s, although the annual number of new HIV infections in 2006 (56,300) was approximately 40% greater than previously estimated (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). In Canada, official epidemiological estimates suggest that the annual HIV incidence may have increased between 2002 and 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Public-Health-Agency-of-Canada-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Public Health Agency of Canada 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sex workers are defined as female, male and transgender, whether adults or young people including adolescents, who receive money, goods or protection directly or indirectly in exchange for indoor or outdoor sexual services, such as in a brothel, street or home, either regularly or occasionally, and who may or may not consciously define those activities as income-generating. The World Health Organization (WHO) regards sex workers as one of the four key populations globally for HIV/AIDS health initiatives (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). Sex workers are at high risk for infection with HIV, and their clients may serve as a "bridging population" by spreading HIV to the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Ghys-2001A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghys 2001A</LINK>). Talbott argued that the number of HIV-infected sex workers in an individual country is highly significant for explaining the HIV prevalence levels across countries in globally (<LINK REF="REF-Talbott-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbott 2007</LINK>). National estimates of the median HIV prevalence among sex workers averaged 0.4% (range 0.1% to 1.4%) in Western Europe in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Vandepitte-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandepitte 2006</LINK>). It has been estimated that there are around 80,000 female sex workers (FSWs) in Britain (<LINK REF="REF-Scambler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scambler 2007</LINK>) and that less than 2% of London's FSWs are HIV-positive (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Day-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2006b</LINK>), notwithstanding reports that almost half (43%) of new diagnoses of HIV in the United Kingdom in 2005 occurred in London (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS_x002f_WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS/WHO 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, the living and working conditions of sex workers could result in a variety of interrelated risk factors for HIV infection as follows: a large number of different sexual partners, and hence exposure to many other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could increase the probability of acquiring or transmitting HIV; unprotected sexual activity, often because clients or private partners refuse to use condoms; and drug injection by either the sex workers or her sexual partners (<LINK REF="REF-Estebanez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estebanez 1993</LINK>). Violence against sex workers mediated by partners, family or the community was reported to have a relationship with an increased risk of STIs in San Francisco (<LINK REF="REF-Cohan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohan 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Migrant sex workers have become a bridging population in the global spread of HIV/AIDS in various high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Parrado-2004A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parrado 2004A</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1996</LINK>), and their mobility causes problems for the establishment of support networks and ongoing medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Mardh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mardh 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Church-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Church 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wolffers-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolffers 2002</LINK>). An Australian study showed a higher risk of STIs and lower rates of condom use for international sex workers than for local sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1996</LINK>). Higher HIV rates were also found in foreign transsexual sex workers in Rome (<LINK REF="REF-Spizzichino-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spizzichino 2001</LINK>). Migrant sex workers face cultural, social, legal and linguistic obstacles to accessing services and information (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Description of the interventions </B>
</P>
<P>Many clients of sex workers refuse to use condoms during sexual relations (<LINK REF="REF-Estebanez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estebanez 1993</LINK>). Condoms comprise one of the most efficacious methods for reducing the risk of transmission of agents of STIs, including HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Sarkar-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkar 2008</LINK>). Female condoms are accepted by sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Denlaud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denlaud 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>), but are associated with major difficulties including cost and poor availability. Continued use of female condoms has not been easy, because some populations have not been receptive to these condoms owing to concerns about the unfamiliar appearance, reported discomfort from the inner ring, high cost and prejudice against their use by providers (<LINK REF="REF-Mantell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantell 2005</LINK>). In Amsterdam, a survey of men recruited from an STI clinic who had had relations with sex workers in the preceding 4 months found that less than half of these men always used condoms during vaginal intercourse with sex workers, and only 7% used condoms with their private sexual partners (<LINK REF="REF-Hooykaas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hooykaas 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Injecting drug use is the major risk factor associated with HIV infection among sex workers in Western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Estebanez-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estebanez 1993</LINK>). In most cases, infection among injecting drug users probably results from sharing contaminated syringes or needles, although some women may have acquired HIV through sexual contact with a drug-using partner. Furthermore, non-injected recreational drugs may also cause people to fail to practice safer sex, thereby contributing to HIV transmission. A number of investigators have reported that the disinhibiting effects of alcohol and other drugs decrease the likelihood of using condoms, and may increase the tendency to engage in higher-risk forms of sexual activity (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Harcourt-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harcourt 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Plant-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plant 1990</LINK>). Among 118 sex workers studied in New York from 1985 to 1987, 31% of those who injected drugs versus only 7% of those who did not were HIV-positive (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1987</LINK>). A European survey of 866 sex workers from nine European centres (Amsterdam, Antwerp, Athens, Copenhagen, Lisbon, London, Paris, Vienna and eight cities in Spain) carried out from 1990 to 1991 found that the HIV seroprevalence was 32% among women who were injecting drug users and &lt;2% among women who did not inject drugs (<LINK REF="REF-European-Working-Group-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Working Group 1992</LINK>). Similarly, a survey of 208 street-based sex workers in Glasgow found that 59% injected drugs (<LINK REF="REF-McKeganey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeganey 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>In regions where HIV infection is rare among FSWs, surveillance of risk behaviour and STIs will indicate the potential for spread of HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS_x002f_WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS/WHO 2006</LINK>). Surveillance of behaviour, STIs and HIV among sex workers is important, because the results may indicate the success or failure of the national response to the epidemic, including targeted programs to encourage safe sex between sex workers and clients (<LINK REF="STD-Ghys-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ghys 2001</LINK>). Interventions to change behaviour among sex workers and their clients have been identified as a strategy to reduce HIV transmission. Fisher et al (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2006a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2006b</LINK>) concluded that critical components of interventions included not only information but also motivation and skills. Vaginal use of topical microbicides by women helps to reduce the transmission of HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Poynten-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynten 2009</LINK>) and other STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Behets-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behets 2008</LINK>). Interventions for management of STIs were based on clinical diagnosis and serologic tests for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) with a monoclonal blocking enzyme immunoassay (<LINK REF="REF-Kamali-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamali 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many sex workers experience violence and fear of arrest under illegal conditions, and may give lower priority to their health needs and behaviour changes, compared with more immediate concerns for their safety and survival (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Alexander-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alexander 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>How the interventions might work </B>
</P>
<P>A previously conducted meta-analysis in developing countries showed that behaviour change interventions effectively reduce HIV transmission for sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Merson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merson 2000</LINK>). Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV has been associated with increased condom use, reduced number of partners, and decreased HIV in sex workers and clients (<LINK REF="REF-Merson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merson 2000</LINK>). These effects result from behaviour changes following education, support and knowledge of one's HIV status. Care programmes and participation in research can have similar effects (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Male condoms reduce HIV and STI transmission in sex workers (<LINK REF="REF-Hanenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanenberg 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2004</LINK>) and prevent STI complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ness-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ness 2004</LINK>). A reliable and accessible supply of good quality condoms is essential (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Merson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merson 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>). Condom promotion, distribution and social marketing result in increased condom use and reduced STI and HIV infection rates, especially in FSWs (<LINK REF="REF-Merson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merson 2000</LINK>). Local culture, language and traditions should also be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Gerofi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerofi 1995</LINK>). Female condoms have successfully prevented pregnancy and reduced STI transmission in analytical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Denlaud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denlaud 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fontanet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontanet 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-French-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2003</LINK>), and there is in vitro evidence and biological plausibility for HIV prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Denlaud-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denlaud 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Education for sex workers may improve healthy behaviour by delivering the basic facts about disease, dispelling myths, and offering healthy lifestyle and work options (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>).

Peer education has resulted in substantial increases in STI and HIV knowledge, condom use and safer sex practices, and reduced the incidence of HIV and STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Vanwesenbeeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanwesenbeeck 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Community development has been successful in the promotion of safe sex, identification of injustice, support for HIV-infected workers, enhancement of self-esteem, cooperation with police and controllers, provision of legal and financial training, initiation of alternative income-generation schemes, and support for migrants and human rights (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2005</LINK>). Successful initiatives have resulted in enhanced self-esteem, improved negotiating skills, ability to refuse clients, access and use of condoms, training to recognize, avoid and escape violence, STI and HIV preventive services, safe houses, drop-in centres and STI treatment through pharmacies (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vanwesenbeeck-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanwesenbeeck 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2002</LINK>).</P>

<B>Why it is important to do this overview </B>
</P>
<P>The settings in which sex workers work, as well as the behavioural characteristics of these sex workers and their clients, may differ between the high-income developed world and low- and middle-income developing world. Hence, the intervention strategies may also be different.</P>
<P>Behavioural interventions are being undertaken in various regions of high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Dorfman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorfman 1992</LINK>). However, there has been no systematic review that has examined and summarized their effects. Therefore, this systematic review was undertaken to assess the available evidence regarding behavioural interventions to prevent HIV transmission among sex workers in high-income countries.</P>

<P>Studies that evaluated the effects of behavioural interventions on any one of the outcome measures, specified below, and that met the criteria for methodological rigour on the basis of the study design (randomised controlled trials and certain quasi-experimental designs) in high-income countries were included. Randomised controlled trials in which the units of randomisation were individuals and clusters (groups or communities) were included. Cross-over trials were also included. From non-randomised studies, specified quasi-experimental prospective designs with a control group were considered eligible only if they included independent comparison groups where assignment to treatment status was not based on need or volition, and where separate baseline measurements were also taken, as in the Untreated Control Group Design with Pretest and Posttest (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1979</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Selection of studies</B>
</P>
<P>All studies that addressed behavioural interventions in high-income countries were identified. High-income countries included all high-income countries in the <LINK REF="REF-World-Bank" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank</LINK>. A high-income country was one with an annual gross national income per capita equivalent to USD $11,906 or greater in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank</LINK>). The abstracts of all the identified studies underwent initial screening in an inclusive manner, based on the objectives of the study, and were short-listed. The full articles of the short-listed studies were obtained and scrutinized independently by two reviewers (EO, WW) for possible inclusion. The scrutiny for inclusion was based on the type of study, type of participants, type of interventions, and outcome measures. A standard proforma was developed and used for documenting the decision process. Each reviewer independently documented the determination of the study's inclusion or exclusion and the reasons. A third reviewer (RM) served as an arbitrator. Subsequently, the agreed-upon studies were included in the review. In the case of the excluded studies, a summary statement was made about the reasons for each exclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and management</B>
</P>
<P>The data from the selected studies were independently extracted by two review authors (EO, WW), using a pre-designed data extraction sheet. The data extraction sheet contained details of the key entries, namely the trial's identification, methods, type of participants, intervention and outcomes.</P>
<P>We used the data collection forms to extract the data for the study design. For the eligible studies, two review authors (EO, WW) extracted the data using the agreed-upon form. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted an additional review author (RM). We entered the data into Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) and checked for accuracy. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we contacted the authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies</B>
</P>
<P>Two review authors (EO, WW) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We resolved any disagreements by discussion or by involving an additional assessor (RM). The following risks of bias were evaluated:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias).</LI>
<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts or protocol deviations).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting bias.</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
<LI>Overall risk of bias.</LI>

<B>Measures of treatment effects</B>

<UL>
<LI>Dichotomous data: We have presented the results as the summary risk ratio with the 95% confidence interval (CI).</LI>
<LI>Continuous data: We have used the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We have used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome but used different methods.</LI>

<P>
<B>Unit of analysis issues</B>
</P>
<P>Individually randomised trials, cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials were included.</P>
<P>
<B>Dealing with missing data</B>
</P>
<P>For the included trials, we noted the levels of attrition. For all outcomes, we carried out the analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>We used the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to measure the heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt;50%), we explored it by a prespecified subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of reporting biases</B>
</P>
<P>Where we suspected reporting bias, we attempted to contact the study authors, asking them to provide missing outcome data. Where this was not possible, and the missing data were thought to introduce serious bias, we explored the impact of including such trials in the overall assessment of the results by a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis and investigation of heterogeneity</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane Review Manager software RevMan 5.1.4 was used for all data syntheses and analyses (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). All participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, and the heterogeneity between study results was assessed using the chi-square test of homogeneity, with significance defined at the 10% level. The study results were expressed as the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, with the 95% CI, and combined using the random-effects method because of the significant heterogeneity between the study results. We used the criteria of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to evaluate the quality of the evidence by outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK> conducted a randomised intervention study in Miami, Florida, USA. The primary objective of the study was to test the relative effectiveness of two alternative HIV and hepatitis B and C prevention protocols, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Standard Intervention and a Sex Worker Focused (SWF) Intervention that was developed specifically to reduce risky drug use and sexual behaviours of street-based FSWs. Eligible participants were women aged 18 to 50 years who had (a) traded sex for money or drugs at least three times in the past 30 days, and (b) used heroin and/or cocaine three or more times a week in the past 30 days. A total of 806 drug-using FSWs were recruited using targeted sampling strategies and randomly assigned to the NIDA Standard Intervention (n=396) or the innovative SWF Intervention (n=410). Similar to the standard intervention, the SWF Intervention was designed as a brief protocol consisting of two 60-minute sessions delivered 2 weeks apart. At the 3-month follow-up, 272 FSWs assigned to the NIDA Intervention (66.3%) and 274 FSWs assigned to the SWF Intervention (69.2%) were included in the analysis. At the 6-month follow-up, 254 (62.0%) and 252 (63.6%) were included, respectively.</P>
<P>The trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK> investigated the relative efficacy of using the VCT plus information dissemination (VCT-ID) approach versus the information dissemination (ID) approach in promoting condom use among male clients of FSWs in Hong Kong. The inclusion criteria were male Hong Kong Chinese cross-border truck drivers (aged &#8805;18 years), who reported having had sex with either an FSW or a female non-regular sex partner (NRP) in mainland China in the last 12 months (NRP was operationally defined as female sex partners who were not commercial sex partners, spouses or girlfriends) and were willing to provide their mobile phone number. A total of 301 participants were randomly allocated to intervention group (n=147) or control group (n=154) by opening a randomisation envelope. At baseline, anonymous structured questionnaires, administered through a computer-assisted method, were used to collect data. The intervention group received the voluntary counselling and testing service (30-45 minutes to complete) and the control group was given three educational pamphlets with very brief counselling (2&#8211;4 minutes). At the first follow-up (1 month from baseline), 141 (95.9%) for the intervention group and 148 (96.1%) for the control group completed the follow-up. At the second follow-up (2 months from baseline), 141 (95.9%) and 147 (95.5%) completed the follow-up, respectively.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK> evaluated the effects of a brief intervention programme on sexually transmitted disease (STD) knowledge, condom use and gonorrhoea incidence among brothel-based sex workers in Singapore. All brothel-based sex workers (n=1226) were invited to attend a 3-hour safe sex intervention session, which consisted of educational lectures, video presentations and role-playing. A controlled before-and-after study was performed whereby the experimental group (n=221) was interviewed, immediately given the intervention and then interviewed again 3 months later. The control group (n=221) was interviewed at the same times, but their intervention was not given until the second interview was complete. At the 3-month follow-up, 182 participants (82.4%) in the experimental group and 199 participants (90.0%) in the control group completed the follow-up.</P>
<P>The other quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trial with a control group was conducted in a cohort of 253 female brothel-based sex workers in Singapore by <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>. One intervention site (n=124) and a comparable control site (n=122) were maintained for 5 months, followed by a time series design to follow up the intervention group for 2 years. Two 2-hour small-group sessions were conducted in a public STD clinic. The instructional methods used included video presentations with actresses as local sex workers to demonstrate negotiation skills, role-playing and peer group discussion of problems arising from their self-monitoring of condom use. Experienced peers gave practical tips on how to deal with difficult clients, and how to reduce problems specific to condom use such as condom slippage, condom breakage and pain from prolonged condom use. All gonorrhoea cases were given individual counselling. Peer leaders were selected by the sex workers themselves to follow up on the sessions and to act on problems encountered. After 3 months, a booster session was held with the distribution of free condoms and pamphlets, and dissemination of congratulatory messages to all compliant and non-infected participants. The control group did not receive any new intervention. A total of 246 subjects were followed up at 5 months with 122 subjects in the control group and 124 in the intervention group. Of these, 96 (77.4%) intervention subjects completed the 1-year follow-up and 74 (59.7%) completed the 2-year follow-up.</P>

<P>No trials reported the HIV prevalence/incidence as outcomes.</P>
<P>1. STI incidence and STI prevalence</P>
<P>Data were collected for two of the reviews' primary outcomes: STI incidence for FSWs (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>) and STI prevalence for clients of FSWs (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies in the STI incidence (two trials, n=627, heterogeneity P=0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP>=82%). Overall, the effects of behavioural interventions for sex workers in high-income countries on STI incidence were not significant between groups with random effects models (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.98). Both studies examined gonorrhoea with biological tests, and no data were available by randomisation for the STI incidence. These trials provided very low quality evidence of no effect of behavioural interventions on STI incidence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Only one study reported that STI prevalence based on self-reports of clients of FSWs was statistically significant (RR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01 to 0.72). This trial provided high quality of evidence for a benefit of behaviour intervention on lower STI prevalence (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

The heterogeneity was not statistically significant among the included trials for condom use (three trials, n=1133, heterogeneity P=0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP>=63%). Moreover, there was no significant difference between the behavioural intervention group and the control group for condom use (RR 1.04, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.09). Sub-group analysis was conducted among randomised control trial group ( <LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK>; RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.96 to 1.03) and quasi-experimental pretest-posttest with control group (<LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>; RR 1.08, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.18).

Nevertheless, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK> observed a significant increase in the number of FSWs always refusing sex without a condom (RR 1.85, 95%CI 1.25 to 2.76).</P>
<P>One trial evaluated condom use for prevention of HIV and STIs among clients of sex workers (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>). There was no significant difference (RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.69 to 1.75). This trial provided moderate quality of evidence for condom use for clients of sex workers (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Knowledge of HIV transmission</P>
<P>One study demonstrated the effectiveness of intervention for knowledge of HIV transmission for sex workers (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>, a brief intervention programme on STD knowledge for FSWs appeared to have an effect (RR1.82, 95%CI 1.55 to 2.14), although the study was not randomised and there were differences in the educational levels.</P>
<P>One study showed the effectiveness of intervention for knowledge of HIV transmission for clients of sex workers (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK> (randomisation study), 30-45 minutes of VCT service for clients of FSWs also had a significant effect for knowledge of HIV transmission (RR 1.93, 95%CI 1.46 to 2.55).</P>
<P>4. Others</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>, the outcome of male clients who visited FSWs in Hong Kong decreased in the intervention group (10.9% to 6.4%), while it increased in the control group (6.5% to 11.7%) at the second follow-up survey (2 months after baseline), but the RR was not significant (RR 0.54, 95%CI 0.25 to 1.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Moreover, VCT intervention increased the number of participants who perceived the use of condoms as highly efficacious in preventing HIV (15.8% to 27.7%), while the number decreased in the control group (22.1% to 20.5%), although the difference between the groups was not significant (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
<P>Violent victimisation outcomes were examined for the intervention group effect in the <LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK> parallel intervention study. The SWF Intervention was significantly more effective in reducing sexual violence at the 6-month follow-up, with the participants in this group nearly twice as likely compared with those in the Standard Intervention group to report a decrease in sexual abuse/victimisation. Although both groups reported lower physical abuse/victimisation after exposure to their respective intervention protocols, no differential impact was apparent at either the 3- or 6-month follow-ups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>, physical victimisation RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.56) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>, sexual victimisation RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.53 to 1.86).</P>

<P>
<B>Summary of main results</B>
</P>
<P>This review demonstrates that there is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in reducing the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries. Only two randomised controlled trials and two quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trials with control groups were included in this review. Indeed, of the four studies that we identified, only two reported STI incidence and one reported STI prevalence as an outcome measure. In one of these, the STI incidence (rates of gonorrhoea based on biological testing) was not significantly different after 5 months of follow-up in the intervention group of FSWs. STI prevalence was also significantly reduced among male clients of FSWs, although the outcome was self-reported. There were no outcomes for HIV incidence or prevalence among the included studies. Although there was no significant difference between the behavioural intervention group and the control group for overall condom use, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK> observed a significant increase in the number of FSWs always refusing sex without a condom in the intervention group at the 5-month follow-up, which may be related to the favourable outcome of STI incidence above. Interventions that include condom negotiation techniques with role-playing and peer group discussions may be effective strategies for FSWs. Moreover, findings from the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK>)demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions that increase knowledge of HIV transmission for sex workers and their clients.</P>
<P>This review provides information that such potential approaches to contract sex workers make them more conscious of and responsible for their health status. Where sex workers are vulnerable in the transmission of HIV and STIs, protection strategies to reduce the vulnerability should be a priority on the policy agenda. Therefore, the meta-analysis in this review provides designs and implementations for future priority studies, particularly in high-income settings, that should be taken into account by policymakers in the design of future interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Only four studies contributed data to this review, of which only two were randomised controlled trials. The data are limited and the results of the review should thus be interpreted with caution. No data were available for some of the review's prespecified outcomes (e.g. HIV incidence or prevalence, needle changes, use of microbicides, less risky types of sex) or participants (e.g. male and transgender sex workers, female clients for sex workers). Therefore, the results of this review can only be applied to FSWs and their clients. Despite these limitations, the results of the review suggest that targeted HIV prevention programs may play an important role in reducing STI incidence and prevalence among FSWs and their male clients.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence from the four studies included in the review is likely to be at some risk of bias, as the two quasi-experimental pretest-posttest trials with a control group design had baseline differences (<LINK REF="STD-Archibald-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Archibald 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>). Only one study from <LINK REF="STD-Lau-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Lau 2010</LINK> made efforts to reduce bias introduced by certain aspects of the study design with the use of sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding for fieldworkers. Another randomised controlled trial from <LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK> randomised the FSWs, but did not report the use of sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding.</P>
<P>Missing data are a particular problem in studies where a population of highly marginalized FSWs with high levels of unstable housing and transience, combined with heavy drug use and limited social connections, impeded efforts to maintain contact with a significant proportion of the participants. Thus, there is no direct evidence to suggest that attrition biased the analyses of the key outcomes.</P>
<P>One of the eligible, but excluded, STI prevention studies on the male sex industry in London by Ziersch illustrated some of the difficulties associated with conducting these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ziersch-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ziersch 2000</LINK>). The outcome evaluation was inconclusive owing to loss of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Potential biases in the review process</B>
</P>
<P>There were a number of potential biases in the review process. We attempted to minimise bias in several ways: two review authors independently assessed the eligibility for inclusion and exclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. However, carrying out reviews is not an exact science and may require a certain amount of subjective judgment. Therefore, it is possible that a different review team may have reached different decisions regarding assessments of eligibility and risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<B>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</B>
</P>
<P>Two of the included studies were peer-driven interventions that used both quantitative and qualitative methods to identify sex workers' needs (<LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>). One of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK>) was consistent with the result that HIV prevention education among injecting drug users in the United States is more effective for peer-driven intervention than for intervention by outreach workers (<LINK REF="REF-Broadhead-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broadhead 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Wong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 1998</LINK> used social and behavioural theories to develop multiple interventions aimed at motivating sex workers to use condoms by relating safe sex to their values, developing their negotiation skills and increasing their self-efficacy to always refuse sex without a condom if the negotiation fails, and providing support by getting brothel keepers to display posters and talk to clients on condom use. Prior to the study, <LINK REF="STD-Surratt-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Surratt 2010</LINK> conducted a series of focus groups with 53 active and former sex workers to better understand the issues most relevant to HIV prevention among this population, including drug use and sexual activity. The role of violent victimisation in exacerbating women's risk for HIV was derived from important content obtained from these focus groups. In addition, the intervention was more effectively tailored to sex workers by using language suggested by the target population as being more relevant and meaningful to FSWs. These sex workers specified that peer intervention programs may have positive effects on the results of the studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-03 15:18:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Windy Mariane Virenia Wariki">
<P>To date, four interventions have been identified that assess the effectiveness of behavioural interventions in reducing the transmission of HIV infection among sex workers and their clients in high-income countries. The behavioural interventions were effective at reducing STI prevalence and improving the knowledge of HIV transmission, but not significant for overall STI incidence or condom use in individual-level interventions for FSWs and their clients. The results of these interventions were positive, but more randomized controlled trials are needed before the evidence can be considered conclusive.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-03 15:22:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Windy Mariane Virenia Wariki">
<P>Very little research has been carried out on the use of behavioural interventions to prevent HIV transmission among sex workers and their clients in high-income settings. This may be a result of the difficulties associated with follow-up tracking of highly marginalized sex workers and their clients. Further randomised controlled trials are very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of the effects. Rigorous interventions with outcomes of HIV incidence or prevalence, conducted among sex workers and their clients (e.g. female, male, transgender) in a variety of different settings are urgently needed. Studies on the nature and types of violence against sex workers are also necessary to provide evidence on how sex workers experience physical, psychosocial and sexual violence from the community or partners.</P>

<P>It consisted of two 2-h small group sessions conducted by trained health advisers and the principal investigator (M.L.W.) in the public STD clinic. Groups of about 16 sex workers were organized to provide a heterogeneous mix of sex workers with differing attitudes and skills in condom negotiation so as to get them to share their individual views and experiences, and provide support to each other under the guidance of a health facilitator. Instructional methods used include video presentations with local sex workers as actresses to demonstrate negotiation skills, role-plays and peer group discussion of problems arising from their self-monitoring of condom use. The experienced peers gave practical tips on how to deal with difficult clients, and how to reduce problems specific to condom use such as condom slippage, breakage and pain from prolonged use of condoms. All gonorrhoea cases were given individual counselling. Peer leaders were selected by the sex workers themselves to follow up on the sessions and to act on problems encountered Three months later, a booster session was held with the distribution of free condoms, pamphlets and dissemination of congratulatory messages to all compliant and non-infected participants. The control group did not receive any new intervention.</P>

<P>Members of the intervention group received the VCT service (30_45 minutes to complete). The baseline risk level of these VCT participants was assessed (e.g., STD history, number of sex partners, sexual risk behaviours, and relevant risk perceptions) by a well-trained fieldworker. Discussion was made (e.g., other relevant HIV-related perceptions and planning prior to the testing) before the administration of the rapid test. Other topics were then discussed in the post-test counselling procedure (e.g., under what circumstances condoms should be used, window period for HIV detection, meaning/implications associated with a positive or negative testing result, and action plans). The three aforementioned education pamphlets and a letter written by a person living with HIV/AIDS (about meaning and issues concerning HIV positive status) were presented to the participants, who were further encouraged to ask questions. The Abbott Determine HIV-1/2 test kit was used. During the study period, the same fieldworker contacted all the participants of both groups via mobile phone biweekly to establish rapport and to conduct the two follow-up surveys.</P>

In addition, as indicated earlier, the intervention addresses issues of special relevance to sex workers, including common misconceptions about HIV risk, techniques for avoiding violent situations, risks associated with unprotected oral sex, and common barriers to safer sex.</P>
