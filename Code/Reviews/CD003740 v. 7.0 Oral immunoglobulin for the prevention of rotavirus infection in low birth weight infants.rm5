<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-01 17:01:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rotavirus infection can cause significant problems including diarrhea in the newborn. This is particularly true in babies weighing less than 2500 g (low birthweight infants). Rotavirus infection is becoming more common in newborn babies and can spread from one baby to another in the neonatal unit. Administration of antibodies against rotavirus to babies may prevent this infection and its spread in the neonatal unit. In this review, only one small trial was identified. Currently, there is not enough evidence to recommend the use of antibodies against rotavirus to babies exposed to rotavirus infection. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Rotavirus is a common neonatal nosocomial viral infection and epidemics with the newer P(6)G9 strains have been reported. Local mucosal immunity in the intestine to rotavirus is important in the resolution of infection and protection against subsequent infections. Oral administration of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulin preparations might be a useful strategy in preventing rotaviral infections, especially in low birth weight babies. </P>

<P>One published study (Barnes 1982) was eligible for inclusion in this review. Barnes 1982 found no significant difference in the rates of rotavirus infection after oral gammaglobulin versus placebo in hospitalized low birthweight babies [RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.37)]. In the subset of infants who became infected with rotavirus after receiving gammaglobulin or placebo for prevention of rotavirus infection, there was no significant difference in the duration of rotavirus excretion between the group who had gammaglobulin (mean 2 days, range 1 to 4 days) and the group who had placebo (mean 3 days, range 1 to 6 days). Barnes 1982 reported no adverse effects after administration of oral immunoglobulin preparations.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Current evidence does not support the use of oral immunoglobulin preparations to prevent rotavirus infection in low birthweight infants. Researchers are encouraged to conduct well-designed neonatal trials using the newer preparations of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulins (colostrum, egg yolk immunoglobulins) and include cost effectiveness evaluations.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:43:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Group A rotavirus infection is a major cause of diarrheal morbidity in children. Globally, it is estimated that in children &lt; 5 years of age, rotavirus causes 111 million episodes of gastro-enteritis requiring only home care, 25 million clinic visits, two million hospitalizations and 440,000 deaths. 82% of deaths occurred in the poorest countries (<LINK REF="REF-Parashar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parashar 2003</LINK>). It has also been recognized as the most common neonatal nosocomial viral infection (<LINK REF="REF-Strodtbeck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strodtbeck 1986</LINK>). Several outbreaks of rotaviral infection in neonatal nurseries in different countries have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bryden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryden 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shif-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shif 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Akinci-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akinci 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Omoigberale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omoigberale 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Rotavirus infection epidemics appear to be seasonal, being more common in the colder winter months. Infection rates range from 13% to 78% of neonates in the neonatal unit during epidemics (<LINK REF="REF-Tufvesson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tufvesson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cicirello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicirello 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilgore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilgore 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2000</LINK>). The main reservoir of rotavirus infection in neonatal nurseries seems to be the infected neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Grillner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grillner 1985</LINK>) and most infection occurs in the first few days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Cicirello-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cicirello 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kilgore-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilgore 1996</LINK>). Therefore, preventive strategies might be useful if administered during this time period. Premature and low birth-weight infants and infants staying in the neonatal unit longer have a greater risk of acquiring the infection (<LINK REF="REF-Dearlove-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dearlove 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walther-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walther 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dennehy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennehy 1985</LINK>). Rotavirus, especially the newer strains, can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration in already sick neonates. Rotavirus infection has been shown to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Mogilner-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogilner 1983</LINK>). In another study, 29% of neonates with NEC were stool rotavirus positive. Although these infants had lower Bell's Staging of NEC, the outcome of these infants regarding mortality or complication rates did not differ from rotavirus negative infants who had NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 2004</LINK>). A significantly higher incidence of bradycardia-apnoea episodes (BAE) has been noticed two days before and two days after the diagnosis of rotavirus infection in infants. These episodes were followed by cyanosis and required intervention more often than did BAE episodes in rotavirus negative infants (<LINK REF="REF-Riedel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riedel 1996</LINK>). Rotavirus infected neonates stay in the hospital longer than non-infected neonates, causing increased stress to the family and increased cost to the neonatal unit (<LINK REF="REF-Strodtbeck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strodtbeck 1986</LINK>). Strict infection control measures have been advocated including hand protection, hand disinfection, individual nursing sets and cohorting infected babies (<LINK REF="REF-Grehn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grehn 1990</LINK>). Closure of neonatal units (<LINK REF="REF-Valmari-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valmari 1984</LINK>) has been recommended to control and eradicate nosocomial outbreaks of rotavirus infections, placing considerable stress on busy neonatal units.</P>
<P>Newer strains of rotavirus P(6)G9 genotypes which previously have not been known to cause outbreaks of diarrhea have been identified to cause epidemics in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Cubitt-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cubitt 2000</LINK>), US (<LINK REF="REF-Ramachandran-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramachandran 1998</LINK>), Bangladesh (<LINK REF="REF-Unicomb-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unicomb 1999</LINK>) and Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Widdowson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Widdowson 2002</LINK>). Unlike previous strains, the new P(6)G9 strains can cause serious outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal units and cause severe symptoms in most infected neonates. Most mothers have not been exposed to these new strains and thus a high proportion of neonates lack protective antibodies which could explain high attack rates in the neonatal unit and the severity of symptoms. Predominance of neonatal cases compared to few cases in older children may indicate that neonates have an increased risk of infection by P(6)G9 strains.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:44:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Determinants of protective immunity against rotavirus are unclear. It has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Molyneaux-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molyneaux 1995</LINK>) that local mucosal immunity in the intestine may protect against rotavirus illness. While local antibodies may be important in the resolution of infection and protection from subsequent infections, there is no specific antibody that could be used reliably as a marker of protection (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1996</LINK>). Breast-fed infants are less susceptible to rotavirus infection and this is probably due to the presence of anti-rotaviral secretory IgA and trypsin inhibitors in the breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-McLean-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLean 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jayashree-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayashree 1988</LINK>). The protective efficacy of breast milk correlates positively with the concentrations of anti-rotaviral secretory IgA in the breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-Jayashree-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jayashree 1988</LINK>). Breast-fed infants tend to excrete fewer viruses than bottle-fed infants after infection with rotavirus (<LINK REF="REF-Chrystie-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chrystie 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>Oral administration of immunoglobulin containing preparations of bovine colostrum from immunized cows, egg yolk immunoglobulin from immunized hens (<LINK REF="REF-Mine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 2002</LINK>) or pooled plasma derived immunoglobulins can provide passive immunity. The highest titers of neutralizing anti-rotaviral antibodies are present in bovine colostrum, then in egg yolk immunoglobulin followed by human pooled plasma derived immunoglobulin (<LINK REF="REF-Bogstedt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogstedt 1996</LINK>). These preparations may inhibit intestinal viral adherence or viral replication and therefore may have a role in the prevention or treatment of rotavirus infections. Oral immunoglobulin preparations are resistant to proteolytic digestion and retain significant neutralizing activity in the stools of treated infants. The newborn infant's immaturity of proteolytic enzymes or rapid gastrointestinal transit time permits intact or nearly intact Ig to pass throughout the gastrointestinal system (<LINK REF="REF-Blum-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blum 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hilpert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilpert 1987</LINK>). In a prospective randomized placebo controlled study of oral human plasma immunoglobulin in children (but not neonates) with acute rotaviral gastroenteritis, there was a reduction in total duration of viral diarrhea and viral excretion, and a faster clinical improvement compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Guarino-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guarino 1994</LINK>). Bovine colostrum from hyperimmunized pregnant cows has been shown to reduce viral excretion, stool output and the need for rehydration when used in the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis in children other than neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Hilpert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilpert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitra-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 2001</LINK>). It has also been shown to prevent diarrhea from rotavirus infection when used as prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebina-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebina 1996</LINK>). Antibodies derived from the yolk of rotavirus immunized hens have been tested in acute rotaviral gastroenteritis in children beyond the neonatal period in a randomized placebo controlled trial, and found to cause earlier clearance of virus from the stools and an improvement of diarrhea (<LINK REF="REF-Sarker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 1998</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-07-07 14:54:42 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advantages of oral immunoglobulin containing preparations in neonates, especially low birthweight infants, would be a reduction in morbidity, reduction in the need for rehydration, earlier clearance of the virus thereby reducing the duration of infection control measures, and a reduction in hospital stay. Infection control measures are expensive and sometimes involve closure of infected units; oral immunoglobulins could be a cheaper and an easier alternative.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:53:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomization), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. We included this information in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. </P>
<P>For the update in 2011, we evaluated the following issues to address the Risk of Bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>): </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- low risk (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- high risk (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear risk.  </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<P>- low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);  </P>
<P>- high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);  </P>
<P>- unclear risk.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel; </P>
<P>- low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for outcome assessors.  </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);  </P>
<P>- high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear risk.  </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:  </P>
<P>- low risk (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);  </P>
<P>- high risk (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </P>
<P>- unclear risk. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- low risk, high risk, or unclear risk.   </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1982</LINK> was included in this review.<BR/>Seventy-five infants whose birthweight ranged from 2000 to 2500 g and who were admitted to a special care baby unit where rotavirus infection was endemic were randomized to oral gammaglobulin or placebo within 12 hours of birth. The intervention (gammaglobulin or placebo) was given in a dose of 4 ml, four times a day for seven days. The following outcomes were reported: i) timing of excretion of rotavirus, ii) quantity or grading of rotavirus excreted in the stools, iii) duration of excretion of rotavirus and iv) the incidence of clinically important diarrhea. The report of this trial analyzed only those 25 infants who were subsequently found to be rotavirus positive; infants who did not excrete rotavirus in the first two weeks of life were excluded from the analysis. As diarrhea or rotavirus infection were not criteria for entry into the study, we considered this to be a study of prevention of rotavirus infection in low birthweight infants admitted to a neonatal unit, where rotavirus was known to be endemic. In order to conduct analyses based on all infants randomized, we requested and obtained limited information from the authors regarding the outcomes of the infants, who were randomized but not infected with rotavirus.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-10-03 13:48:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1982</LINK>) is too small to reliably answer the objectives of this review. This study was analyzed in the report as a trial of treatment of rotavirus infection with oral gammaglobulin. Infants were randomized within 12 hours of birth and neither rotavirus infection nor diarrhea was a criterion for entry into the trial. Twenty-five of the 75 infants randomized were diagnosed to have rotavirus infection. It was assumed that 50 infants who were rotavirus negative were not exposed to rotavirus infection and excluded from analysis. However, it is difficult to assume so in a neonatal unit where rotavirus infection is known to be endemic and hence this study is included as a trial for prevention of rotavirus infection in low birthweight infants. There was no significant difference in the infection rates between the two randomized groups nor was there any significant difference in the duration of rotavirus excretion in the subset of infants who were infected with rotavirus.</P>
<P>Newer immunoglobulin preparations, namely bovine colostrum from rotavirus immunized cows and egg yolk of rotavirus immunized hens (<LINK REF="REF-Mine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mine 2002</LINK>), have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing rotavirus diarrhea and reducing morbidity when used to treat rotavirus infections in children other than neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Hilpert-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilpert 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitra-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitra 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ebina-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebina 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarker 2001</LINK>). These preparations have not been tested in neonatal trials for prevention or treatment of rotavirus infection. The obvious advantages are ease of administration, lack of adverse effects and potentially important clinical benefits.</P>
<P>Future investigators should be encouraged to plan large multicenter trials using the newer preparations of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulin for the prevention of rotavirus infection during epidemics of rotavirus infections or in neonatal units where rotavirus is endemic. They would be well advised to use sensitive rotavirus detection methods and include all low birth weight infants, especially the smaller ones who are at a much greater risk of rotavirus infection. These large trials should be planned during the months of the year when rotavirus infections occur. Large multicenter trials would be able to recruit units with different degrees of endemicity for rotavirus infections. In theory, enhancing local mucosal immunity has the potential to reduce rates of rotavirus infections and attenuate symptoms of infection.</P>
<P>Active immunization with rotavirus vaccines can be an effective strategy to prevent rotavirus infections. The initial vaccine licensed was a tetravalent rhesus-human reassortment vaccine (Rotashield). Vaccination with this vaccine was discontinued because of safety concerns, as there was an association with intussuception. Currently available vaccines RotaTeq and RIX4414 (Rotarix) have not been shown to be associated with intussuception and are 70% effective against any rotavirus disease and 90 to 100% effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease (<LINK REF="REF-Vesikari-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vesikari 2006</LINK>). The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends routine rotavirus vaccination with either bovine reassortment rotavirus vaccine (RV5) or human attenuated virus vaccine (RV1), to be given orally for three doses or two doses respectively (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2009</LINK>). However, current rotavirus vaccines do not include the newer P(6)G9 rotavirus strains and immunizations start from six weeks through 14 weeks of age. Therefore, vaccination would not be expected to prevent neonatal rotavirus infection in hospitalized low birthweight infants. Alternate methods of prevention of rotavirus infection therefore become important. Oral immunoglobulin therapy may have the potential to prevent rotavirus infection in hospitalized low birthweight neonates and reduce neonatal morbidity, mortality and health resource utilization.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current evidence from one small randomized controlled trial does not support the routine use of oral immunoglobulin preparations in the prevention of rotavirus infections in hospitalized low birth weight infants who are exposed to rotavirus. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The efficacy of the newer preparations of anti-rotaviral immunoglobulins, namely colostrum from cows immunized against rotavirus and egg yolk immunoglobulins from hens immunized against rotavirus, have not been assessed for the prevention of rotavirus infections in the newborn. Well designed, large randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effectiveness and safety of these preparations in hospitalized neonates, in the prevention of rotavirus infections. Premature and or low birth weight infants are likely to have a higher mortality and morbidity after infection with the new strains of rotavirus and it will be prudent to test in this group of infants. Such randomized controlled trials should report effects on mortality, morbidity and health resource utilization. Key outcomes to be looked for would be efficacy in the prevention of rotavirus infection, reduction of morbidity and a reduction in the duration of viral excretion which will determine the duration of expensive infection control measures. The design of these randomized controlled trials should also include cost-effectiveness evaluations.</P>
