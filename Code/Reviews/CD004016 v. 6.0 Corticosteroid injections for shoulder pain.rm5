<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Corticosteroid injections may be of limited short-term benefit for shoulder pain</P>
<P>The available evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the use of subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease, although its effect may be small and short-lived, and it may be no better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Similarly, intra-articular steroid injection may be of limited, short-term benefit for adhesive capsulitis. Further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain are needed. Important issues that need clarification include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>While many treatments, including corticosteroid injections in and around the shoulder, are advocated to be of benefit for shoulder pain, few are of proven efficacy. This review of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain is one in a series of reviews of varying interventions for shoulder disorders. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of adults with shoulder pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Central and Science Citation Index were searched up to and including June 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and pseudo-randomised trials in all languages of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo or another intervention, or of varying types and dosages of steroid injection in adults with shoulder pain. Specific exclusions were duration of shoulder pain less than three weeks, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and fracture. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trial inclusion and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers according to predetermined criteria. Results are presented separately for rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, full thickness rotator cuff tear and mixed diagnoses, and, where possible, combined in meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-six trials met inclusion criteria. The number, site and dosage of injections varied widely between studies. The number of participants per trial ranged from 20 to 114 (median 52 participants). Methodological quality was variable.</P>
<P>For rotator cuff disease, subacromial steroid injection was demonstrated to have a small benefit over placebo in some trials however no benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID was demonstrated based upon the pooled results of three trials.<BR/> <BR/>For adhesive capsulitis, two trials suggested a possible early benefit of intra-articular steroid injection over placebo but there was insufficient data for pooling of any of the trials. One trial suggested short-term benefit of intra-articular corticosteroid injection over physiotherapy in the short-term (success at seven weeks RR=1.66 (1.21, 2.28).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite many RCTs of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain, their small sample sizes, variable methodological quality and heterogeneity means that there is little overall evidence to guide treatment. Subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease and intra-articular injection for adhesive capsulitis may be beneficial although their effect may be small and not well-maintained. </P>
<P>There is a need for further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Other important issues that remain to be clarified include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>This review is one in a series of reviews aiming to determine the evidence for efficacy of common interventions for shoulder pain. This series of reviews form the update of an earlier Cochrane Review of all interventions for shoulder disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Green-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Shoulder pain is common with a reported prevalence of 6.9 to 34% in the general population and 21% in those over 70 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Chard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1991</LINK>). Shoulder disorders account for 1.2% of all general practice encounters, being third only to back and neck complaints as musculoskeletal reasons for primary care consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Rekola-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rekola 1993</LINK>). They are also a cause of significant morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Chard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Croft--1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 1996</LINK>). Although there are many accepted standard forms of conservative therapy for shoulder disorders, evidence of their efficacy is not well established. Our previous systematic review of randomized controlled trials investigating these treatments concluded that there was very little evidence to either support or refute the efficacy of interventions commonly used to treat shoulder pain. Furthermore, the interpretation of results of studies that have been performed is often hampered by the fact that these disorders are labelled and defined in diverse and often conflicting ways. In our previous review we also undertook a methodological review of the selection criteria used in these studies and concluded that more research is needed to establish a uniform method of defining shoulder disorders. </P>
<P>Since our previous review many new clinical trials, studying a diverse range of interventions, have been performed. In order to update our review we have therefore subdivided it into a series of reviews investigating the evidence for efficacy of single interventions. We have also broadened our review to include all randomised or pseudo-randomised clinical trials regardless of whether outcome assessment was blinded. </P>
<P>This review examines the evidence for efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of adults with shoulder pain. Corticosteroid injections are a commonly used modality to treat shoulder pain irrespective of underlying aetiology. Corticosteroid may be injected into the glenohumeral joint via an anterior or posterior approach, into the subacromial space, tendon sheaths of specific tendons, or locally into trigger or tender points. These are usually performed by the clinician who uses anatomical landmarks to guide blinded placement of the needle. Apart from placement of the injection into various anatomical sites, other variations in the use of steroid injections include single or multiple injections over time; injection of different sites at one time; use of different corticosteroid preparations, different volumes and types of local anesthetic; and different total volumes of injection. This review aims to review the evidence of efficacy and safety of steroid injections in the treatment of shoulder pain taking into account these issues. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of patients with shoulder pain.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>This review was conducted following a peer reviewed a priori protocol.<BR/>a) Randomised or pseudo-randomised controlled trials. Studies where participants were not randomised into intervention groups were excluded from the review. <BR/> <BR/>b) Trials in which allocation to treatment or control group was not concealed from the outcome assessor were not excluded. A sensitivity analysis including and excluding these trials was planned, because foreknowledge of treatment allocation may lead to biased assessment of outcome. </P>
<P>c) Studies in all languages were translated into English and considered for inclusion in the review. A sensitivity analysis including and excluding foreign language trials was planned to test the effect of inclusion of these trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion in this review was restricted to trials with participants meeting the following criteria:</P>
<P>All studies which primarily concerned pain arising from the shoulder in adult populations (greater than 18 years of age) were included irrespective of diagnostic label. For studies that included various regional painful disorders such as shoulder and elbow pain, we included their data if the results for shoulder pain were presented separately or if 90% or more of the study participants had shoulder pain. Specific exclusions were duration of shoulder pain less than three weeks, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and fracture. </P>
<P>In our previous review, we performed a methodological review of the selection criteria used in the included studies (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998b</LINK>). Study populations were broadly able to be categorised as either adhesive capsulitis (which included frozen shoulder and periarthritis) or rotator cuff disease (which included supraspinatus tendonitis, infraspinatus tendonitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, rotator cuff lesion, bursitis or subscapularis tendonitis) based upon the diagnostic labels and/or definitions of these labels when described. Some trials did not specify a diagnosis and some trials gave no selection criteria or study population definition (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998b</LINK>). For this review we were broadly able to categorise the participants as adhesive capsulitis (including frozen shoulder and periarthritis), rotator cuff disease, full thickness rotator cuff tear and mixed diagnoses (more than one diagnostic label or definition of study population not clearly specified).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>All randomised controlled comparisons of corticosteroid injections versus placebo, or another modality, or of varying types and dosages of steroid injection were included, and comparisons established according to intervention. Studies that included steroid injection in more than one arm were not included unless they provided information about the benefit of steroid injection. For example trials that compared steroid injection plus another intervention to steroid injection alone do not provide any information about the benefit of steroid injection eg. Thomas et al compared steroid injection and manipulation under anaesthesia to steroid injection alone (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1980</LINK>). This has been included in the surgery review. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>No studies were excluded on the basis of outcome measure used. Reported outcomes included pain (at night, at rest, and on movement), range of motion (active and/or passive: flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation and hand behind back), function, strength, and return to work or school. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (includes all major physiotherapy and occupational therapy journals from U.S.A., Canada, England, Australia and New Zealand), and Science Citation Index (SCISEARCH) up to and including June 2002 . The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group's "optimally sensitive search strategy" (see below) was used to identify all possible randomised controlled trials. Keywords gained from previous reviews and all relevant articles were searched as text terms and any additional keyword identified from subsequent articles was searched again. As this review is one of a series concerning different interventions for shoulder pain, various interventions were included in the search strategy and all searches combined as a single endeavour.</P>

<P>Further electronic searches for key authors identified were made, and a record of these searches kept. Print outs of all search strategies were compiled and stored for future reproduction and review if required.</P>
<P>In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) Issue 2, 2002 was searched.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Following identification of potential trials for inclusion by the previously outlined search strategy, the methods sections of all identified trials were reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria (see selection criteria), by two of three investigators (RB, SG, JY). All articles were coded and details of source, intervention, population and funding recorded. The investigator compiling the references (RB) decided on potentially relevant trials (based on the article being a randomised controlled trial of a steroid injection for the treatment of shoulder pain), excluding those where it was clear the intervention and population did not meet the inclusion criteria. There were no disagreements with respect to inclusion of trials into the review. </P>
<P>Trials meeting inclusion criteria were collated, and the methods and results sections were re-assessed by the same two of three reviewers (RB, SG, JY) for assessment of validity.</P>
<P>ASSESSMENT OF VALIDITY</P>
<P>Validity of included trials was assessed by comment on whether they met key criteria (appropriate randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, number lost to follow up and intention to treat analysis). These criteria were selected on the basis of being important for potentially biasing the overall outcome of trials. The only scoring was given for allocation concealment, ranked as:</P>
<P>A: adequate<BR/>B: unclear <BR/>C: inadequate<BR/>D: not used</P>
<P>Whether or not trials were appropriately randomised (as described in the Cochrane Handbook, <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>), included blinded participants, care providers and outcome assessor, had complete follow up and used an intention to treat analysis was recorded on a pre-piloted data extraction sheet and later transposed into the "Characteristics of Included Studies" table. Validity of trials was assessed in this way as opposed to using a numerical or summary scale due to concerns regarding the validity of such scales and lack of information about whether all the criteria included in such scales impact on the overall outcome of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS</P>
<P>In order to assess efficacy, raw data for outcomes of interest (means and standard deviations for continuous outcomes and number of events for binary outcomes) were extracted where available from the published reports. All standard errors of the mean were converted to standard deviation, and, when necessary, standard deviation was imputed from the range by division by four. Wherever reported data was converted or imputed, this was recorded in the notes section of the included studies table. For trials where the required data was not reported or able to be calculated, further details were requested from first authors. If no further details were provided, the trial was included in the review and fully described, but not included in the meta-analysis (i.e. no pooling of study data). An entry to that effect was made in the notes section of the included studies table.</P>
<P>When trial results were not normally distributed and so reported as median and range, the trial was not included in the meta-analysis but results presented in Additional Tables. </P>
<P>Meta-analysis was facilitated by RevMan 4.1. The following choices of statistic and 95% confidence intervals were presented for all outcomes.<BR/> <BR/>CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES:<BR/>Weighted mean difference using a fixed effects model was selected when outcomes were measured on standard scales. When outcomes were reported on non standard scales, using differing units and methods of assessment (for example disability scales), a standardised mean difference was selected. Possible clinical reasons for heterogeneity were explored, and in the presence of significant heterogeneity, trial results were not combined.</P>
<P>DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES:<BR/>Relative risk using a fixed effects model was selected for interpretation of dichotomous outcome measures in this review as this is the most appropriate statistic for the interpretation when the event is common (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1998</LINK>). Reasons for heterogeneity were evaluated and in the event of significant heterogeneity trial results were not pooled. </P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS<BR/>Three sensitivity analyses were planned. <BR/>1. Trials in which the outcome assessor was not blinded were to be excluded to assess the possible effect of detection bias. <BR/>2. Trials published in languages other than English were to be excluded to assess the possible effect of publication bias.<BR/>3. Trials for which the method of randomisation was unclear were to be excluded to assess their effect upon the conclusion of the review.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Forty potential trials were identified and 26 met the inclusion criteria. Reasons for study exclusion were lack of randomization (n=7), heterogeneous study population or included rheumatoid arthritis (n=3), did not provide any information about the value of steroid injection per se (n=3), or no outcome data reported (n=1). The 13 excluded trials and details of why they failed to meet the inclusion criteria for this review are outlined in the Table of Characteristics of Excluded Studies. </P>
<P>Details of the 26 included trials are given in the Table of Characteristics of included Studies. Twenty-five of the 26 included trials were published in English, and one was published in German (<LINK REF="STD-Strobel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Strobel 1996</LINK>). The number of participants per trial ranged from 20 to 114 (median 52 participants) and one trial did not specify number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1975</LINK>). </P>
<P>STUDY POPULATION<BR/>Based upon review of the diagnostic labels and/or definitions of the study populations, the included trials could be broadly categorised as studying adhesive capsulitis (including 'periarthritis' and 'frozen shoulder') (12 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bulgen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bulgen 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dacre-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dacre 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gam 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kivim_x00e4_cki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kivimäcki 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Windt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Windt 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-1996" TYPE="STUDY">White 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1975</LINK>); rotator cuff tendonitis (including impingement, subacromial bursitis, partial rotator cuff tears)(10 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Adebajo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adebajo 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Blair-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plafki-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plafki 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Strobel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Strobel 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vecchio-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecchio 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Withrington-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Withrington 1985</LINK>); full thickness rotator cuff tear (1 trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Shibata-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 2001</LINK>); or a combination of diagnoses (3 trials) (<LINK REF="STD-Hollingworth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hollingworth 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Winters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 1997</LINK>). The lack of uniformity in the way shoulder disorders are labelled and defined was highlighted in our previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Green-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998b</LINK>) and similar issues are applicable to the current review. </P>
<P>DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTIONS ACCORDING TO STUDY POPULATION<BR/>1. ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS <BR/>For adhesive capsulitis, intra-articular steroid injection was compared to placebo in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1991</LINK>); no treatment in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1973</LINK>); physiotherapy in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Windt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Windt 1998</LINK>); physiotherapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2001</LINK>); capsular distension in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gam 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1991</LINK>); ice in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bulgen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bulgen 1984</LINK>); infra-red irradiation in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1973</LINK>); and stellate ganglion block in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1975</LINK>).

Richardson performed an arthrogram following steroid injection and reported that the injection was intra-articular 'only inconstantly' when intra-articular injection was performed using the posterior approach, but 'readily obtained' when subacromial injection was performed (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1975</LINK>). White et al mixed urograffin with the corticosteroid preparation and took post-injection plain films.

<P>OUTCOME ASSESSMENT<BR/>Our previous review highlighted the wide variation in assessment of outcome in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of interventions for painful shoulder (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Green-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998b</LINK>) and similar issues are applicable to the current review. Of the 26 included trials, 23 trials (88.5%) included some measure of pain and 23 trials (88.5%) reported at least one measure of shoulder range of movement. The method of assessment of shoulder range of movement, including description of the instrument used, and how end of range was defined was recorded for only a minority of studies. Function was assessed in nine studies (34.6%) measured by simple four or six-point scales in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adebajo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adebajo 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>); work status in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Strobel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Strobel 1996</LINK>) and incorporated within an overall score in two trials (Patte score <LINK REF="STD-Plafki-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plafki 2000</LINK>; UCLA score <LINK REF="STD-Shibata-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 2001</LINK>).

<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS PLACEBO OR NO TREATMENT FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>Neither of the two trials that compared intra-articular steroid injection to either placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1991</LINK>) or no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1973</LINK>) in adhesive capsulitis provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. The outcome of these trials varied, with Rizk et al reporting no differences between intra-articular steroid injection and placebo with respect to pain and range of movement up to six months (double-blind, intention to treat analysis) (<LINK REF="STD-Rizk-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rizk 1991</LINK>); and Lee et al reporting significant benefit of injection over analgesia alone up to six weeks (unblinded, results only displayed graphically) (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 1973</LINK>). Lee et al also reported significant benefit of bicipital tendon sheath injection over analgesia alone. </P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR AND SUB-ACROMIAL STEROID INJECTION VERSUS NO TREATMENT FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>One trial that compared a combination of intra-articular and subacromial steroid injection to no treatment for adhesive capsulitis did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bulgen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bulgen 1984</LINK>). It reported little difference with respect to long-term outcome but some early benefit of injection with respect to pain and range of movement (only outcome assessment blinded, statistical analysis unclear).</P>
<P>SUB-ACROMIAL STEROID INJECTION VERSUS PLACEBO FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>The results of two trials involving a total of 45 participants that compared subacromial steroid injection to placebo in rotator cuff disease could be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Adebajo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adebajo 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>) (comparison 2). There was a small benefit of subacromial steroid injection over placebo at four weeks with respect to pain (SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.39, 1.26), function (SMD 0.63 ((95% CI 0.20, 1.06) and range of active abduction (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.39, 1.25) (<LINK REF="STD-Adebajo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adebajo 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>). Both of these trials were double-blind (participants and outcome assessment), no loss to follow-up was reported and an intention to treat analysis was performed. </P>
<P>It was not possible to combine the results of the other five trials that compared subacromial steroid injection to placebo for rotator cuff disease. Two of these trials reported some benefit of injection over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plafki-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plafki 2000</LINK>). Blair et al however found no difference with respect to performance of activities of daily living (double-blind but analysis and loss to follow up unclear) (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 1996</LINK>). Plafki at al reported benefit after six months of steroid injection in 19 of 40 participants in one of the two groups that received steroid injection, although another eight participants in the steroid groups required surgery (double blind, study stopped after first 10 participants in placebo group failed to improve and aggravation of symptoms in four participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Plafki-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Plafki 2000</LINK>). Two double-blind trials reported no differences between the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vecchio-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vecchio 1993</LINK>), although one has only been reported in abstract thus far (<LINK REF="STD-Kirkley-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kirkley 1999</LINK>). One trial favoured the placebo group with respect to improvement in pain at three and 12 months although more participants in the steroid injection group resumed work at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Strobel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Strobel 1996</LINK>). However the blinding of this study was unclear, the analysis included completers only and there was a large loss to follow up in both groups (30 and 15% in the injection and placebo groups respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Strobel-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Strobel 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>ANATOMICAL STEROID INJECTION (SITE DETERMINED BY CLINICAL FEATURES) VERSUS TRIGGER OR TENDER POINT INJECTION FOR GENERAL SHOULDER PAIN AND SUBGROUP EXCLUDING ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>One trial demonstrated that anatomical steroid injection was superior to trigger or tender point injection with respect to success rate after one week for 43 participants with general shoulder pain (RR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.62, 5.42), as well as in a subgroup of 33 participants excluding adhesive capsulitis (RR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.45, 4.47) (<LINK REF="STD-Hollingworth-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hollingworth 1983</LINK>). This trial was double-blind, there was no reported loss to follow-up and an intention to treat analysis was performed.</P>
<P>HIGHER DOSE VERSUS LOWER DOSE INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>One trial compared two doses of intra-articular steroid injection in adhesive capsulitis. While a trend favouring higher dose intra-articular steroid injection was found with respect to improvement in pain at six weeks (WMD=-18.10, 95% CI -37.11, 0.91), no differences were found between the higher and lower dose steroid injection with respect to improvement in sleep disturbance, functional impairment or improvement in external rotation (57 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-de-Jong-1998" TYPE="STUDY">de Jong 1998</LINK>). No statistically significant differences were found with respect to frequency of adverse effects. Both participants and outcome assessment were blinded in this trial, the method of analysis was unclear, and four patients (12.5%) dropped out of the low-dose group.</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS: COMPARISON OF ANTERIOR TO POSTERIOR APPROACH<BR/>The one trial (involving 40 participants) that compared anterior to posterior intra-articular steroid injection for adhesive capsulitis did not provide any comparative data, although reported a significantly higher level of injection accuracy with the anterior approach (19/20, 95% versus 10/20 50%, p &lt; 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-White-1996" TYPE="STUDY">White 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>Only one of the three trials comparing intra-articular steroid injection to physiotherapy contained sufficient data for meta-analysis (56 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-van-der-Windt-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van der Windt 1998</LINK>). At seven weeks, treatment success favoured steroid injection (RR=1.66, 95% CI 1.21, 2.28). At three and seven weeks, all outcomes measured favoured steroid injection (including improvement in severity of main complaint, pain during the day, pain at night, pain as rated by an observer, functional disability and abduction). By 13 weeks, benefit favouring steroid injection remained statistically significant only for improvement in severity of main complaint. No difference in outcome was demonstrated for any of the measured outcomes at 26 weeks and a small benefit favouring steroid injection was found for improvement in severity of main complaint at 52 weeks. No statistically significant differences were found with respect to frequency of adverse effects in the two treatment groups apart from facial flushing which was more common in the steroid injection group (RR=9.0, 95% CI 1.18, 68.74). While participants in this were unblinded, the study population included 109 participants, there was a low withdrawal rate (3.6% and 7.5% from the physiotherapy and steroid injection groups respectively) and an intention to treat analysis was performed. </P>
<P>It was not possible to combine the results of the other two trials that compared intra-articular steroid injection to physiotherapy for adhesive capsulitis. Bulgen compared a combination of both intra-articular and subacromial steroid injection to physiotherapy and reported little difference between groups with respect to long-term outcome but some early benefit of the combined injections with respect to pain and range of movement (only outcome assessment blinded, statistical analysis unclear) (<LINK REF="STD-Bulgen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bulgen 1984</LINK>). Dacre et al, which compared steroid injection placed anteriorly around the shoulder joint to physiotherapy reported no significant differences between groups at 6 weeks and 6 months (only outcome assessment blinded, four patients of unspecified group lost to follow-up and a completers analysis only) (<LINK REF="STD-Dacre-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Dacre 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS PHYSIOTHERAPY AND NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION (NSAID) FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>No difference with respect to pain was demonstrated between intra-articular steroid injection versus physiotherapy and NSAID at two and 12 weeks following treatment in one trial of 20 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Arslan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Arslan 2001</LINK>). However participants were unblinded in this study and it was unclear whether outcome assessment was blinded.</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS CAPSULAR DISTENSION WITH AIR FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>No difference with respect to improvement in abduction at 16 weeks was found in one trial of 29 participants comparing intra-articular steroid injection to capsular distension with air for adhesive capsulitis (<LINK REF="STD-Jacobs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Jacobs 1991</LINK>). In this trial outcome assessment was blinded but it was unclear whether participants were blinded. There was no loss to follow up reported and an intention to treat analysis was performed.</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS CAPSULAR DISTENSION WITH LIGNOCAINE AND STEROID FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>The one trial (involving 22 participants) that compared intra-articular steroid injection to capsular distension with lignocaine and steroid did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gam 1998</LINK>). They reported a benefit favouring the capsular distension group with respect to range of movement and analgesic use, no difference with respect to pain at rest but a trend favouring the distension group for pain with activity (double-blind, one patient in each group lost to follow-up, completers analysis only). </P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS STELLATE GANGLION BLOCK FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>The one trial (involving an unknown number of participants) that compared intra-articular steroid injection to stellate ganglion block for adhesive capsulitis did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Williams-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1975</LINK>). It reported no differences in outcome between treatment groups at four weeks and three months.</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS ULTRASOUND FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>No difference with respect to pain, range of abduction or success of therapy at four weeks was found in one trial of 24 participants comparing intra-articular steroid injection to ultrasound for rotator cuff disease (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS ACUPUNCTURE FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>No difference with respect to pain, range of abduction or success of therapy at four weeks was found in one trial of 24 participants comparing intra-articular steroid injection to acupuncture for rotator cuff disease (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION VERSUS HYALURONATE INJECTION FOR FULL THICKNESS ROTATOR CUFF TEAR<BR/>No difference with respect to satisfaction with treatment at 4 weeks was found in one trial of 78 participants comparing intra-articular steroid injection to hyaluronate injection for full thickness rotator cuff tears (<LINK REF="STD-Shibata-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Shibata 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>SUB-ACROMIAL STEROID INJECTION VERSUS NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION (NSAID) FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>The results of three trials with a total of 120 participants with rotator cuff disease that compared subacromial steroid injection to NSAID could be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Adebajo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Adebajo 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>) (comparison 11). No benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID with respect to improvement in pain, function or range of shoulder abduction at four or six weeks was demonstrated. One of the trials also failed to demonstrate any difference between sub-acromial steroid injection and NSAID in improvement in global assessment score at six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-White-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White 1986</LINK>). </P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR, SUB-ACROMIAL AND ACROMIOCLAVICULAR STEROID INJECTIONS VERSUS PHYSIOTHERAPY (NOT MANIPULATION) FOR GENERAL SHOULDER PAIN (MIXED DIAGNOSES)<BR/>A benefit favouring steroid injections over physiotherapy (not manipulation) with respect to pain at the end of treatment (when patient left study or 11 weeks post-randomisation) was demonstrated in one trial of 82 participants with general shoulder pain (mixed diagnoses)(WMD -2.30, 95% CI -4.10, -0.50) (<LINK REF="STD-Winters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR, SUB-ACROMIAL AND ACROMIOCLAVICULAR STEROID INJECTIONS VERSUS MANIPULATION FOR GENERAL SHOULDER PAIN (MIXED DIAGNOSES)<BR/>A benefit favouring steroid injections over manipulation with respect to pain at the end of treatment (when patient left study or 11 weeks post-randomisation) was demonstrated in one trial of 77 participants with general shoulder pain (mixed diagnoses)(WMD -3.40, 95% CI -5.46, -1.34) (<LINK REF="STD-Winters-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Winters 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION AND NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION (NSAID) VERSUS PLACEBO FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>No difference with respect to pain or success of therapy at four weeks was found in one trial of 24 participants comparing intra-articular steroid injection and NSAID to placebo for rotator cuff disease and range of abduction at four weeks favoured the placebo group (WMD -27.60, 95% CI -49.99, -5.21) (<LINK REF="STD-Berry-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Berry 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR STEROID INJECTION AND MANIPULATION UNDER ANAESTHESIA VERSUS MANIPULATION UNDER ANAESTHESIA ALONE FOR ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS<BR/>One trial of 24 participants demonstrated no difference with respect to range of abduction at four months between participants who had received an intra-articular injection of steroid with manipulation under anaesthesia compared to those who had manipulation under anaesthesia alone (<LINK REF="STD-Kivim_x00e4_cki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kivimäcki 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>SUB-ACROMIAL STEROID INJECTION AND NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION (NSAID) VERSUS NSAID ALONE FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE<BR/>There was no added benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID alone in one trial of 50 participants with respect to improvement in pain, function, range of abduction and remission at four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Petri-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Petri 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>INTRA-ARTICULAR AND SUB-ACROMIAL STEROID INJECTION VERSUS PLACEBO FOR SHOULDER PAIN (MIXED DIAGNOSES)<BR/>The one trial (involving 101 participants) that compared a combination of both intra-articular and sub-acromial steroid injection to placebo for shoulder pain (mixed diagnoses) did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Richardson-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Richardson 1975</LINK>). It reported a trend towards the steroid injections being more effective than placebo at two and six weeks (double-blind, unclear if completers only analysis and loss to follow-up was 16 and 13% in the steroid injections and placebo groups respectively). </P>
<P>SUPRASPINATUS INJECTION VERSUS PLACEBO FOR ROTATOR CUFF DISEASE (SUPRASPINATUS TENDINITIS)<BR/>The single trial that compared supraspinatus steroid injection to placebo for rotator cuff disease (supraspinatus tendinitis)(25 participants) did not provide sufficient data for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Withrington-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Withrington 1985</LINK>). It reported no difference with respect to pain or analgesics consumption at two and eight weeks follow up. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review specifically sought to determine the evidence for efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Despite a lack of uniformity in the way shoulder disorders are labelled and defined we broadly categorised the trial populations into adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff disease, full thickness rotator cuff tear and a mixed population of patients with shoulder pain based upon the information provided in the trials. Nevertheless the degree to which the results of different trials could be compared and/ or pooled was still limited particularly by the heterogeneity of the interventions and comparisons studied, varying methodological quality, inadequate reporting of results and small sample sizes. </P>
<P>For rotator cuff disease, the pooled results of two small studies suggested a small benefit of subacromial steroid injection over placebo measured at four weeks. However the results of five further trials, of varying methodological quality, that were unable to be pooled reported varying results (benefit favouring steroid injection in two trials, no difference in two trials and benefit favouring placebo in one trial). In addition, the pooled results of three trials found no difference in outcome between subacromial steroid injection and NSAID; one trial found no additional benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID alone; one trial reported no difference in outcome between intra-articular steroid injection, placebo, ultrasound and acupuncture; and one trial reported no difference in outcome between supraspinatus injection of steroid and placebo. Based upon these findings, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the short- or long-term benefit of subacromial steroid injection for rotator cuff disease. It is not known whether benefit is dependent upon accurate placement of steroid into the subacromial space although one trial which included a general population of patients with shoulder pain demonstrated that anatomical steroid injection may be superior to trigger or tender point injection with respect to success rate after one week for general shoulder pain. While two studies have verified accurate placement of subacromial steroid injection, no trials have compared blind injection to radiologically-guided injection with respect to outcome. </P>
<P>For adhesive capsulitis, we were unable to pool the results of any trials comparing intra-articular steroid alone or in combination with subacromial steroid injection to placebo or no treatment. Two trials suggested a possible early benefit and none of the trials demonstrated any longer term benefit. One trial did demonstrate a trend favouring higher dose over lower dose intra-articular steroid injection for pain improvement at six weeks in adhesive capsulitis although there were no differences with respect to improvement in sleep disturbance, functional impairment or improvement in external rotation. One trial suggested that the anterior approach may be more accurate but no trials have compared the efficacy of anterior versus posterior intra-articular injection. No trials have compared blind injection to radiologically-guided injection with respect to outcome although one trial found no benefit of injection around the anterior shoulder joint versus placebo and one trial demonstrated that anatomical steroid injection may be superior to trigger or tender point injection with respect to success rate after one week for general shoulder pain. One trial did demonstrate that intra-articular steroid injection is more beneficial than physiotherapy in terms of pain, functional disability and range of abduction at three and seven weeks, although this benefit was no longer apparent by 26 and 52 weeks. While this was supported by one trial that compared a combination of intra-articular and sub-acromial steroid injection to physiotherapy, another trial found no difference between steroid injection versus physiotherapy and NSAID. One trial suggested that distension of the shoulder joint with steroid and lignocaine conferred a benefit over steroid injection alone with respect to range of movement and pain with activity but not pain at rest whereas another trial reported no difference in abduction when steroid injection was compared to distension of the shoulder joint with air alone. Finally one trial demonstrated no additional benefit of intra-articular steroid injection over manipulation under anaesthesia alone. Based upon the findings of these studies, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the value of intra-articular steroid injection for adhesive capsulitis. </P>
<P>We were able to locate only one trial that specifically studied the value of steroid injection for full thickness rotator cuff tear. It reported no difference in outcome between those who received intra-articular steroid versus those who received hyaluronate at four weeks. With the increasing availability of ultrasound and MR imaging, it should be possible to perform trials investigating the efficacy of other interventions for this subset of patients. </P>
<P>Two previous reviews of steroid injections for shoulder pain (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Der-Heijden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Der Heijden 1996</LINK>) and for rotator cuff tendinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Goupille-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goupille 1996</LINK>) have been performed. Goupille and Sibilia concluded that steroid injection is effective in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinitis. However, this conclusion cannot be verified by the presented results. Their review included non-randomized studies, reported results of primary studies only as significant or not significant and they made no attempt to quantify effect sizes or pool results. We verified the conclusions of the review by Van Der Heijden et al regarding the overall poor methodological quality of reviewed trials, however our review differs in several important respects. Firstly, we attempted to differentiate studies based upon the nature of the populations being studied, recognizing that the benefits of therapy may vary for different underlying causes of shoulder pain. Secondly, we calculated effect sizes for the same reported outcome measures in different trials. This enables a direct comparison between studies using the same outcome measurement, although it is important to note that if one effect size is larger than another it may be because in the different studies, the numerator (the treatment effect) is larger, the denominator (the variability between subjects in each group) is smaller, or some combination of the two. In the previous studies, the overall efficacy of interventions was compared based upon calculation of success rates for each intervention group. These were determined by dividing the number of documented "successes" (defined as recovery or substantial improvement from baseline, according to the patient) at the end of the intervention period by the number allocated to the intervention by randomization. The exact definition of "success" therefore differed between papers and is, in essence, subjective. Both previous reviews did not attempt to pool the results of different trials because of valid concerns regarding the biased conclusions that may be drawn when combining studies of poor methodological quality. However, we pooled the results of the two steroid injection studies that received the highest methodological ranking in their reviews, adding further weight to the conclusions of our review. </P>
<P>This updated review of steroid injections for shoulder pain has again highlighted issues that need to be considered in order to determine the value of this intervention for shoulder pain. Less than half of the 26 trials that fulfilled inclusion criteria contained sufficient data for meta-analysis (12/26, 46.2%) and data from only three trials, included in our original review, could be pooled. Further work is needed in developing standard criteria to define shoulder disorders and a minimum core set of outcome measures that should be used in all clinical trials of shoulder pain. Other issues include the importance of accurate placement of the injection, the frequency, dose and type of steroid injected and choice of comparator. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is little evidence to either support or refute the efficacy of steroid injections for shoulder pain. While there are many randomised controlled trials of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain, their small sample sizes, variable methodological quality and heterogeneity in terms of population studied, injection modality employed and choice of comparator results in little overall evidence to guide treatment. There is evidence to support the use of subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease although its effect may be small and not well-maintained, and it may be no better than NSAID. There is a suggestion that intra-articular steroid injection may be beneficial in the short-term for adhesive capsulitis but again the effect may be small and not well-maintained. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Further work in needed in developing standard criteria to define shoulder disorders and a minimum core set of outcome measures. Other important issues that remain to be clarified include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy. </P>
