<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-13 03:12:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A genital tract infection during pregnancy can cross into the amniotic fluid and result in prelabour rupture of the membranes and preterm labour. Preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) is associated with poor infant health, death, admission of the newborn to neonatal intensive care in the first few weeks of life, prolonged hospital stay and long-term neurologic disability including cerebral palsy.<BR/>
<BR/>In this review, only one study of moderate quality evidence was included. The study reported on 4155 women randomly assigned either to an intervention group (2058 women received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis) or a control group (2097 women received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed). The present systematic review found that a simple infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care may reduce preterm births and preterm low (below 2500 g) and very low (below 1500 g) birthweight. The simple infection screening reduced preterm births from 5% of women in the control group to 3% in the intervention group. The number of low birthweight preterm infants and very low birthweight preterm infants were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. Moreover, an infection screening and treatment program during routine antenatal care is likely to save over EUR 60,000 for each preterm birth averted.</P>

<P>Genital tract infection is associated with preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). Screening for infections during pregnancy may therefore reduce the numbers of babies being born prematurely.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-13 12:29:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One study (4155 women at less than 20 weeks' gestation) met the inclusion criteria. The intervention group (2058 women) received infection screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas vaginalis and candidiasis; the control group (2097 women) also received screening, but the results of the screening program were not revealed and women received routine antenatal care. The rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was significantly lower in the intervention group (3% versus 5% in the control group) with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.75; the evidence for this outcome was graded as of moderate quality). The incidence of preterm birth for infants with a weight equal to or below 2500 g (low birthweight) and infants with a weight equal to or below 1500 g (very low birthweight) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66 and RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75, respectively; both graded as moderate quality evidence). Based on a subset of costs for preterm births of &lt; 1900 g, the authors reported that for each of those preterm births averted, EUR 60,262 would be saved.</P>

<P>There is evidence from one trial that infection screening and treatment programs for pregnant women before 20 weeks' gestation reduce preterm birth and preterm low birthweight. Infection screening and treatment programs are associated with cost savings when used for the prevention of preterm birth.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-30 13:19:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-01-11 01:48:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm birth, defined as birth occurring prior to 37 weeks' gestation, occurs in 5% to 10% of all pregnancies and is the most common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the world. Preterm birth is implicated in at least two-thirds of early infant deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1997</LINK>) and 60% of perinatal mortality including long-term neurologic disability such as cerebral palsy. It is associated with admission to neonatal intensive care, severe morbidity in the first weeks of life, prolonged hospital stay after birth, and readmission to hospital in the first year of life (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2000</LINK>). Surviving infants, especially those born before 32 weeks, have a substantially increased risk of chronic lung disease, and major and minor impairments (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2000</LINK>). Whatever the result, the emotional impact on the family can be enormous.</P>
<P>A wide spectrum of causes and demographic factors have been implicated in preterm birth. These can be categorized into four groups.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Medical and obstetric complications: there are associations with placental hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders in about one-third of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Meis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 1995</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Lifestyle factors: there is an association with alcohol abuse, low maternal age, and occupational factors (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holzman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holzman 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Satin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Satin 1994</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Amniotic fluid infection caused by a variety of micro-organisms located in the genital tract: approximately one-third of preterm births are associated with chorioamniotic infection (<LINK REF="REF-Lettieri-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lettieri 1993</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Asymptomatic cervical dilatation (<LINK REF="REF-Papiernik-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papiernik 1986</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Many micro-organisms cause both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and may result in preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour, or both. For example, bacterial vaginosis (including <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>, <I>Bacteroides</I> species, <I>Mobiluncus </I>species, <I>Ureaplasma urealyticum</I>, and <I>Mycoplasma hominis</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Hillier-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hillier 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meis 1995</LINK>), <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gravett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gravett 1986</LINK>), <I>Trichomonas vaginalis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cotch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotch 1997</LINK>), <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1990</LINK>), Group B S<I>treptococci</I> (GBS; <LINK REF="REF-Regan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regan 1981</LINK>), <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-McGregor-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGregor 1990</LINK>), syphilis (<LINK REF="REF-McFarlin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarlin 1995</LINK>), HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Temmerman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Temmerman 1994</LINK>), enteropharyngeal bacteria and <I>Peptostreptococcus</I> species (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1994</LINK>) have been associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. <I>Candida</I> species, however, have been associated with an unclear risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A possible mechanism for the link between infection and preterm birth is the bacterial stimulation of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. This may occur either directly via phospholipase A<SUB>2 </SUB>and C (<LINK REF="REF-Bejar-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bejar 1981</LINK>) or as a result of bacterial endotoxin introduced into the amniotic fluid which stimulates decidual cells to produce cytokines and prostaglandins that initiate labour (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1989</LINK>). Indirect links via substances such as interleukin-1, tumour necrosis factor and platelet activating factor, all of which may be found in infected amniotic fluid, have also been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Romero-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Romero 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoon 2000</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-11 00:42:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By identifying and treating vaginal infections, screening programs may be able to reduce the rate of preterm birth. Different screening methods are used for different types of organisms, however there is scant evidence to inform the optimal screening regimen for detecting these organisms during pregnancy. Therefore, it is unclear whether all women should be routinely screened, how often the screening should occur, and which tests should be used.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-11 01:19:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I> has been identified by multiple tests from different specimen sources. The samples may be analysed by three types of DNA-based test: ligase chain reaction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme immuno-assay (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2002</LINK>). DNA amplification techniques allow for highly sensitive and specific tests (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1997</LINK>) that are more sensitive than cell culture (<LINK REF="REF-Jespersen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jespersen 2005</LINK>). These screening tests can detect <I>Chlamydia</I> in genital secretions, urine specimens, and endocervical, vaginal or urethral samples (<LINK REF="REF-Domeika-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Domeika 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shrier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrier 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trichomoniasis may be asymptomatic in up to 50% of infected women (<LINK REF="REF-Wolner_x002d_Hanssen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolner-Hanssen 1989</LINK>). The diagnosis is usually made on clinical findings and laboratory procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Petrin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrin 1998</LINK>). Most frequently, the saline wet-mount preparation is used for observation of motile organisms under the light microscope. Wet-mount smear is a cheap and quick method but more sensitive techniques are culture, immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassay (<LINK REF="REF-Lossick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lossick 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borchardt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borchardt 1991</LINK>). Different staining techniques include Gram stain, Giemsa stain, Papanicolaou smear, acridine orange (<LINK REF="REF-Borchardt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borchardt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rein 1990</LINK>); diverse molecularly-based diagnostic methods, such as hybridization assay and PCR, may also be used. These tests vary widely in sensitivities and specificities for screening trichomoniasis (<LINK REF="REF-DeMeo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMeo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madico-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madico 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayta-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayta 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muresu-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muresu 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical syndrome; the microbiology of bacterial vaginosis is complex and is composed of <I>Gardnerella vaginalis</I>, <I>Mycoplasma hominis </I>and anaerobic bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Amsel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsel 1983</LINK>). The diagnosis is usually made on clinical Amsel criteria findings (<LINK REF="REF-Amsel-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amsel 1983</LINK>) and laboratory tests. Vaginal pH testing may be a valuable screening tool as it is a quick and inexpensive test (<LINK REF="STD-Gjerdingen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gjerdingen 2000</LINK>). Vaginal swab Gram stain with quantification of the microbial flora has high sensitivity and specificity and is accepted as an alternative method (<LINK REF="REF-Nugent-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nugent 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multiple screening tests exist for other organisms including syphilis. Screening tests such as <I>Treponema pallidum</I> hemagglutination assay, <I>Treponema pallidum</I> particle agglutination assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are more reliable than Venereal Disease Research Laboratory testing, the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, and immunoblot assays (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 2006</LINK>). The screening test for <I>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</I>, usually from a culture, remains accurate when transport conditions are suitable; this tests can be used with cervical, urine and vaginal swabs. Diagnosis of HIV infection can be obtained from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and RNA PCR testing (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 1998</LINK>). The HIV-p24 Ag is effective for early diagnosis of an acute HIV infection (<LINK REF="REF-Thies-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thies 1994</LINK>). Strategies for the diagnosis of GBS include obtaining vaginal or both vaginal and anorectal GBS cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Quinlan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quinlan 2000</LINK>) and a rapid enrichment cum antigen detection test (<LINK REF="REF-Das-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Other Cochrane reviews have addressed a number of issues regarding treatment of infection in pregnancy. Antibiotic treatment of chlamydia, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis and gonorrhoeal infection in pregnancy appear to be effective to clear organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2013</LINK>) but it is not known whether treatment of <I>trichomonas</I> will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2002</LINK>). There is also little evidence to show that screening and treatment in all asymptomatic pregnant women for bacterial vaginosis can prevent preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2013</LINK>), although antibiotic prophylaxis in pregnancies with a previous preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis can reduce preterm delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Thinkhamrop-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thinkhamrop 2002</LINK>). There is insufficient evidence regarding the treatment of ureaplasmas to reduce preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Raynes_x002d_Greenow-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raynes-Greenow 2004</LINK>), and there is no evidence that antiretrovirals and the treatment of syphilis influence the incidence of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2001</LINK>). None of the aforementioned reviews are concerned primarily with screening programs for antenatal lower genital tract infection, thus a review of the effects of screening programs for lower genital tract infection to prevent preterm birth is required.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at a high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it likely to impact on the findings. In future updates, we will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses (see 
<LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2009</LINK>). We assessed the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the comparison of lower genital tract infection screening versus no screening.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks).</LI>
<LI>Preterm low birthweight (below or equal to 2500 g).</LI>

<P>Outcomes number two and three are subsets of outcome number one.</P>
<P>GRADEprofiler (<LINK REF="REF-GRADE-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADE 2014</LINK>) was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create &#8217;Summary of findings&#8217; tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>For future updates, we will include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of the intervention and the choice of the randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>Numbers of preterm low birthweight infants (weight equal to or below 2500 g) and preterm very low birthweight infants (weight equal to or below 1500 g) were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.66 and RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Kiss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiss 2004</LINK>). None of the women reported adverse effects during the treatment period. Neonatal morbidity and mortality were not reported.</P>
<P>For a subset of preterm infants with a birthweight less than 1900 g in the <LINK REF="STD-Kiss-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kiss 2004</LINK> trial, hospital costs for mother and baby and the costs of the screening program were assessed to be EUR 60,692 (with screening and treatment contributing only 7% of costs). Overall cost savings per prevented preterm birth for this subset therefore amounted to EUR 60,692. In this trial, the screening program halved the number of preterm infants with a birthweight &lt; 1900 g. This threshold was chosen as these babies were all transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-13 02:09:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In a single trial, an antenatal lower genital tract infection screening and treatment program was shown to significantly reduce preterm birth, low birthweight preterm births (below 2500 g) and very low birthweight preterm births (below 1500 g). This intervention led to savings in direct costs associated with prematurity. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-13 02:12:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The included trial was conducted in a developed country (Austria) where characteristics of the population, such as incidence and pattern of lower genital tract infections and socioeconomic status, might differ compared to other countries. Therefore, the results of this review might not be globally generalisable. There was also economic evaluation of this intervention.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-13 02:17:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using the Cochrane Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the evidence for preterm birth outcomes was graded as moderate.The strength of this review was that the included trial was a large multi-centre prospective, randomised controlled trial. There was a clear sample-size calculation and an adequate number of participants were available for the analysis. However, around 3.2% of all randomised women (140/4429) were lost to follow up, and the study authors did not report whether the loss rate was balance between the two groups. Further, there was no blinding of group assignment or of screening results in the intervention group. The differences between the care received in the treatment and control arms may have introduced bias, depending upon the outcome measure in question.</P>
<P>The cost-benefit analysis showed a substantial savings of more than EUR 60,000 per preterm birth averted for a subset of low birthweight babies routinely admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Costs for the 75% of preterm babies with birthweights &gt; 1900 g in this trial were not reported but are assumed to be lower due to lower rates of hospitalisation.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-17 12:14:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We followed the methods set out in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). A comprehensive search was performed, all studies were examined, and the data were independently extracted by at least two review authors. We restricted the included studies to RCTs as they provide the strongest level of evidence. Therefore, we have attempted to reduce bias in the review process.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-13 12:30:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results agree with another Cochrane systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Brocklehurst-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brocklehurst 2013</LINK>), which reported that antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women with abnormal vaginal flora may reduce preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Our results differed from <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2011</LINK>, which reported that metronidazole for the treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with trichomoniasis led to an increase in preterm birth at less than 37 weeks' gestation compared with no treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-13 02:19:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Integrating a simple infection screening and treatment program into routine antenatal care may reduce preterm births in a general population of pregnant women. However, based on the evidence reviewed, we are not able to determine the effects of recurrent or persistent infection on preterm birth. Healthcare providers should discuss the potential benefits and harms of infection screening and tailor care to meet the specific needs of each care setting and healthcare system, or both.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-13 02:30:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the effects of antenatal infection screening and treatment programs in different contexts, for example, different gestational ages, different types of infection screening, and in different populations, especially in developing countries with high rates of preterm birth. <BR/>

<P>McDonald&#8217;s review of antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis compares "antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment". This is different to our review which compares "any lower genital tract infection screening and treatment programs with no screening". In the McDonald review, the subgroup analysis for the small number of women who received treatment before 20 weeks' gestation shows a promising reduction in the risk of preterm birth less than 37 weeks (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.95; five trials, 4155 women). Although this is not strong evidence, it is consistent with the reduction in preterm birth before 37 weeks in our review (risk ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.75; one trial, 4155 women).</P>
