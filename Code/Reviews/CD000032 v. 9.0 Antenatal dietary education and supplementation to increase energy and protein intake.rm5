<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:11:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Does dietary advice or supplementation to increase energy and protein intake in pregnancy improve outcomes for babies, and are there any adverse effects? Do these interventions impact differently on poorly-nourished and well-nourished pregnant women and their infants?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>During pregnancy, a baby developing inside the womb receives all its nutrition from its mother. Inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy can lead to malnutrition and poor outcomes for the baby. Therefore, advising women on their diet and providing food supplements in pregnancy may help babies to grow and thrive.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find</B>
</P>
<P>This review includes 17 randomised controlled trials, involving 9030 women. The quality of the included trials is low to moderate. We, examined several aspects of dietary advice and supplementation and produced the following four main findings.</P>
<P>(1) Providing nutritional advice resulted in an increase in the mother's protein intake, there were fewer babies born too early (two trials involving 449 women) and fewer babies with low birthweight (one trial involving 300 women), One study of 389 women showed increases in some babies birth head circumference (in one trial involving 389 women) There were also more babies with a higher birthweight among undernourished women (two trials involving 320 women).</P>
<P>(2) Giving the mothers balanced energy and protein supplements was associated with fewer babies dying during labour (five trials, 3408 women), clear increases in birthweight (11 trials, 5385 women) and fewer babies who were small-for-gestational age (seven trials, 4408 women). However, the impact on the long-term health of the baby was uncertain, including among undernourished women.</P>
<P>(3) High-protein supplementation (one trial involving 1051 women) showed no benefit for women and potential harm for the baby through an increase in the number of babies small for their gestational age at birth.</P>
<P>(4) Isocaloric protein supplementations (i.e. balanced supplements in which the protein replaces an equal quantity of other nutrients, e.g. fat and carbohydrate): in birthweight and weekly gestational weight gain, showed no benefit for women or their babies (two trials involving 184 women).</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Providing nutritional advice or balanced energy and protein supplements to women during pregnancy may be beneficial. However, there is not enough evidence on isocaloric protein supplements which currently appear to be unhelpful and high-protein supplements may be harmful.</P>

<P>We examined 149 reports corresponding to 65 trials. Of these trials, 17 were included, 46 were excluded, and two are ongoing. Overall, 17 trials involving 9030 women were included. For this update, we assessed methodological quality of the included trials using the standard Cochrane criteria (risk of bias) and the GRADE approach. The overall risk of bias was unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>Nutritional education (five trials, 1090 women) </B>
</P>
<P>Women given nutritional education had a lower relative risk of having a preterm birth (two trials, 449 women) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), and low birthweight (one trial, 300 women) (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14). Head circumference at birth was increased in one trial (389 women) (mean difference (MD) 0.99 cm, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.55), while birthweight was significantly increased among undernourished women in two trials (320 women) (MD 489.76 g, 95% CI 427.93 to 551.59, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), but did not significantly increase for adequately nourished women (MD 15.00, 95% CI -76.30 to 106.30, one trial, 406 women). Protein intake increased significantly (three trials, 632 women) (protein intake: MD +6.99 g/day, 95% CI 3.02 to 10.97). No significant differences were observed on any other outcomes such as neonatal death (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.72, one trial, 448 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), stillbirth (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.90, one trial, 431 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.11, one trial, 404 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>) and total gestational weight gain (MD -0.41, 95% CI -4.41 to 3.59, two trials, 233 women). There were no data on perinatal death.</P>
<P>
<B>Balanced energy and protein supplementation (12 trials, 6705 women)</B>
</P>
<P>Risk of stillbirth was significantly reduced for women given balanced energy and protein supplementation (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, five trials, 3408 women, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>), and the mean birthweight was significantly increased (random-effects MD +40.96 g, 95% CI 4.66 to 77.26, Tau² = 1744, I² = 44%, 11 trials, 5385 women, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of small-for-gestational age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90, I² = 16%, seven trials, 4408 women, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). No significant effect was detected for preterm birth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16, five trials, 3384 women, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>) or neonatal death (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, five trials, 3381 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). Weekly gestational weight gain was not significantly increased (MD 18.63, 95% CI -1.81 to 39.07, nine trials, 2391 women, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). There were no data reported on perinatal death and low birthweight.</P>
<P>
<B>High-protein supplementation (one trial, 1051 women)</B>
</P>
<P>High-protein supplementation (one trial, 505 women), was associated with a significantly increased risk of small-for-gestational age babies (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.41, <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). There was no significant effect for stillbirth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.15, one trial, 529 women), neonatal death (RR 2.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 10.36, one trial, 529 women), preterm birth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.56, one trial, 505 women), birthweight (MD -73.00, 95% CI -171.26 to 25.26, one trial, 504 women) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 4.50, 95% CI -33.55 to 42.55, one trial, 486 women, <I>low-quality evidence</I>). No data were reported on perinatal death.</P>
<P>
<B>Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women)</B>
</P>
<P>Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women) had no significant effect on birthweight (MD 108.25, 95% CI -220.89 to 437.40) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 110.45, 95% CI -82.87 to 303.76, <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). No data reported on perinatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal death, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:11:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review provides encouraging evidence that antenatal nutritional education with the aim of increasing energy and protein intake in the general obstetric population appears to be effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, increasing head circumference at birth, increasing birthweight among undernourished women, and increasing protein intake. There was no evidence of benefit or adverse effect for any other outcome reported.</P>
<P>Balanced energy and protein supplementation seems to improve fetal growth, and may reduce the risk of stillbirth and infants born small-for-gestational age. High-protein supplementation does not seem to be beneficial and may be harmful to the fetus. Balanced-protein supplementation alone had no significant effects on perinatal outcomes.</P>
<P>The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. The risk of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined in several of the included trials, and the quality of the evidence was low for several important outcomes. Also, as the anthropometric characteristics of the general obstetric population is changing, those developing interventions aimed at altering energy and protein intake should ensure that only those women likely to benefit are included. Large, well-designed randomised trials are needed to assess the effects of increasing energy and protein intake during pregnancy in women whose intake is below recommended levels.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Pregnancy requires an increased intake of macronutrients and micronutrients for maternal and fetal needs, and malnourishment or inadequate dietary intake during pregnancy can lead to adverse perinatal outcomes. Observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 2001</LINK>) have indicated that both gestational weight gain and energy intake are strongly and positively associated with fetal growth, and possibly associated with a reduced risk of preterm birth. Moreover, these associations are stronger in undernourished women, i.e. those with low pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (<LINK REF="REF-Ota-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ota 2011</LINK>). Fetal development complications, such as low birthweight and infants born small-for-gestational age, are associated with increases in perinatal mortality and morbidities (<LINK REF="REF-Ashworth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashworth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1987</LINK>). Globally, it is estimated that more than approximately 20 million low birthweight infants are born each year, and more than 95% of these babies are born in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Unicef_x002d_WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unicef-WHO 2004</LINK>). The effects of poor maternal nutrition on both immediate birth outcomes and longer-term health has been well-described in many epidemiological studies, including the effects from the Dutch winter famine of 1944 to 1945 (<LINK REF="REF-Stein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 1975</LINK>). Recognised longer-term health risks associated with poor infant growth include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eriksson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eriksson 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the interventions and how the interventions might work</HEADING>
<P>Undernourished maternal nutritional status at conception and inadequate maternal nutritional status during pregnancy can result in adverse perinatal outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Viswanathan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viswanathan 2008</LINK>). Dietary education to pregnant women and balanced protein energy supplementation to achieve appropriate energy intake can lead to an increase in maternal weight gain during pregnancy, and fetal growth (<LINK REF="REF-de-Onis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Onis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kulier-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulier 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viller 1998</LINK>). Protein generally comprises about 10% to 15% of dietary energy (<LINK REF="REF-Garlick-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garlick 2000</LINK>). Balanced protein energy supplementation (i.e. supplements in which protein provides less than 25% of the total energy content) has been shown to have significant positive impacts on maternal and perinatal birth outcomes, such as reductions in the incidences of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Viller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viller 1998</LINK>), stillbirth (<LINK REF="REF-Imdad-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imdad 2011</LINK>) and intrauterine growth restriction (<LINK REF="REF-de-Onis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Onis 1998</LINK>). Furthermore, non-randomised trials have reported beneficial effects on fetal growth (<LINK REF="STD-Lechtig-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Lechtig 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prentice-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prentice 1983</LINK>), although the evidence from properly randomised trials suggests more modest benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rush-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 2001</LINK>). On the other hand, data from women with severe dietary carbohydrate restrictions and very high animal protein intake, which were collected as part of routine antenatal care in a moderately affluent area, suggest that high-protein dietary supplementation may have depressed birthweight by 400 g or more (<LINK REF="REF-Grieve-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grieve 1979</LINK>: <LINK REF="REF-Rush-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rush 1989</LINK>). Isocaloric protein supplementation denotes a supplement, in which the protein content is 'balanced', i.e. provides less than 25% of its total energy content, but the protein replaced an equal quantity of non-protein energy in the control group. The observational findings reported for a non-randomised trial in Guatemala (<LINK REF="STD-Lechtig-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Lechtig 1975</LINK>) also suggest that protein supplementation is unlikely to benefit pregnant women or their infants.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We adjusted their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. Where we used ICCs from other sources, we reported this and conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. We determined that if we identified both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we planned to synthesise the relevant information. We would have considered it reasonable to combine the results from both if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely. Two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kafatos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kafatos 1989</LINK>) gave no published or unpublished data on the outcome-specific ICC. Therefore, we assumed a value of 0.01 and adjusted the corresponding sample sizes according to the design effect, i.e. by dividing the crude (individual) sample sizes by 1+ (m -1)r, where m is the average cluster size and r is the ICC (assumed to be 0.01).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary when an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>Since observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1987</LINK>) suggest a stronger association between gestational weight gain and fetal growth in women who were under-nourished before pregnancy, we stratified the analysis of the effects on mean birthweight into those trials in which the majority of women had low pre-pregnancy (or early pregnancy) weight (<LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girija-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Girija 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>), and those in which the participants appeared adequately nourished (<LINK REF="STD-Elwood-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Elwood 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982a</LINK>). For the Taiwan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK>) and two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Huybregts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huybregts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982b</LINK>),within-trial stratification was possible, based on data contained in the published reports.</P>
<P>The following outcomes were used in subgroup analysis birthweight, weight, height and BMI:</P>
<OL>
<LI>women with low pre-pregnancy (or early pregnancy) weight versus adequately nourished women;</LI>
<LI>boy versus girl.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.</P>
<P>Because growth varies with differences in sex (<LINK REF="REF-de-Onis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Onis 2007</LINK>), it is desirable to compare growth between groups after adjusting for variations by sex. We conducted subgroup analysis on children's data separated by sex for the follow-up results of balanced protein and energy supplementation at the age of 11 to 17 years (height, weight, BMI z-score, and body fat).</P>

<P>Although postnatal follow-up was limited to a small number of trials, the enhancement of fetal growth observed in those trials was not reflected in larger size or improved neurocognitive development at one year. The Bayley mental score at one year had no significant effect in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>). The Taiwan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK>) detected no effect on the Stanford-Binet IQ score at five years (<LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>), and weight at one year (<LINK REF="CMP-002.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.13</LINK>). As the data of the standard deviation of length at one year for <LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK> were not credible compared with the <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK> study, we omitted the former from the analysis and only showed the data from <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-002.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.14</LINK>). There was no significant effect on head circumference at one year from either the Taiwan (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK>) or Harlem trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.15</LINK>). Mortality from birth to age 12 months follow-up showed no significant difference between prenatal lipid-based nutrient supplements versus prenatal multiple micronutrients (<LINK REF="STD-Huybregts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huybregts 2009</LINK>) (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.10; one study, 1023 women; <LINK REF="CMP-002.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.17</LINK>). A follow-up study at age 12 months of <LINK REF="STD-Huybregts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huybregts 2009</LINK> showed no significant difference for infant growth (length for age growth, weight per month, length per month, head circumference per month, chest circumference per month), mortality, or morbidity between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Lanou-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanou 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maternal outcomes other than weight gain were reported infrequently. Only two trials reported results on other outcomes.

The East Java trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>) found no increase in maternal weight at four weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="CMP-002.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.18</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this update, we found one trial of 1320 pregnant women for lipid-based nutrient supplementation (only the conference abstract was available).

<P>Follow-up at 6.5 to 9.5 years of age for approximately 25% of the children randomised in <LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK> found no difference in immune function (delayed-hypersensitivity skin tests, antibody responses to pneumococcal and rabies vaccines, and salivary IgA concentration) between the intervention and control groups (data not shown in data and analysis table). Follow-up at 11 to 17 years of age for approximately two-thirds of the children who were still alive found no significant differences in height (<LINK REF="CMP-002.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.19</LINK>), weight (<LINK REF="CMP-002.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.20</LINK>), or systolic or diastolic blood pressure (data not shown), but did find a small increase in the mean BMI z-score (MD +0.16, 95% CI +0.01 to +0.31; one trial, 855 children - <LINK REF="CMP-002.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.21</LINK>) in the control group. However, the difference in BMI was in contrast with the absence of the effect on per cent body fat (<LINK REF="CMP-002.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.22</LINK>). Follow-up at 16 to 22 years of age of <LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK> showed no evidence (data not shown) that maternal protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy compared with supplementation during lactation (controlled group were supplemented protein-energy during lactation) affected the cognitive ability or school performance of offspring in rural Gambia (<LINK REF="REF-Alderman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderman 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Nutritional education was successful in reducing the risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, increasing head circumference at birth, increasing birthweight among undernourished women and increasing protein intake; however, there was no evidence of benefit or adverse effect for any other outcome reported.</P>
<P>Balanced energy/protein supplementation was associated with a significantly reduced risk of stillbirth, increased mean birthweight, and a significant reduction in the risk of small-for-gestational-age birth. No significant effect was detected for preterm birth, or neonatal death.</P>
<P>High-protein supplementation was associated with a significantly increased risk of infants born small-for-gestational age, but this is based on only one trial including 1051 women. Based on two trials including only 184 women, isocaloric protein supplementation had no significant effect on birthweight or weekly gestational weight gain.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Nutritional education appears effective in increasing pregnant women's protein intake, as well as significantly increasing birth head circumference and birthweight among undernourished women, and reducing preterm birth and low birthweight. No data have been reported on other important maternal pregnancy outcomes, such as duration of labour, caesarean section, or postpartum weight retention.</P>
<P>The modest increase in birthweight associated with balanced energy/protein supplementation may well be explained by the rather small net increases in energy intake achieved in most of the trials. Non-compliance and dietary substitution are likely explanations for these small net increases, and the much higher energy supplement provided in the Gambia trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>) appeared to have a much larger effect on mean birthweight. Of the seven sizeable trials with the highest methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elwood-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Elwood 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huybregts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huybregts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>), only the East Java trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>) failed to show any benefit for mean birthweight (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), despite convincing evidence that the trial participants were undernourished prior to the intervention. Owing to the large sample size, chance is an unlikely explanation for the absence of benefit in the East Java trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>), and an undetected substitution of the normal home diet by the supplement seems more likely. Due to the significant effect on mean birthweight (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>), the reduction in the risk of infants born small-for-gestational age (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>) was substantial. Nonetheless, that reduction did not appear to be associated with long-term benefits for child growth or development, and long-term follow-up was only reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>). Of greatest importance is the evidence indicating reduced risk of stillbirth (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). However, this evidence is based on five trials and is classified as low quality, and the biological mechanism for such risk reduction remains unclear, given the modest effects observed on the indices of fetal growth.</P>
<P>Most of the supplements/dietary manipulations also involved changes to the micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) content of the diet in both the intervention and control. As micronutrient supplementation may also alter some pregnancy outcomes independent of protein and energy, it is difficult to separate the contribution to the effects, particularly in the "balanced protein and energy" studies.</P>
<P>The available evidence from one trial provides no justification for prescribing high-protein nutritional supplements to pregnant women. Not only do such supplements appear to lack beneficial effects, but the evidence suggests that they may even be harmful. Furthermore, the data derived from these trials suggest that isocaloric protein supplementation alone (i.e. without energy supplementation) is unlikely to be of benefit to pregnant women or their infants. The two included trials had high heterogeneity, probably because amounts of energy supplementation were different (273 kcal in <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982a</LINK>; 425 kcal in <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982b</LINK>). The finding of the excluded trial of <LINK REF="STD-Mardones_x002d_Santander-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mardones-Santander 1988</LINK>, which reported increases in the risk of small-for-gestational age infants, remains uncertain, given the methodological limitations of the trial. Moreover, the normal-protein "control" supplement in <LINK REF="STD-Mardones_x002d_Santander-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mardones-Santander 1988</LINK> contained much higher quantities of iron and other micronutrients than the high-protein supplement.</P>
<P>The results of this review should be interpreted with caution considering that the majority of trials were published in the 1970s and 1980s. The incidence of inadequate nutrition and overweight and obesity is likely to be different today, and most trials included a mixed population of those considered to have poor nutritional status and potentially those with adequate nutrition or over-nutrition. Indeed, seven trials were from high-income countries where recent reports suggest that two-thirds of the general population and half of pregnant women are overweight or obese (<LINK REF="REF-Haslehurst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haslehurst 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2011</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We included 17 trials involving 9030 women. The quality of the evidence in this review was assessed using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>) and the results are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 4</LINK>. The GRADE uses four levels of quality (very low, low, moderate and high) over several domains covering limitations in the design and implementation of the studies, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency in the results, imprecision of the results and high probability of publication bias. Weekly gestational weight gain was used when total gestational weight gain was not available. In studies on a nutritional education during pregnancy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), the evidence was judged to be of low quality (stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, birthweight and infants born small-for-gestational age) and very low quality (total gestational weight gain) which includes two of the primary outcomes. The studies on balanced protein and energy supplementation in pregnancy (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), including significant reductions in stillbirth and infants born small-for-gestational age, and significant increase in birthweight, were considered to be of moderate quality. Preterm birth was also of moderate quality. Neonatal death was low quality, and weekly gestational weight gain was very low quality. In studies on high-protein supplementation in pregnancy studies (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), the significant increase in infants born small-for-gestational age was of moderate quality in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>) and weekly gestational weight gain was of low quality. In the isocaloric balanced protein supplementation in pregnancy studies (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of results table 4</LINK>), the evidence was judged to be of very low quality (birthweight, weekly gestational weight gain) meaning that the estimates were very uncertain.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-23 12:19:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We made efforts to limit potential biases in the review process in several ways. Two review authors assessed the eligibility for inclusion and the risks of bias independently. Although the authors' views varied, we decided to accept the final conclusions after extensive discussion and reaching a consensus. Carrying out reviews, however, may require a number of subjective judgements, and it is possible that a different review team may have reached different decisions regarding the assessments of eligibility and risks of bias. Feedback from readers will serve to improve the next review update.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We have included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and excluded the quasi-RCTs previously included in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>). The new findings of this review are that balanced energy and protein supplementation was associated with significant increases in mean birthweight, while the other major findings are consistent with those of the previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2003</LINK>). Prenatal supplementation with multi-micronutrients was associated with a significantly reduced risk of low-birthweight infants and with improved birthweight when compared with iron-folic acid supplementation, although there was no effect on the risk of preterm birth or small-for-gestational age infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2009</LINK>). Researchers should aim to include only those women in trials to increase energy and protein intake who have the potential to benefit. Observational data suggest women who are overweight or obese or who exceed their daily energy and protein requirements during pregnancy are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including: stillbirth and large-for-gestational age and macrosomia (birthweight <U>&gt;</U> 4 kg) (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heslehurst-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heslehurst 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thangaratinam-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thangaratinam 2012</LINK>), therefore, the effect of increasing protein and energy intake could have opposite effects on different populations within the same trial if those included are not adequately defined and selected.</P>
<P>In this update, we found a follow-up study of <LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK> participants aged 16 to 22 years that assessed the cognitive ability or school performance of offspring (<LINK REF="REF-Alderman-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderman 2014</LINK>). Although balanced protein-energy supplementation provided a benefit for short-term pregnancy outcomes, no long-term effects on cognitive ability were observed in the follow-up study. We could not conclude if the benefits of supplementation during pregnancy lasted for a long period, and we also need to consider the effect of the intervention given postpartum in the control group. Some studies showed that nutrition in the early postnatal period was important for brain development, prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding improved cognitive development at 6.5 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2008</LINK>), and stunting in early childhood was related to poor cognitive development (<LINK REF="REF-Grantham_x002d_McGregor-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grantham-McGregor 1991</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>This review provides encouraging evidence that nutritional education to increase protein and energy intake and balanced energy and protein supplementation may reduce some perinatal adverse outcomes. The long-term effects are unclear and it seems likely that targeting undernourished women rather than the whole obstetric population would convey the most benefit. For most of the included trials in this review, the risk of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined, and the results of this review should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Nutritional education appears to be effective in increasing pregnant women's protein intake, and increases fetal growth, such as birth head circumference and birthweight among undernourished women. The 54% relative reduction in preterm birth, and also the reduction in low birthweight for nutritional education in energy and protein compared with no nutritional counselling may be beneficial to pregnant women.<BR/>
<BR/>Balanced energy and protein supplementation appears to reduce the risks of stillbirth, although the biological mechanisms underlying these reductions remain unclear. Furthermore, balanced protein and energy interventions, as provided in most trials, result in significant increases in maternal weight gain and infant birthweight, and decrease the risk of infants born small-for-gestational age These effects do not seem to confer long-term benefits to the child in terms of growth, neurocognitive development, and diseases in adulthood, such as adiposity or blood pressure. The available evidence is inadequate to evaluate the potential effects on preterm birth, neonatal death or maternal health.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Based on the available evidence, there is no justification for prescribing high-protein and isocaloric nutritional supplements to pregnant women, although the number of trials and women included are few.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-30 13:27:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>High-quality randomised trials that target those women who are nutritionally deprived or underweight with reduced energy intake are needed; and long-term follow-up is also required.</P>
<P>Given the modest benefits in birthweight among undernourished women, preterm delivery and low birthweight documented for balanced energy and protein education during pregnancy, future randomised trials need to assess the effects on perinatal outcomes such as stillbirth and neonatal death. Effective interventions, such as the content and frequency of nutritional education, need to be clarified.<BR/>
<BR/>Future energy and protein supplementation trials should focus on outcomes other than fetal growth, especially in undernourished women, and should give particular attention to confirming evidence on interventions for reducing the risks of stillbirth and small-for-gestational age. Such trials will require large sample sizes. Any future trials should also assess the effects on women, including duration of labour, caesarean section, macrosomia and postpartum weight retention. Increased protein intake during pregnancy seems to be effective for increasing birthweight; however, future interventions need to consider how women and families can learn to integrate more protein in daily meals.</P>
<P>
<BR/>The lack of evidence of benefit, coupled with the possibility of harm, suggests that future trials of high-protein supplementation and isocaloric protein supplementation should not be considered.</P>

<P>The methods section has changed to include only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and to exclude quasi-RCTs or cross-over trials. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Atton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Atton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-Brown-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell Brown 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankin-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hankin 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyengar-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Iyengar 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mardones_x002d_Santander-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mardones-Santander 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1938" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1938</LINK>), previously included in the analysis, have now been excluded because of their quasi-RCT design. The current inclusion of information about caloric restriction for women who are overweight or obese only serves to increase confusion as it requires discussion of the clinical implications for two different populations, thus we excluded the outcome of "energy and protein restriction in women who were overweight or showed high weight gain". Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Badrawi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Badrawi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guelinckx-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Guelinckx 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 2008</LINK>), previously included in the analysis, have now been excluded because the target population was out of scope for this review. Six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Atton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Atton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-Brown-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell Brown 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hankin-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Hankin 1962</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iyengar-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Iyengar 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mardones_x002d_Santander-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mardones-Santander 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1938" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1938</LINK>), previously included in the review, have now been excluded because of their quasi-RCT design.</P>
<P>We have added subgroup analysis that were not specified in the original protocol. Observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1987</LINK>) suggest a stronger association between gestational weight gain and fetal growth in women who were under-nourished before pregnancy. We therefore stratified the analysis of the effects on mean birthweight into those trials in which the majority of women had low pre-pregnancy (or early pregnancy) weight (<LINK REF="STD-Ceesay-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ceesay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girija-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Girija 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kardjati-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kardjati 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rush-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rush 1980</LINK>), and those in which the participants appeared adequately nourished (<LINK REF="STD-Elwood-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Elwood 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982a</LINK>). For the Taiwan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blackwell-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Blackwell 1973</LINK>) and two others (<LINK REF="STD-Huybregts-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Huybregts 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Viegas-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Viegas 1982b</LINK>), within-trial stratification was possible, based on data contained in the published reports. Because growth varies with differences in sex (<LINK REF="REF-de-Onis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Onis 2007</LINK>), it is desirable to compare growth between groups after adjusting for variations by sex. We conducted subgroup analysis separated by sexes for follow-up results of balanced protein and energy supplementation at the age of 11 to 17 years (height, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI z-score, and body fat).</P>

<P>1) Randomisation by cluster (village), but effects reported for individual births, based on multilevel (3-stage random-effects) modelling with separate error terms for the village, mother and, for mothers with more than 1 pregnancy during study, the baby.<BR/>2) Results reported both overall and stratified by season (hungry vs harvest), but this review was based on overall data. Note that definitions of seasons are not entirely consistent with previous (non-randomised) studies from this group and were chosen because "post hoc analysis indicated that this selection yielded the greatest discrimination between hungry and harvest season effects".<BR/>3) Many outcome analyses are based on individual women and therefore do not account for the intra-class correlation among women living in the same village. Sample sizes in these outcomes have therefore been adjusted downward to the nearest integer by dividing by 1+(m-1)r, where m is the average number of women per village and r = 0.01 is the (assumed) intra-class correlation co-efficient.</P>

<P>Despite the original RCT design, the reported results were based on observational analyses of the data. In one report of this trial (Delgado 1982), the results were indeed presented according to randomised treatment. This report was also excluded, however, because the analysis was based on individual women despite randomisation by village, and was limited to women with data on length of gestation, and showed evidence of major problems in validity of gestational age measurements. Stein 2003, Webb 2005, Stein 2006, and Hodinott 2008 were also based on the treatment allocation as randomised but were excluded from analysis of long-term outcomes because the offspring were also supplemented, making it impossible to distinguish effects of prenatal maternal supplementation from those of postnatal supplementation of the infant/child.n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA).</P>

<P>4 pregnancy interventions, to be given daily from 12 weeks' gestation until delivery.<BR/>1. FeFol: iron-folate, 60 mg iron 400 µg folate, representing the usual standard of care during pregnancy, as per Gambian Government guidelines (control group). <BR/>2. MMNs: a combination of 15 micronutrients, specifically designed for use during pregnancy, and as formulated by UNICEF. A single tablet provides the recommended dietary allowance for each micronutrient, but we will supplement women in this arm of the trial with 2 daily MMN tablets. <BR/>3. PE + FeFol: protein-energy and iron-folate. A food-based supplement developed by Valid International, providing a comparable level of iron and folate to the FeFol only arm, but with the addition of energy, protein and lipids. <BR/>4. PE + MMN: protein-energy and MMNs. A micronutrient fortified food-based supplement also developed by Valid International, and providing comparable levels of micronutrients to the MMN arm (including FeFol), in addition to the energy and protein and lipid content. <BR/>
