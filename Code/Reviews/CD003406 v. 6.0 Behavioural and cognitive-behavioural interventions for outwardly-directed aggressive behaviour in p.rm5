<P>
<I>
<B>Review question</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>This review is an update of a previous version.The aim of the review was to find out whether behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapies are more effective in reducing aggressive behaviour in adults and children with intellectual disabilities, compared to a control group that received no intervention.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Background</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>Challenging behaviour is a significant cause of social exclusion for people with intellectual disabilities. There is no firm evidence about which therapies are most helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We searched a number of electronic databases in April 2014 to ensure that the review was up-to-date. We included six studies in the review with a total number of 309 participants. Three studies examined anger management, one study examined assertiveness training and problem solving, one study examined 'mindfulness' based on meditation, and one study examined modified relaxation. All the studies were conducted in community settings apart from one, which was conducted in a forensic inpatient setting. Five of these studies were small, comprising between 12 and 40 participants, and one was a large study of 179 participants, which was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme. Information on funding was not available for the other studies. Follow-up data were available only for two studies.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Key results</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>We found improved outcomes in five studies, including reduction in anger ratings and in aggressive incidents, at the end of treatment. One study found improvements in anger coping skills as reported by key workers at 16 weeks and 10 months, but no other long-term benefit. One large study did not find improvements in quality of life or reduced costs to health services. Due to differences in the types of interventions, populations and assessments, we could not combine the results of the studies.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</I>
</P>
<P>There was one large study which presented moderate-quality data on the outcomes of interest. The other included studies were small and of poor methodological quality. Based on a 'Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) assessment, we judged the quality of evidence on the outcomes of interest to range from very low to moderate quality. Moreover, the diversity of the interventions and participant groups makes it difficult for us to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any particular approach. Therefore, more good-quality studies with longer-term follow-up data are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-03-16 10:40:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Outwardly-directed aggressive behaviour is a significant part of problem behaviours presented by people with intellectual disabilities. Prevalence rates of up to 50% have been reported in the literature, depending on the population sampled. Such behaviours often run a long-term course and are a major cause of social exclusion. This is an update of a previously published systematic review (see Hassiotis 2004; Hassiotis 2008).</P>

<P>In April 2014 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and eight other databases. We also searched two trials registers, checked reference lists, and handsearched relevant journals to identify any additional trials.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-03-16 10:42:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently identified studies and extracted and assessed the quality of the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-18 12:58:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We deemed six studies (309 participants), based on adult populations with intellectual disabilities, suitable for inclusion in the current version of this review. These studies examined a range of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches: anger management (three studies (n = 235); one individual therapy and two group-based); relaxation (one study; n = 12), mindfulness based on meditation (one study; n = 34), problem solving and assertiveness training (one study; n = 28). We were unable to include any studies using behavioural interventions. There were no studies of children.</P>
<P>Only one study reported moderate quality of evidence for outcomes of interest as assessed by the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We judged the evidence for the remaining studies to be of very low to low quality. Most studies were at risk of bias in two or more domains: one study did not randomly allocate participants and in two studies the process of randomisation was unclear; in one study there was no allocation concealment and in three studies this was unclear; blinding of assessors did not occur in three studies; incomplete outcome data were presented in one study and unclear in two studies; there was selective reporting in one study; and other biases were present in one study and unclear in four studies.</P>
<P>Three of the six studies showed some benefit of the intervention on improving anger ratings. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, as we considered the studies too heterogeneous to combine (e.g. due to differences in the types of participants, sample size interventions, and outcome measures).</P>
<P>Follow-up data for anger ratings for both the treatment and control groups were available for two studies. Only one of these studies (n = 161) had adequate long-term data (10 months), which found some benefit of treatment at follow-up (continued improvement in anger coping skills as rated by key workers; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies (n = 192) reported some evidence that the intervention reduces the number of incidents of aggression and one study (n = 28) reported evidence that the intervention improved mental health symptoms.</P>
<P>One study investigated the effects of the intervention on quality of life and cost of health and social care utilisation. This study provided moderate-quality evidence, which suggests that compared to no treatment, behavioural or cognitive-behavioural interventions do not improve quality of life at 16 weeks (n = 129) or at 10 months follow-up (n = 140), or reduce the cost of health service utilisation (n = 133).</P>
<P>Only one study (n = 28) assessed adaptive functioning. It reported evidence that assertiveness and problem-solving training improved adaptive behaviour.</P>
<P>No studies reported data on adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-16 11:01:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The existing evidence on the effectiveness of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions on outwardly-directed aggression in children and adults with intellectual disabilities is limited. There is a paucity of methodologically sound clinical trials and a lack of long-term follow-up data. Given the impact of such behaviours on the individual and his or her support workers, effective interventions are essential. We recommend that randomised controlled trials of sufficient power are carried out using primary outcomes that include reduction in outward-directed aggressive behaviour, improvement in quality of life, and cost effectiveness.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Intellectual disabilities</HEADING>
<P>Intellectual disabilities, also known as 'learning disabilities' in the UK, are defined as a condition of global cognitive delay that occurs during the developmental period. It is associated with low cognitive ability as indicated, for example, by an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70 on an appropriately standardised and administered test. It is also characterised by additional deficits in areas of adaptive functioning such as education, occupation, self direction, personal relationships, and community utilisation. Intellectual disabilities are known as 'Mental Retardation' in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>) and as 'Intellectual Disability' in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). We use the term 'Intellectual disabilities' throughout the present review as it is used internationally.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Problem behaviours in people with intellectual disabilities</HEADING>
<P>Challenging behaviour is a term used to describe longstanding patterns of maladaptive behaviour in people with intellectual disabilities. While not currently a diagnostic entity, it is nonetheless considered a potential comorbidity in people with intellectual disabilities in the DSM-5 (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2013</LINK>). However, the ICD-10 provides a diagnostic code, not only for 'Repetitive Self Injury', but also 'Aggression towards Other' (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The social perspective of challenging behaviour is very important because it is the complex interaction between the individual and the setting in which he or she lives that determines whether a behaviour is considered to be unacceptable. It will, for example, have to be interpreted as frightening or distressing by another person (<LINK REF="REF-RCPsych-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPsych 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1995</LINK> emphasised this 'two-way' interaction between the individual and his or her environment in his definition of challenging behaviour:</P>
<P>"It refers to culturally abnormal behaviour of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is likely to be placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit the use of, or result in the person being denied access to, ordinary community facilities"</P>
<P>In clinical practice in the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland, the consensus Diagnostic Criteria for behavioural and mental disorders in Learning Disabilities (DC-LD (<LINK REF="REF-RCPsych-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPsych 2001</LINK>)) have adopted the following general diagnostic criteria for problem behaviours in people with intellectual disabilities:</P>
<P>A The problem behaviour is of significant frequency, severity or chronicity as to require clinical assessments and special interventions or support;</P>
<P>B The problem behaviour must not be a direct consequence of other psychiatric disorders (for example, pervasive developmental disorders, non-affective psychotic disorders, depressive episode, generalised anxiety disorders, personality disorders), drugs or physical disorders;</P>
<P>C One of the following must be present:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the problem behaviour results in significant negative impact on the person's quality of life or that of others</LI>
<LI>the problem behaviour presents significant risks to the health or safety of the person or others</LI>
</UL>
<P>D The problem behaviour is persistent and pervasive.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Throughout this systematic review, we use the term 'problem behaviours' to refer to challenging behaviour.</P>
<P>A wide range of problem behaviours may occur in people with intellectual disabilities. These include:</P>
<OL>
<LI>physically aggressive behaviour;</LI>
<LI>destruction of environment;</LI>
<LI>self injury;</LI>
<LI>sexually inappropriate behaviour;</LI>
<LI>offending type behaviour (arson, stealing, other crime); </LI>
<LI>other (may include behaviour problems as varied as ripping clothes, eating non-edible objects, mannerisms or bizarre rituals) (<LINK REF="REF-RCPsych-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCPsych 2001</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>It has been shown that several problem behaviours can coexist in the same individual (<LINK REF="REF-Borthwick_x002d_Duffy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borthwick-Duffy 1994</LINK>). Severity has been shown to correlate with level of IQ, gender, institutional setting, age, and other disabilities. Problem behaviours may also form part of the phenotype of specific genetic disorders such as overeating in Prader-Willi syndrome or severe self injury in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Behaviours associated with specific genetic conditions are sometimes referred to as a 'behavioural phenotype' for that condition (<LINK REF="REF-Skuse-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skuse 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McClintock-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClintock 2003</LINK> also identified a series of predictors for problem behaviours in people with intellectual disabilities in a meta-analytic study, such as male gender, deficit in expressive communication, and a diagnosis of autism, which appeared to be particularly associated with aggressive behaviour. <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2008</LINK> replicated some of the previous findings and found, in addition, that problem behaviours were associated with female gender, living in shared-care settings or with a paid carer (rather than with family), not having Down Syndrome or severe physical disability, and suffering from urinary incontinence and visual impairment.</P>
<P>The prevalence of problem behaviours in school children has been reported to range from 8.2% if severe to 22.2% if less severe (<LINK REF="REF-Kiernan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiernan 1994</LINK>). Studies of adult populations with intellectual disabilities have shown a variable prevalence of all problem behaviours, ranging from 6.1% in the community to 40% among those in long-stay hospitals (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1995</LINK>) and 10% to 15% in the total intellectually-disabled population (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2001</LINK>). More recently, in a population-based study, the prevalence of challenging behaviour was found to be 25% based on clinical opinion or 18.7% based on the DC-LD criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A prospective study of incidence of mental ill-health in an epidemiological sample of adults with intellectual disabilities found a two-year incidence rate of problem behaviour of 4.6% (<LINK REF="REF-Smiley--2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smiley 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the most difficult-to-manage behaviours is episodic aggression towards others or property. Such behaviours have a significant impact on the individual and his or her carers and are linked to exclusion, long-term hospitalisation, increased likelihood of relocating individuals to 'out of area' placements and being prescribed antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Lundgvist-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lundgvist 2013</LINK>). Estimates of the prevalence of aggressive behaviour are variable and depend on context. An American survey of 91,164 people with intellectual disabilities identified aggressive behaviours (physical aggression and property destruction) in 9.2% of all those who presented with any type of problem behaviours (14%) (<LINK REF="REF-Borthwick_x002d_Duffy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borthwick-Duffy 1994</LINK>). One study of 3165 adults with intellectual disabilities receiving rehabilitation services in Canada found a 12-month prevalence of aggressive behaviour of 51.8%; property damage of 24%; verbal aggression of 37.6%; physical aggression of 24.4%, and sexual aggression of 9.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Crocker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crocker 2006</LINK>). However, only 4.9% of individuals exhibited aggressive behaviour that led to another person being injured. A community-based epidemiological study found that the prevalence of aggression was 9.8% and the two-year incidence was 1.8% (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2009</LINK>). The prevalence of aggression in individuals with profound intellectual disability or multiple disabilities has been reported to be as high as 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Poppes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poppes 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The chronic course of aggressive behaviour, and its serious consequences for the individual and his or her social network, suggest that there is a great need for immediate and accessible specialised support and for the development of effective interventions for its management.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Scope of this review</HEADING>
<P>This review is concerned with behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions for outwardly-directed aggressive behaviour, which refers to aggressive and destructive behaviour directed towards others and property, including verbal and physical aggression. The review does not include studies of self injurious behaviour, examined in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Rana-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rana 2013</LINK>), or other types of behaviour such as stereotypical behaviour or sexually inappropriate behaviour.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management of aggressive behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Established patterns of aggressive behaviour usually require intensive and individualised management. Generally the acute management of aggression requires the removal of the individual or others from the vicinity by implementing techniques, which may include de-escalation, appropriate forms of restraint, time-out or psychotropic medication. Psychosocial techniques can then be adopted to promote more adaptive responses in the individual.</P>
<P>A range of psychosocial interventions, in particular behavioural and cognitive-behavioural techniques, are available to manage aggressive behaviour within the intellectually-disabled population. While we make a distinction between behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions, it may be a false dichotomy to think of them as unconnected methodologies. Most modern interventions integrate elements stemming from both cognitivism and behaviourism to elicit change, but may differ in levels of emphasis of the two.</P>
<P>Behavioural approaches involve carrying out a functional analysis of behaviour. A clear description of the behaviour, factors that predict the behaviour, and factors or consequences that maintain the behaviour are identified. A hypothesis about the function of the behaviour is formulated, followed by direct observations that provide evidence supporting the hypothesis. Behavioural approaches utilise the principles of reinforcement and extinction. Positive Behavioural Support is one framework used frequently in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2005</LINK>). It aims to encourage a clear understanding of the individual's behaviour within his or her social context.</P>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), a widely-used approach for a range of psychological problems, aims to allow the individual to identify how his or her thoughts and feelings and physiological response are linked, to allow him or her to address present maladaptive cognitions. The therapist and individual develop a formulation of the causes behind the behaviours and factors that maintain it, and work together to identify new strategies to reduce distress and cope with difficult situations. The therapist helps the patient learn to recognise errors in thinking style and explore potential alternative explanations for his or her beliefs. The therapist makes necessary technical modifications based on the level of intellectual disability and the individual needs of their client, for example, visual aids, repetition or proceeding at a slower pace. Cognitive-behavioural therapy has been used mainly for the management of aggression and anger in people with intellectual disabilities.</P>
<P>Emerging interventions, such as mindfulness, are being adapted in adjunction to behavioural approaches, or as a stand-alone intervention. Mindfulness has its roots in key principles found in Buddhist teaching (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 2004</LINK>) and utilises meditation to identify patterns in thinking. Cognitive-behavioural exercises can then be used to develop the above-mentioned understanding of the interlinked nature of body, thoughts, emotions, and behaviour.</P>
<P>In practice, there is often a multi-component approach to the management of aggressive behaviour, as it is important to bring about significant changes rapidly and to ensure the safety of the person and others, including carers. The objective, however, is to promote long-term emotional well-being and reduce challenging behaviours.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-18 13:15:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Positive behavioural support involves using functional analysis to identify the purpose of a particular behaviour, and then teaching the person the necessary social, behavioural, and communication skills to replace the original behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2005</LINK>). The approach demands a multi-component intervention as it acknowledges that challenging behaviours may be provoked by multiple variables. It therefore involves the development of a new support plan and focuses on achieving physical, environmental, and social well-being for the individual. It relies on the use of positive strategies and reinforcement to maintain positive behaviour, avoiding any punitive measures.</P>
<P>Cognitive-behavioural therapy-based interventions for anger management can be delivered either individually or within a group setting. In order to successfully implement the intervention, the therapist and individual work collaboratively to identify and develop awareness of situations that evoke anger in the individual and when he or she is becoming angry. It teaches new skills to manage and control anger when such situations arise. Anger management strategies involve a range of cognitive, behavioural and physiological skills such as problem solving, removing oneself from the situation, being assertive, seeking help, or employing relaxation techniques.</P>
<P>Mindfulness teaches the individual to focus and refocus their attention on the here and now during meditation and to observe his or her thoughts and feelings without judgement (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 2004</LINK>). In practice this means realising when they have feelings of anger or upset without trying to censor or analyse these feelings or thoughts. Individuals learn to develop the ability to let such feelings arise and subside without having to react to them, thus changing patterns of behaviour. An intervention based on mindfulness called 'Meditation on the Soles of the Feet' teaches individuals with aggressive behaviour to identify behaviours or emotions that give rise to anger or aggression and then to alter the focus of their attention from these precursors to a neutral part of their body, in this case, the soles of the feet (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-03-18 13:20:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The importance of effectively managing problem behaviours, particularly aggression, has led to considerable research into different types of interventions. These are usually published as single-case reports, which lack data on long-term evaluation of clinical outcomes and the economic costs of those interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Meinhold-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinhold 1990</LINK>). Four reviews of treatment efficacy for problem behaviours have been identified (<LINK REF="REF-Didden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Didden 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Didden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Didden 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heyvaert-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyvaert 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scotti-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scotti 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>All four reviews based their meta-analyses mostly on single-case experimental designs and covered published research in several specialist journals over a 10-year period.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Scotti-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scotti 1991</LINK> suggests that formal functional analysis of behaviour prior to treatment may improve clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>The Didden reviews describe their analyses in more detail and include more papers. <LINK REF="REF-Didden-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Didden 1997</LINK> searched 30 journals, which focused on intellectual disabilities and included four groups of interventions: pharmacological management, antecedent control procedures, response contingent procedures, and non-contingent procedures.</P>
<P>The participants had a diagnosis of severe intellectual disability or developmental disorders such as autism. The authors used 'elimination of problem behaviour' as their main outcome. They compared pre- and post-intervention effects and concluded that the majority of problem behaviours can be treated with variable degrees of efficacy. Aggressive behaviour (aggression, destruction, public disrobing) was less amenable to treatment when compared to self injury or socially disruptive behaviours such as tongue protrusion, non-compliance, hyperactivity or food theft. The authors concluded that externally destructive behaviours "are associated with the lowest levels of treatment efficacy".</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Didden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Didden 2006</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis of single-case studies of individuals with mild intellectual disabilities to borderline intelligence. The authors concluded that behavioural interventions based on functional behavioural analysis pre-treatment can improve several types of problem behaviours, including destructive behaviour, physical and verbal aggression, self injury, and stereotypies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Heyvaert-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyvaert 2012</LINK> conducted a multilevel meta-analysis examining 285 single-case and small-n studies for the effectiveness of contextual, behavioural, and pharmacological interventions for problem behaviours in people with intellectual disabilities. Contrary to previous meta-analyses, the authors did not find pre-treatment functional assessment to be a significant moderator. Only aggression and the manipulation of antecedent factors were found to have significant moderating effects. Outwardly-directed aggression appeared to be associated with significantly lower effectiveness of interventions for problem behaviours, while the presence of a component manipulating antecedent factors, such as environmental or social factors, was associated with a better outcome than when no such component was present.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of CBT in the management of anger (<LINK REF="REF-Nicoll-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicoll 2013</LINK>) included 12 studies. Nine studies were deemed suitable for meta-analysis. The authors found that CBT treatment had large effect sizes, but suggested that this should be regarded with caution due to the inclusion of studies with small sample sizes. They included non-randomised studies and studies with no control groups.</P>
<P>All of these reviews suggest that CBT and behavioural approaches may be effective in the management of problem behaviours and aggression. However, these reviews have methodological shortcomings, including broad definitions of problem behaviours (as well as the inclusion of several different types of problem behaviours) and the inclusion of studies that were not randomised, or lacked a control group, or were based on single-case studies. We therefore consider that tere is a need for the present systematic review.</P>

<P>Children and adults with intellectual disabilities (mild-to-severe/profound) who exhibit aggressive behaviour. We considered studies of participants with pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism, if they stated that the participants also met criteria for intellectual disabilities by some standardised measure or were recorded as having been assessed in the past (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1993</LINK>). We also include studies where participants had other comorbid conditions in addition to intellectual disabilities and aggressive behaviour if it was possible to extract data on aggressive behaviour as distinct from other symptoms. We exclude studies where the participants had an adult-onset organic brain disorder such as dementia.</P>
<P>In this updated version of the review, we include syndromes associated with an aggressive behavioural phenotype such as Prader-Willi syndrome, Williams syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis, as studies of interventions targeting these behaviours may have been completed and published in the interim. We decided to include these syndromes in this update as people with aggressive behavioural phenotypes are often the most difficult to treat, and the evidence base for the management of aggressive behaviour in these people is limited. Including these participants in the review would therefore increase the generalisability of the results, and help clinicians to make better decisions about the treatment of people with aggressive behaviour and intellectual disabilities, including those with behavioural phenotypes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study Design</HEADING>
<P>All six included studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). One study was a cluster-randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>). Five studies employed a wait-list or treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group. Only one study used an 'active' control group (<LINK REF="STD-McPhail-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McPhail 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>One study compared modified relaxation training to a control group receiving 'story reading' (<LINK REF="STD-McPhail-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McPhail 1989</LINK>). Four studies compared cognitive-behavioural treatment to a wait-list control group (<LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>), and one study compared a mindfulness-based approach ('Meditation on the Soles of the Feet') to a wait-list control group (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>). Four studies delivered a manualised intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Delivery of intervention</HEADING>
<P>In two studies, the therapy was delivered by carers or support staff ('lay therapists') (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>) who received training prior to the intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>, fortnightly supervision was provided by psychologists to the 'lay therapists' delivering group-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). In all of the other studies the therapy was delivered by trained therapists/psychologists or the researchers.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes and Measures</HEADING>
<P>Please see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK> for the list of scales and their associated abbreviations used in this review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Reduction in aggressive behaviour (frequency/severity of incidents)</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported the number of incidents of aggressive behaviour. <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK> recorded the number of incidents of physical and verbal aggression on a scale developed for the study, which was rated by parents and support staff. <LINK REF="STD-McPhail-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McPhail 1989</LINK> recorded the level of disruptive behaviour (aggressive, verbal, 'movement', and 'other') observed by staff three times a week over a duration of 45 minutes. The scale was also developed for the study.</P>
<P>The severity/intensity of aggressive (challenging) behaviour was measured by <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> using the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC), Hyperactivity and Irritability subscales; Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS); and the Controllability Beliefs Scales (CBS).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">2. Improved ability to control anger</HEADING>
<P>The most frequently used measure was the Provocation Inventory (PI; <LINK REF="REF-Novaco-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novaco 2003</LINK>), used by <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> to record self-reported levels of aggression in anger-inducing situations. <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> also used the PI to record carer-reported levels of aggression in anger-inducing situations.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK> measured anger disposition and capacity to regulate anger using the Novaco Anger Scale (NAS) and the Anger Expression (AX) subscale from the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI; <LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK> also employed the Ward Anger Rating Scale (WARS; <LINK REF="REF-Novaco-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novaco 1994</LINK>), which was completed by a member of staff, to investigate anger attributes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK> used the Role-Play Test of Anger Arousing Situations (RPT). Other measures used were the Anger Inventory (AI) (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2002</LINK>) and the Profile of Anger Coping skills (PACS) (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">3. Improvement in adaptive functioning</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK> used the Adaptive Behaviour Scale-Revised-Part II (ABS-R-II) as a measure of adaptive functioning and used the Problem-Solving Task (PST) to measure problem-solving ability in hypothetical situations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Improvement of mental state</HEADING>
<P>Two studies included psychological symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK> used the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) to measure psychological distress. <LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> measured depression using the Glasgow Depression Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability (GDS-ID); anxiety was measured using the Glasgow Anxiety Scale for people with an Intellectual Disability (GAS-ID); and self esteem was measured using the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (SES).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">5. Improvement in quality of life</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> was the only study to assess quality of life, which was measured using the Comprehensive Quality of Life Scale: Intellectual Disability (COMQoL-ID).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">6. Frequency of service utilisation (and costs)</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK> was the only study to measure costs of service utilisation. This was measured using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI).</P>
<P>
<B>7. Other outcomes</B>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-21 22:21:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Afia Ali">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-18 14:55:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review contains two new studies, and six studies overall, of adults with intellectual disabilities, examining a range of Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches (individual- and group-based anger management, relaxation, mindfulness-based meditation, problem solving and assertiveness training). No studies of behavioural interventions were included. Overall, the participants were recruited from community-based facilities in all but one of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK>), and are similar to those with problem behaviours likely to be seen by other community-based services in the United Kingdom (UK). <LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK> included detained male service users with serious aggression. The majority of the participants had mild intellectual disabilities or borderline intelligence quotients (IQs).</P>
<P>Follow-up data for both treatment and control groups were available for two studies, of which only one had long-term data of 10 months. One of the new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>) is large, with moderate-quality evidence (based on the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment) that the anger management intervention improves anger coping skills as reported by participants post-treatment, and anger coping skills as reported by key workers post-treatment and at follow-up (10 months). There were also improvements in anger ratings by carers (key workers) post-treatment and at follow-up, and some improvements in the measures of overall problem behaviours post-treatment but not at follow-up. The other new study included in the review found that the number of incidents of physical and verbal aggression decreased post-treatment in those receiving the intervention (i.e. mindfulness); however, we judged this evidence to be of low quality (<LINK REF="STD-Singh-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2013</LINK>). Of the remaining four studies, one found almost no benefit from the intervention, but the intervention was carried out in a forensic sample (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 2005</LINK>). The other three studies showed improvements in anger ratings post-treatment in the intervention group (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2002</LINK>), improvements in psychiatric symptoms and subjective distress (<LINK REF="STD-Nezu-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nezu 1991</LINK>), and improvements in disruptive behaviour, including aggressive disruptive behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-McPhail-1989" TYPE="STUDY">McPhail 1989</LINK>). We judged the evidence reported by these studies to be of moderate-to-low quality, and that CBT-based interventions improve anger ratings, reduce the number of aggressive incidents, and improve psychiatric symptoms.</P>
<P>Only one study investigated the effects of the intervention on quality of life and the cost of health and social care utilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>). This study found that the intervention did not improve quality of life or reduce the cost of health service utilisation compared to 'no treatment'. There was heterogeneity in the types of interventions adopted by the different studies (i.e. anger management based on modified relaxation or meditation (mindfulness); social skills training based on behavioural techniques; problem solving and assertiveness training; and anger management using cognitive-behavioural principles); the patient populations studied (e.g. community versus forensic population; presence of comorbid mental health problems), and the outcome measures used. Because of these differences, we did not perform a meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Based on the available data, there is limited evidence that CBT-based interventions are effective in the long-term management of people with outwardly aggressive behaviour, because of the lack of long-term follow-up data comparing the intervention and control groups. There is therefore a need for further high-quality studies reporting such data comparing the outcomes of interest, including cost effectiveness.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-03-21 22:18:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Afia Ali">
<P>We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the body of evidence. Based on this assessment, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for outcomes addressing anger management in community settings from high to moderate quality because the results come from only one study and because the confidence intervals were wide (i.e. imprecision). We judged the quality of the evidence for outcomes addressing anger management in forensic settings and modified relaxation training as very low quality (downgraded by three levels), again because the results came from only one study and the confidence intervals were wide (i.e. imprecision), but also because the samples were small, we rated them as being at risk of bias, and the authors did not conduct an intention-to-treat analysis. Finally, we judged the evidence for outcomes assessing assertiveness, problem solving and meditation based on mindfulness as low-quality evidence (downgraded by two levels), again because of risk of bias, imprecision (wide confidence intervals), small samples or being the only published study.</P>
<P>As regards risk of bias, one study did not randomly allocate participants, and in two studies the process of randomisation was unclear. In one study there was no allocation concealment and in three studies this was unclear. Blinding of participants was not possible, given the type of interventions examined, and blinding of assessors did not occur in three studies. One study was at high risk of attrition bias, and in another study this was unclear. There was selective reporting in one study, and other biases were present in one study and unclear in four studies.</P>
<P>Another methodological limitation was the lack of stringent definition criteria for outwardly-directed aggression. Also, only two studies reported follow-up data for both the treatment and control groups, with only one study reporting a follow-up period of up to 10 months (<LINK REF="STD-Willner-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Willner 2013</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-03-21 22:21:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Afia Ali">
<P>For this updated version of the review, due to the introduction of new search terms, we re-ran searches of key databases. The electronic search was thorough but limited by the search terms that we used. The review process could be further enhanced through more extensive handsearching of journals and contact with experts in the field.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-03-18 15:02:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings from this review are broadly similar to the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hassiotis-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassiotis 2008</LINK>). However, the two new studies have provided further evidence in support of the use of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural approaches in improving some of the participant outcomes. However, evidence from one large study suggests that CBT (anger management) does not lead to significant improvements in quality of life or to reduction of costs.</P>
<P>The results are consistent with other systematic reviews and meta-analysis of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions in the management of aggressive behaviour. <LINK REF="REF-Nicoll-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicoll 2013</LINK> found large effect sizes for the treatment of anger using CBT, but they included studies that were not randomised and studies that did not include a control group. <LINK REF="REF-Didden-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Didden 2006</LINK> found that behavioural interventions were effective in reducing different types of challenging behaviour. However, the included studies were single-case studies. <LINK REF="REF-Heyvaert-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyvaert 2010</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Heyvaert-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyvaert 2012</LINK> found a positive effect of treatment of any type for problem behaviours. However, the treatments included pharmacological as well as psychological therapies in managing a range of challenging behaviours, and small case studies. Finally, another systematic review of psychological therapies indicates that individual CBT may be effective for treating depression in people with intellectual disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Vereenooghe-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vereenooghe 2013</LINK>), whilst interventions aiming at improving interpersonal relationships are least effective.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-03-22 23:13:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Afia Ali">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-03-22 23:13:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Afia Ali">
<P>At present, there is some evidence that cognitive-behavioural treatments are effective in the short-term management of outwardly-directed aggression. Five of the included studies reported significant improvement immediately after treatment was completed, but the effect was imprecise. Unfortunately, we were not able to include behavioural interventions, such as Applied Behavioural Analysis or Positive Behavioural Support, as published studies did not report specific data on aggression. Despite the methodological limitations, there is some indication that mindfulness may be of some help in reducing aggression. Cognitive-behavioural interventions are relatively resource-intensive but it can be argued that they are preferable to the use of psychotropic drugs, which have significant side-effects. Given that behavioural treatments are often used as first-line or adjunctive treatment in clinical practice for problem behaviours, including outwardly-directed aggression, it is important that their efficacy is further investigated. In addition, no information yet exists on the best way in which they should be implemented, for example, alone or in combination with other approaches. Finally, access to psychological therapies for people with intellectual disabilities is an important issue, and therefore lay therapists delivering such interventions could make psychological therapies more accessible to this population group.</P>
<P>The treatment of problem behaviours is an expensive long-standing problem for community intellectual disability services and many people are placed far from home or in hospitals. In England, there has been a further drive to develop effective community services for people with intellectual disabilities and aggression (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2012</LINK>). If such services are to be successful in helping patients effectively, it is paramount that evidence-based treatments are available.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-03-18 09:17:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Willner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willner 2005</LINK>, in a critical overview of psychotherapeutic interventions for people with intellectual disabilities, pointed out the dearth of significant clinical trials to underpin anecdotal information about the efficacy of those interventions in practice. Clearer evidence should be provided by larger randomised controlled trials of well-defined interventions over a longer time frame. The trial protocols should indicate clearly how intellectual disabilities and aggressive behaviour are defined and measured, and they should have strategies for dealing with dropouts. Recruitment of people with intellectual disabilities into trials presents a challenge and strategies to ensure participant flow into studies are essential. Randomised controlled trials comparing behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions to other interventions, such as psychotropic medication, or other psychological interventions (e.g. parent training), and studies in children or participants with more severe intellectual disabilities, behavioural phenotypes associated with aggression or autism, would add significantly to the evidence base and improve clinical decision making. Furthermore, new studies should introduce mixed-methods designs to identify any process issues that impede or facilitate the delivery of complex interventions in people with intellectual disabilities.</P>

<P>For binary outcomes, for example, 'problem behaviour present' or 'not present', we will calculate a standard estimation of the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<P>When different measures are used to assess the same outcome, we will combine the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD) and calculated 95% CIs. However, we will only include normally distributed data in the meta-analysis. To assess the distribution of the data, we will calculate the observed mean minus the lowest possible value (or the highest possible value minus the observed mean) divided by the standard deviation; a value less than two is evidence of skew. If the data are skewed, we will contact the authors to request individual participant data or data summaries so that we may transform the data using a log scale. If we are unable to to retrieve this information, we will present a narrative description of the results.</P>

<P>Dealing with missing data</P>
</TH>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>First, we will try to contact the authors to request any missing data (e.g. missing participants, summary data). Failing that, we will follow the recommendations in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>)</P>
<P/>
<P>We will manage missing data by performing an intention-to-treat analysis. When dichotomous data is missing, we will assume that participants who dropped out had a less favourable outcome (e.g. problem behaviour present) and impute the data accordingly. For continuous missing data, we will use 'the last observation carried forward (LOCF)'.</P>
<P/>
<P>We will assess the impact of these decisions on the robustness of the results by conducting sensitivity analyses. Thus, for dicohotomous data, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis by imputing data assuming that those missing experienced the more favourable outcome (e.g. problem behaviour not present) (<LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2005</LINK>). For continuous missing data, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis comparing outcomes based on observed data and the LOCF data.</P>
<P/>
<P>When possible, we will obtain any missing summary data (e.g. missing standard deviations) using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P/>
<P>We will describe the methods used to impute the data in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' tables. If we are unable to impute the data (e.g. we have insufficient information as regards the numbers missing from each group), we will analyse the available data only and explain in the main text the reasons why we were not able to impute the missing data. When we are unable to impute the results, we will present a narrative description of the results of these studies.</P>

<P>Assessment of heterogeneity</P>
</TH>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, to examine the extent to which confidence intervals overlap around the estimate for each included study on the forest plots. If confidence intervals have generally limited overlap, this could indicate the presence of statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P/>
<P>We will use the Chi² test to formally test for heterogeneity, with a low P value (i.e. less than 0.10) indicating possible heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will also use the I² to determine the proportion of variation in point estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error or chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We will consider I² values in the range of 50% to 90% to represent substantial statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P/>
<P>Due to the potential unreliability of the Chi² test, we will also present the magnitude of the heterogeneity and compare it with the distribution suggested by <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2012</LINK> to confirm whether there is substantial heterogeneity in the included studies in the meta-analysis.</P>
