<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Intervention superseded. As of May 2010, this Cochrane Review is no longer being updated. The editorial team believes that the question addressed by this Cochrane Review is no longer relevant to decision making, as the polysaccharide vaccine formulation has been replaced by the newer generation conjugate serogroup A vaccine that is highly protective in young children and in adults. The review continues to be of value for comparing the effectiveness of the conjugate vaccine against the results recorded  for the polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Searches conducted. In this 2004 update, the review was edited extensively to shorten it and simplify the key messages without changing the interpretation or the conclusions.<BR/>Based on available evidence of effectiveness from the controlled trials conducted over two decades ago, it would be unethical to conduct randomised controlled trials to determine age-specific levels of vaccine efficacy in the under five-year age groups. Case controlled studies in the setting of large epidemics that can yield an adequate sample size that allows for subgroup analysis could help address the questions of age-specific protection and duration of protection with the vaccine. However, such opportunities are unlikely to occur as efforts are enhanced to initiate vaccination programs at the earliest signs of an emerging outbreak (<LINK REF="REF-Kaninda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaninda 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>).<BR/>Current priorities for research justifiably focus on achieving high levels of vaccine uptake once a given threshold of disease incidence is reported. Furthermore, the advent of the conjugate meningococcal serogroup A vaccine with improved immunogenicity in the very young (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joseph-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joseph 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twumasi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twumasi 1995</LINK>) appears to render as unnecessary new research on the polysaccharide vaccine that does not also consider the conjugate vaccines.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-16 13:46:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meningococcal meningitis is a brain infection caused by bacteria living in the back of the throat. The bacteria can cause infection of the blood (septicaemia) and of the brain coverings (meningitis). Infection can progress very quickly to damage the brain and can be fatal. The polysaccharide vaccine is strongly protective in children over five years and in adults. Whilst the vaccine is also protective in children aged three months to five years, in low-income countries the level of protection in children of this age group is not very clear. </P>
<P>This review found there was not enough evidence from trials to answer some important questions about vaccination for meningococcal meningitis. Meningitis is the most common manifestation of invasive disease caused by <I>Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis)</I>. Other clinical manifestations include septicaemia, conjunctivitis, pericarditis and arthritis. Meningitis and septicaemia can be rapidly fatal if untreated. <I>N. meningitidis </I>is a normal commensal of the throat and may be found in about 10% of a healthy population. Reasons why the bacteria may become invasive to cause disease are unclear. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed that the polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine prevented meningitis caused by the serogroup A strain of meningococci, and the vaccine has since been used effectively to control epidemics. However, observational studies suggested variations in the level and duration of protection, particularly among younger children, thus resulting in different interpretations of the potential value of routine vaccinations. The review was conducted to provide a summary estimate of the efficacy of the vaccine, its effectiveness in children under five years old, and its duration of protection. Results from 8 out of 12 eligible RCTs were included, and showed the vaccine highly protective in the first year after vaccination: the summary estimate of efficacy was 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 87% to 99%). Although protection extended to the third year after vaccination, the results were not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in Finnish children aged three months to five years, but the effect of a booster dose in children under two years was not statistically significant. The vaccine was protective in one- to five-year old children in low-income countries but its effectiveness by one or two-year age strata in this age group could not be determined. Two of 15 eligible non-RCTs were included in the analysis, but were at high risk of bias.</P>

Protection extended to the second and third year after vaccination but the results did not attain statistical significance. The vaccine was protective in Finnish children aged three months to five years. The latter was the only trial to offer booster doses to young children but lacked statistical power.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-05-21 13:54:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Serogroups A, B and C of <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I> (<I>N. meningitidis</I>) account for most cases of meningococcal disease globally. While serogroup A has been the most important serogroup in Africa, serogroup C disease has also occurred, as has serogroup X disease and, most recently, epidemics caused by serogroup W-135 disease (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>). By contrast, serogroups B and C are responsible for the majority of cases in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>). Large epidemics of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis in Africa are associated with attack rates that may affect close to 1% of the population and with a case fatality of about 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peltola-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). The last major serogroup A epidemic occurred between 1996 and 1997 in Africa, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases and over 25,000 deaths in the sub-Saharan 'meningitis belt' region that extends from Ethiopia in the east to Senegal in the west (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2008</LINK>). The endemic incidence in this region is around 20 per 100,000 compared with between less than 1 per 100,000 and 5 per 100,000 in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>). Extrapolation of data from Niger produced a burden estimate of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis in the meningitis belt of 110,584 cases annually ranging from 44,409 during non-epidemic years to 669,835 in epidemic years (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). During non-epidemic years meningococcal meningitis is most common in young children, with 50% to 60% of cases occurring in those aged three months to five years old. However, cases are also seen in teenagers and young adults under 30 years of age. In Africa, the maximum incidence during epidemics is usually found among children aged five to 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-11 21:20:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vaccines containing four specific antigens related to the polysaccharide capsules of serogroups A, C, Y and W135 are available commercially, but polysaccharide vaccines are not effective against serogroup B strains for which there are different vaccine formulations (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollard-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 2000</LINK>). The polysaccharide vaccines are distributed in a freeze dried form for intramuscular (IM) injection either as bivalent AC vaccine or quadrivalent A, C, Y, W135 vaccine containing 50 ug of each antigen. The preparations include:</P>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-11 09:20:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The polysaccharide serogroup A meningococcal vaccine induces antibodies against the <I>N. meningitidis</I> serogroup A capsule, but does not affect carriage or the transmission of meningococci (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassan_x002d_King-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassan-King 1988</LINK>). As a T-cell independent immunogen, the polysaccharide vaccine does not induce immunological memory. Its effect matures with the age of the recipient, that is, the peak antibody response increases with the logarithm of age between seven months and 21 years (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1979</LINK>). In the Finnish immunogenicity study (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1977</LINK>), the antibody response in very young children also increased with age and reached levels recorded in unvaccinated adults, by the age of two to three years. Although the antibody response to a primary dose of vaccine was weak below six months of age, a booster dose resulted in levels exceeding mean levels in unvaccinated adults. The booster effect was noted up to 11 months of age but an additional effect of the booster between 12 and 17 months of age was unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1977</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-11 21:56:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted over three decades ago showed that the polysaccharide vaccine was highly effective in preventing serogroup A meningococcal meningitis, and the vaccine has since been used to control epidemics (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). Observational studies suggested variations in the level and duration of protection, particularly among younger children (<LINK REF="STD-Lennon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lennon 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reingold-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Reingold 1985</LINK>). These studies have resulted in different interpretations of the potential value of routine vaccination programmes in epidemic-prone countries and in the need for, and timing of, booster doses.</P>
<P>The controversy was revisited in a flurry of letters to the editor of the Lancet (<LINK REF="REF-Higham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higham 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaninda-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaninda 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wenger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenger 1997</LINK>) in response to a paper that asserted "&#8230; mass vaccination of the entire population and the routine vaccination of infants according to the recommended schedule will eliminate endemic disease and prevent epidemics" (<LINK REF="REF-Robbins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robbins 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The coupling of polysaccharide antigens to proteins transforms the polysaccharide into a so-called conjugate polysaccharide antigen, a more powerful T-cell dependent antigen capable of priming immunological memory, inducing immunogenicity in infants and young children and capable of reducing carriage prevalence. Conjugate vaccines include those for <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> (<I>H. influenzae</I>) type b (Hib) and <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>)<I>. </I>These vaccines confer longer-lasting immunity than polysaccharide vaccines, work in infants, and reduce transmission of the bacteria, thereby providing herd immunity and protecting those unimmunised (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). The polysaccharide vaccines do not reduce carriage except transiently in closed populations and &#8220;herd immunity&#8221; does not follow (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). All conjugate vaccines have been shown to consistently produce a strong herd immunity effect, i.e.<I> </I>reduction of disease incidence in unvaccinated individuals. This effect is explained because conjugate vaccines prevent colonisation of the organism (carriage) and as a result, transmission of the organism in the population is drastically reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Pollard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollard 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Monovalent serogroup C conjugate vaccines have become established in the immunisation programmes in many countries and the first quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine, containing the polysaccharides from four of the serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 meningococci conjugated to a protein carrier was licensed in the USA in 2005. However, there are no controlled clinical trial data providing information of the efficacy or effectiveness of the vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Pace-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pace 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phase II and II/III clinical studies have been conducted with a candidate meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac&#8482;) in one to 29-year olds in Africa (Mali, Senegal, The Gambia) and India (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). A single dose of the vaccine was well tolerated, safe and highly immunogenic when compared to the polysaccharide vaccine. In African toddlers (12 to 24 month olds), the vaccine elicited 20-fold higher serum bactericidal antibody titres than the A component of a licensed ACWY polysaccharide vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Use of the conjugate vaccine in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to accomplish three goals: elimination of epidemic meningitis due to serogroup A <I>N. meningitides,</I> reduction in the rate of endemic meningitis by up to 50 % (the fraction of endemic meningitis due to serogroup A <I>N. meningitidis</I>), and establishment of herd immunity with control of serogroup A <I>N. meningitidis</I> in infants and persons older than 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>). The level of clinical protection from the conjugate vaccines, once available, will have to be compared against the effect of the polysaccharide vaccine. This review was therefore conducted to synthesise knowledge on the protective effect of the polysaccharide vaccine in such a way that the results could be used as the basis for comparisons with conjugate vaccines, once those results are generated.</P>

<B>Non-RCTs: </B>Both review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the non-RCTs, and there were no disagreements. Criteria for assessing the methodological quality of non-RCTs have not been as well-developed as for RCTs although Orenstein described the potential biases that may distort estimates of vaccine efficacy in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Orenstein-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orenstein 1988</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-05-16 13:53:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vaccine efficacy is usually defined as (1 - RR) by 100%, where RR is the risk ratio. For the meta-analysis, the summary estimate of effect was expressed as the odds ratio (OR); the OR provides an estimate of the RR of developing disease in the vaccinated compared with the unvaccinated group when disease incidence is rare (less than 10%) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 1998</LINK>). As the incidence of disease in all studies was less than 0.3%, vaccine efficacy was calculated from the formula: (1 - OR) by 100%. Furthermore, because of the low incidence of disease, the summary OR and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the Exact method for pooling data (StatXact-4 Version 4.0, 1998, Cytel Software Corporation). When the number of events are small, the Exact method for calculating the summary OR and 95% CI is preferred over the Peto method (<LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1998</LINK>), which is the default method in RevMan software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). Martin et al also recommend that sparse data should be combined based on the exact probability theory without using any limiting approximations (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial assessed the effect of a booster dose of vaccine (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>) and this was in children aged three to 17 months. As no cases occurred in either the booster or no-booster group, the review authors calculated the power of the study to detect a difference in incidence between these two groups using the Exact method. The power calculation was based on the assumptions that alpha = 0.05, an odds ratio for disease in vaccinated of 0.01; incidence of disease among controls in this age group was the same as the incidence in controls aged three months to five years during the study period (the incidence in controls aged three to 17 months was not cited in the paper).</P>

These trials were conducted between 1973 and 1983 in different settings: two during endemic activity in Egypt (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>); three during epidemics in Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>); one during an epidemic in Sudan (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>); and two in Finland, one while an epidemic was receding among army recruits (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>) and one in children under six years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>). In three trials, the unit of allocation to intervention was an individual participant (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>), while in four trials allocation was by clusters: in the two Egyptian trials, the unit of allocation was school class, and in the two Nigerian trials, household (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>) and village (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">RCTs</HEADING>
<P>The methods of selection of participants and allocation of intervention differed across the eight randomised trials. Two trials were double-blinded and the vaccine and intervention control was allocated to school children in classes that were systematically randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two other trials were also double-blinded but participants volunteered for the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>). Volunteers may have a different risk profile for an infectious disease related to socio-demographic, cultural and behavioural characteristics compared with those who do not volunteer (<LINK REF="REF-Clemens-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clemens 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hornick-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hornick 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilhelmsen-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilhelmsen 1976</LINK>). They are likely to be from less educated and poorer sectors of the population and to experience higher morbidity; they may be more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases, and once exposed, may also be more likely to develop disease. In addition, the levels of seroconversion following vaccination may not be as high among volunteers. The results of trials with volunteers may, therefore, lack generalisability.</P>
<P>In the Finnish army trial, recruits were invited to volunteer to be vaccinated (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>) and recruits not accepting vaccination constituted the control group. Volunteers represent a subset of the population, which behaves in different ways according to rank, age and experience. The results of the study were, therefore, not generalisable to all army recruits or to the general population.</P>
<P>In the Nigerian school trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>), one in three students was randomly given the vaccine and those not receiving vaccine constituted the controls. Although allocation of participants to the vaccine was not blinded, this trial was considered unlikely to result in a selection bias because, in an epidemic setting, the intervention allocators could not have had a priori knowledge of the participants' likelihood of responding to the vaccine nor of the risk of developing disease. The latter includes both the likelihood of being exposed to infection as well as the likelihood of developing disease after being exposed to infection.</P>
<P>In the Nigerian household trial, household members, of alternate cases with meningococcal meningitis, were given either meningococcal vaccine or tetanus toxoid (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>); however, it was not stated whether the intervention allocators and participants were blinded to the vaccination status. In the Nigerian villages trial (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>), residents of villages that had two cases with meningococcal meningitis received either meningococcal vaccine or no intervention but the method of allocation was not stated. As in the Nigerian school trial (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>), the method of allocation in these two Nigerian trials was once again considered unlikely to result in a selection bias as the intervention allocators could not have had a priori knowledge of the participants' relative levels of susceptibility to infection or disease.</P>
<P>The two specific concerns about incomplete outcome data were related to the level of completeness of case finding and potential loss to follow up. The level of completeness of case finding was validated in the two Nigerian trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>). Although the level of completeness was not explicitly reported in the other trials, this was considered adequate in four trials that detailed case ascertainment through a comprehensive range of sources (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>). Case finding was also likely to be complete in the relatively closed sub-population of the Nigerian school (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>). Case finding was sub-optimal in Sudan (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>) as it was restricted only to local hospitals; however, because of the double-blinding to vaccination status, this was more likely to result in non-differential rather than differential bias.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported the number of participants who may have been lost to follow up, for example, due to out-migration from the study area. This potential deficiency was more likely to result in non-differential rather than differential bias in the four trials with double-blinding to vaccination status.</P>
<P>In the remaining four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>) it was possible that loss to follow up could have resulted in a differential bias that reduced or exaggerated vaccine effect. However, the vaccine effect may have been exaggerated only if vaccinated participants lost to follow up were more likely to have developed meningococcal meningitis than controls lost to follow up, or if vaccinated participants who developed disease were more likely to attend a health centre not participating in the trial. This was considered an unlikely possibility as participants were residents of relatively discrete communities with clearly defined methods of surveillance for meningococcal disease.</P>
<P>The quality of care provided to the vaccinees and controls was comparable in the four trials with double-blinding to vaccination status (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>). Similarly, considering the epidemic setting of the four other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>), it was unlikely that selective care would have been provided exclusively to the vaccinated group to reduce the risk of disease or enhance responsiveness to the vaccine.</P>
<P>In the Finnish army trial, vaccinated recruits slept in separate dormitories from controls. The behaviour of these volunteer vaccinees and their accommodation in separate facilities may not ensure equivalent exposures to infection in the vaccinated and control groups. It was therefore, possible that in addition to the direct immunising effect of the vaccine, volunteers were subjected to a lower risk of exposure to the pathogen than in the control group (indirect vaccine effect), thus exaggerating the potential effect of the vaccine. Furthermore, if the vaccine reduced levels of carriage of the pathogen, it would also provide indirect protection against disease. This would be true only if the vaccine was known to reduce naso-pharyngeal carriage of meningococci. This trial was unable to assess the effect of the vaccine on carriage of <I>N. meningitidis</I> because the carriage rate for the invasive strain was only 1.5% when new recruits arrived and 3.2% one month later. One trial implicated reduction of carriage after vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>) but this was not confirmed subsequently (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hassan_x002d_King-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassan-King 1988</LINK>). Studies with another polysaccharide vaccine, i.e. against <I>Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae</I>) type b suggested that only the conjugate and not the polysaccharide vaccine prevents carriage of these organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Robbins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robbins 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Kd (kilodaltons) of the vaccines used in five trials (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table) were cited in one publication (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1976</LINK>). The Kd value reflects the partition coefficient of the polysaccharide component upon Sepharose 4b gel filtration. It indicates the molecular weight of the capsular polysaccharide, which is related to the immunogenicity of the vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Gotschlich-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotschlich 1972</LINK>). The lower the Kd value, the more immunogenic the antigens. A Kd value of 0.6 was shown to lack immunogenicity (<LINK REF="STD-Sanborn-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Sanborn 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1976</LINK>); the trial reported by Sanborn was, therefore, excluded from the review.</P>
<P>The two specific concerns about detection bias were related to blinding of the outcome assessors to the vaccination status of cases, and to possible misclassification of outcome among participants with meningitis of uncertain aetiology.</P>
<P>It was not explicit whether outcome assessors were blinded to the vaccination status of possible cases before suspecting and/or confirming the diagnosis in any of the trials. If a participant had clinical features compatible with meningitis, it was possible that knowledge of the vaccination status influenced the final diagnosis. Detection bias affecting the trial results could, therefore, not be confidently excluded.</P>
<P>The trials in Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>) reported the number of cases confirmed to be caused by serogroup A meningococci, as well as the number with meningitis of undetermined aetiology. A sensitivity analysis was, therefore, conducted to assess the effect on the OR of alternative assumptions of the number of cases with meningitis of unknown aetiology that could have been caused by serogroup A meningococci.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">1. Potential confounders</HEADING>
<P>Only 55% of children aged 7 to 12 years, not at school, and 45% of children aged three months to six years were vaccinated. These children were not selected at random and were, therefore, unlikely to be representative of all children in the community; they may have differed from participants who were not vaccinated in terms of the likelihood of being exposed to the infection, the risk of developing meningitis given exposure to infection, and the likelihood of seroconverting after vaccination. While the results were adjusted for a range of potential confounders, entering these confounders into the statistical model does not necessarily ensure that adjustments have been made for important social, behavioural and life course exposures (<LINK REF="REF-Concato-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Concato 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Case ascertainment</HEADING>
<P>Only cases attending hospital were included in the study and this method could have resulted in a differential ascertainment of cases if, for example, unvaccinated participants were less likely to attend hospital or were more likely to develop severe disease with a rapidly fatal outcome. While an association between disease severity and vaccination is not known for serogroup A meningococcal disease, the serogroup B vaccine has been reported to reduce disease severity (<LINK REF="REF-Noronha-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noronha 1995</LINK>). It is, therefore, possible that unvaccinated participants could have been under-represented among cases in hospital, thus reducing estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, as case fatality tends to be higher among younger children with meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Lennon-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lennon 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peltola-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 1983</LINK>), fatalities before admission may have been disproportionately higher among unvaccinated younger children. This would result in a misclassification differential for vaccination status and age. As the number of cases increased sharply in 1984 (see below under '(6) The high number of cases in 1984'), younger children may once again have been disproportionately affected thus lowering estimates of vaccine effectiveness in 1984.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3. Confirmation of disease status</HEADING>
<P>While the case definition of meningitis based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing has high specificity, its sensitivity for detecting all cases attending hospital would depend on the frequency of and clinical indications for performing lumbar punctures. The indications for the latter were not described and, furthermore, it is unknown whether these may have changed over the course of the study. For example, it was possible that increasing awareness of the study among clinicians resulted in more frequent testing later in the study period thus contributing to the higher incidence in 1984. If clinicians were also becoming increasingly aware of the possibility of vaccination failures, they may have started testing relatively more patients with a history of vaccination who presented with a febrile illness. Such a practice could have biased estimates of vaccine effectiveness towards lower values in 1984.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4. Confirmation of vaccination status of participants</HEADING>
<P>The proportion of participants whose vaccination status was classified as 'unconfirmed' increased sharply in 1984; among controls this increased from 15% (5/34) and 9% (6/68) in 1982 and 1983 respectively to 31% (44/142) in 1984. The corresponding increase among cases was from 0% in 1982 and 1983 to 44% (11/25) in 1984. This increase in proportion of cases with unconfirmed vaccination status would be particularly important if many of these cases were in the very young age group. The increased uncertainty of vaccination status in 1984 reduced confidence in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness for that year.</P>
<P>The proportion of controls vaccinated was reasonably constant at 45%, 52% and 45% for each of the three study periods respectively. If vaccination failure was an important explanation for a rise in incidence in 1984 one could have expected a higher proportion of cases to be vaccinated in that year than in 1982 and 1983. In fact, the proportion of cases vaccinated increased from 8% (2/25) in 1982 to 25% (11/44) in 1983 but did not continue to rise in 1984 (23%) (25/107). It was, therefore, essential to explore if bias or confounding may have been an alternative explanation for the low estimates of vaccine effectiveness in 1984.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5. Vaccine cold chain</HEADING>
<P>As the vaccine was strongly protective for the first year after the vaccination campaigns in 1981 and in 1983, a breach in the vaccine cold chain would not explain the finding of the low vaccine effectiveness in 1983 or 1984.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6. The high number of cases in 1984</HEADING>
<P>The number of cases rose markedly from 25 cases over two months in 1982 and 44 cases over four months in 1983 to 107 cases over two months in 1984. As the rise in 1984 may have reflected either a true rise in incidence or better case ascertainment in 1984, these data require further elaboration.</P>
<P>A rising incidence of meningitis after vaccination is an unusual observation when compared with other published studies and has two important implications. It could have biased the estimates towards a lower level of vaccine effectiveness in 1984 if many unvaccinated cases may have died before admission to hospital, that is, if vaccination status was related to disease severity (as discussed under '(2) Case ascertainment' above).</P>
<P>The higher number of cases in 1984 may have been the result of unique local events such as the influx of migrants after the vaccination campaign in 1981 or an outbreak of infections that compromised immunity to meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Griffiss-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiss 1982</LINK>); examples include infections with malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Bradley-Moore-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradley Moore 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1978</LINK>), influenza (<LINK REF="REF-Cartwright-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cartwright 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1991</LINK>) and <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae)</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>An alternative explanation for the higher number of cases in 1984 could have been better case ascertainment. This could be related to a change in the case referral pattern from the community or improved case detection at the hospital. The possible effects of differential and non-differential ascertainment of cases have been discussed under 'Hospital-based case ascertainment'.</P>

<P>The major limitations in this study were the lack of adjustment of the vaccine effect for potential confounders and the relatively low statistical power of the study (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potential confounders: the vaccine strategy was deliberately targeted for subpopulations with a high incidence of disease. Although 89% of children under two years of age received the vaccine, the level of uptake in subpopulations with a high incidence of disease, for example among children of Polynesian or Maori descent, was not described. It was possible that the unvaccinated Polynesian children, for example, may have been at a greater risk of being exposed to the pathogen and of developing disease than the vaccinated Polynesian children. This risk differential for disease could have exaggerated estimates of vaccine effectiveness, which should, therefore, have been adjusted for potential confounders such as socio-economic status, household crowding, and attendance at child care.</P>
<P>Although the two non-RCTs addressed the specific objectives of this review, they were at high risk of bias; they, therefore, did not add more information to the review beyond that obtained from the randomised trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Vaccine effect in the first year after vaccination</HEADING>
<P>The duration of follow up of participants after vaccination varied across studies: in four trials, this was confined to one outbreak episode lasting between three to five months (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>); follow up in two other trials was for two outbreak periods lasting between eight and 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>); in the remaining two trials, follow up extended beyond one year after vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, the three strata reflect the results of the trials in which (1) participants volunteered to receive the vaccine (one trial); (2) participants volunteered into the trial and were then systematically randomised into intervention and control arms (two trials); and (3) participants were identified by the investigation team and were randomly allocated into the intervention and control arms (five trials).</P>
<P>The point estimate of the vaccine effect was consistent across seven of the eight trials with an OR of zero in five trials, 0.11 in two trials and 0.12 in one trial. Only one relatively small trial had a higher OR (0.4) with wide confidence intervals (95% CI 0 to 3.57) (<LINK REF="STD-Blakebrough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blakebrough 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Finnish trial in stratum 2 (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>), there were no cases among vaccinated participants and the incidence of meningococcal meningitis among non-participants was higher than among controls (41 per 100,000 compared with 12 per 100,000, P = 0.02). Similarly, there were no cases among vaccinated participants in Sudan but the overall incidence in the region was higher than among controls (540 per 100,000 compared with 93 per 100,000, P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>). From these two trials, the summary vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI 74% to 100%) hardly differed from the summary effect of the five trials in stratum 2: vaccine efficacy of 95% (95% CI 84% to 99%).</P>
<P>The summary vaccine efficacy of the eight trials combined was 95% (95% CI 87% to 99%).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the two trials reporting the number of cases with laboratory-confirmed as well non-confirmed serogroup A meningococcal meningitis. In the Finnish children's trial (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>), the cause of meningitis in one vaccinated participant was unknown and three others were suspected but not confirmed to be caused by other pathogens; if this one case was assumed to be caused by serogroup A meningococci, the OR would change from 0 (95% CI 0 to 0.84) to 0.17 (95 % CI 0 to 1.37). In the Finnish army trial, 92% of cases with meningococcal meningitis were caused by serogroup A meningococci. If this proportion was applied to the 21 cases in the trial with purulent meningitis of undetermined aetiology, 19 would have been caused by serogroup A meningococci. Assuming the worst scenario where both cases in the vaccinated group and 17 cases in the control group were caused by serogroup A meningococci, the OR would change minimally from 0.12 (95% CI 0 to 0.79) to 0.15 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.63).</P>

In the trial in Sudan, none of the vaccinated participants aged one year and above developed meningitis but the ages of the 10 cases in the control group were not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>). In the control group, 2346 children were aged one to five years and 2285 were vaccinated. The sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) showed that if fewer than six cases were under the age of six years the trial would have lacked the power to identify a statistically significant vaccine effect in this age group. As children under six years usually constitute less that half the cases during epidemics of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis (<LINK REF="REF-Peltola-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peltola 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>), it was more likely that five or fewer cases among the control group were under six years of age; this trial probably lacked the power to yield a statistically significant result.</P>
<P>In the remaining two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>) neither numerator nor denominator data of children were reported and, therefore, the vaccine effect in children under six years could not be determined.</P>

<P>Although there were no cases in the vaccinated group in the Finnish trial the ages of the cases in the control group were not reported. The sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) showed that if fewer than six cases were under 18 months old, the trial lacked the power to identify a statistically significant vaccine effect in this age group. Only six cases occurred in the control group (aged three months to five years), and it was unlikely that all six cases were below 18 months of age as the authors would probably have reported such an unusual finding. Children aged three to 17 months were also given a booster dose three months after the first dose but none of the children in the booster (N = 7889) or the no-booster subgroup (N = 2873) developed disease. The study lacked the power to detect a statistically significant effect of the booster dose; the power was only 2% if the incidence among controls in this age group was assumed to be the same as the incidence in controls, that is, 6 per 48,977 (the incidence in children aged three to 17 months was not reported in the paper).</P>
<P>In the historical cohort study, attack rates among children aged three to 23 months, and the relative risk of disease for the three comparison subgroups are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. The time frame for determining the incident cases was concurrent, that is, incident cases were included in the analysis only after the second dose had been given, by 18 September 1987. During this period, three cases occurred among children given one dose of the vaccine and none occurred among the unvaccinated children. The only case among unvaccinated children in this study was on August 26 1987.</P>

<P>Pooled data from these trials showed the vaccine was protective in the second year after vaccination (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.88, P = 0.23) but this result was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the validity of pooling these results may be questioned as the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>) used the vaccine with a higher Kd value, that is, less immunogenic than the vaccine used in the first trial (Kd of 0.39 compared with 0.27) (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1976</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Duration of protection</HEADING>
<P>While two trials suggested a protective effect in the second and third year after vaccination, the results were not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wahdan-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Wahdan 1977</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Age-specific vaccine effect in children</HEADING>
<P>In the Finnish study, the vaccine was protective in children aged three months to five years (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>). The study, however, lacked the statistical power to detect a significant effect in children aged three to 17 months.</P>
<P>The vaccine was protective in Sudanese children (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>) but the trial probably also lacked the power to detect a statistically significant effect in children aged one to five years.</P>
<P>The rationale for a subgroup analysis in children under five years of age was based on evidence from two observations that suggested a differential effect with increasing age. Firstly, levels of naturally occurring antibodies against meningococci rise progressively during the first 12 years of life and this is associated with a corresponding reduction in the incidence of meningococcal disease with increasing age (<LINK REF="REF-Goldschneider-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldschneider 1969</LINK>). Secondly, antibody response to the polysaccharide vaccine increased with age in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Makela-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Makela 1977</LINK>) and, in another, increased linearly with the logarithm of age between seven months and 21 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Gold-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gold 1979</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Effect of the booster dose of vaccine in young children</HEADING>
<P>The effect of a booster dose in children was assessed in only one trial; it was given three months after the first dose of vaccine administered to children aged three to 17 months. No cases occurred in either the booster or the no-booster group and the trial lacked the power to identify a statistically significant effect of the booster dose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Immunogenicity trials</HEADING>
<P>Data from immunogenicity studies were beyond the scope of this review but may provide surrogate evidence to answer the specific objectives of this review in terms of the protective effect in very young children and the effect of a booster dose. As an example, the Finnish children trial detected higher levels of antibodies to meningococci in children aged three to 17 months when they were given a booster dose three months after the primary vaccination (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>), suggesting that this may enhance clinical protection against meningitis. Other studies have shown a progressive decline in vaccine induced antibody levels over time, in children and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Mohammed-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohammed 1984b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zangwill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zangwill 1994</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-06-11 21:28:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the trials and the relative incompleteness of the information in the published reports when compared with the recommendations of the CONSORT statement for publishing RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>) arguably rendered the trials invalid for this review. However, the eight RCTs revealed consistent results and were conducted in vastly diverse settings, with endemic and epidemic disease, in high- and low-income countries. Furthermore, the two Nigerian trials (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1980</LINK>) were designed to control for the level of exposure to infection in the vaccinated and unvaccinated households and villages. The review authors, therefore, considered it unlikely that the results were biased consistently towards the strong protective effect of the vaccine.</P>
<P>The RCTs had an 'inclusive' study design in that while some restricted the participants by age group other exclusion criteria were not applied. Vaccine effect did not differ markedly across studies, including those with volunteer vaccinees (<LINK REF="STD-Makela-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Makela 1975</LINK>) and with volunteer participants (<LINK REF="STD-Erwa-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Erwa 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>). The trials, therefore, had broad applicability across diverse populations. However, the trials lacked specificity as they were not designed to address the specific objectives specified for this review, that is, whether there was a differential effect across the age strata in children under five years of age; whether a booster dose after primary vaccination in children under two years enhanced protection; or the duration of protection in children and adults.</P>
<P>The methodology of the case control study in Burkina Faso (<LINK REF="STD-Reingold-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Reingold 1985</LINK>) was at high risk of bias and was, therefore, not included in the final analysis. The major concern of the historical cohort study in New Zealand (<LINK REF="STD-Lennon-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lennon 1992</LINK>) was that the results were not adjusted for potential confounders and an additional limitation was the lack of statistical power to identify a protective effect after one or two doses of vaccine in children aged under two years.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether the effects in Finnish children under six years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Peltola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Peltola 1977</LINK>) may be generalised to children in low-income countries as the latter group may be more susceptible to infectious diseases, exposed to higher doses of the infection during epidemics, and may also differ in their immune responsiveness to the vaccine (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1978</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-11 12:26:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>The polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine is strongly protective against serogroup A meningococcal meningitis in children over five years of age and adults for the first year after vaccination. While it is also protective in the second and third years after vaccination, the level of vaccine efficacy could not be determined. Consequently, the time interval after which revaccination should be considered to control prolonged outbreaks or prevent disease in epidemic-prone areas cannot be determined from this review of epidemiological studies.</P>
<P>The vaccine was strongly protective in children aged three months to five years in Finland. Because of the relatively small number of children in the trial the vaccine efficacy could not be determined across age strata within this age group; nor the effect of a single compared with two doses of vaccine in children aged three to 17 months.</P>
<P>The vaccine was protective in one- to five-year old children in low-income countries (Nigeria and Sudan) but the age-specific efficacy in strata between one and five years of age could not be determined.</P>
<P>The vaccine was effective at a dose of 25 to 30 ug among Finnish children under six years but the effect of this lower dose was not reported from the trials in low-income countries.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence from these field trials to determine:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the level of efficacy and duration of protection across age strata in children under five years of age;</LI>
<LI>the value of booster doses in children under two years of age; and</LI>
<LI>the duration of protection beyond one year after vaccinating children over five years of age and adults.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-11 21:29:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the efficacy of the vaccine in children and the seriousness of the disease it would be unethical to conduct RCTs to determine the age-specific vaccine efficacy and duration of protection in children under five year of age. The levels of serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) induced by the vaccine may correlate with the level of clinical protection in children under five years of age because in vitro measurements of SBA killing can be considered a surrogate for in vivo<I> </I>killing (<LINK REF="REF-Frasch-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frasch 2009</LINK>). It is therefore possible that the level of SBA induced by the vaccine may inform decisions on the need for booster doses in children under two years of age and the need to revaccinate children and adults during prolonged epidemics or to prevent epidemics.</P>
<P>Case control studies during large epidemics in which children could have been vaccinated may help address the uncertainty of age-specific protection from the vaccine. However, such opportunities are unlikely as efforts have been strengthened to initiate vaccination programmes with very high levels of coverage at the earliest signs of an emerging outbreak (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1999</LINK>). Current priorities for research focus, justifiably, on achieving high levels of vaccine uptake once a given incidence threshold is reported (<LINK REF="REF-Kaninda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaninda 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1992</LINK>) and for assessing candidate conjugate meningococcal serogroup A vaccine with improved immunogenicity in young children (<LINK REF="REF-Marc-LaForce-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marc LaForce 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2008</LINK>). These priorities render unnecessary new research on the polysaccharide vaccine that does not also consider concurrently the effect of conjugate vaccines.</P>

<P>Intervention superseded. As of May 2010, this Cochrane Review is no longer being updated. The editorial team believes that the question addressed by this Cochrane Review is no longer relevant to decision making, as the polysaccharide vaccine formulation has been replaced by the newer generation conjugate serogroup A vaccine that is highly protective in young children and in adults. The review continues to be of value for comparing the effectiveness of the conjugate vaccine against the results recorded  for the polysaccharide serogroup A vaccine.</P>

They contrasted with the number cited in the first paragraph under 'Meningococcal disease' and in the 'Summary' as a total of 8 cases with serogroup A meningococci among controls. The remaining 21 cases had purulent meningitis attributed to antibiotic treatment before cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected, and only 2 of these cases with purulent meningitis had been vaccinated</P>
