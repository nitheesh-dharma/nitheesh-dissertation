These suggestions were very useful and one of them required a clarification to our definition of AHRF which resulted in eliminating several studies from the review. There have been many changes to the data as a result. We have all reviewed the final version and now submit as the amended final version. I left the changes visible (tracked) but am happy to cleam this up if it is not convenient for you to read in this view. I just wanted you to be able to see the changes. Please don't hesitate to contact if any queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RN comments and MECIR check 29/3/17 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this update - you've done a great job. Also makes a nice change to read a review which is able to form some convincing conclusions! My comments below are from a contact editor perspective and I also performed a routine MECIR compliance check at the same time. I suspect many of the things I spotted are a result of this being a complex update. Almost all the comments below relate to very minor tweaks/additions, so please don't be alarmed by the length and don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions/concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the following sentence would be better in the data collection and analysis section: &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The primary outcomes were mortality during the hospital admission and the need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in symptoms and changes in arterial blood gases.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;Putting it in selection criteria may suggest that studies were selected on the basis of the outcomes reported. Ah - I now see from the methods that relevant outcome reporting was an inclusion criteria! Presumably this is a hang-over from the previous version of the review, as this is not standard practice for Airways, unless there's a very good justification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not incorrect, I wonder if the reporting of PaCO2 needs to be slightly altered to reflect the uncertainty? (i.e. it currently appears in a string of results in which CIs exclude no difference)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first line of the conclusion seems a little at odds with the statement previously that most studies were at risk of performance bias, and there were uncertainties about detection bias. Perhaps adding a comment that these studies would be almost impossible/impossible to effectively blind and that primary outcomes were less likely to be at risk (which would imply that they are as good quality as realistically possible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NIV should be considered early in the course of respiratory failure and before severe acidosis ensues, as a means of reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation&amp;quot; - to me, this sentence doesn't seem to fully follow the results presented - is this related to the more rapid correction of acidosis? This may need to be spelt out a little more clearly, otherwise it seems to suggest (to me at least!) you have compared early vs delayed NIV subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLS: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;numerous adverse effects&amp;quot; - perhaps a little non-plain language? Lots of unwanted side effects, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objectives stated in the abstract methods and the main text methods don't quite match - I would suggest copying the abstract methods into the main text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of study: worth mentioning whether cross over and cluster RCTs were considered or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes: see comment above under 'abstract'. Could you provide some justification for this decision (even if it's just to say this was a decision made in the previous update of the review and thus you decided for consistency not to change this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A really small point, but on one occasion the word 'rate' is used to describe an outcome ('intubation rate' - highlighted) when strictly speaking it's a risk rather than a rate (just being pedantic, but that's what us systematic reviewers are known for!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need for endotracheal intubation, pH sub-grouping - consider adding test for subgroup difference in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Length of ITU stay is described as significantly favouring the NIV group, but CIs include no difference (MD -2.96, 95% CI -7.00 to 1.08).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptom scores: apologies if this has already been discussed with Chris, but I note Bott 1993 is included in this analysis and the text suggests median symptom scores were reported. Worth a brief mention of how the data were transformed to be included in the analysis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment intolerance: I found this sentence rather confusing: &amp;quot;Eight studies involving 346 patients (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Barbe 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Barbe 1996&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Dikensoy 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Dikensoy 2002&lt;/a&gt;; Keenan 2005a; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Khilnani 2010&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Khilnani 2010&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Liu 2005&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Liu 2005&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Matuska 2006&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Matuska 2006&lt;/a&gt;; Pastaka 2007a) demonstrated a significantly larger (five-fold) 11% incidence of treatment intolerance in the NIV group compared to the usual care group (RD 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.16; participants = 346; studies = 8; I2 = 0%) (RR 5.53, 95% CI 1.95 to 15.68; participants = 346; studies = 8; I2 = 0%), &lt;a link_type=&quot;ANALYSIS&quot; href=&quot;001.06&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Analysis 1.6&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;quot; Is the 11% misplaced? That could be all it is that's confusing me (I also note this is a sentence Chris may have altered..!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; one hour post-intervention - mmHg: &amp;quot;The overall result significantly favoured use of NIV however significant statistical heterogeneity was detected (MD -4.04, 95% CI -9.74 to 1.66)&amp;quot; - CIs include no difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discussion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this discussion is very informative and contains all the right information but perhaps not in quite the right places - I'm sure this relates to the previous version not being broken into sub-sections. However, I don't think this is a essential to change and would probably require quite a bit of work. More specific comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;most acceptable NNT&amp;quot; reads a little oddly to me - perhaps &amp;quot;maximum acceptable&amp;quot; makes more sense? (i.e. the smaller the better, really!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;..with the exception of hospital length of stay which demonstrated a significantly greater benefit in those with more severe acidosis (pH &amp;lt; 7.30) than those with milder acidosis (pH 7.35 to 7.30)&amp;quot; - apologies if I've missed something, but where was this result reported? My understanding was you only applied your subgroups to your primary outcomes? Perhaps this has snuck in from the previous update..?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The improvements in pH, PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;respiratory rate..&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; Respiratory rate was not an outcome in this update - consider removing this from discussion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall completeness section: this section is rather brief and usually contains a bit more detail about to what extent the PICO question has been addressed by the synthesis of included studies. I appreciate that much of this information if included in the section above and in the biases in the review process section, but would authors consider adding a few sentences about the applicability/completeness of the study populations, interventions, comparisons, outcomes and settings? (e.g. were there important groups of participants not represented, were studies appropriately designed, were outcomes measured in a meaningful way?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality of the evidence: you have applied GRADE to length of hospital stay but this isn't mentioned here (see comment below on SOF also).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOF:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if length of hospital stay should be downgraded further to low rather than moderate, as you've identified two possible problems (unclear ROB and inconsistency). Hovever, in your methods you state that you will only apply GRADE to primary outcomes, which length of stay is not. Consider removing? Or updating methods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC second stats check March 22nd: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I am happy with the changes below. I have altered the results in the text (abstract and main results to reflect the 11% risk of intolerance of NIV). Please check if you are happy with the changes,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CO comments (on behalf of the author team) 20/03/17:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Emma and Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your suggestions. Please see comments below indicating responses to all points raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don't hesitate to clarify if any further queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian (on behalf of the full authorship team).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC stats check 1st March&lt;/b&gt;. This review looks good to me! Thanks for all the work Christian, just a couple of issues below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would advise changing the intolerance meta-analysis to Risk Difference (as by definition this is zero in the control arms)! It is much easier to understand as risk difference and does not involve a zero cell correction. DONE, with thanks. Need to edit wording in results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also please can you check the SD for pH in &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Dikensoy 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Dikensoy 2002&lt;/a&gt; (order of magnitude higher than the other studies). CHECKED. Is unusual but accurate data according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would suggest removing the Length of hospital stay from Comparison 2: pH subgroups (as the median duration on control is twice as long for low pH as high pH so the mean differences are not comparable)? For consistency maybe removed from ITU and ward comparison too? DONE, with thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally I would remove figures 5 and 9 (as sufficient info is shown in Figure 4 and 8). Also there are too many figures at present. DONE, with thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma Dennett comments 27/02/2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plagiarism check. There was a large match with the old version of this review. This is so-called 'self-plagiarism'. We don't think it is necessarily a good use of time to redraft huge sections of a review to eradicate self-plagiarism (though in some cases it would be, not here). However, the substantial reuse of content from the old version of the review should be acknowledged clearly and the authors of the previous version thanked in the acknowledgments section. DONE, with thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;i removed the abbreviation UMC as we don't use it in other reviews, to be consistent. I don't think it will have a huge impact on the review as there weren't too many uses of it. THANKS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;abstract (now amended, with thanks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add 1-2 sentences about baseline characteristics of the population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add sentence about RoB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;symptom scores is missing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plain language summary. now amended, with thanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I tried to imagine how I would explain this to my aunt who has COPD and made some changes. Always tricky to get the PLS right. See what you think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you've chosen different figures to illustrate fewer deaths here than in the abstract. Really it should be consistent throughout the review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;please define 'treatment intolerance'. DONE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;characteristics of included studies tables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you please add the study funder to the notes section for each included study (done, with thanks for the suggestion)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;please check and accept my edits (all edits accepted now)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the correct way to refer to it according to the style guide. I've edited THANKS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;method of analysis missing from Dikensoy 2002, Khilnani 2010 (amended now, with thanks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be consistent with h, hr, and hours (thanks, now checked and amended)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;excluded studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nava 2011:&amp;quot;No COPD specific data despite contacted author. Included kyphoscoliosis and restrictive lung diseases.&amp;quot; If there were participants with COPD then I think it should be included, but you say you couldn't get the separated data, so it wouldn't have an impact on the review. As per our wording in the eligibility critieria, we do not feel it is appropriate to include ('mixed' disease groups were not eligible).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I spent a long time editing the units etc in the characteristics of included studies, so I didn't check the risk of bias as thoroughly as normal. I usually count up the number of studies at high/low/unclear RoB in each domain and cross reference. I did however to this for other bias. You need to add a sentence about the domain 'other bias'. Also some of the studies say ' no other source of bias identified', but you have given them unclear risk of bias - while other are low risk. I think these should all be low risk. THANKS, amended now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Results&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;check the MD inserted into Length of ICU stay as what you wrote didn't match with the forest plot (amended now, with thanks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discussion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;'ideal NNT' - would 'acceptable NNT' better? Surely the &lt;i&gt;ideal&lt;/i&gt; NNTB for any treatment would be 1!? DONE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;can you not back calculate the [H+]? I was trying to remember from my undergrad days - and had some flashbacks when I saw this diagram http://blog.science-matters.org/2013/06/14/converting-h-to-ph-poh-and-oh/. But I'm not sure of there is anything different when converting the pH in blood from that in solutions - No, this would not be suitable - all authors agree this is not relevant to do. Have edited this sentence. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're not supposed to have anything written directly under the heading 'discussion' it should go straight into the main results. The content seems good to me - though there is a slight bit of duplication with some text you have under potential biases in the review process. Perhaps it would be OK to add another heading - e.g. interpretation - under the summary of main results and copy and paste that text? I'm sure the copy editor will complain about it otherwise... Good suggestion, thanks. I have amended as proposed. Please let me know if this seems suitable or if the copy editor disapproves. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Liz S 22/02/2017&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I have updated the search methods section to comply with the updated Cochrane style guide. THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-PRISMA diagram (DONE NOW, WITH THANKS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add the studies from the later searches: We have added the original search total (on the left) and combined together all later searches as one total (on the right) as there was no publication between 2004 and the current version, although there were five different searches conducted. Rather than separating each of these we thought this would be easier to interpret for the reader as one combined 'update' total. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second box down on the righthand branch (begins; 66 records screened). This needs to contain the total number of records after duplicates removed. Then the box that branches out to the right needs to have the total number of records excluded on the basis of title and abstract alone. The first four searches did not contain any duplicates, we assume they were automatically excluded before being sent to us by an electronic automated process. We did have two duplicates in the most recent search (Jan 2017 - total of 88 citations, down to 86 with duplicates removed), however, if we were to report this it would not be consistently applied and with only two duplicates it wouldn't make sense. Are you happy for us to leave this box as is or do you want us to still include the two duplicates (total search 656 with 654 after duplicates removed)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you have reported the number of studies in qualitative synthesis - please add also the number of studies in quantitative synthesis: Revised the sentence as 23 studies used in both qualitative and quantitative synthesis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emma J notes 21/2/17:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;1) Referencing queries:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliot and Plant (under Plant 2001) were referenced as 'National Research Register' - these are now obsolete so I've deleted them as per advice from Liz. THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nava 2001 and Nava 2001b are one and the same I think? Please remove the one with least info DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parc de Salut Mar 2013 - I've changed the ID to the NCT number as per Cochrane Style Guide. Not much detail to go on so please check I&amp;#8217;ve picked the correct trial here. THANKS, CHECKED and correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffery 1992 &amp;#8211; x2 versions - delete one please. DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;2 Acknowledgements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've added 3 translators that weren't listed here but were listed on my translation log. Let me know if you disagree! I don't know where these names came from, butam hpapy to include (?perhaps they came from the original review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 Declarations of interest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've listed each individual author - please check I've used correct initials. THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;4 Affiliations - Christian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see I've added these back for you, but you'll get/have received an email from me in any case as a double-check. THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try and do a spell-check before submitting! I don't know all these highfalutin words so have to google them to find out if spelt correctly (RevMan spell-check not that efficient!). DONE, WITH THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Emma,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything is ready for editorial review now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the data re: NNTs after having all studies now checked for calculation of effect estimates (and updated SoF table and Cates' plot figures). Curiously, can you explain how to fix the issue in the results tables (under the subheading 'data and analyses') where the total number of studies isn't equalling the total number of studies included within some of the sub-groups (e.g. 2.1 and 3.2)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I appear to have lost two of my affiliations again for some reason. Can you please restore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Christian - my notes in response to your notes below...* I cannot find any reference to the study of Chu 2009 anywhere (?old excluded study). Comes up as a validation error (empty reference). Shall we just delete? - weird it's not an excluded study in the old version. Delete it! I would do, but you might need to check numbers....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisia Wedzicha's contact details need to be updated to 'Imperial College London, UK' - done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's an issue with the excluded studies. Where are all the studies excluded from the original review?? - I can add, but waiting for confirmation you want this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to accept the changes in Figure 1. And would benefit from a review of the presentation of this material with respect to the number of records screened/included from each of the (now multiple) updates. Difficult to determine the precise number of records screened and reasons for exclusion from earlier versions for a 'complete' PRISMA. Presenting it all is proving to be a bit of a messy task (both in this figure and in the results of the search section). Any advice? - I've accepted the changes to the PRISMA. Suggest changing &lt;i&gt;a posteriori&lt;/i&gt; to excluded from the current review. Our very own Liz has proposed how to present study flow diagrams for updates :) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046496/ I actually think your diagram looks pretty good, so happy to leave it as is - you came to the same conclusion as Liz! once I've heard back from you about re-adding the excluded studies from the old version, I'll think about presenting this is the text - or will ask Liz if I'm not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If figures needing deleting, suggest figures 7-10 could go? Or combine the two Cates' plots into one figure (can this be done)? Also, can you do anything to make the Cates' plots appear smaller? You can keep them as they look pretty important and not a crazy number of figures (it's more for the ones where people have 30 outcomes and put a figure for each one - before you ask, yes this amazingly does happen.....)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CO notes: I think the ongoing study NCT01869387 could be deleted: our definition of AHRF includes acidosis...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*need to re-check references to analysis numbers as I have now re-numbered the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC look at primary outcome. I suggest that you are not really gaining by trying to put these three outcomes into one! I would remove this and add intolerance as a third outcome after mortality and intubation. I think this will give a clearer picture of these clinically important, but really quite separate outcome measures. The challenge with mortality and intubation is that we do not know which patients had both, and therefore I think you are very sensible to keep them separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have altered &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Barbe 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Barbe 1996&lt;/a&gt; SD to make it an SE for duration in hospital. Skew is a major issue for this outcome, but I think the Forest plot gives a fair picture!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have also changed a typo in the SD for &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Matuska 2006&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Matuska 2006&lt;/a&gt; for one hour PH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not touched comparison 2 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See what you think and see yellow post its in DAta analysis outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris August 18th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes relating to previous versions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2&lt;br&gt;=============================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated: 03092003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review substantially updated in August 2003 with six additional included studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix Ram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================&lt;br&gt;Reviewer Reply: FSFRam 28/8/2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comments Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only issue which requires attention is the calculation of NNT for overall intubation rate - which has been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby please send review to Paul for peer reviewing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;===========================&lt;br&gt;Technical Editing by CJC 23/8/2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors and contributions: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: excellent level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYNOPSIS: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT: PAUL AM I CORRECT IN THINKING THAT THE ABBREVIATIONS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE ABSTRACT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: fine, but was the subgrouping by duration of NIPPV (leading to the Avdeev separation POSTHOC)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: a few minor changes to typos in results made and NNT changed to whole numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your calculation of NNT is incorrect for Intubation and has been changed as below. &amp;quot;INTUBATION&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8226; Overall [Comparison 01:03]&lt;br&gt;All eight included studies with 546 patients contributed data towards this outcome. There was a significant reduction in the risk of intubation of greater than 50% in the NPPV group when compared to the UMC group (RR 0.42; 95%CI 0.31, 0.59) with an NNT of 5 (95%CI 4, 7). &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have altered the wording for the Random effects model here: I THINK THIS SHOULD BE NOTED AS A POST HOC SUBGROUP ANALYSIS?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;#8226; Study location subgroups [Comparison 03:04 &amp;amp; 05]&lt;br&gt;Three studies with 138 patients reporting this outcome (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Brochard 1995&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Brochard 1995&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Celikel 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Celikel 1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Kramer 1995&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Kramer 1995&lt;/a&gt;), which were conducted on ICU, and five studies with 408 patients (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Barbe 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Barbe 1996&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Bott 1993&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Bott 1993&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Dikensoy 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Dikensoy 2002&lt;/a&gt;, Plant 2000) were conducted on the ward. The three studies conducted in ICU showed a reduction in hospital length of stay in favour of NPPV (WMD -3.38 days; 95%CI -6.09, -0.67 days). The overall result for the five studies conducted in the wards showed significant heterogeneity (Comparison 03:04). The use of random effects model did materially alter the result (WMD -2.93 days; 95%CI -5.31, -0.54). Removal of the &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Barbe 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Barbe 1996&lt;/a&gt; study due to a lower Cochrane study quality grading (B) failed to resolve the heterogeneity. Removal of the &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt; study as having the longest mean duration of treatment with NPPV (29 hours) resolved the heterogeneity with the overall result remaining statistically significant (comparison 03:05) (WMD -2.75 days; 95%CI -4.12, -1.37 days).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I AM NOT CONVINCED BY THE FOLLOWING - pAUL WHAT DO YOU THINK: (RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL HAS BEEN REMOVED AS IT CANNOT RESOLVE HETEROGENEITY ONLY INCORPORATE IT!)&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;pH ONE-HOUR POST INTERVENTION [Comparison 01:07 &amp;amp; 08]&lt;br&gt;Six studies provided data on pH one hour after initiation of treatment (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Bott 1993&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Bott 1993&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Brochard 1995&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Brochard 1995&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Celikel 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Celikel 1998&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Dikensoy 2002&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Dikensoy 2002&lt;/a&gt;, Plant 2000). There was significant improvement in pH with NPPV compared to UMC however this result was heterogeneous. A step-by-step elimination of each study from the meta-analysis revealed that &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt; was contributing to the heterogeneity. Therefore, we have reported the result without the &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Avdeev 1998&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Avdeev 1998&lt;/a&gt; study with the overall result significantly in favour of NPPV (WMD 0.03; 95%CI 0.02, 0.04, 408 patients). &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added the significant difference between subgroups for this outcome. Residual between subgroup Chi score is 7.73 on one degree of freedom.

Three studies with 316 patients (&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Barbe 1996&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Barbe 1996&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Bott 1993&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Bott 1993&lt;/a&gt;, Plant 2000) contributed data in the pH subgroup 7.35 -7.30. A reduction in hospital length of stay in this subgroup was not statistically significant (WMD -0.89 days; 95% CI -2.92, 1.14 days), and there is a significant difference between the two subgroup results.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;INTUBATION&lt;br&gt;With NPPV the risk of endotracheal intubation is more than halved and by treating 5 patients with NPPV one we would avoid one patient being intubated. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;NNT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO MATCH THE RESULTS.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:42:13 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Why is this question important?</B>
</P>
<P>When people have a severe attack of COPD, their breathing becomes very difficult. This can turn into breathing failure (acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF)) that often requires urgent hospital-based medical care. One of the treatments that may be given is breathing support (intubation and mechanical ventilation). This involves delivery of air and/or oxygen via a ventilator connected to a tube inserted down the throat and into the lungs. This is undoubtedly a lifesaving procedure for patients with severe life-threatening exacerbations of COPD, but it is associated with several possible unwanted side effects.</P>
<P>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) involves delivery of breathing support via a ventilator connected to a nose mask or a face mask. NIV is used more frequently nowadays to help such patients in many hospitals. This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of adding NIV to usual care for this patient group.</P>
<P>
<B>How did we answer the question?</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed all available evidence up to January 2017 regarding effects of NIV combined with usual care compared with usual care alone (involving no ventilation). Because up to 20% of people with COPD who have respiratory failure can die from it, we looked at the number of deaths as the primary outcome. We also looked at need for intubation and time spent in hospital.</P>
<P>
<B>What did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We included information from 17 clinical trials involving a total of 1264 patients. Compared with usual care in this patient group, we found that NIV was more beneficial for reducing deaths and the number of patients who needed to be intubated. On average, risk of dying was reduced by 46% and risk of needing intubation was reduced by 65%. Reviewers rated the quality of evidence for both of these findings as 'moderate' (according to GRADE criteria). People who had NIV spent an average of three and a half days less in hospital than those who did not.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>This review provides convincing evidence to support the use of NIV as an effective treatment strategy for patients admitted to hospital for acute exacerbations of COPD and respiratory failure.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH &lt; 7.35 and mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation.

<P>Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a 'Summary of findings' table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-10 18:23:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively.</P>
<P>Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as 'moderate' quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications (unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N = 8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A trend towards improvement in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>. Treatment intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-group differences. </P>

<P>Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH &lt; 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-10 18:23:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those with more severe disease, are prone to exacerbations that frequently result in admission to hospital. Severe acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs) are commonly characterised by development of acute respiratory acidaemia due to prolonged hypercapnia (elevated levels of carbon dioxide). This clinical state is known as acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF). Between one fifth and one third of patients with COPD admitted to hospital with AHRF die in hospital despite the use of mechanical ventilation support strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Ambrosino-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ambrosino 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foglio-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Foglio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2011</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In severe COPD, hyperinflation places the respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage, and they function close to their maximum capacity (<LINK REF="REF-Macklem-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklem 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1986</LINK>). During acute exacerbations, elastic and resistive loads on the respiratory muscles increase, and this may lead to ventilatory failure. Ensuing tissue acidosis further impairs ventilatory muscle function, which leads to the downward spiral of ventilatory failure (<LINK REF="REF-Jaun-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaun 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Various methods of ventilatory support are available for the compromised patient. Conventional therapy aims to facilitate adequate oxygenation while treating the cause of the exacerbation. This is usually achieved with the use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and controlled oxygen. Traditionally, patients who do not respond to conventional treatment would receive invasive mechanical ventilation. This mode of ventilation involves sedation, intubation (insertion of a tube into the airway for breathing), attachment to a mechanical ventilator, and transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU). This treatment strategy has been commonly used in clinical practice for some years and is associated with successful reversal of hypercapnic acidaemia and recovery of breathing function in some individuals. However, it is also associated with significant risks. The intubation process may cause damage to local tissue structures, and the course of ventilation may be complicated by factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and sinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koenig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koenig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waters-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2015</LINK>). Invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD is also associated with high morbidity and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support (<LINK REF="REF-Brochard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brochard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esteban-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esteban 1995</LINK>). Prolonged length of ICU stay is therefore not uncommon for this patient group.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an alternative management option for AHRF secondary to AECOPD (<LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meduri-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Meduri 1989</LINK>). NIV allows provision of positive pressure ventilation; however unlike invasive ventilation, NIV is performed without the need for sedation and intubation. Instead, ventilatory support is provided by a flow generator connected to NIV via a full face or nasal mask. Advantages of NIV over invasive ventilation include the ability to apply it for short, intermittent periods (which may be sufficient to reverse ventilatory failure);lack of sedation and its potential adverse secondary effects (e.g. ventilatory suppression); maintenance of the ability to eat, drink, and converse; and the consequent opportunity for individuals to have continued involvement in decisions regarding their care. It is important to note that the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia observed with NIV use is less than that seen among intubated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Guerin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kramer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nourdine-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nourdine 1999</LINK>). NIV is increasingly used as adjunctive therapy in the management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Therefore, it is essential that the effectiveness of NIV as a primary management option is accurately determined to verify its use in patients with AECOPD previously characterised by greater reliance on invasive ventilation.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-10 18:23:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>The mechanisms underpinning effects of NIV among patients with AHRF are fundamentally similar to those supporting mechanical ventilation, that is, NIV works to enhance ventilation by providing pressure-supported airflow to unload fatigued ventilatory muscles. This enables recovery of function of respiratory muscles of ventilation and facilitates normalisation of, or improvement in, lung volumes and lung mechanics to reverse acidaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Appendi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appendi 1994</LINK>). Clinical improvement is most commonly determined via analysis of arterial blood gas samples and overall clinical state. NIV is used increasingly in clinical practice and is an established form of treatment for patients with a variety of chronic hypoventilatory syndromes (<LINK REF="REF-Moloney-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moloney 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 18:11:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Use of NIV in AHRF due to AECOPD has been supported by a number of case series (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Foglio-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Foglio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meduri-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Meduri 1989</LINK>) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs; <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celikel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Celikel 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>). Despite this fact, NIV is not more successful than usual care in all cases of AHRF due to AECOPD (<LINK REF="STD-Barbe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barbe 1996</LINK>), and failure rates of between 9% and 50% have been reported (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soo-Hoo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soo Hoo 1994</LINK>). Factors that may relate to this include patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, the impact of coadjuvant polypharmacy for AECOPDs such as anxiolytics or respiratory suppressants, and factors related to staff (e.g. time, expertise) and individual patients (e.g. claustrophobia). A matter of concern is that NIV, particularly when applied unsuccessfully, may delay the start of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, thereby potentially resulting in poorer health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ambrosino-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambrosino 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK>). This may be influenced by the common clinical situation whereby patients with AECOPD find tight-fitting NIV masks (whether nasal or full face) uncomfortable or claustrophobic. Intolerance may result in poor treatment adherence and, ultimately, in NIV ineffectiveness. This is an update of a Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Ram-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ram 2004</LINK>).</P>

<P>Studies must have been conducted on adult patients admitted to hospital with AHRF due to AECOPD. Studies of patients who commenced NIV before hospital admission were not eligible for inclusion. We defined AHRF by a mean admission pH &lt; 7.35 and mean baseline admission partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>) greater than 45 mmHg (6 kPa). If we could not verify mean baseline pH data, we accepted studies if investigators stated within their inclusion criteria that participants needed to have had an admission pH &lt; 7.35. Studies of participants with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia and of those with other underlying pathologies were not eligible for inclusion. Studies involving a mixed group of participant pathologies (e.g. some with COPD, some with congestive cardiac failure (CCF)) were eligible if data specifically pertaining to those with COPD were available or could be obtained. We excluded no studies on the basis of the presence of concurrent respiratory comorbidities such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea, obesity, and hypoventilation syndrome.</P>

<P>Studies must have compared effects of NIV versus usual care. Non-invasive ventilation was defined as delivery of BiPAP when inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was greater than expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). NIV may have been delivered via any type of interface (e.g. full face mask, nasal mask, helmet). Usual care was defined according to trial authors' definitions, which typically involveda combination of supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, bronchodilators, steroids, respiratory stimulants, and/or other suitable medical interventions (e.g. diuretics, methylxanthines). However, usual care could not include any form of 'usual' NIV or invasive ventilation. Studies that involved participants who had already received a form of invasive or non-invasive ventilation (including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) before enrolment, including studies of NIV weaning, were not eligible for inclusion. </P>

Six of the included studies were multi-centric, including <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1995</LINK> (the only international multi-centric study, conducted in France, Spain, and Italy), <LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2009</LINK> (conducted in seven hospitals in Spain), <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK> (conducted in two hospitals in the USA), <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK> (conducted in three centres in the UK), <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK> (conducted in 14 centres in the UK), and <LINK REF="STD-Collaborative-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collaborative 2005</LINK> (conducted across 19 hospitals in China). All trials included patients who had AHRF due to AECOPD, but two studies also included patients with other diagnoses. <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK> included patients with AECOPD, heart failure, pneumonia, asthma, and pulmonary embolus, and <LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK> included patients with acute respiratory failure due to AECOPD and acute pulmonary oedema. For both studies, we included in the review only data related to patients with AECOPD. It is likely that participants in included studies did not represent the full spectrum of patients with AHRF due to AECOPD observed in clinical practice, as those requiring immediate intubation were typically ineligible for inclusion in the clinical trials of this review.</P>
<P>The number of participants in each included study ranged from 20 to 342 (median 41), with an aggregate total of 1264 (at the time of randomisation) in the review. We could not determine the precise number of participants who completed clinical trials. All trials recruited similar numbers of patients for both study groups. Available data show that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 (range 57.7 to 70.5) years, and males and females accounted for 65% and 35% of participants, respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>All included studies compared NIV plus usual care versus usual care alone. The precise nature of usual care varied slightly between studies, but it typically included combinations of pharmacological therapies such as oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, theophylline, antibiotics, mucolytics, doxapram, diuretics, and heparin. Variability in care was most likely attributable to differences in the years studies were conducted and/or local practices within specific regions or hospitals. Six trials were conducted in hospital respiratory/medical wards (<LINK REF="STD-Barbe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barbe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-del-Castillo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">del Castillo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dikensoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dikensoy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>), seven in ICU or critical care settings (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celikel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Celikel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matuska-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matuska 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Samaria-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Samaria 2009</LINK>), one on an 'intermediate care ward' (<LINK REF="STD-Avdeev-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Avdeev 1998</LINK>), and one (<LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>) primarily in a hospital ED. We did not include in location subgroup analyses data from this latter study (<LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>), and we could not determine the setting for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Collaborative-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collaborative 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Investigators most commonly delivered NIV via pressure-cycled ventilation (N = 21 studies). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>) used volume-cycled nasal NIV. Mean (range) inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) values used when NIV was commenced were 10.7 (3 to 20) cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, but IPAP levels were frequently titrated during early phases, according to the maximum level tolerated by the patient or a target respiratory rate. The mean (range) expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) value used upon NIV initiation was 4 (0 to 5) cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O.</P>
<P>Nine studies delivered NIV via a face mask interface (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Celikel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Celikel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Collaborative-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Collaborative 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-del-Castillo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">del Castillo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dikensoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dikensoy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matuska-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matuska 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>), and three used nasal masks only (<LINK REF="STD-Barbe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barbe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK>). Four studies allowed optional use of a face mask and/or a nasal mask (<LINK REF="STD-Avdeev-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Avdeev 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2001</LINK>). We could not determine the type of interface used in the remaining included studies.</P>
<P>The duration of total NIV use was highly variable across included studies. Studies typically implemented NIV according to protocols that aimed to achieve a target number of hours of NIV use per day (reduced from early to late admission), but the total number of hours of NIV use was almost always individualised according to the time needed for AHRF to resolve.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The most commonly reported outcomes of relevance for this review were mortality (N = 12 studies), need for endotracheal intubation (N = 17 studies), and hospital length of stay (N = 10 studies). The outcome of treatment intolerance rarely included adverse events in the control group, hence results clearly appeared to favour usual care over NIV. One should consider this when interpreting the quantitative findings derived from this analysis.

<P>Adequate blinding of participants to reduce knowledge of the received intervention was rare and occurred in only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Carrera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Carrera 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>). Adequate blinding is inherently difficult to achieve in clinical trials of NIV interventions, as delivery of placebo care is challenging, and differences between active and inactive treatments are easily detectable. Knowledge of the intervention group may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures such as ratings of dyspnoea, but it is likely that most other outcomes were not affected. Much uncertainty surrounds the adequacy of assessor blinding across included studies. Lack of outcome assessor blinding may have affected results related to several of the secondary review outcomes.</P>

The overall pooled analysis shows a significantly lower incidence of mortality among participants who received NIV compared with those who received usual care.

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK>) demonstrated an effect estimate that tended to favour usual care (not statistically significant); this study was unusual as participants were characterised by very severe hypercapnia upon presentation to hospital (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 80 mmHg in both groups).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-10 18:23:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett">
<P>Addition of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to usual care for management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly reduces risks of mortality and endotracheal intubation. Treatment with NIV is associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay on average, but this finding relates most often to patients with prolonged admissions. NIV appears to improve acidosis within one hour of initiation. Results appear generally consistent across both intensive care unit (ICU) and ward settings, and for patients admitted with more severe (pH &lt; 7.30) or less severe (7.30 to 7.35) acidaemia.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interpretation of main findings</HEADING>
<P>We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1264 participants. This represents a substantial increase from the original review in the number of studies and number of participants included. Trial results demonstrate clear benefits associated with use of NIV as adjunctive therapy to usual care (compared with usual care alone) for treatment of patients admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Benefits were consistent across a range of outcomes considered to be clinically important. Compared with usual care, the overall pooled effect of NIV across included studies included significant reductions in risk of mortality and need for endotracheal intubation, with the average number of patients required to be treated to derive benefit in the magnitude of 12 and 5, respectively. Although no clinical consensus has been reached regarding the most acceptable number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for such outcomes, this approach appears to represent good return upon investment with respect to the importance of these clinical outcomes and the generally low incidence of adverse events reported in studies included in this review. Effects of NIV + usual care versus usual care alone across secondary outcomes were derived from a significantly smaller pool than derived across primary outcomes and were less consistent. The magnitude of effect observed among subgroups defined on the basis of admission pH (&lt; 7.30 or from 7.35 to 7.30) or clinical setting (ICU vs ward) did not significantly differ for most outcomes, with the exception of hospital length of stay, which demonstrated significantly greater benefit for those with more severe acidosis (pH &lt; 7.30) than for those with milder acidosis (pH 7.35 to 7.30). This suggests that benefits derived from NIV use are likely to extend across a range of differing clinical scenarios.</P>
<P>Researchers have reported a significant 46% relative reduction in risk of mortality with NIV compared with usual care. This equates to potential avoidance of one death for every 12 patients treated with NIV (a slight increase from the original review (NNTB = 10)). This mortality benefit across the large number of included studies is of considerable clinical importance. Debate has surrounded the issue of whether NIV would delay necessary endotracheal intubation and therefore increase mortality. However, this position is not supported by the findings of this review. Mortality with NIV was reduced overall and across almost all of the pH and location subgroups, inferring generally similar responses irrespective of such factors. The only subgroup that did not reach statistical significance for this outcome was the ICU subgroup (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.07). It is noteworthy to mention that this subgroup included the <LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK> study, which was unique compared with any other included study, as the mean admission partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<SUB>2</SUB>) across both groups was in excess of 80 mmHg. This would be considered an indicator for intubation at many hospitals. Although this study demonstrated significant improvement in arterial blood gases and need for intubation, the mortality effect was small and non-significant (two deaths in NIV group due to septicaemia and acute coronary event vs one death in the control group due to septicaemia). In translating findings related to this outcome into clinical practice, it may be worth considering that the potential for mortality in clinical practice could be greater than that observed in clinical trials owing to factors related to patient suitability for mechanical ventilation. Individuals who are poor candidates for intubation and ventilation, including those with a very poor prognosis or a low likelihood of satisfactory quality of life or prespecified end-of-life choices (e.g. not for resuscitation/intubation wishes), are unlikely to feature in clinical trials such as those included within this review, yet may be appropriate candidates for NIV.</P>
<P>Need for endotracheal intubation was reduced by approximately two-thirds (64%) relative to usual care, equating to just five patients needing to be treated with NIV to potentially avoid intubation of one patient. The magnitude of benefit was clear and statistically significant for all subgroups, and no significant differences were observed for this outcome across subgroups related to admission pH or treatment location. These data further demonstrate the clearly important clinical benefits associated with NIV. It is worth noting that findings related to this outcome could be considered a conservative underestimation of the true effect of NIV due to inherent challenges in evaluating and reporting this outcome in clinical trials. Whereas failure of treatment for patients enrolled into an NIV treatment arm commonly results in progression to intubation and mechanical ventilation or withdrawal of treatment, failure in a usual care arm typically results in escalation of medical management to 'off-protocol' NIV, followed by potential subsequent intubation and mechanical ventilation (or treatment withdrawal). The precise incidence of 'actual intubation' therefore is likely to be less than the 'need for intubation' in usual care groups. Additionally, actual intubation rates may be influenced by the availability of beds in ICU settings. Therefore we considered the <I>need</I> for intubation as our principal definition for this outcome, as we believed this more accurately evaluated treatment 'success' versus 'failure'. Studies that reported only actual intubation rates were not rated as having high risk of bias due to data contamination, as we believed this phenomenon was representative of clinical care and was unlikely to overinflate effect estimates related to this outcome.</P>
<P>Need for endotracheal intubation is not always considered a 'negative' outcome, particularly in the context of treatment failure and concerns regarding the timeliness of 'essential' intubation and mechanical ventilation. Although this review did not set out to answer specific questions related to such examples, some inferences may be drawn from the present data (with due caution related to indirectness of the data for answering such questions) on the basis of lack of significant differences in beneficial effect estimates for the need for intubation (and mortality) in subgroups defined according to baseline pH levels. Although <I>time to</I> intubation was not specifically examined within this review, the data should alleviate some concerns regarding the safety of NIV as a first-line therapy option (or trial of therapy for some) for patients who may present later in the course of their AHRF (when concerns regarding timeliness of invasive ventilation may be greater).</P>
<P>NIV use was not associated with exclusively positive outcomes. Data from our review demonstrate the need for intubation criteria was met by 66 of the 559 participants in the intervention group (12% incidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). Rapid access to teams and resources capable of delivering invasive ventilation would therefore appear advisable for individuals considered appropriate for escalation of care when NIV is used. However, it is essential that evaluations and judgements regarding end-of-life decisions are made for all patients with severe AECOPDs characterised by AHRF on an individual needs basis. Although some patients with COPD may not be candidates for invasive ventilation, a considerable proportion of those who present to hospital with severe exacerbations requiring NIV have greater underlying disease severity and, in the setting of NIV treatment failure, may be more appropriate for attempted continuation/titration of NIV, conservative management, or treatment withdrawal. For example, patients who may have received prolonged (&gt; 7 days) intubation/ventilation in the past owing to respiratory muscle atrophy may be characterised by reduced ventilatory reserve and impaired capacity to clear pulmonary secretions - features that are likely to recur during subsequent exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Coakley-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coakley 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Helliwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helliwell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Bourdelles-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Bourdelles 1994</LINK>). Other risks associated with invasive positive pressure ventilation such as barotrauma, cardiac output impairment, increased work of breathing related to dead space ventilation (due to length of the endotracheal tube), and the potential for prolonged or difficult weaning (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1986</LINK>) are relevant factors for consideration when treatment plans for such patients are determined.</P>
<P>The findings of this review are intended to be interpreted with respect to <I>initial</I> management of AHRF secondary to AECOPD. Several studies have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of NIV in patients who are weaning from invasive ventilation; we explicitly excluded these from this review and believe that our results should not be extrapolated to such contexts.</P>
<P>It is noteworthy to reflect upon <LINK REF="STD-Barbe-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Barbe 1996</LINK>, which was one of the only studies to conclude that addition of NIV to usual care was not beneficial. This trial adopted a less common approach to delivery of NIV, as investigators delayed initiation of nasal NIV by 12 to 48 hours after hospital admission (a period longer than most other included studies) and administered it in two fixed sessions (three hours per day). Most other clinical trials in this field, however, adopted flexible prescription practices, allowing quicker initiation and longer duration of treatment in accordance with participant responses (e.g. change in clinical condition). This latter approach is more likely to reflect current clinical practice in many countries where NIV is common. Removal of this study from analyses did not meaningfully impact results, most likely because of the relatively low weighting attributed to this (or any) study, in the light of the large quantity of pooled data for most review outcomes. This small study (N = 24) was also characterised by a mild baseline level of acidosis (mean admission pH of 7.33) at which significant mortality may not be expected to occur.</P>
<P>NIV significantly reduced length of hospital stay by more than three days. It should be noted that the (weighted) mean length of hospital stay for the usual care group was very high (17.5 days). This duration of admission is far in excess of that commonly observed in clinical practice in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chandra-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra 2012</LINK>). It remains to be seen whether the magnitude of benefit would be the same for patients admitted to clinical settings in which shorter admissions are more common. This could be an important area of future research. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>) contributed data to the outcome of ICU length of stay, limiting wider applicability of this non-significant finding that tended to favour use of NIV.</P>
<P>The high incidence of intolerance in the NIV group was not surprising, given that this finding is clearly related to the potential discomfort of NIV in the NIV group and the absence of such discomfort in the usual care group. Although this finding indicates that NIV is not well tolerated by all patients with AHRF due to AECOPD, care should be taken <I>not</I> to interpret this finding as indicative of harm or a reason to deny a patient the opportunity to receive NIV when indicated. When review authors explored the incidence of complications, it became clear that most complications were related to delivery of NIV (e.g. mask-related facial pressure areas, bloating) but were of a generally mild nature with little long-term clinical consequence (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The two studies that reported data unrelated to NIV use described significant benefits favouring NIV use; however, additional confirmatory data appear necessary to verify this finding.</P>
<P>Four studies provided data regarding patient-reported ratings of perceived breathlessness. Investigators used three different measurement instruments (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Borg score, and verbal rating score) at various times after admission. Therefore, pooling of these data was difficult. Although we noted statistical significance for the single study (N = 60) using VAS, we believe this does not represent any preferable sensitivity to detect changes associated with NIV use. It makes clinical sense to expect that resolution of AHRF would be associated with reduced perception of dyspnoea. Hence, although data for this outcome appear limited in the extent to which they may apply beyond this review, we believe that additional research is not strongly indicated to vigorously pursue data collection for this outcome.</P>
<P>Acidosis has been shown to be an important prognostic factor of survival from respiratory failure in COPD; thus early correction of acidosis is an essential goal of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 1992</LINK>). This review has shown that NIV (compared with usual care) achieves more rapid correction of acidosis within the first hour. The collective observed benefits of NIV for pH, PaO<SUB>2</SUB>, PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> (not statistically significant), and symptoms of dyspnoea suggest a picture of overall clinical improvement in respiratory failure status. Although data presently available are not confirmatory, it is intuitive to hypothesise that this clinical improvement may be a logical mechanism underpinning observed beneficial effects of NIV on need for endotracheal intubation and mortality. A previous study using NIV in respiratory failure secondary to exacerbations of COPD (<LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1990</LINK>), which was not included in this review (not an RCT), reported reductions in respiratory rate and transdiaphragmatic activity with increases in tidal volume and minute ventilation. These findings support the mechanism that NIV not only rapidly improves gas exchange but also allows respiratory muscles to rest, thereby reducing respiratory muscle work in respiratory failure. NIV appears to optimise the window of opportunity for respiratory muscle recovery and for other conventional treatments (bronchodilators, oxygen, corticosteroids, antibiotics, etc.) to take maximal effect. It is interesting to note that in the current review, the outcome for PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> did not reach statistical significance; however, our post hoc exploration of this finding showed that it was heavily influenced by data derived from <LINK REF="STD-Dikensoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dikensoy 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Matuska-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Matuska 2006</LINK>, both of which were rated as having high risk of bias owing to imbalance of outcomes at baseline. In each instance, participants in the NIV group happened to have statistically significantly worse baseline PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> levels before commencing the intervention (despite randomisation). Endpoint data recorded at one hour were used for meta-analysis, yet these values appeared numerically worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group. Inspection of the degree of change in both studies showed NIV to be superior to usual care in both instances (NIV group improved and usual care group deteriorated in both studies). This finding may need to be interpreted with due diligence.</P>
<P>A specific point to consider regarding observed changes in blood acidity levels relates to the unit of measurement for the pH outcome. It is perhaps ideal to express changes in this outcome in units of hydrogen ion concentrations (H<SUP>+</SUP>) rather than pH; however the latter clearly is used more widely and is easier to interpret in the clinical domain than the former. pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration; because of the logarithmic nature of pH, one cannot assume that differences in hydrogen ion concentrations between (for example) a pH of 7.26 versus 7.27 compared with 7.27 versus 7.28 are linear. Descriptions of mean changes in acidity of 0.01 of a pH unit can therefore risk becoming meaningless. As reporting of pH in clinical trials and clinical practice regarding NIV use is far more common than reporting of use of H<SUP>+</SUP>, we opted to report data in this more conventional manner and do not advocate change. Rather, we encourage appropriate due diligence in implementation of findings related to this outcome, especially when stratification according to acidosis severity may be pertinent.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We rated evidence for the primary review outcomes of mortality and need for endotracheal intubation as showing 'moderate' quality according to GRADE criteria. This rating was largely due to uncertainty regarding risk of bias judgements for several included studies. In the light of the relatively small weighting of any individual trial in this large meta-analysis, the impact of such issues could be considered potentially small, especially given the nature of robust outcomes such as mortality, for which the threat of issues such as performance or detection bias could be considered less. Further research may impact the magnitude and our confidence in treatment effect estimates, particularly for several of the secondary review outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One should consider some important factors when interpreting the findings of this review. One issue affecting data across numerous secondary outcomes is the systematic bias associated with treatment success/failure in favour of the intervention. Treatment failure typically would result in loss of data collection for some outcomes (e.g. arterial blood gas parameters measured after the first hour of treatment), hence it is reasonable to suspect that observed effect estimates may overestimate the true effectiveness of NIV in management of respiratory failure for some outcomes.</P>
<P>It is also well accepted that no definition of an intensive care unit has been universally accepted, and this has resulted in widespread variability in the scope and context of such settings across the world. The applicability of our subgroup analyses comparing effectiveness of NIV in ICU and ward environments was therefore constrained by the definitions proposed by study authors. We believe this is the most appropriate approach for handling this issue.</P>
<P>Many of the studies included in the pH subgroup &lt; 7.30 (indicative of more severe acidaemia) examined NIV delivered within the ICU environment. Similarly, most studies conducted in the pH subgroup 7.30 to 7.35 took place in the ward environment. Risk ratios for primary outcomes for subgroup analyses were not significantly different. Therefore it is challenging to distinguish between the relative impact of the severity of presenting acidaemia versus NIV hospital setting on these outcomes. One could speculate the null hypothesis that little difference would likely exist between subgroups, and that ICU-based studies and studies with lower mean admission pH would do better with NIV.</P>
<P>Potentially relevant research findings might always be presented in works that are not available for inclusion within a review or have not been published owing to factors such as 'negative' outcomes. We believe our comprehensive search strategy was sufficient for this purpose, as it included electronic searching of databases regularly updated through the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), including handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Selection bias from the review team was minimised by systematic extraction of data by two independent members of the review team using standardised templates.</P>
<P>The extent to which bias related to clinical decision making for study participants influenced clinical outcomes is difficult to accurately ascertain. No study in this review could be described as 'double-blinded' owing to the practical challenges associated with such procedures; however <LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK> employed 'sham' NIV. Other studies ensured that research personnel responsible for making clinical management decisions were unaware of which treatment arm a participant was assigned to, until NIV had commenced (<LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 1995</LINK>), or were not involved in decisions to intubate (<LINK REF="STD-Celikel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Celikel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>), or employed <I>a priori </I>criteria for decisions regarding intubation (<LINK REF="STD-del-Castillo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">del Castillo 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK>) or treatment failure (<LINK REF="STD-Dikensoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dikensoy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>). It is clearly important that interventions associated with a real potential for serious adverse events (such as NIV) should have sufficient monitoring in place and should provide appropriate rescue therapy in the event of clinical deterioration. Although we would like to assume that all patients who 'fail' NIV would be offered immediate alternative management (e.g. intubation and mechanical ventilation), it remains possible that, in an unblinded trial, management could be delayed to prolong the window of opportunity for clinical benefit associated with NIV. Variability in the criteria used to define such treatment failure therefore has significant potential to influence such outcomes. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK> enrolled patients presenting to hospital with severe AHRF characterised by PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> levels over 80 mmHg in both groups. This would warrant immediate intubation at many hospitals.</P>
<P>Finally, NIV itself has limitations. Some 13% to 29% of patients are unable to tolerate the mask (<LINK REF="STD-Foglio-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Foglio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1998</LINK>), and facial skin ulcers can be caused by mask pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Stauffer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stauffer 1982</LINK>). Other limitations include lack of direct access to the airways, which could promote mucus plugging and/or atelectasis in patients with excessive secretions, thereby increasing the risk of aspiration. NIV initiation requires a conscious and co-operative patient and cannot be done in patients with haemodynamic instability or life-threatening hypoxaemia. No conclusions can be drawn regarding NIV as an alternative to intubation owing to eligibility requirements of this review.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A previous review evaluated effects of NIV added to standard treatment for management of acute respiratory failure (<LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK> review, which analysed participants with COPD separately, showed a strong survival benefit (odds ratio (OR) = 0.29) and a reduced need for intubation (OR = 0.12) in favour of NIV. Although our systematic review derived similar conclusions as those presented by Keenan and coworkers, some important limitations of this previous review led to the need for the present review. First, our review included 17 RCTs, but we included only three of the seven studies included in the <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK> review and excluded the remaining four studies for various reasons. <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 1992</LINK> did not compare NIV with usual care but compared NIV with doxapram; <LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulou 1993</LINK> used an inadequate method for randomisation (alternation); <LINK REF="STD-Martin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Martin 1995</LINK> included only a subgroup of participants with COPD and not all participants met the inclusion criterion of PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 45 mmHg; and <LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 1995</LINK> excluded all patients who had COPD.</P>
<P>Second, we sought to implement a more comprehensive search strategy compared with the one used by <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK>, as indexing of MEDLINE alone is likely to miss potentially relevant studies. The strategy used in this review included electronic database searches, handsearching, and inclusion of non-English studies.</P>
<P>Our current review includes only studies that were primarily set up to compare NIV with usual care for management of respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK> review set out to investigate NIV versus usual care in acute respiratory failure due to various causes, including cor pulmonale, respiratory distress, COPD, and pneumonia. The <LINK REF="STD-Keenan-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keenan 1997</LINK> review conducted a <I>post hoc</I> analysis of the COPD subgroup.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available data from a large number of good quality randomised controlled trials included in this review offer convincing evidence supporting the use of NIV as a first-line adjunct intervention to usual medical care for patients admitted with AHRF secondary to AECOPD. This review had some risks of bias (e.g. performance bias); however review authors believe that these conferred a relatively minor impact upon primary review outcomes, particularly with due consideration given to challenges associated with 'shamming' NIV interventions. Although it makes clinical sense to consider implementing NIV early in the course of respiratory failure (before acidosis progresses to a more severe nature), our data related to pH subgroups suggest that the intervention is no less effective as a means of reducing risk of endotracheal intubation and mortality among these patients. We regarded the evidence supporting a likely reduction in hospital length of stay due to NIV to be of moderate quality according to GRADE criteria, and we believe the magnitude of the impact related to this outcome is of high clinical interest (particularly to healthcare administrators).</P>
<P>Previous research has shown NIV use to be no more costly than management via intubation and/or mechanical ventilation, no more time-consuming in terms of nursing involvement (<LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nava-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nava 1997</LINK>), and no more costly to deliver within or outside the ICU setting (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1995</LINK>), mainly as the result of cost benefits associated with reductions in ICU resources (<LINK REF="STD-Plant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Plant 2001</LINK>). Data in this review support the use of NIV in the ward setting; however decisions regarding implementation of such therapy in different settings should be made with careful consideration of factors specific to individual institutions that may impact patient safety, including degree of illness severity and/or acuity;availability and expertise of appropriately trained medical, nursing, and allied health staff for safe implementation and sufficient monitoring of patients (e.g. frequent observations); adequate staff-to-patient ratios; and appropriate access to and understanding of different NIV interfaces and equipment (e.g. arterial blood gas analysers) to accurately evaluate the impact of NIV upon a diverse range of clinical outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-10 10:26:17 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An important issue emerging from the present review concerns the feasibility of conducting future studies of NIV versus no NIV. This is due in part to the clear benefit of NIV for a highly important clinical outcome such as mortality and to increasing implementation of this intervention as part of routine clinical care for patients with AHRF secondary to AECOPD. Therefore, it will become increasingly difficult to define 'usual medical care' without NIV as a therapy consistent with evidence-based practice. This may pose particular challenges in obtaining future human ethical committee approval to conduct parallel-group clinical trials such as those included in this review. For example, although future research may reasonably impact and/or refine the precise estimate of effect related to hospital length of stay, we do not believe this warrants future research employing control groups that receive usual medical care without NIV.</P>
<P>One should interpret study findings within the context of the specific questions posed by this review - which were limited to issues of clinical effectiveness in the hospital setting. Additional research would enhance our ability to more accurately select the right patients and the right levels of ventilation (e.g. dosage, duration, mode). Studies are also needed to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of NIV applied in different settings (e.g. out-of-hospital, high-dependency units, non-specialist departments/wards) and to evaluate the feasibility (if any) of using NIV as an <I>alternative</I> to endotracheal intubation. Fewer data were available for several of the secondary outcomes of this review (e.g. symptoms, length of ICU stay), suggesting that further confirmatory evidence could still be needed to determine the impact of NIV on these outcomes. We contend, however, that targeting the primary outcomes of this review should remain the primary focus of future research related to clinical effectiveness. Outcomes not considered within the present review include those related to quality of life or to the diverse longer-term impact of critical (or near-critical) illness survival known to significantly affect morbidity in the time post discharge.</P>
<P>Finally, it would be clinically advantageous to identify optimal monitoring strategies for patients with differing acuity levels (e.g. extent of acidaemia) to guide evidence-based treatment decisions for such patients. This may be particularly relevant for environments outside the ICU setting, where access to resources for monitoring clinical progress (e.g. blood gas analysis) may be challenging. It would also seem worthwhile for researchers to explore the utility of emerging practices, such as expanded development of device interfaces (e.g. helmets) and the increasing popularity of methods such as transcutaneous carbon dioxide analysis or venous blood gas analysis for patient evaluation owing to their relative simplicity compared with arterial sampling. Research in these fields is still in its relative infancy.</P>

<P>Updates undertaken since publication of the original review resulted in the following changes to the protocol.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Significant updates to the methods to bring the review in line with current Cochrane (MECIR) standards. This included insertion of a 'Summary of findings' table and updates to the risk of bias methods (removal of the Jadad scale). This process included evaluation of the following additional domains of potential bias: imbalance of outcome measures at baseline, comparability of intervention and control group characteristics at baseline, protection against contamination, and selective recruitment of participants.</LI>
<LI>Following critical feedback regarding this review, we amended the definition of AHRF from the initial review to now include reference to pH &lt; 7.35. We deemed this essential to enhance its consistency with clinical practice.</LI>
<LI>Amendment of primary review outcomes. In the initial version, the primary outcome was 'treatment failure', defined according to any combination of intubation, mortality, or treatment failure. To remove ambiguity regarding overlap between these definitions, the current version lists treatment intolerance as an independent secondary review outcome. We also made clarifications to the definition of our primary outcome 'need for endotracheal intubation' to minimise ambiguity.</LI>
<LI>Exclusion of one study that was included in the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Conti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Conti 2002</LINK>) due to inclusion of mechanical ventilation as a comparator intervention; and reclassification of one study originally included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Servillo-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Servillo 1994</LINK>) to 'Awaiting classification' due to lack of sufficient information pertaining to mean baseline pH to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review in accordance with our revised definition of AHRF.</LI>
<LI>Replacement of one abstract included in the original review with a full-text version in the update (Khilnani 2002 is now <LINK REF="STD-Khilnani-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Khilnani 2010</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Minor edits to wording of two eligibility criteria to explicitly clarify that (a) studies of patients who commenced NIV before hospital admission are ineligible for inclusion in the review; and (b) 'usual medical care' may not include any form of positive pressure ventilation considered to be 'usual' for that study centre.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Thys-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Thys 2002</LINK> was originally included as an 'ICU' study in the subgroup analysis of ward versus ICU care. As this study was based in an emergency department (potentially more intensive than a ward, but not an ICU setting), in keeping with the primary aim of the review, we excluded this study from the ward versus ICU subgroup analysis for the present (and subsequent) updates.</LI>
<LI>Data from <LINK REF="STD-Bott-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Bott 1993</LINK> were originally included in some of the meta-analyses related to blood gas tensions; however owing to lack of sufficient study information regarding the number of participants included in these outcome data, this study was subsequently removed from the meta-analysis and was reported separately. Additionally, mortality data were removed from the meta-analysis, as they were identified as relevant to the post-discharge period, not to in-hospital mortality.</LI>
<LI>We conducted subgroup analyses of admission pH and location only for the primary outcomes of interest for this review (mortality and need for endotracheal intubation), rather than for all outcomes.</LI>
<LI>One additional table (percentage change in PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> at one hour post intervention) included in the earlier review was removed.</LI>
<LI>Type of NIV for subgroup analysis was removed from the investigation of heterogeneity section of the protocol, as all studies except one used pressure-cycled NIV.</LI>

<U>Intervention description:</U> All participants were first fitted with a nasal mask, however this was substituted with an oronasal mask if participant intolerant or excessive air leak. NIV was administered using a BiPAP ventilator assist system (Respironics, Inc,, Murrysville, PA, USA), a pressure-limited device that cycles between adjustable (up to 20 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O) inspiratory and expiratory pressure using S or T modes. The S/T mode was used for this study. Ventilation was initiated with a backup rate of 12 breaths/min. IPAP was set at 8 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O initially, and EPAP was set at the lowest possible setting (~2 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O). Oxygen was blended in via a mask port to maintain SpO<SUB>2</SUB> &#8805; 90%. IPAP was increased by 1 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O every 15 to 30 minutes or as tolerated. Subsequent adjustment in IPAP if ABG showed persistent respiratory acidosis or clinical evidence of continued respiratory distress</P>
<P>All participants also received corticosteroids, frequent respiratory treatments, supplemental oxygen, and antibiotics</P>
<P>
<U>Control description:</U> Corticosteroids, frequent respiratory treatments, supplemental oxygen, and antibiotics. Control participants who declined intubation were offered a trial of NIV if their condition deteriorated sufficiently to warrant intubation and if they were considered to have needed intubation for purposes of analysis</P>
<P>
<U>Duration of intervention:</U> Encouraged to use NIV as long as tolerated, aiming for at least 8 hours per day.

<U>Intervention description:</U> Usual care (no sham NIV) plus bi-level NIV (BiPAP ST/D 30; Respironics, Inc., Murrysville, PA, USA). BiPAP was used with inspiratory PS initially set at 10 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O and EPAP at 4 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O, used in assist-control mode with a backup frequency of 10 breaths/min, via face mask (Bird, Bird Corp., Riverside, CA, USA). IPAP was increased by 2 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O steps, until signs of discomfort (increasing sensation of dyspnoea), observation of air leaks, or pressure of 20 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O was reached. EPAP was similarly increased until discomfort.</P>
<P>Supplemental oxygen included via nasal catheter as required to maintain oxygen saturation &gt; 90%</P>
<P>
<U>Control description:</U> Supplemental oxygen, bronchodilator aerosol therapy (fenoterol 1500 mg and ipratropium bromide 0.4 mg) repeated every 20 minutes and IV glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 80 mg). Sham NIV employed, involving same setup as NIV group but a modified T-connector piece (several holes created) between mask and tubing to enable IPAP = EPAP = 0 cmH<SUB>2</SUB>O. Oxygen was added with a nasal catheter inside the mask as needed to obtain saturation of 90%</P>
<P>Treatment failure and success were defined in advance. Treatment success led to study end, treatment failure led to intubation in the active NIV group. Failure in the placebo NIV group led first to active NIV (rescue protocol)</P>

<P>An initial search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group RCT register up to and including September 2003. This Cochrane Airways RCT register contains records downloaded from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and UK Research Register as well as records identified through hand searching of key respiratory journals and abstracts from meetings of the American Thoracic Society, British Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society. Randomised controlled trials are identified for this RCT register using the following search strategy: (placebo* OR trial* OR random* OR double-blind OR double blind OR single-blind OR single blind OR controlled study OR comparative study).</P>
<P>The following search terms were used in the above mentioned Cochrane Airways RCT register to search for trials for this review: (nasal OR mechanical OR non-invasive or non invasive or positive pressure OR intermittent positive pressure OR airway* pressure OR pressure-controlled OR volume-controlled AND ventilat*) OR positive pressure OR bi-level positive pressure OR ventilation support OR NIPPV OR NIV OR NIAV OR NIV</P>
