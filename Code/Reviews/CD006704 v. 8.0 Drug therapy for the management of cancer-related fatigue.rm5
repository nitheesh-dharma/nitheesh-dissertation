<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-14 08:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>Fatigue associated with cancer is a significant problem. It can occur because of side effects of treatment or because of the disease itself. It can have a significant impact on a person's ability to function. The causes of fatigue are not fully understood and so it is very difficult to treat appropriately. This review has examined drug treatment for fatigue as it represents one of the ways this problem can be tackled. The review authors looked at trials in all types of cancer and at all stages of treatment. Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria but only 31 (7104 participants) were deemed suitable for detailed analysis as they explored fatigue in sufficient detail. They found mixed results with some drugs showing an effect on fatigue - most notably drugs that stimulate red blood cell production and also drugs that improve levels of concentration. Methylphenidate, a stimulant drug that improves concentration, is effective for the management of cancer-related fatigue but the small samples used in the available studies mean more research is needed to confirm its role. Erythropoietin and darbopoetin, drugs that improve anaemia, are effective in the management of cancer-related fatigue. However safety concerns and side effects from these drugs mean that they can no longer be recommended to treat cancer fatigue.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-28 13:35:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1 2008). Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is common, under-recognised and difficult to treat. There have been studies looking at drug interventions to improve CRF but results have been conflicting depending on the population studied and outcome measures used. No previous reviews of this topic have been exhaustive or have synthesised all available data.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of drugs for the management of CRF.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-06-14 08:54:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from Issue 2 2007) MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2007 to October 2009 and a selection of cancer journals. We searched references of identified articles and contacted authors to obtain unreported data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-11 14:31:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>Studies were included in the review if they 1) assessed drug therapy for the management of CRF compared to placebo, usual care or a non-pharmacological intervention in 2) randomised controlled trials (RCT) of 3) adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Meta-analyses were performed on different drug classes using continuous variable data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-14 08:57:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. Six additional studies were identified since the original review. Only 31 of these studies involving 7104 participants were judged to have used a sufficiently robust measure of fatigue and thus were deemed suitable for detailed analysis. The drugs were still analysed by class (psychostimulants; haemopoietic growth factors; antidepressants and progestational steroids). Methylphenidate showed a small but significant improvement in fatigue over placebo (Z = 2.83; P = 0.005). Since the publication of the original review increased safety concerns have been raised regarding erythropoietin and this cannot now be recommended in practice.There was a very high degree of statistical and clinical heterogeneity in the trials and the reasons for this are discussed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-04-28 09:18:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is increasing evidence that psychostimulant trials provide evidence for improvement in CRF at a clinically meaningful level. There is still a requirement for a large scale RCT of methylphenidate to confirm the preliminary results from this review. There is new safety data which indicates that the haemopoietic growth factors are associated with increased adverse outcomes. These drugs can no longer be recommended in the treatment of CRF. Readers of the first review should re-read the document in full.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-28 13:32:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1 2008) on drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Minton-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minton 2008</LINK>). Cancer-related Fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common symptoms experienced by cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2002</LINK>). It can be problematic at the time of diagnosis, during and after treatment and in patients with advanced disease (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2002</LINK>). Most studies have reported prevalence figures in excess of 60% (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2002</LINK>). The subjective sensations attributed to CRF are characterised by a pervasive and persistent sense of tiredness not relieved by sleep or rest. This can adversely affect a person's emotional, physical and mental well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2005</LINK>). CRF can also affect patients' abilities to function in terms of their usual social activities, and their ability to carry on with their normal working lives. Fatigue is not only a problem in cancer patients.</P>
<P>Fatigue is a recognised condition within the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Bultmann-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bultmann 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrie-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrie 1997</LINK>). It is a feature of other chronic illnesses such as multiple sclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Krupp-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krupp 1988</LINK>) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<LINK REF="REF-Trendall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trendall 2001</LINK>). It can also be a separate diagnosis in its own right in the case of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (<LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>While CRF in some groups may have similarities with CFS there are important differences in particular in relation to concerns about its relationship to disease progression and toxicity of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Servaes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Servaes 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has therefore been suggested that CRF should be considered to represent a diagnostic entity in its own right (<LINK REF="REF-Cella-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sadler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadler 2002</LINK>). CRF is a complex condition with many physical and psychological components potentially predisposing people to it. These same factors may also exacerbate and perpetuate established CRF. The complex nature of the condition makes it difficult to identify a clear underlying mechanism. Indeed, it is more than likely that no such single mechanism exists (<LINK REF="REF-Andrews-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andrews 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, CRF is a disabling and distressing condition which is often under-recognised by cancer physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Mock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stone-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2002</LINK>) and clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2010</LINK>) have attempted to summarise existing evidence for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for CRF. The main focus of one of these reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Mock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mock 2004</LINK>) was on non-pharmacological measures where there have been a number of studies investigating exercise interventions and the role of support groups. The review authors concluded that:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>exercise had a direct effect on reducing fatigue;</LI>
<LI>there was some evidence that correction of anaemia improved quality of life and energy.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Another review group focused their review on pharmacological interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2005</LINK>). They considered the evidence in support of a number of treatment options:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<I>Antidepressants:</I> on the basis of one study found by this review group (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 1995</LINK>) anti-depressants were suggested as a possible treatment for fatigue associated with advanced disease or uncontrolled symptoms, or both. However, the review authors did not recommend the routine use of anti-depressants in the absence of concurrent depression. This opinion was based in part on the results of a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted with paroxetine which improved mood but found no effect on fatigue in ambulatory cancer patients (<LINK REF="STD-Morrow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 2003</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>
<I>Erythropoietin: </I>this was recommended because it has been studied as a treatment for anaemia in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and some studies reported improvements in fatigue in such patients with the correction of anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Demetri-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demetri 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glaspy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glaspy 1997</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>
<I>Corticosteroids</I>: <LINK REF="REF-Morrow-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrow 2005</LINK> concluded that corticosteroids may produce modest improvements in quality of life including improvement in fatigue in patients with metastatic cancer but that they are limited by the side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1985</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network's (<LINK REF="REF-NCCN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCN 2010</LINK>) clinical guidelines also provide further options for CRF management. These suggest initially treating any underlying reversible causes of fatigue (e.g. anaemia, poor nutrition or depression) and attending to general supportive measures and psychosocial support. The most common specific recommendation for an intervention targeted at fatigue is the use of an exercise programme which is the subject of a separate Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Cramp-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cramp 2010</LINK>). The main drug treatment the NCCN guidelines recommend is the use of methylphenidate in selected cases of cancer-related fatigue after other non-pharmacological approaches have been tried. However, most of the evidence for this suggestion is from a trial in HIV patients (<LINK REF="REF-Breitbart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breitbart 2001</LINK>). A recent RCT in cancer patients failed to find any significant superiority over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous literature reviews have made suggestions for the use of different drugs based on varying amounts and quality of evidence. No previous review has collated all of the relevant literature concerning pharmacological interventions for cancer-related fatigue in a systematic way. A Cochrane systematic review was therefore needed in order to evaluate all the available evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for CRF. Treatment of fatigue in palliative care will be the subject of another Cochrane review prepared by Radbruch et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Radbruch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radbruch 2007</LINK>). Close collaboration between the two review author groups will ensure maximum coverage and minimum overlap of the two reviews. This review update was conducted to analyse the increasing number of trials and to address safety concerns raised over haemopoietic growth factors.</P>

<P>One review author (OM) screened the eligibility of retrieved articles from the title and abstract. If there was insufficient information for assessment, the full article was scrutinised by two review authors (OM and PS). Two review authors (OM and PS) independently assessed all RCTs. For a trial to be included it must have included fatigue as part of a primary outcome measure and one treatment arm must have been a drug therapy. Disagreement was resolved by consensus with other members of the review group (MS, AR, MH).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>Each trial was assessed for potential bias on the basis of allocation and concealment as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). A - adequate; B - unclear; C - clearly inadequate; D - allocation concealment not used. We also assessed the methodological quality of each study using the three item Oxford Quality Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Were withdrawals and dropouts described? (1 = yes; 0 = no)</P>
<P>All studies also had an assessment of efforts made to match groups in terms of prognostic factors. Study quality was further assessed based on intention-to-treat analysis, standardisation and blinding of outcome assessment and percentage loss to follow up. This information was used to determine an overall risk of bias from a study - those studies felt to be at an unacceptably high risk of bias were excluded from the review. Study quality was not scored on an additive basis. Impact of study quality was determined by sensitivity analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data management</HEADING>
<P>Data was organised using RevMan 5 (version 5.1.1). Data extraction forms were developed <I>a priori</I> and included information regarding methods, participant details, dose and frequency of drug administration, attrition and outcome measures. Two review authors (OM and PS) independently extracted data and disagreements were resolved by consensus with the other members of the group (MH, AR, MS).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Heterogeneity assessment</HEADING>
<P>Homogeneity of the results of the various endpoints of interest was explored using I squared (I<SUP>2</SUP>) values. Heterogeneity in the results was seen as a result of many potential factors (postulated <I>a priori</I>) and efforts were made to identify sub groups for sensitivity analysis. Meta-analysis was undertaken. As a result of high statistical heterogeneity we used a random-effects model for analysis.</P>

<P>We evaluated quantitative outcomes for dichotomous and continuous data using RevMan 5 and the random-effects models as the data was not normally distributed. Analysis based on intention to treat was used. Outcomes of interest were compared between treatment and control arms using mean differences and standard deviations.</P>
<P>The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was not calculated because of the continuous outcome data found. A judgement on how to combine outcome measures was made depending on how information was collected. In trials where the same scale was used the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated to provide an effect size of clinically significant change on one specific outcome measure. In other trials which had different outcome measures, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). The size of difference between mean score change on the meta-analysis is given by the Z score.</P>

<P>Re-running the search strategy in MEDLINE ,EMBASE and CENTRAL retrieved 647 additional references. The Updated search identified 12 additional studies potentially suitable for inclusion. Further analysis of these studies found that six did not meet the inclusion criteria for the review. One study met the inclusion criteria but was not possible to include in a meta-analysis and was not analysed further. Therefore there are now 31 studies included for full analysis; 19 additional studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified but were not analysed.

There were six placebo controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Littlewood-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Littlewood 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Shaughnessy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osterborg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Osterborg 2002</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Tsuboi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tsuboi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witzig-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Witzig 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2007</LINK>). Due to the difference in quality a sensitivity analysis was also performed.</P>
<P>Combining the eleven trials in a random effects model showed a low degree of heterogeneity I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 20%. There was no clear difference in heterogeneity in sensitivity analysis when variation in doses was accounted for. Trials used doses from 3000 to 40,000 units a week and different dosing schedules with some trials using a three times a week dosing and others giving a weekly dose. Tumour type studied also did not affect heterogeneity.</P>
<P>When the six placebo controlled trials (N = 1401) were combined in a subcategory there was homogeneity I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%. This would suggest the heterogeneity was due to study quality and lack of blinding in allocation. The overall effect Z score = 4.88 (P &lt; 0.0001), SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.17.</P>

All were placebo controlled trials. The trials were homogenous I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%. One trial investigated patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies only (<LINK REF="STD-Hedenus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hedenus 2003</LINK>), one lung tumour patients (<LINK REF="STD-Vansteenkiste-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vansteenkiste 2002</LINK>) and one any tumour type (<LINK REF="STD-Kotasek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kotasek 2003</LINK>). The other included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>) was conducted on cancer patients not on any chemotherapy. The four trials used different doses which varied form 2.25 g/kg to 15 g/kg three times weekly. Only a combined mean effect has been used in the meta-analysis to avoid duplication.</P>
<P>The overall effect Z score = 1.45 (P = 0.05) , SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.00. This indicated that there is a small but statistically significant difference between darbopoetin and placebo for the treatment of CRF. <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Combined analysis</HEADING>
<P>As darbopoetin is a derivative of erythropoietin and therefore a nearly identical drug with a similar mechanism of action we felt it was appropriate to combine the two groups in a combined analysis of all placebo controlled trials. The following trials were included in a random-effects model: <LINK REF="STD-Hedenus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hedenus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotasek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kotasek 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Littlewood-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Littlewood 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Shaughnessy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Shaughnessy 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osterborg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Osterborg 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vansteenkiste-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vansteenkiste 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Witzig-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Witzig 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wright-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2007</LINK>. Total N = 2801. The overall Z score = 5.08 (P &lt; 0.001), SMD -0.23 95% CI -0.32 to -0.14. This indicated a small but consistent positive effect using either growth factor. It also suggested that the overall effect is increased with the addition of the darbopoetin trials which might be expected from the common mechanism of action. The erythropoietin studies which used the FACT F tool (functional assessment of cancer therapy - fatigue sub scale) (<LINK REF="REF-Cella-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 2002</LINK>) for fatigue measurement were combined in a random effects model but using weighted mean difference (WMD). The overall Z score = 6.13, SMD -4.29, 95% CI -5.04 to -2.60. This indicates that overall these trials may provide a clinically significant reduction in fatigue.</P>

<P>The studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 98.8%). This may be explained by difference in dosing regime (from 160 milligrams to 320 milligrams once a day). The Simons study used medroxyprogesterone acetate while the others all used megestrol acetate. However, when this study was excluded the heterogeneity remains very high (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 98%). There are other factors which may contribute. The duration of study varied widely from ten days (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK>) to 12 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Westman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tumour type - apart from <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK> (only included gastrointestinal (GI) and lung tumours) any tumour was included in all the remaining studies.</P>
<P>Two studies allowed palliative chemotherapy or radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Simons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Westman 1999</LINK>) this was in the minority of patients (10%) and matched in both treatment groups. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Conno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Conno 1998</LINK>) did not allow any concomitant therapy.</P>
<P>The four studies were combined in a random-effects model as there was significant heterogeneity despite limited sensitivity analysis. The overall effect Z score is 0.78 (P = 0.44) SMD -0.49 95% CI -1.74 to 0.75. The effect of megestrol acetate alone is Z = 0.67 (P = 0.5) SMD -0.66, 95% CI -2.6 to 1.28.

<P>As these are individual trials no synthesis of the data was possible.</P>
<P>The Ibandronate study N = 466 (<LINK REF="STD-Diel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diel 2004</LINK>) was a trial with long term follow up of nearly two years. It recruited participants with breast cancer only. The results showed that the ibandronate group had a statistically significant difference in fatigue scores at the 96 week outcome assessment. There was no clear dose response with different dosing schedules. All groups experienced increases in fatigue scores over the time of the study</P>
<P>One single study used etanercept in conjunction with docetaxel chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Monk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2006</LINK>). This was a trial on a very small number of participants (N = 12) but that studied all tumour types. It was a pilot study but with 'positive' results - the etanercept group showed a statistically significant reduction in fatigue compared to patients treated with docetaxel alone.</P>
<P>The final single study used donepezil N =142 (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2007</LINK>) for one week only but showed no benefit over placebo.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>This updated review did not find any increase in adverse effects in the drug classes studied. However there has been a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2009</LINK>) examining the adverse effects of the hematopoietic growth factors. On a number of sub group analyses the authors of this review found an increase in mortality in advanced cancer patients and many more adverse events in the treated groups.</P>
<P>The majority of trials had minimal reported adverse events. The analysis for grouped adverse events (comparison 7.1) demonstrated some variation across the different drugs.</P>
<P>The haemopoietic growth factors had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.30 indicating a non statistically significant between group difference.<BR/>The progestational steroids had an OR of 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.51 indicating a non statistically significant between group difference.<BR/>The psychostimulant studies had an OR of 1.24, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.62 indicating a non statistically significant between group difference.<BR/>The paroxetine studies had an OR of 1.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.48 indicating a non statistically significant between group difference. <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>
</P>
<P>Some of the erythropoietin trials highlighted ongoing safety concerns. <LINK REF="STD-Leyland_x002d_Jones-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leyland-Jones 2005</LINK> was primarily a survival study. It was designed to compare mortality rates between groups not receiving chemotherapy. The erythropoietin group showed increased mortality at four months and the trial was terminated prematurely. It was felt that there may have been an increased rate of fatal thrombo-embolic events in the erythropoietin arm over placebo (1.1% versus 0.2% at four months). The rate of serious adverse events was 5% in the erythropoietin arm versus 2% with placebo. This study was designed to keep haemoglobin at 12 to 14 g/100 ml. Current prescribing guidelines state that a haemoglobin of 12 g/100 ml should not be exceeded (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-53" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 53</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Wright-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Wright 2007</LINK> was also prematurely terminated as a result of safety concerns. The data monitoring committee suspended the trial after it was noted that the median survival in the epoetin group was worse than placebo. The cause for this discrepancy was unclear and may not have been solely due to adverse events related to the medication. Nevertheless current prescribing guidelines should be adhered to and a lower maintenance haemoglobin aimed for.</P>
<P>A more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of all adverse events of these agents is made in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2007</LINK>). The reader is also referred to the review by the same group published in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2009</LINK>).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-14 09:47:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>The aim of this Cochrane review was to look at the overall effect of drugs on CRF. The study has yielded a large number of trials of varying size and quality. It has also demonstrated the wide range of tools used for fatigue or quality of life measurement, or both. The large number of trials identified allowed for synthesis of data and the quantification of the clinical effect of the drugs used on CRF which previous narrative reviews have been unable to do.</P>
<P>The review was comprehensive as it was impracticable to specify in advance which drugs would be studied. The included RCTs incorporate four different drug classes where results could be combined and two separate single trials. Other drugs were identified during the search strategy but none were examined within a RCT and so none of those trials are reported. However, some of these drugs are now being studied within a RCT. These trials are listed in the 'characteristics of ongoing studies' table. There are ongoing trials investigating the effects of modafinil (<LINK REF="STD-Drappatz-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Drappatz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morrow-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wee-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wee 2009</LINK>); levo carnitine (<LINK REF="STD-Cruciani-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cruciani 2007</LINK>); co-enzyme Q10 (<LINK REF="STD-Frizell-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Frizell 2007</LINK>); adenosine triphosphate (<LINK REF="STD-Dagnelie-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dagnelie 2007</LINK>); There are also three ongoing trials that will add to the data on methylphenidate (<LINK REF="STD-Hutson-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hutson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roth-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roth 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2006</LINK>) and one ongoing trial examining etanercept (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2007</LINK>).<BR/>On viewing the current data some general comment about the trials underway are warranted before a more detailed discussion on individual analyses is given.</P>
<P>While the quality of some trials was mediocre on the scale used this may be due to lack of consistency in trial reporting and failure to adhere to CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Consort-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consort 2007</LINK>). There is a high rate of attrition in some studies but this is due more to the population studied than reported adverse events. The rate of attrition was mainly due to disease progression and the complex nature of any concurrent treatment. This led to large withdrawals because of death or protocol violation. If this was not reported in the trial publication then the quality score given was lower. There are no between group differences in withdrawal rate for all drugs studied (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>). The heterogeneity of some of the trials may also have been due to a low signal:noise ratio. There were many factors such as disease progression and the unstable nature of the population which may have affected heterogeneity which it has not been possible to account for. However, for the erythropoietin trials heterogeneity was mainly due to differences in study design.</P>
<P>All trials demonstrated statistical non significance between group differences for important prognostic factors. This included a detailed description of stage and type of tumour and concurrent treatment (if any). If specific methods were required to match the randomised groups this was invariably achieved with stratification by tumour type and treatment. There were no exceptions to this. There were also no significant differences in any trial in relation to missing data.</P>
<P>There was some variation in the withdrawal rates but nearly all trials were analysed on an intention to treat basis. The exception to this was <LINK REF="STD-Boogaerts-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boogaerts 2003</LINK> that used last observation carried forward (LOCF). The variations in the quality of trials and any impact in a sensitivity analysis will be commented on for each drug.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Psychostimulants</HEADING>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Auret-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Auret 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butler-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Butler 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lower-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lower 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mar-Fan-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mar Fan 2008</LINK>) were combined. The standardized mean difference (SMD) on analysis was positive with a small effect seen and narrow confidence interval. The five studies did differ in design and follow up but used the same outcome measure (FACT F) and so it is possible to obtain a weighted mean difference (WMD) of -2.21. This translates as the value equal to the previously calculated minimal clinically significant difference (2 point change) on this scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cella-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cella 2002</LINK>). This gives the result's clinical relevance - these drugs lead to an observable improvement in fatigue. The current evidence supports the use of psychostimulants in the treatment of CRF. In addition there are three further trials being conducted with methylphenidate that may potentially increase the available evidence base (<I>see</I> 'characteristics of ongoing studies' table).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Erythropoietin</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of studies included in the analysis. Eleven studies were combined in total and demonstrated a positive effect. This persisted in a sensitivity analysis of placebo controlled trials although the CI was much narrower. It was not possible to generate a number needed to treat (NNT) as the data were continuous. A WMD was generated using a sub-analysis of studies using the FACT F and gave a score of 4.33. Again this value was above the minimal clinically significant difference. This would suggest that erythropoietin does provide a recognisable reduction in fatigue. This conclusion was limited to anaemic patients undergoing chemotherapy only. As there have been more recent safety concerns close monitoring of haemoglobin should also be instigated. This is especially important as previous multivariate regression (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2004</LINK>) has shown that haemoglobin only accounts for a small (approximately 20%) percentage of fatigue symptomology. The authors also demonstrated that greater improvement was most likely to be seen at lower haemoglobin concentrations (8 to 10 g/100 ml). The improvement in fatigue may not necessarily be due to improvement in haemoglobin concentrations after a minimum level has been reached. However in conclusion overall new safety concerns raised now mean that any potential improvement in fatigue is out weighed by the increase risk of harm from these drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Darbopoetin</HEADING>
<P>The four placebo controlled trials combined in a random-effects model showed superiority over placebo. Three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hedenus-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hedenus 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kotasek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kotasek 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2003</LINK>) had multiple dose treatment arms. The reporting of these trials only gave changes in fatigue score based either on dose of darbopoetin or haemoglobin change. Thus it was necessary to calculate the average response in order to undertake a meta-analysis. The authors were contacted to provide original trial data. The result seen is as expected as darbopoetin is a derivative of erythropoietin and has an almost identical mechanism of action. However, the WMD using the FACT F gave a score of -1.96 slightly below the minimal clinically significant difference. It is possible that further trials may strengthen this result but future trials need to focus on fatigue measurement with a simplified or fixed dosing regime to avoid the complex analyses from previous trials which has made data extraction so difficult.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Erythropoietin/darbopoetin</HEADING>
<P>A further analysis was carried out combining all the placebo controlled trials. This demonstrated a positive result using a random-effects model. The effect size was increased when the erythropoitetin/darbopoetin trials were combined over the erythropoietin trials alone. As we were interested in the mean effect of treatment on fatigue this data would seem to provide further evidence for their use in clinical practice. The review identified three head to head trials (<LINK REF="STD-Glaspy-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glaspy 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Glaspy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Glaspy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waltzman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Waltzman 2005</LINK>)<I> </I>which suggested that neither treatment was inferior on the limited fatigue data provided. However, it was not the aim of the review to demonstrate superiority of one treatment over another. In addition these studies were not primarily designed to look at quality of life changes for the two drugs. The combined WMD using all studies using the FACT F gave a score of 3.75 - above the minimal clinically significant difference on this scale. Data on transfusion requirements and haemoglobin changes for the two drugs can be found in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2007</LINK>
<I>).</I>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Paroxetine</HEADING>
<P>Two studies were combined (<LINK REF="STD-Morrow-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Morrow 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roscoe-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Roscoe 2005</LINK>). These trials were conducted by the same group concurrently but were separate trials in their own right. The analysis fails to show any benefit of paroxetine for the treatment of CRF. The addition of a third antidepressant trial of sertraline (<LINK REF="STD-Stockler--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Stockler 2007)</LINK> did not alter these findings. There were many measures made of fatigue and mood within the study but only the primary fatigue outcome was included in our analysis. The results of the trials demonstrate an improvement in mood with no associated improvement in fatigue. It is not clear, however, if this is a class effect related to all antidepressants. The use of antidepressants with different mechanisms of action may improve fatigue. Further trials may yet add more evidence. This is, however, an important negative result as many clinicians view the two symptoms as having a large overlap. While fatigue may be a symptom of a depressive illness, this data reinforces our contention that cancer-related fatigue is an entity in its own right.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Progestational steroids</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Conno-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Conno 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simons-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Simons 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Westman 1999</LINK>) were combined. The analysis demonstrates no superiority over placebo for this class of drugs. While all these trials are older than other included trials they were of good quality and placebo controlled. There is no evidence to support their continued use for the treatment of fatigue in current practice. There is no requirement for additional trials as the analysis demonstrates a consistent negative effect.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Single <I>t</I>rials</HEADING>
<P>There are three separate trials which were not combined.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Diel-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Diel 2004</LINK> examined the use of ibandronate over a period of two years. The results indicate that there is limited evidence to support the use of ibandronate in the treatment of CRF over a long term follow-up. The effect is likely to be due to reduction in bone morbidity rather than directly improving fatigue <I>per se</I>. However, it is the only study to use a measure of fatigue over a long follow up period in patients with metastatic disease. The clinical significance of the results are unclear and further targeted trials are needed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Monk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Monk 2006</LINK> examined the use of etanercept during chemotherapy. While the results are statistically significant the small numbers and poor design mean that further larger and better quality trials are needed to explore this effect. This study was conducted with one type of chemotherapy only and the results cannot readily be extrapolated. There is very limited evidence to support its use currently outside of a study setting. Future trials should be conducted with larger numbers as the proof of concept has been achieved in this small study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bruera-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 2007</LINK> examined the use of donepezil in patients off active treatment. There was no benefit over placebo and no further examination of this drug is indicated.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>This review was focused on fatigue and does not make any comment on the overall quality of life (QOL) changes that may be seen with the use of these drugs. There is likely to be a relationship between improving fatigue and improving QOL. Indeed in many trials the two terms are used interchangeably. We have extracted data on fatigue changes only. During the review process if we felt that data did not provide a detailed measure of fatigue then the study was not analysed further.</P>
<P>There were only continuous data available from the trials with only mean score change analysed in the meta-analysis. The diverse conduct and quality of the trials meant that there is large variance in outcome data. This means that combined between group changes need to be interpreted with caution and the conclusions of the review are necessarily limited.</P>
<P>We included trials that assessed outcomes using overall QOL in addition to pure fatigue scales. However, in many cases the trials were often published in ways that made extraction of the fatigue data impossible. Often only a limited comment was made on the effect on QOL with no quantitative data recorded if multiple outcome measures were included.</P>
<P>This was most often the case in the erythropoietin/darbopoetin trials where multiple measures of QOL were obtained but not published. This reaffirms the findings of a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bohlius-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohlius 2007</LINK>) where quantifying QOL changes with these drugs was not included because of missing data. We have tried to include as much data in our analysis as possible by contacting authors to obtain data. This may have had the propensity to introduce bias into our study as this data has not been peer reviewed.</P>
<P>It is also possible that the difficulties in conducting these types of trials with any of these drugs may mean that trials have not been published at all. There is therefore the potential for a publication bias in this review. However, by contacting experts in this field we have attempted to reduce this bias as much as possible.</P>
<P>This review also demonstrated that there is still no consensus as to how QOL data should be presented. A single study report will often not give useful data about QOL changes due to limited space for data reporting and study complexity. It is hoped that this review will serve to highlight this weakness in study reporting.</P>

<P>Four methylphenidate trials provided equivocal evidence for its use in a dose of 10 to 20 mg per day depending on response. Serious adverse effects were minimal but contra-indications to this drug should be reviewed before prescribing.</P>
<P>Erythropoietin and darbopoetin can no longer be recommended for the treatment of CRF given the increase in adverse events associated with these drugs.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-14 09:49:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Caroline Struthers">
<P>This review highlighted the large number of outcome measures used to examine fatigue. It found major limitations in reporting of trials. Future trials in this area should focus on fatigue as a primary outcome using validated outcome measures.</P>
<P>Further large scale RCTs should be conducted using methylphenidate to evaluate these preliminary results further. Other candidate drugs needing further evaluation include tumour necrosis factor blocking drugs.</P>
