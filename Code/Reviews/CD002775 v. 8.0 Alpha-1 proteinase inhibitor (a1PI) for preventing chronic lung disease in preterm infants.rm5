<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-29 18:04:33 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is not enough evidence to show the long term effect of using Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor for chronic lung disease in premature babies. Inflammation of the lungs is one of the causes of chronic lung disease (CLD) in babies born before 37 weeks. Babies with CLD need extra oxygen and the disease can also cause serious long-term problems. Lung damage is caused by the release of enzymes and other anti-oxidants because babies with CLD have a low level of Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (a1P1), a substance that stops lung tissue being destroyed. A medication version of AlP1 is sometimes given to protect their lungs. The review of the trials found that there is not enough evidence to show long term beneficial effects of a1P1. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Two eligible studies were identified. The methodological qualities of identified studies were good. One study randomised infants to either placebo or a1PI 60 mg/kg/dose for four doses while in the second study the same investigators explored the efficacy of different dose regimens of a1PI compared to placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing CLD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age among all randomised infants at any dose of a1PI (pooled RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.41) or when given 60 mg/kg/dose for four doses compared to placebo (pooled RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.18).</P>
<P>There was a trend towards reduced risk of development of oxygen dependency at 28 days postnatal age for 60 mg/kg/dose for four doses of a1PI compared to placebo. When any doses of a1PI were combined, the pooled RR was statistically significant [RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.98); RD -0.15 (95 % CI -0.29 to -0.01)].</P>
<P>Treatment with a1PI did not reduce the risk of CLD and/or death at 36 weeks postmenstrual age or the risk of long term neurodevelopmental abnormalities. In addition, no statistically significant difference was noted in other respiratory parameters such as duration of oxygen requirement or respiratory support.</P>

<P>Prophylactic administration of a1PI did not reduce the risk of CLD at 36 weeks or long term adverse developmental outcomes in preterm neonates.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-12-04 09:32:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advances in perinatal and neonatal care such as use of antenatal steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Crowley-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowley 2001</LINK>), surfactant replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1993</LINK>) and modification in ventilatory techniques have led to improved survival of preterm neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 1993</LINK>) and resulted in higher number of survivors with chronic lung disease (CLD) (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1993</LINK>). Pulmonary sequelae after respiratory distress syndrome were identified initially by <LINK REF="REF-Shepard-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepard 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1964</LINK> and later <LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>, who coined the term "bronchopulmonary dysplasia". <LINK REF="REF-Shennan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shennan 1988</LINK> defined CLD as oxygen requirement (with or without characteristic x-ray findings) persisting beyond 36 weeks post menstrual age (PMA). CLD is associated with prolonged hospitalisation, increased risk of re-hospitalisation and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes amongst survivors.</P>
<P>The etiology of CLD is multi factorial. Inflammation of pulmonary parenchyma plays a major role in evolution of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1984</LINK>). As a result of the inflammation there is a massive influx of neutrophils in to the alveoli (<LINK REF="REF-Ogden-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogden 1982</LINK>), liberation of pro - inflammatory mediators like cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>) and release of oxygen free radicals and proteinases in the alveoli. <LINK REF="REF-Merritt-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merritt 1983</LINK> has shown that neutrophil elastase released from neutrophils is elevated in tracheal lavage fluid of neonates who go on to develop CLD. The proteinases in the pulmonary parenchyma can digest fibrillar collagen, elastin fibers, laminin and fibronectin (<LINK REF="REF-Gerdes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1990</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-29 17:52:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Strategies or interventions for the prevention of CLD include antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1998</LINK>), vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1991</LINK>), vitamin A (<LINK REF="REF-Darlow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darlow 2001</LINK>), ceruloplasmin and anti proteinases (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1986</LINK>). Antioxidants neutralize the initial burst of free oxygen radicals. Failure of release of antioxidants results in tissue destruction with release of proteolytic enzymes such as elastase. Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (a1PI), a major inhibitor of elastase, prevents its proteolytic action on fibronectin and elastin (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1984</LINK>). Activity of a1PI has been evaluated in preterm and term neonates. <LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 1986</LINK> observed that a1PI activity and ceruloplasmin levels were low in all neonates, especially in less mature neonates who had higher incidence of CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Evans-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1976</LINK>). Furthermore <LINK REF="REF-Bruce-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruce 1981</LINK> showed that the levels of a1PI may be normal in preterm neonates but exposure to high oxygen concentration may result in inactivation of the methionine terminal of a1PI rendering it physiologically inactive.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-11-29 17:52:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>a1PI in the form of alpha-1 antitrypsin has been used since 1987 in adult patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Wewers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wewers 1987</LINK>). Aerosolized alpha-1 antitrypsin has been used in patients with cystic fibrosis who have normal alpha-1 antitrypsin levels but excessive elastase activity (<LINK REF="REF-McElvaney-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElvaney 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hubbard-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hubbard 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Koppel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koppel 1994</LINK> demonstrated that early administration of alpha-1 antitrypsin to newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia protects them from developing the anticipated pulmonary and vascular changes and the resultant right ventricular hypertrophy. In preclinical animal experiments, <LINK REF="REF-Fournel-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fournel 1988</LINK> demonstrated a1PI extravasation into pulmonary alveolar spaces with intravenous administration of a1PI resulting in sustained and proportionate increase in alveolar antielastase activity without abnormal clearance or significant inactivation of a1PI. No physiological or systemic adverse responses to anticipated clinical doses were observed and the toxicologic studies also failed to reveal any acute or subchronic effects. Known side effects attributable to a1PI administration are delayed fever and transient leucocytosis (<LINK REF="REF-Hebel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebel 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>With these observations, it seems that improving the proteinase - anti proteinase balance may have beneficial effects on CLD (<LINK REF="REF-Gadek-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gadek 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoder-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoder 1991</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="REF-Gerdes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerdes 1988</LINK> failed to show sustained clinical improvement after administration of dexamethasone which reduced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid elastase concentration.</P>

<P>Standardized methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to assess methodological quality of the studies.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. </P>
<P>For the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<P> 1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data):</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear. </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stiskal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stiskal 1998</LINK> randomised patients to receive a1PI (60 mg/kg) or placebo (Human Albumin 5%, equal volume- 2.4 ml/kg). Infusion was administered over 5 minutes within 24 hours of birth and at four, seven and fourteen days of age. Other clinical management decisions were left to the clinical care team responsible for the patients. A total of 106 patients were enrolled (53 in each group). Recruitment was halted after 2 deaths occurred in one of the centres after a review by the safety committee the study was allowed to progress. There were four protocol violations and one family refused the participation of their neonate after the first dose had been given.</P>
<P>The primary outcome assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Stiskal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stiskal 1998</LINK> study was the incidence of CLD among the survivors (oxygen requirement at 28 postnatal days). Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements at 36 weeks PMA and the use of systemic steroids. Strict criteria were laid out to define whether patients met the criteria for steroid use (requirement for mechanical ventilation and FiO2 &gt; 0.3 for at least 48 hours after 16 days of life) but achievement of these criteria didn't mandate the use of steroid. The decision to give steroids or not was left at the discretion of the team taking care of the infant. Other efficacy parameters monitored were age at final extubation, age off supplemental oxygenation, age off respiratory support, x-ray changes at 28 days and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram. The incidence of pulmonary haemorrhage, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, sepsis and PDA were recorded for both groups.</P>
<P>The follow-up of the cohort was published in abstract form (Kelly 1998). Authors were contacted to confirm that the patients were the same as in the original trial. Eighty three of 94 surviving infants were assessed. Five infants were assessed at &lt;12 months age but the rest were assessed at &gt; 18 months of age. Patients were assessed at standard interval to &gt;18 months of age for developmental progress. Patients were classified in 3 groups: 1. Normal 2. Mildly impaired (motor abnormality without significant functional limitation and/or mild hearing loss and/or severe myopia and/or developmental quotient &gt; 1 &lt; 2 SD below mean and 3. Severely impaired (motor abnormality with significant functional limitation and/or deafness and/or blindness and/or developments quotient &gt; 2 SD below the mean).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2000</LINK> performed an open randomised study to determine the effect of different dosing regimens of a1PI. Ventilated neonates weighing 500 - 1250g were randomised to four groups.</P>

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Stiskal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stiskal 1998</LINK> randomisation was performed centrally by the pharmacist using computer generated random table numbers. Randomization was stratified according to birth weight and whether patient was out born or inborn. Allocation was concealed in sequential opaque, sealed envelopes. Randomization was done in blocks of four. Masking of the intervention was done to ensure that investigators, parents and care takers were unaware of treatment allocation. Crossover was not allowed and contamination was not possible because study drug was not available outside the trial. Co-interventions were possible for the use of other interventions which may be effective in reducing the incidence of chronic lung disease and were monitored. Short term outcome assessments (need for oxygen at 28 days postnatal age and 36 weeks PMA) were blinded as the assessors were not aware of treatment allocation.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-06 13:26:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>An extensive literature search was conducted to identify trials that might qualify for this review. However, only two trials, both performed in a similar setting and by the same group of investigators, were identified. Even after combining trials appropriately the number of neonates providing data on outcomes remained very small (n = 195). As a result, the fact that there was no statistically significant difference found between groups may be due to lack of statistical power.</P>
<P>The quality of included studies was good suggesting that extracted data were valid. However, there were some differences in design. The first study of (<LINK REF="STD-Stiskal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stiskal 1998</LINK>) compared the drug with placebo in a blinded randomised controlled trial while the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Dunn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dunn 2000</LINK>) compared different dose regimens with placebo in an open randomised controlled trial. Methodological rigor was strict in both instances.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant difference in the development of CLD at 36 weeks PMA. The difference remained insignificant even after higher dose and increased frequency of administration. The incidence of CLD at 28 days was reduced by a1PI but it was apparent that the difference was lost at 36 weeks PMA. The other outcome measures such as duration of oxygen requirement or duration of respiratory assistance was not statistically significantly different amongst the groups irrespective of the dose of a1PI.</P>
<P>Long term outcomes were evaluated in the <LINK REF="STD-Stiskal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Stiskal 1998</LINK> study only and were not found to be statistically significantly different between treatment and control groups.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The prophylactic administration of a1PI for prevention of CLD in preterm neonates may have short term benefits but to date there are no long term benefits reported. The use of a1PI cannot be recommended for routine use to prevent CLD in preterm infants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>With no trend towards long term benefits of a1PI it may be argued that further placebo-controlled trials are not warranted. However, the total number of patients enrolled to date is very small. The apparent lack of benefit may be due to a type II error. </P>
