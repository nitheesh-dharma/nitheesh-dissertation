<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Knee replacement surgery is common for the management of arthritis but can cause knee stiffness. Knee stiffness can make it difficult to perform certain activities including standing up from a seated position. Continuous passive motion (CPM) is a way of providing regular movement to the knee using a machine. This Cochrane review presents what we know about the effects of CPM following knee surgery. After searching for all relevant studies in January 2013, we found 24 studies with 1445 participants who had knee replacement surgery primarily for knee arthritis. CPM was started from the first to the fourth day post surgery and applied for 1.5 to 24 hours a day, over 1 to 17 days. The review showed that CPM following knee replacement surgery probably improves the ability to bend the knee slightly and the person's quality of life but may not improve pain or function. We are uncertain about the effects of CPM on need for manipulation under anaesthesia, participants' perceptions of treatment effectiveness or risk of complications.</P>
<P>Best estimates of what happens to people who have CPM after knee replacement surgery are:</P>
<P>
<B>Range of motion -</B> <B>active knee flexion (i.e. ability to bend the knee)</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM were able to bend their knees an average of 2 degrees more (0 to 5 degrees more) than those who did not have CPM at six weeks (2% absolute improvement, 0 to 4% absolute improvement)</P>
<P>- People who had CPM were able to bend their knees an average of 80 degrees.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM were able to bend their knees an average of 78 degrees.</P>
<P>
<B>Pain (higher scores means worse or more severe pain)</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM rated their pain an average of 0.4 points lower (0.8 points lower to 0.1 points higher) on a 0 to 10 point scale at six weeks (4% absolute reduction, 8% reduction to 1% increase)</P>
<P>- People who had CPM rated their pain an average of 2.6 points on a 0 to 10 scale.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM rated their pain an average of 3 points on a 0 to 10 scale.</P>
<P>
<B>Function (higher scores means better function)</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM had a loss in function equivalent to an average of 1.6 points on a 0- to 100-point scale at six months (2% absolute reduction, 5% reduction to 2% increase).</P>
<P>- People who had CPM had function equivalent to an average of 56 points on a 0- to 100-point scale.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM had function equivalent to an average of 57.6 points on a 0- to 100-points scale.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life (higher scores means better quality of life)</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM had an increase in quality of life equivalent to an average of 1 point on a 0- to 100-point scale at six months (1% absolute improvement, 3% reduction to 4% increase).</P>
<P>- People who had CPM had a quality of life equivalent to an average of 41 points on a 0- to 100-point scale.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM had function equivalent to an average of 40 points on a 0- to 100-points scale.</P>
<P>
<B>Manipulation under anaesthesia</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM had a decrease in the risk of requiring manipulation under anaesthesia equivalent to an average of 25 fewer manipulations per 1000 patients (4% absolute risk reduction, 8% risk reduction to 0% risk reduction).</P>
<P>- People who had CPM had on average a 1.6% risk of requiring manipulation under anaesthesia.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM had on average a 7.2% risk of requiring manipulation under anaesthesia.</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>People who had CPM had a decrease in the risk of developing adverse events equivalent to an average of 13 fewer adverse events per 1000 patients (1% absolute risk reduction, 5% risk reduction to 3% risk increase).</P>
<P>- People who had CPM had on average a 15% risk of developing adverse events.</P>
<P>- People who did not have CPM had on average a 16.3% risk of developing adverse events.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:14:19 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>Arthritis of the knee is a common problem causing pain and disability. If severe, knee arthritis can be surgically managed with a total knee arthroplasty. Rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty often includes continuous passive motion (CPM). CPM is applied by a machine that passively and repeatedly moves the knee through a specified range of motion (ROM). It is believed that CPM increases recovery of knee ROM and has other therapeutic benefits. However, it is not clear whether CPM is effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-23 08:00:40 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of CPM and standard postoperative care versus similar postoperative care, with or without additional knee exercises, in people with knee arthroplasty. This review is an update of a 2003 and 2010 version of the same review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:23:09 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 24 January 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to 24 January 2013), CINAHL (January 1982 to 24 January 2013), AMED (January 1985 to 24 January 2013) and PEDro (to 24 January 2013).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-19 15:32:02 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>Randomised controlled trials in which the experimental group received CPM, and both the experimental and control groups received similar postoperative care and therapy following total knee arthroplasty in people with arthritis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-01-24 10:04:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes of interest were active knee flexion ROM, pain, quality of life, function, participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, incidence of manipulation under anaesthesia and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were passive knee flexion ROM, active knee extension ROM, passive knee extension ROM, length of hospital stay, swelling and quadriceps strength. We estimated effects for continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences (SMD), and effects for dichotomous data as risk ratios; all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). If appropriate, we performed meta-analyses using random-effects models.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-03-03 12:07:54 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>We identified 684 papers from the electronic searches after removal of duplicates and retrieved the full reports of 62 potentially eligible trials. Twenty-four randomised controlled trials of 1445 participants met the inclusion criteria; four of these trials were new to this update.</P>
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on active knee flexion ROM: mean knee flexion was 78 degrees in the control group, CPM increased active knee flexion ROM by 2 degrees (95% CI 0 to 5) or absolute improvement of 2% (95% CI 0% to 4%). The medium- and long-term effects are similar although the quality of evidence is lower.</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on pain: mean pain was 3 points in the control group, CPM reduced pain by 0.4 points on a 10-point scale (95% CI -0.8 to 0.1) or absolute reduction of -4% (95% CI -8% to 1%).</P>
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important medium-term effects on function: mean function in the control group was 56 points, CPM decreased function by 1.6 points (95% CI -6.1 to 2.0) on a 100-point scale or absolute reduction of -2% (95% CI -5% to 2%). The SMD was -0.1 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI -0.3 to 0.1).</P>
<P>There was moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important medium-term effects on quality of life: mean quality of life was 40 points in the control group, CPM improved quality of life by 1 point on a 100-point scale (95% CI -3 to 4) or absolute improvement of 1% (95% CI -3% to 4%).</P>
<P>There was very low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM reduces the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia; risk of manipulation in the control group was 7.2%, risk of manipulation in the experimental group was 1.6%, CPM decreased the risk of manipulation by 25 fewer manipulations per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 64) or absolute risk reduction of -4% (95% CI -8% to 0%). The risk ratio was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.9).</P>
<P>There was low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM reduces the risk of adverse events; risk of adverse events in the control group was 16.3%, risk of adverse events in the experimental group was 15%, CPM decreased the risk of adverse event by 13 fewer adverse events per 1000 or absolute risk reduction of -1% (95% CI -5% to 3%). The risk ratio was 0.9 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.3). The estimates for risk of manipulation and adverse events are very imprecise and the estimate for the risk of adverse events does not distinguish between a clinically important increase and decrease in risk.</P>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of CPM on participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:38:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>CPM does not have clinically important effects on active knee flexion ROM, pain, function or quality of life to justify its routine use. It may reduce the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia and risk of developing adverse events although the quality of evidence supporting these findings are very low and low, respectively. The effects of CPM on other outcomes are unclear.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-02-05 12:12:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:58:37 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Total knee arthroplasties (TKA) are surgical procedures that involve replacing the knee joint with artificial components. They are commonly performed to reduce pain and increase function in people with severe arthritis such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A common problem post surgery is joint stiffness.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:56:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Continuous passive motion (CPM) was first introduced by Salter et al in the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Salter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salter 1989</LINK>). It is a way of providing regular movement to the knee using an external motorised device that passively moves the joint through a pre-set arc of motion (<LINK REF="REF-Sheppard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheppard 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-05 12:12:47 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CPM is primarily advocated in the belief that it increases knee range of motion (ROM) (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salter-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salter 1989</LINK>). This is supported by animal studies, which have demonstrated that early movement minimises joint stiffness and improves ROM (<LINK REF="REF-Videman-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Videman 1987</LINK>). However, some scientists also claim that it reduces pain (<LINK REF="STD-Harms-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Harms 1991</LINK>), length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnebel-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnebel 1989</LINK>), and the need for manipulation under anaesthesia (a procedure that involves forcefully flexing the knee while the patient is anaesthetised to increase knee ROM (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1981</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-23 07:58:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There remains uncertainty about whether CPM is therapeutic following TKA. For example, CPM continues to be prescribed as part of postoperative care following TKA, commercial companies continue to advertise CPM machines as a way to improve outcomes following TKA and research attention continues to be directed at determining the effects of CPM. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to update two earlier versions of the same review with the overall aim of providing an objective synthesise of the evidence about the effectiveness of CPM following TKA for people with arthritis.</P>

<P>We included trials if CPM and standard postoperative care were compared with similar postoperative care with or without additional knee exercises. Standard postoperative care could include muscle-strengthening exercises (isometric or dynamic), functional exercises, gait training, immobilisation or ice, provided both groups received the same intervention. Additional knee exercises could include instructions or supervised active or passive knee ROM exercises. They could not include knee exercises provided with any type of CPM device.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Major outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes of interest were active knee flexion ROM, pain, function, quality of life, participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, need for manipulation under anaesthesia and adverse events. If study authors did not distinguish between active and passive knee flexion ROM then it was assumed that the measurement was passive. Only direct measures of pain intensity were of interest. These included pain scales but not pain medication. These outcomes are presented in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes were passive knee flexion ROM, active knee extension ROM, passive knee extension ROM, length of hospital stay, swelling and quadriceps strength. If authors did not distinguish between active and passive knee ROM then it was assumed that the measurement was passive. We interpreted "knee extension lag" as active knee extension ROM and "fixed deformity" as passive knee extension ROM.</P>
<P>All results, except need for manipulation and adverse events, were categorised into short-term effects of CPM (reflected in outcomes taken less than six weeks after randomisation), medium-term effects of CPM (reflected in outcomes taken six weeks to six months after randomisation) and long-term effects of CPM (reflected in outcomes taken more than six months after randomisation). Where trials collected data at multiple time periods within one of these categories, we used the data collected at the longest time since randomisation. Need for manipulation and adverse events were extracted regardless of time since randomisation.</P>
<P>Each of the primary outcomes were used in the 'Summary of findings' table. We used short-term effects except for function and quality of life where we used medium-term effects because either there were no data for the short-term effects or the data could not be pooled because of heterogeneity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two independent review authors examined the titles and abstracts of trials identified by the search strategy for trials that potentially met the inclusion criteria. We retrieved all trials classified as potentially eligible by at least one of the review authors. We re-examined the retrieved articles to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted characteristics of included studies and results from each of the included trials. We resolved discrepancies by consensus. We addressed questions regarding the relative effectiveness of different dosages of CPM in a meta-regression (see 'Data synthesis' for details). We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were used to measure the same construct (e.g. function). SMDs were calculated by dividing the difference between treated and control means by the pooled estimate of the SD. If authors of trials provided both intention-to-treat and per-protocol data, we used the intention-to-treat data. We did not impute missing data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each trial using the method recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the following methodological domains:</P>
<OL>
<LI>random sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>allocation sequence concealment;</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants;</LI>
<LI>blinding of therapists;</LI>
<LI>blinding of outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting; and</LI>
<LI>other potential sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We rated each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear (either lack of information or uncertainty over the potential for bias). We attempted to contact all study authors to clarify any ambiguities.</P>
<P>We resolved disagreements in ratings by discussion or, where necessary, by consulting a third review author.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we presented summary estimates as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pain, ROM and quality of life (weighted by the inverse of the variances of the estimates) or SMD and 95% CI for outcomes measured on different scales (function). SMDs were back-translated to a typical scale (e.g. 0 to 100 for function) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among-person SD (e.g. the SD of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial)<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we presented results as risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI.</P>
<P>For outcomes where it was desirable to have a lower score (e.g. pain); a negative value indicated a beneficial treatment effect of CPM. Conversely, for outcomes where it was desirable to have a larger score (e.g. knee flexion ROM); a positive value indicates a beneficial treatment effect of CPM. For some outcomes, such as function, different outcomes were used in different trials and the direction of beneficial treatment effect was not consistent such that higher numbers sometimes indicated a better outcome while in other trials it was the opposite. To overcome this problem, we inverted some data to ensure all outcomes were consistent within the one analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unit of analysis issues</HEADING>
<P>In trials with more than two groups, we extracted only data from the two groups with the most contrasting interventions and used these for analyses. For example, in trials with one control and two CPM groups, we included only the results of the control group and CPM group with the highest dosage in analyses. We adopted this approach to reduce complexity and increase the readability of the systematic review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>If outcomes were only reported graphically, we estimated the mean scores and SDs from the graphs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We estimated the effect of CPM by taking the difference in the mean outcome of the groups that did and did not receive CPM. For the primary analysis, the standard postoperative care may or may not have included additional knee exercises to one or both groups. We conducted a secondary analysis on just those trials in which the standard postoperative care for the control group included additional knee exercises. These trials provide a head-to-head comparison of the effectiveness of CPM and additional knee exercises. We pooled the MDs in outcomes from each trial to obtain a summary estimate of the effectiveness of CPM provided the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was not greater than 50%. We used random-effects models throughout. We used random-effects meta-regression to explore the effect of mean total CPM time (hours) on passive knee flexion ROM in the short term. We used the user-written metareg routine in the Stata software package (version 10) for this purpose.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings' tables</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to summarise the quality of evidence about the effect of CPM on each of the primary outcomes (active knee flexion ROM, pain, function, quality of life, participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, need for manipulation under anaesthesia and adverse events). We used the short-term effects in the analyses except for function and quality of life where we used the medium-term effects because either there were no data for the short-term effects or the data could not be pooled because of heterogeneity. We defined levels of quality as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>high quality: randomised trials;</LI>
<LI>medium quality: downgraded randomised trials;</LI>
<LI>low quality: double-downgraded randomised trials; and</LI>
<LI>very low quality: triple-downgraded randomised trials.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The quality of evidence was downgraded if:</P>
<OL>
<LI>there were limitations in the design and implementation of available trials suggesting high likelihood of bias;</LI>
<LI>there was only indirect evidence (indirect population, intervention, control, outcomes);</LI>
<LI>there was unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including problems with subgroup analyses);</LI>
<LI>the results were imprecise (wide CIs); and</LI>
<LI>there was a high probability of publication bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the same way, the quality of evidence was upgraded if:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the effect sizes were large;</LI>
<LI>all confounding factors reduced a demonstrated effect or suggested a spurious effect in trials that showed no effect; and</LI>
<LI>there was a dose-response gradient.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used GRADEpro software to compile the 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
<P>We re-expressed outcomes pooled using SMDs as a MD by multiplying the SMD by a representative control group baseline SD from a trial, using a familiar instrument.</P>
<P>In addition to the absolute and relative magnitude of effect provided in the 'Summary of findings' table, we have reported the absolute percent difference, the relative percent change from baseline, and the number needed to treat (NNT) for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) (the NNT was only provided for outcomes that showed a statistically significant difference).</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the absolute risk difference using the risk difference statistic in Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>), and expressed the result as a percentage; the relative percentage change as the RR - 1 and expressed it as a percentage; and the NNT from the control group event rate and the RR were determined using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we calculated the absolute risk difference as the MD between intervention and control groups in the original measurement units (divided by the scale), expressed as a percentage; the relative difference as the absolute change (or MD) divided by the baseline mean of the control group from a representative trial. As no continuous outcomes were significantly different between the intervention and control group, we did not calculate the NNT.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We planned no sensitivity analyses; however, we did look for small sample bias by re-doing all the analyses using a fixed-effect model and comparing results between the random-effects model and fixed-effect model of analyses for each outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-01-24 09:33:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 09:33:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>CPM following TKA is primarily advocated for its proposed benefits on knee ROM, particularly knee flexion. Knee flexion ROM is important for mobility tasks such as walking, transferring and performing activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 2000</LINK>). It is also important for activities such as squatting and kneeling, which are activities of daily living for many cultures (<LINK REF="REF-Hemmerich-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemmerich 2006</LINK>). In interpreting the results of this review, it is important to consider how much additional knee flexion ROM is required to justify the use of CPM. Few people would claim that an added benefit of less than 5 degrees is functionally important, and most people would probably agree that considerably more than 5 degrees is required to justify the added time, cost and inconvenience of CPM. This being the case, the findings of this systematic review provide moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on active knee flexion ROM (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The short-term effects on passive knee flexion, passive knee extension and active knee extension are similar with mean effects of 1 to 2 degrees. All estimates of the short-term effects of CPM on knee ROM are estimated with less than 5 degrees of uncertainty (as reflected in the 95% CI). The medium- and long-term effects of CPM on active knee flexion ROM, passive knee flexion ROM, active knee extension ROM or passive knee extension ROM are similar to the short-term effects - all have mean effects less than 3 degrees. Importantly, the upper 95% CIs of all but one of the eight estimates of the medium- and long-term effects are less than 5 degrees. The exception is the long-term effects on active knee flexion ROM, but this estimate was only based on three trials of 132 participants and the estimate is imprecise (95% CI -1 to 7 degrees). Taken together, this review provides moderate-quality evidence that CPM does not have sufficient effect on knee ROM to justify its widespread use.</P>
<P>Some people develop very stiff knees following TKA, irrespective of whether they receive CPM. One way to manage this problem is to manipulate the knee under anaesthesia. There is very low-quality evidence to suggest that CPM reduces the risk of manipulation. The reported effect is large in relative terms (RR 0.34) but the incidence proportion of manipulations following TKA is low (i.e. 7%) with only 25 manipulations reported in the eight trials involving 581 participants. An RR of 0.34 with this incidence proportion corresponds to an absolute reduction in risk of manipulation under anaesthesia of 4% (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This means that one manipulation will be prevented in every 21 people provided with CPM (95% CI 16 to 126). However, the estimate of RR is imprecise (95% CI 0.13 to 0.89) and does not rule out the possibility of a trivially small effect (i.e. one manipulation prevented in every 126 people provided CPM). In addition, these results are based on just eight trials and it is not clear in any of the included trials whether the clinicians making decisions about the need for manipulation were blinded to allocation. Interestingly, while knee stiffness is the most common indication for manipulation under anaesthesia, the results from this systematic review indicate there was little difference in knee ROM of people who did and did not receive CPM. Therefore, the findings about risk of manipulation need to be interpreted with caution (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>).</P>
<P>One hundred and seventy-eight adverse events were reported in 16 trials comprising 1040 participants. The types of adverse events reported were delayed healing, haemarthrosis, falls, deep venous thromboses, wound infections, pulmonary emboli and a patellar rupture. Some of the adverse events were unlikely to be related to CPM but nonetheless were included in the analyses because they would not bias the findings. The point estimate provides low-quality evidence to indicate a decrease in the risk of adverse events with CPM (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.33); however, the associated 95% CI includes an important increase and decrease in the risk of adverse events with CPM. It is, therefore, unclear whether CPM affects the risk of adverse events. The effect of CPM on participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness was also unclear. The three trials that included this outcome provided contradictory results and the data were too heterogeneous to pool.</P>
<P>CPM clearly does not have clinically meaningful short-, medium- or long-term effects on pain (MDs range from -0.4 to 0.3 points on a 10-point scale; 95% CI range from -0.8 to 0.9) although the medium- and long-term effects are only based on three and one trials, respectively, and, therefore, need to be interpreted with caution. The short-, medium- and long-term effects of CPM on length of hospital stay, swelling and quadriceps strength are more difficult to interpret. While none of the meta-analyses on these outcomes were statistically significant, it is not clear if they rule out clinically meaningful effects. Resolution of this issue requires clarification of what constitutes a clinically meaningful effect. For example, if a reduction in length of hospital stay of 2 days is considered clinically meaningful then the results of this systematic review clearly indicate that CPM does not have clinically meaningful effects (MD -0.4 days; 95% CI -1.0 to 0.2). However, if a reduction in length of hospital stay of 1 day is considered clinically meaningful then the data do not rule out the possibility of a clinically meaningful effect.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most important outcome is function because it reflects the implications of ROM, strength, swelling and pain on activities of daily living. However, function was not routinely included as an outcome measure and when it was, many different scales were used. The best estimate of the effect of CPM on function comes from trials that examined the medium-term effect. These trials provided moderate-quality evidence to suggest that CPM does not have clinically important effects on function unless a relative percent change in function of 5% is considered as worthwhile (relative percent change -4%; 95% CI -12 to 5; see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The precision of this estimate is surprisingly good given the multidimensional nature of the different measures used to measure function. For example, The Hospital and Knee Score used in some trials not only measures the ability of patients to walk, transfer and climb stairs but also measures knee ROM, pain, strength and instability. Future trials would benefit from some agreement on the most appropriate way to measure function in this group of patients.</P>
<P>Quality of life was only measured in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maniar-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Maniar 2012</LINK>), yet together these trials provide moderate-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important effects. The medium-term effect was very small and the estimate surprisingly precise (MD of 1 point on a 0- to 100-point scale; 95% CI -3 to 4). This estimate does not rule out the possibility of a 4/100 point improvement in quality of life with CPM but most would consider this too small to justify its use. However, more trials are required to verify these findings.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 02:36:45 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many different protocols were used to administer CPM. For example, in some trials CPM was started immediately after the TKA operation whereas in other trials it was started days later. The CPM settings were also different between trials. In some trials, the settings were dictated by a protocol whereas in other trials they were determined by patient comfort or clinician discretion. All these variables may have influenced the observed effects of CPM. A meta-regression was used to explore the possibility that total CPM time influences passive knee flexion ROM. Passive knee flexion ROM was selected because this was the most commonly measured outcome. The meta-regression indicated that there was little or no effect of CPM duration on short-term passive knee flexion ROM. That is, trials that applied CPM for 24 hours a day over an extended time period did not report systematically more passive knee flexion ROM than those that only applied CPM for a few hours over one or two days.</P>
<P>Protocols for co-interventions were also highly variable. In a subset of four trials, control participants also received additional knee exercises. A secondary analysis explored the effect of CPM in this subset of trials. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of CPM and knee exercises. This analysis was inconclusive because of the small number of trials. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that CPM would be more effective than knee exercises because the primary analysis indicated CPM is no more effective than usual care, with or without additional knee exercises.</P>
<P>There was usually a high degree of consistency (low between-study heterogeneity) in estimates of effects of pooled findings. Heterogeneity was only apparent in a small number of comparisons, typically where SMDs were used and when total sample sizes were small. The heterogeneity could have been due to any number of factors but was most likely due to the use of different tools to measure the same construct. This was particularly problematic for function, which was measured with outcomes as diverse as self reporting questionnaires and timed walking tests.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the applicability of the evidence about CPM is changing. CPM may no longer be a viable or appropriate treatment option, regardless of findings, because patients are now commonly discharged within a few days of surgery and often mobilised on the same day as surgery.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of trials was variable (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Only 10 trials clearly blinded assessors. Not surprisingly, given the nature of the intervention, no trial blinded participants or therapists. Failure to blind assessors, participants and therapists exposes the trials to performance and detection biases. The failure to blind participants is potentially more of problem for outcomes that rely on self report (such as pain) than more objective measures (such as passive knee ROM). Only eight of the 24 trials concealed allocation and nearly all trials were selective in their reporting of data. These potential sources of bias led to a downgrading of the quality of evidence for all outcomes reported in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> on the 'Risk of bias' criterion. Pain, manipulation under anaesthesia and participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness were further downgraded because the results across trials for these outcomes were inconsistent. Imprecision of the point estimates were considered a serious problem for two of the primary outcomes, namely participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness and manipulation under anaesthesia. Consequently, the findings for active knee flexion ROM, function and quality of life are based on moderate-quality evidence, the findings for pain and risk of adverse events are based on low-quality evidence, and the findings for participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness and manipulation under anaesthesia are based on very low-quality evidence. These limitations notwithstanding, the main findings are probably robust because bias tends to inflate estimates of effects (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Savovic-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Savovic 2012</LINK>), and most estimates of treatment effects in this systematic review were very small.</P>

<P>The main potential source of bias in the review process arises from failure to identify all relevant trials. This may have occurred, particularly if trials were unpublished.

<P>The original version of this systematic review was done in 2003. It was updated in 2010 and then again for this review in 2013. The main difference in conclusions between the original and the 2010 version related to length of hospital stay. In 2003, it was concluded that CPM reduces length of hospital stay. In the 2010 systematic review, it was concluded that CPM does not reduce length of hospital stay. However, in this present review it was concluded that the effects of CPM on length of hospital stay are inconclusive.</P>
<P>It is also worth noting that the original review performed in 2003 suggested that the effect of CPM on knee ROM may be dose dependent. Dose dependence was tested in the 2010 review and then again in this review by using a meta-regression to examine effects of mean total CPM time (hours) on passive knee flexion ROM in the short term. The results indicated that the response to CPM is not dose dependent.</P>
<P>Our findings are broadly consistent with the findings of similar systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Grella-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grella 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lenssen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenssen 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Dijk-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Dijk 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viswanathan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viswanathan 2010</LINK>). The only discrepancy is with the conclusions of Lenssen et al (<LINK REF="REF-Lenssen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenssen 2003b</LINK>). These authors concluded that CPM had a short-term effect on knee flexion ROM (MD 8 degrees; 95% CI -2 to 18) despite the considerable uncertainty around the estimate. The difference between our estimate and that of <LINK REF="REF-Lenssen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenssen 2003b</LINK> was probably due to differences in the trials included in the two meta-analyses. Our pooled estimate (MD 2 degrees, 95% CI 0 to 4) was based on 11 trials (697 participants) and the estimate of <LINK REF="REF-Lenssen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenssen 2003b</LINK> was based of five trials (317 participants). There was only one trial in common in the two meta-analyses due to differences in the inclusion criteria and year of the reviews.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews have investigated the effect of CPM following knee cartilage defect surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fazalare-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazalare 2010</LINK>), shoulder rotator cuff repair (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Plessis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Plessis 2011</LINK>), and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Lobb-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobb 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>). One review reported no evidence of benefit of CPM (<LINK REF="REF-Lobb-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobb 2012</LINK>), two concluded that there was insufficient evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Fazalare-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazalare 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2007</LINK>), and one reported two clinical trials that demonstrated a treatment effect on ROM but this conclusion was not clearly supported from the findings of the two cited trials (<LINK REF="REF-Du-Plessis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Du Plessis 2011</LINK>). While it is possible that the effects of CPM are different for various conditions, this would seem unlikely. Therefore, the results of the systematic reviews following different types of surgery lend further weight to the results of this systematic review indicating little if any benefit of CPM on at least knee ROM following TKA.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The findings of 24 RCTs of 1445 participants provide moderate-quality evidence that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on active knee flexion ROM or medium-term effects on function or quality of life. There is low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM does not have clinically important short-term effects on pain. The effects of CPM on participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, risk of manipulation, risk of adverse events, length of hospital stay, swelling and quadriceps strength remain unclear although there is very low-quality evidence to indicate that CPM reduces the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia.</P>

<P>The effects of continuous passive motion (CPM) on range of motion (ROM), pain, function and quality of life are too small to justify its use and costs but the effects of CPM on participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness are unclear. This review provides very low-quality evidence that CPM reduces the risk of manipulation under anaesthesia; however, these findings need to be interpreted with caution because they are inconsistent with the moderate-quality evidence indicating that CPM has no effect on knee ROM even though the main indication for manipulation under anaesthesia is joint stiffness.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-24 10:17:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Lisa A Harvey">
<P>Future trialists should strive to improve the quality and reporting of their trials. The use of concealed allocation and blinded assessors is particularly important for reducing bias. In addition, attention should be given to stating when CPM starts and finishes, how long it is applied for and what settings are used. The accuracy of future meta-analyses could also be substantially improved if trialists consistently reported between-group differences with associated measures of variability for all outcomes and at all time points of data collection. In addition, researchers should strive to agree upon a standardised CPM protocol and appropriate outcome measures. This is particularly important for function and quality of life because researchers are using numerous different outcome measures, which makes pooling of results problematic. However, and regardless, we would only suggest further research to verify the effect of CPM on the need for manipulation under anaesthesia. Trials designed for this purpose should consider restricting the inclusion criteria to people at high risk of requiring manipulation under anaesthesia and ensuring those making the decision about the need for manipulation are blinded.</P>
<P>We would not recommend trials to determine the effect of CPM on knee joint ROM even though the evidence about the futility of CPM for improving active knee flexion is only moderate. The evidence was only downgraded from high to moderate because of the susceptibility of the included trials to bias. However, bias tends to inflate estimates of treatment effectiveness. Therefore, the real estimate is probably even less that reported in this review. In addition, the findings from passive knee flexion, active knee extension and passive knee extension were no more encouraging. Therefore, resources should not be wasted on further investigating the effect of CPM on knee joint ROM. However, without an effect of CPM on knee joint ROM there is no readily understandable way that CPM could affect any other variable. CPM is primarily prescribed for knee joint ROM. This suggests that trials designed to attain better estimates of the effects of CPM on some of the other outcomes may also be futile.</P>
<P>However, if trialists want to be more confident about the evidence supporting the conclusions of this trial, then they could look at improving quantification of the effects of CPM on function and quality of life because the findings on these outcomes are only based on a small number of trials and the quality of evidence is only moderate. More importantly, however, future trialists should focus on determining the effect of CPM on the need for manipulation. It is very difficult to reconcile the suggestion that CPM decreases the need for manipulation when CPM has little effect on knee joint ROM. The apparent contradiction in findings could reflect the low-quality evidence supporting the findings on the decreased need for manipulation with CPM. Therefore, future trialists should pay particular attention to reducing bias.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review should only be updated if new evidence emerges that is likely to substantially change the conclusions of this review or shift the quality of evidence supporting the conclusions to high. However, it is unlikely that additional trials will change the conclusions about ROM because these estimates are reasonably precise and consistent, and we anticipate that with better quality trials the treatment effects will be smaller, not greater. If CPM does not affect knee joint ROM then it is most unlikely that CPM will affect any other outcomes because CPM is primarily prescribed on the basis of its benefits on knee joint ROM. With no effect on knee joint ROM, there are no obvious mechanisms for CPM to affect other outcomes. An update may, however, be justified if subsequent trials better clarify the effect of CPM on the need for manipulation.</P>

<P>The protocol was modified when the review was updated in 2010. The modifications were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>participants restricted to those with pre-surgery diagnosis of arthritis;</LI>
<LI>comparisons were changed from continuous passive motion (CPM) and physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone to CPM and standard postoperative care versus CPM and standard postoperative care with active or passive knee exercises;</LI>
<LI>updated methods based on current Cochrane Collaboration recommendations for risk of bias assessment, 'Summary of findings' table, and the updated Cochrane search filter for identifying randomised controlled trials;</LI>
<LI>endpoints were classified as short, medium and long term;</LI>
<LI>only one observation was extracted for each outcome within a particular endpoint (short, medium or long term);</LI>
<LI>in trials with more than two groups, only data from the two groups with the most contrasting interventions were extracted and used for analyses;</LI>
<LI>the comparisons were divided into primary and secondary comparisons;</LI>
<LI>pain outcomes were restricted to direct measures of pain intensity (e.g. visual analogue scale); data on pain medication were not extracted.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The protocol was modified when the review was updated in 2013. The modifications were:</P>
<OL>
<LI>missing standard deviations (SD) were not imputed. Instead, studies with missing SDs were removed from the analyses;</LI>
<LI>studies that stated that they reported outcomes but did not provide the data were included in the counts of studies that collected the outcomes; however, these studies were not included in the meta-analyses;</LI>
<LI>primary and secondary outcomes were changed and added on request of the Editorial Committee of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. It was requested that the original protocol be ignored and that the primary outcomes be changed to: active knee flexion, function, quality of life, participants' global assessment of treatment effectiveness, incidence of manipulation and adverse events. This necessitated adding outcomes that were not in the original protocol or the previous version of the review. It also required moving primary outcomes to secondary outcomes and vice versa;</LI>
<LI>only the primary outcomes were used in the 'Summary of findings' table. The choice between short, medium or long term were based on which ever had the most number of trials;</LI>
<LI>need for manipulation and adverse events were not categorised into short-, medium- or long-term effects. Instead, each of these outcomes were collated regardless of time of occurrence since randomisation.</LI>
