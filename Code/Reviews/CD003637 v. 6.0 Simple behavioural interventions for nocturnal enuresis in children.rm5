<TITLE>Simple treatments for bedwetting in children</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:17:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is the involuntary loss of urine at night without an underlying organic disease as the cause. It can result in issues of psychosocial well-being such as social problems, sibling teasing and lowered self esteem. It affects around 15% to 20% of five year olds and up to 2% of adults.</P>
<P>Simple behavioural strategies to help children gain control include star charts and other reward systems, fluid restriction, bladder training (including retention control training) and lifting or wakening. These are often used as a first attempt to control bedwetting and can be undertaken by families with less professional involvement.</P>
<P>The review found 16 trials which involved 1643 children. Most simple behavioural treatments were only studied in single small trials which makes the evidence less reliable. Simple treatments such as rewarding dry nights (e.g. with star charts), lifting and waking and bladder training appeared to be more effective than no treatment but they are not as effective when compared with other treatments known to work, such as enuresis alarm therapy and drug therapy. There does not appear to be one simple behavioural therapy that is more effective than another. On the other hand, simple treatments do not have any side effects or safety concerns. Therefore, simple methods could be tried as first line therapy before considering alarms or drugs for this common childhood condition.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:15:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15% to 20% of five year olds and up to 2% of adults. Although there is a high rate of spontaneous remission, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Behavioural interventions for treating bedwetting are defined as interventions that require a behaviour or action by the child which promotes night dryness and includes strategies which reward that behaviour. Behavioural interventions are further divided into:</P>
<P>(a) simple behavioural interventions - behaviours or actions that can be achieved by the child without great effort; and</P>
<P>(b) complex behavioural interventions - multiple behavioural interventions which require greater effort by the child and parents to achieve, including enuresis alarm therapy.</P>
<P>This review focuses on simple behavioural interventions.</P>
<P>Simple behavioural interventions are often used as a first attempt to improve nocturnal enuresis and include reward systems such as star charts given for dry nights, lifting or waking the children at night to urinate, retention control training to enlarge bladder capacity (bladder training) and fluid restriction. Other treatments such as medications, complementary and miscellaneous interventions such as acupuncture, complex behavioural interventions and enuresis alarm therapy are considered elsewhere.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:16:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the effects of simple behavioural interventions in children with nocturnal enuresis.</P>
<P>The following comparisons were made:<BR/>1. simple behavioural interventions versus no active treatment;<BR/>2. any single type of simple behavioural intervention versus another behavioural method (another simple behavioural intervention, enuresis alarm therapy or complex behavioural interventions);<BR/>3. simple behavioural interventions versus drug treatment alone (including placebo drugs) or drug treatment in combination with other interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-03 16:01:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 15 December 2011). The reference lists of relevant articles were also searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-04-11 00:48:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of simple behavioural interventions for treating nocturnal enuresis in children up to the age of 16. Studies which included children with daytime urinary incontinence or children with organic conditions were also included in this review if the focus of the study was on nocturnal enuresis. Trials focused solely on daytime wetting and trials of adults with nocturnal enuresis were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-27 04:13:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials and extracted data. Differences between reviewers were settled by discussion with a third reviewer.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:17:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 1643 children of whom 865 received a simple behavioural intervention. Within each comparison, outcomes were mostly addressed by single trials, precluding meta-analysis. The only exception was bladder training versus enuresis alarm therapy which included two studies and demonstrated that alarm therapy was superior to bladder training.</P>
<P>In single small trials, rewards, lifting and waking and bladder training were each associated with significantly fewer wet nights, higher full response rates and lower relapse rates compared to controls. Simple behavioural interventions appeared to be less effective when compared with other known effective interventions (such as enuresis alarm therapy and drug therapies with imipramine and amitriptyline). However, the effect was not sustained at follow-up after completion of treatment for the drug therapies. Based on one small trial, cognitive therapy also appeared to be more effective than rewards. When one simple behavioural therapy was compared with another, there did not appear to be one therapy that was more effective than another.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:17:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Simple behavioural methods may be superior to no active treatment but appear to be inferior to enuresis alarm therapy and some drug therapy (such as imipramine and amitriptyline). Simple behavioural therapies could be tried as first line treatment before considering enuresis alarm therapy or drug therapy, which may be more demanding and have adverse effects, although evidence supporting their efficacy is lacking.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:19:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is one of seven reviews of interventions for bedwetting or nocturnal enuresis. The others focus on: desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>), tricyclics and related drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), other drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Deshpande-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deshpande 2012</LINK>), alarms (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004d</LINK>), complex behavioural and educational interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004e</LINK>) and complementary and miscellaneous therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 2011</LINK>). This review is an update of previous updates by Glazener (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004f" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004f</LINK>) based on the original review by Lister-Sharp and her colleagues at the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York, UK (<LINK REF="REF-Lister_x002d_Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lister-Sharp 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the promotion by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) of using standardised nomenclature in paediatric continence research (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>) and the improved understanding about the pathophysiology of nocturnal enuresis, there has been an emphasis on classifying enuresis as either monosymptomatic or non-monosymptomatic. The ICCS has also defined initial and long term treatment success. Unfortunately, the older studies have usually not used these definitions (or were unclear about their definition of initial success). There were no studies that included a two-year follow-up; therefore, long term success could not be assessed.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:18:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is the intermittent involuntary loss of urine at night, in the absence of physical disease, at an age when a child could reasonably be expected to be dry (by consensus, at a developmental age of five years) (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). Nocturnal enuresis has a significant negative impact on the child's psychosocial well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Von-Gontard-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Von Gontard 2011a</LINK>). Children with nocturnal enuresis usually do not have daytime bladder symptoms and are deemed to have monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Between 10% to 28% of children who wet during sleep at night also have bladder problems during the day (including daytime wetting) (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>).These children are said to have non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). A total of 6.6% of children have combined daytime urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Sureshkumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sureshkumar 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although daytime urinary incontinence is a significant problem it is usually considered separately to nocturnal enuresis, as the aetiologies underlying the two conditions are thought to be different (<LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Physical causes such as structural abnormalities and functional disorders of the urinary tract, including overactive bladder syndrome or urinary tract infections, are more often found in children who also have daytime wetting (<LINK REF="REF-Jarvelin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarvelin 1990</LINK>). If daytime symptoms are present, investigations to identify physical (organic) causes such as urinary tract dysfunction, congenital malformation and neurogenic disorders are usually necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Djurhuus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djurhuus 1992</LINK>), with treatment initially focused on addressing the daytime urinary symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Hjalmas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hjalmas 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). Daytime urinary incontinence is considered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Sureshkumar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sureshkumar 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevalences and causes</HEADING>
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is common in children. Estimating its prevalence is difficult because there is variation in diagnostic criteria with very few studies using ICCS (International Children's Continence Society) definitions (<LINK REF="REF-De-Jonge-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Jonge 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krantz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krantz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neveus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neveus 2006</LINK>). The generally quoted prevalence rates are 15% to 20% of five year olds, 7% of seven year olds, 5% of ten year olds, 2% to 3% of teenagers and 0.5% to 2% of adults, with a spontaneous remission rate of 14% until adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bower-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hirasing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirasing 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yeung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yeung 2004</LINK>). The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is higher amongst children in residential care (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Butler proposed the conceptual model that nocturnal enuresis occurs when there is poor arousal from sleep in response to a sensation of a full bladder with overactivity of bladder function or excessive overnight urine production, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 2000</LINK>).

<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:19:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1. Simple behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Behavioural interventions assume that the ability to remain dry at night is a learned response which can be achieved using psychological conditioning techniques if dryness has not arisen spontaneously. These include fluid restriction, lifting, wakening, reward systems (e.g. star charts) and bladder training (including retention control training).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fluid restriction</HEADING>
<P>Fluid restriction (deprivation) before bedtime is a method frequently used by parents (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1977</LINK>). Fluid restriction reduces the total overnight urine production which reduces the child's need to void overnight. However, fluid restriction (particularly during the day) may reduce the bladder volume (<LINK REF="REF-Sorotzkin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorotzkin 1984</LINK>) and hence increase the chance of enuresis by reducing the ratio of bladder volume to overnight urine production. Even so, it might be useful to limit pre-bedtime fluid intake, particularly drinks with diuretic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Novello-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novello 1987</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lifting</HEADING>
<P>In 'lifting', carers pick up the child, while still asleep, from the bed to allow them to urinate in an appropriate place, reducing the likelihood of urinating in the bed. Usually lifting is done without a password. It has been argued that this practice is counterproductive as the child is encouraged to urinate without waking and is denied the opportunity to learn to recognise the sensation of a full bladder which may trigger arousal (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1994</LINK>). On the other hand, some suggest that lifting is effective, precluding the need for professional help (<LINK REF="REF-Shaffer-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaffer 1977</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Scheduled wakening</HEADING>
<P>Scheduled wakening involves waking the child to urinate during the night (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>), reducing the likelihood of urinating during sleep. A scheduled waking programme may be used with the child being woken progressively earlier after dry nights until the interval between going to bed and scheduled waking is one hour. Older individuals may use an alarm clock (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>), mobile phones or other forms of alarms to wake themselves. Lifting with a password is another form of waking where the child is woken 1.5 to 2 hours after falling asleep and asked a password to check whether they are awake before being taken to the toilet.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Star charts and other reward systems</HEADING>
<P>Star charts and other reward systems are behavioural interventions which use positive reinforcement to encourage a desired behaviour. The child is rewarded for attaining a goal, such as remaining dry all night or getting up to go to the toilet. These schemes should be negotiated with the child and family. The aim is to positively reinforce dry nights and to reduce the negative emphasis on wet beds. These are often the first type of treatments proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1975</LINK>). However, rewards for dry nights may be problematic because children may feel a failure if they try but cannot attain the goal despite trying their best (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bladder training and retention control training</HEADING>
<P>Retention control training (a form of bladder training) aims to increase the bladder capacity by using exercises such as delaying urination for extended periods of time during the day or drinking extra fluids (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>). Stream interruption exercises (pelvic floor muscle training, sphincter control exercises) are other forms of bladder training that are sometimes tried (<LINK REF="REF-Novello-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novello 1987</LINK>).</P>

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2. Other behavioural interventions (only included in this review if used in comparison arms)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Enuresis alarms</HEADING>
<P>Enuresis alarms consist of an alarm system which is triggered by micturition (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004d</LINK>). The first enuresis alarms were bed-based with the child sleeping on a pad or mat containing an electrical circuit. Urine coming into contact with the mat would cause an alarm to sound. The alarm is intended to train the child to recognise the sensation of having a full bladder and to either inhibit urination or waken to void (<LINK REF="REF-Forsythe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsythe 1989</LINK>). There are now many different types of enuresis alarms, including body worn alarms with sensors placed in the child's underwear. Alarms are now either wired or wireless and stimuli range from noises (buzzer, various sounds, voice) to vibration and light.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Over-learning with alarm training</HEADING>
<P>Over-learning is a reinforcement procedure which may be initiated after successful alarm treatment (e.g. after achievement of 14 consecutive dry nights). Extra drinks are given at bedtime to ensure that the bladder is full overnight causing the child to learn to wake to void. Alarm treatment is then continued until 14 consecutive dry nights are again achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Blackwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackwell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Young-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1972</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Complex behavioural and educational interventions</HEADING>
<P>Complex behavioural interventions include combinations of interventions and usually require greater effort by the child and parents or carers to achieve. These include Dry Bed Training and Full Spectrum Home Training (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004e</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Howe-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howe 1992</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dry Bed Training</HEADING>
<P>Dry Bed Training was initially developed in the early 1970s for use with people with learning disabilities (<LINK REF="REF-Azrin-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azrin 1973</LINK>). It aims to condition the child to wake to void. The original schedule involved an intensive training night, during which the person was woken every hour and taken to the toilet. If an accident occurred, 45 minutes of 'cleanliness training' (changing the bed) and 'positive practice' (practices of getting up and going to the toilet about nine times) was implemented. On subsequent nights, the individual was woken once and taken to the toilet, this nightly wakening occurring progressively earlier. Variants such as Modified Dry Bed Training forego the reprimands and positive practice elements (<LINK REF="REF-Butler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butler 1988</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Full Spectrum Home Training</HEADING>
<P>Full Spectrum Home Training (<LINK REF="REF-Houts-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houts 1983</LINK>) combines enuresis alarm training, cleanliness training, retention control training and over-learning procedures.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">3. Other managements for enuresis (only included in this review if used in comparison arms)</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Since psychotherapists consider enuresis to be a symptom rather than a condition in itself, the emphasis of treatment is on the "child's inner emotional disturbance" (<LINK REF="REF-Mishne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishne 1993</LINK>). Consequently, the intervention is aimed at addressing underlying psychological causative factors and modifying the environment which produced the symptom (<LINK REF="REF-Mishne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishne 1993</LINK>). Psychotherapy may be used in the management of children who have psychological problems in addition to enuresis, to address problems directly related to psychopathology (<LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1994</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">4. Drugs</HEADING>
<P>Pharmacological interventions are used to reduce nocturnal enuresis by reducing overnight urine production (e.g. desmopressin), reducing bladder overactivity (e.g. oxybutynin) or by other mechanisms. Placebo drugs have been used to compare with other interventions to test their effectiveness. Drugs that have been compared with simple behavioural interventions include desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>), tricyclic drugs (amitriptyline or imipramine) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>), drugs other than desmopressin and tricyclics (e.g. oxybutynin) (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004c</LINK>) and placebo.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:19:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nocturnal enuresis is common in children. Although nocturnal enuresis in itself is pathologically benign, it is socially and emotionally stigmatising and can affect the self esteem, peer relationships and educational opportunities of sufferers. It can be inconvenient and distressing to both the child and their family (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzwater-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzwater 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morison 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redsell-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redsell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theunis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theunis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Warzak-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warzak 1993</LINK>). Although many different interventions have been tried for treating nocturnal enuresis, the relative effectiveness of each remains uncertain. Simple behavioural interventions are often the first interventions tried by parents or carers at home with minimal professional involvement. Therefore, it is important to identify effective interventions because successful treatment of nocturnal enuresis can result in improvement in health, self esteem and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglof-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglof 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Most interventions were addressed by either single trials, single arms in multi-intervention trials or had data for a particular outcome in only a single trial.

<P>Bladder training was not as effective as enuresis alarm therapy based on fewer wet nights at the end of treatment with alarms (MD 2.25, 95% CI 0.30 to 4.20, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.2) (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>), fewer children not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment with alarms (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.26, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.1)(<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>) and fewer wet nights after completion of treatment with alarms (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>.1)(<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK> trial also reported fewer wet nights at the end of treatment with alarm therapy, but no test of significance could be applied as SDs were not given. Bladder training did not provide any additional benefit to alarm therapy: there was no statistically significant difference in numbers of children not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment for bladder training combined with enuresis alarm therapy (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.50 to 6.23, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.2) (<LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>) or bladder volume alarm (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.83, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Pretlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pretlow 1999</LINK>) but the trials were small and the confidence intervals were wide. Therefore, alarm training does appear to be more effective than bladder training, with no apparent additional benefits for bladder training when added to enuresis or bladder volume alarm therapy.</P>
<P>When reward treatment was compared with cognitive therapy, there was no statistically significant difference in mean wet nights at the end of treatment (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.29 to 1.83, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.3). However, the numbers not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.30, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.6) and the number failed or relapsed after completion of treatment was lower (better) for cognitive therapy compared to rewards alone (RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.11 to 10.59, <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1995</LINK>) suggesting that cognitive therapy may be superior to rewards.</P>
<P>When reward treatment was compared with enuresis alarm therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1995</LINK>), no statistically significant difference in mean wet nights at the end of treatment was demonstrated (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.65 to 2.05, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.4).

<P>When random waking was compared with enuresis alarm therapy using a continuous signal (conventional) alarm, there was no difference in mean wet nights (MD 0.33, 95% CI -1.23 to 1.89, <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.5) (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>) and <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>.3 (<LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>) where no test of significance could be applied as SDs were not given), and number not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.55, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.8) (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>).

<P>When bladder training plus placebo drug was compared with a placebo drug alone (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>), there was no difference in number not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.6). When bladder training plus placebo was compared with oxybutynin (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>), there was no difference in number not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.30, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.5). When bladder training plus placebo was compared with bladder training plus oxybutynin (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>), there was no difference in number not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.23, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.7).</P>
<P>When bladder training was compared with desmopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Hamano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hamano 2000</LINK>), there was no difference in mean wet nights (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.20, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.2) and number not achieving 14 dry nights (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.62, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.4) at the end of treatment. Nor was there a difference after treatment stopped, largely because most children who were cured while using desmopressin relapsed once the drug was stopped (number failed or relapsed after completion of treatment (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>.5)).</P>
<P>When waking was compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>), there was no difference in mean wet nights (MD -0.99, 95% CI -2.54 to 0.56, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.1), and number not achieving 14 dry nights (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.64, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.1) at the end of treatment. In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>) the numbers were too small to determine whether waking was superior to placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>.1) and no test of significance could be applied as SDs were not given.</P>
<P>When waking plus reward plus placebo drug was compared with amitriptyline (<LINK REF="STD-Mehrotra-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrotra 1980</LINK>), amitriptyline appeared to be more effective with lower numbers not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 2.83, 95% CI 1.42 to 5.67, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.2). However, there was no significant difference in the number who failed or relapsed after completion of treatment (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.49, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>.1). When waking plus reward plus placebo was compared with waking plus reward plus amitriptyline, the addition of amitriptyline was just superior to the behavioural therapy alone, with a lower number not achieving 14 dry nights at the end of treatment (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.39, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.3). However, the number who failed or relapsed after completion of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.43, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>.2) was not statistically different. This suggests that the amitriptyline may be effective during treatment but has no sustained effect after stopping treatment .</P>
<P>When random waking was compared with imipramine, or imipramine combined with alarm therapy, although the mean number of wet nights was lower for imipramine or imipramine combined with alarm therapy (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>.2 and <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>.3, respectively), the numbers were small and no test of significance could be applied as SDs were not given (<LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>When fluid restriction and avoidance of punishment was compared to imipramine (either alone or in combination with fluid restriction and avoidance of punishment), the addition of imipramine appears to be superior with lower numbers of those who failed or relapsed after completion of treatment (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.57, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>.3 and RR 8.00, 95% CI 2.11 to 30.34, <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>.4, respectively) (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1990</LINK>). Therefore, the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and amitriptyline alone or in combination with simple behavioural interventions appeared to be superior to simple behavioural interventions alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There were no reported adverse effects directly caused by simple behavioural interventions. Eight trials mentioned adverse events but only five specifically mentioned adverse events for individual interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Anany-1999" TYPE="STUDY">El-Anany 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hamano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrotra-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrotra 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2008</LINK>). The main adverse events, leading to the high dropout rate, were: failure of the treatment because it was too demanding of the children or their families (<LINK REF="STD-Pretlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pretlow 1999</LINK>); because it led to family strife (<LINK REF="STD-Pretlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pretlow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>); or emotional problems (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1969</LINK>); or simply because it did not work (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Anany-1999" TYPE="STUDY">El-Anany 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConaghy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">McConaghy 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pretlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pretlow 1999</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison with no active treatment</HEADING>
<P>Simple behavioural interventions generally appeared to be more effective than no active treatment. Rewards for dry nights with or without lifting or waking appeared to be more effective (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dommelen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dommelen 2009</LINK>), but each finding was based on single, small trials. Bladder training (retention control training) also appeared to be more effective than no active treatment, although the studies were too small and of low methodological quality to provide useful information (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1977</LINK>). These interventions are widely used by families as first line treatment. The role of lifting is more controversial because of concerns that it encourages the child to pass urine whilst asleep, thus preventing their learning to wake to the sensation of a full bladder, even if there may be more instances of dry nights. In one study, lifting without a password (but not lifting with a password) was superior to no active treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Dommelen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dommelen 2009</LINK>). One explanation for the failure of lifting with a password (compared with the success of lifting without a password) may be related to increased tiredness in the child caused by their trying to remember the password which may affect their treatment response.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison with other behavioural interventions</HEADING>
<P>Enuresis alarm therapy was more effective than bladder training (retention control training) for treating nocturnal enuresis (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>), with no additional benefit when bladder training was combined with alarm therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pretlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pretlow 1999</LINK>). Cognitive therapy also appeared to be more effective than rewards in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1995</LINK>). In the other studies of behavioural interventions, no single behavioural intervention was more effective than any other behavioural intervention, with no differences between alarm therapy and rewards, lifting or waking or combination of rewards and waking, or between rewards and various forms of lifting or waking or between bladder training and dry bed training.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison with drugs</HEADING>
<P>Four of the six trials which included a drug arm were conducted over 20 years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrotra-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrotra 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Turner-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Turner 1970</LINK>) before the recognition of the effectiveness of desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>), tricyclic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>) and enuresis alarms (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004d</LINK>) for treating nocturnal enuresis.</P>
<P>The tricyclics amitriptyline and imipramine were compared with simple behavioural therapies and appeared to be more effective than simple behavioural therapies such as waking, lifting, rewards, fluid restriction or avoidance of punishment, either alone or in combination (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrotra-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrotra 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no difference demonstrated between bladder training and desmopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Hamano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hamano 2000</LINK>), oxybutynin or placebo, either alone or in combination with bladder training (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Hoeck-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Hoeck 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the tricyclics appeared to be more effective than some simple behavioural therapies, the potential adverse effects of the tricyclics needs to be considered. The main problems with many of the simple behavioural interventions were the high dropout and non-compliance rates as families found themdifficult and found the waking at night to attend to the child disruptive and stressful.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 16 trials comparing various simple behavioural strategies for treating nocturnal enuresis, involving 1643 participants. Simple behavioural therapies are generally more effective than no treatment but inferior to proven effective treatments such as alarm training and tricyclics. As most trials are small and of poor methodological quality, care needs to be taken with interpretation of the results.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of the 16 included trials was low. Of the nine trials which reported means of continuous outcomes, five failed to provide SDs (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fournier-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Fournier 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1977</LINK>). The sample sizes were small for most studies. The only combination of interventions that could be meta-analysed was bladder training versus enuresis alarm therapy. In the other comparisons outcomes were reported for single trials only, precluding meta-analysis. The confidence intervals are wide and this is likely to obscure or overestimate treatment effects. Only ten of the 16 studies gave information about the follow-up results after the intervention was finished (<LINK REF="STD-Bennett-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bryant-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bryant 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Anany-1999" TYPE="STUDY">El-Anany 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fava-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Fava 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fielding-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Fielding 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hamano-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hamano 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehrotra-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Mehrotra 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ronen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ronen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Dommelen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Van Dommelen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most included trials either had high risks of bias or had insufficient information to judge the level of risk. Thirteen of the 16 trials did not provide information about the method used to generate the allocation sequence, blinding was usually not possible for simple behavioural therapies, most studies had high attrition rates, with 10 of the studies not using intention-to-treat analysis or imputation methods to deal with the high loss to follow up.</P>
<P>Other potential biases included not providing adequate baseline or background information about the participants, inclusion of children with organic causes of wetting or daytime urinary incontinence (who may respond differently to the interventions) and failure to report details of adverse reactions.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the studies did not provide adequate detail to allow the reviewers to assess the adequacy of the quality of the study. Therefore, subjective judgement was sometimes made by the reviewers based on the scant information provided.</P>
<P>As there was no clear definition of what is a "simple behavioural intervention" for treating nocturnal enuresis, the reviewers had to make a subjective judgement. It could be argued that some of the included interventions should be classified as a complex behavioural intervention.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this study are consistent with the other reviews of nocturnal enuresis, showing superiority of proven effective treatments such as enuresis alarm therapy and tricyclic antidepressants over simple behavioural therapies. However, there was no difference found between desmopressin and simple behavioural therapies: this may have been caused by the inclusion of only one small, low quality study of desmopressin versus bladder training (a simple behavioural therapy which did not appear to be effective when compared with other active treatments).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Simple behavioural interventions are commonly used by families for treating nocturnal enuresis. However, other proven effective therapies such as enuresis alarm therapy and tricyclic antidepressants were found to be more effective than simple behavioural interventions. Although desmopressin had been proven to be an effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis in other reviews, there were limited trials comparing desmopressin with simple behavioural therapies. The findings from this review should be interpreted cautiously due to the poor quality and small sizes of the trials. Nevertheless, rewards, bladder training and lifting or waking could initially be tried as such methods are safe and are better than doing nothing. However, they require a high level of parental involvement which can sometimes be stressful. Their main benefit may be to encourage a positive attitude to dry nights rather than blame and punishment for wetting.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-15 15:23:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These tentative findings need to be tested in rigorous trials against other proven methods such as desmopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004a</LINK>), tricyclics (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004b</LINK>) and alarms (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004d</LINK>) or as an adjunct to these other therapies. Future trials should clearly distinguish children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and those with non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and exclude physical (organic) causes of wetting. There needs to be adequate assessment of baseline wetting and change in wetting for each intervention.</P>
<P>The difficulty in comparing interventions is exacerbated by the lack of uniformity in outcome measures used. In our view, these should include: the mean number of wet nights at the completion of treatment and at follow-up after the end of treatment (at six months and two years, consistent with ICCS definitions); the number failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of the treatment period; adverse events; acceptability of treatment; compliance; and relapse rates after treatment has stopped. Economic analysis of costs both to the health service and families should be included.</P>
<P>Not all interventions are suitable for all children. Further research is needed to determine which interventions are appropriate for which groups and why. It should include formal testing to identify pre-treatment factors which might determine or modify treatment effects. Important factors include age, presence of daytime wetting and family circumstances. It is important to be able to compare interventions in different populations (e.g. in primary care) and for different purposes (e.g. a short-term measure to cover nights away from home), in order to inform choice of treatment.</P>

<P>The original protocol of this review included physical interventions. There were no physical interventions identified in the previous versions of this review and we identified two studies of physical interventions in the updated search (<LINK REF="STD-But-2006" TYPE="STUDY">But 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reed-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reed 1993</LINK>) which we felt were more suitable to the complementary and miscellaneous intervention review as these studies are quite distinct from the other simple behavioural interventions. Therefore, the authors have decided to exclude physical interventions from this review and from the title of this review.</P>
