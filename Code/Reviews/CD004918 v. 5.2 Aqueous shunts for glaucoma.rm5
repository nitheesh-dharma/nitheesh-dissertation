<TITLE>Aqueous shunts for glaucoma</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-27 10:09:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>
<B>What was the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>We aimed to learn:<BR/>1. how successful and safe aqueous shunts are for lowering eye pressure when compared with standard surgery (trabeculectomy);<BR/>2. how successful and safe various types of aqueous shunts are when compared with each other; and<BR/>3. how successful and safe aqueous shunts are when the procedure is modified.</P>
<P>Our search for relevant studies identified 27 trials.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>It is uncertain if aqueous shunts are more effective or are safer than standard surgery (trabeculectomy) for glaucoma (very low-certainty evidence). The Baerveldt and Molteno aqueous shunts may reduce eye pressure more than the Ahmed shunt (moderate- and low-certainty evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>What did we study in this review?</B>
<BR/>Glaucoma is a condition caused by the build-up of fluid in the front part of the eye. This build-up of fluid raises the eye pressure, which can lead to damage of the optic nerve and vision loss. Some people with glaucoma need surgery to reduce eye pressure. Standard surgery is called trabeculectomy. In trabeculectomy, a small hole is made to the tissue in the front of the eye to create a drain for the fluid. Alternatively, a small implant called an aqueous shunt can be inserted into the eye to create a pathway for fluid to drain.</P>
<P>
<B>What were the main results of this review?</B>
<BR/>We found 27 studies. Four studies compared an aqueous shunt (either Ahmed or Baerveldt) with standard surgery (trabeculectomy). Five trials compared two different types of shunt (Ahmed versus Baerveldt, Ahmed versus Molteno, Molteno versus Schocket). Eighteen studies compared modifications to aqueous shunts.</P>
<P>The results of the review were as follows.<BR/>1. The evidence comparing aqueous shunts with trabeculectomy was of very low-certainty.<BR/>2. There were some differences between different implants: the Baerveldt and Molteno implants may work better than the Ahmed implant; eye pressure was reduced more and fewer antiglaucoma medications were needed (moderate- and low-certainty evidence). The Molteno implant may work better than the Schocket implant (low-certainty evidence on eye pressure only).<BR/>3. Although 18 trials looked at modifications to aqueous shunts, many different modifications were studied, and the evidence was inconclusive.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
<BR/>We searched for studies that had been published up to 15 August 2016.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:18:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 27 trials with a total of 2099 participants with mixed diagnoses and comparisons of interventions. Seventeen studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and seven reported adequate allocation concealment. Data collection and follow-up times varied.</P>
<P>Four trials compared an aqueous shunt (Ahmed or Baerveldt) with trabeculectomy, of which three reported one-year outcomes. At one-year, the difference in IOP between aqueous shunt groups and trabeculectomy groups was uncertain (mean difference (MD) 2.55 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.78 to 5.87; 380 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The difference in logMAR visual acuity was also uncertain (MD 0.12 units, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.31; 380 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In two trials, the difference in visual field score was uncertain (MD -0.25, 95% CI -1.91 to 1.40; 196 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The mean number of antiglaucoma medications was higher in the aqueous shunt group than the trabeculectomy group in one trial (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.12; 184 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effect on needing additional glaucoma surgery was uncertain between groups in two trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.36; 329 participants; very low-certainty evidence). In one trial, fewer total adverse events were reported in the aqueous shunt group than the trabeculectomy group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81; 212 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported quality-of-life outcomes at one-year follow-up.</P>
<P>Two trials that compared the Ahmed implant with the Baerveldt implant for glaucoma found higher mean IOP in the Ahmed group at one-year follow-up (MD 2.60 mmHg, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.62; 464 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The difference in logMAR visual acuity was uncertain between groups (MD -0.07 units, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.13; 501 participants; low-certainty evidence). The MD in number of antiglaucoma medications was within one between groups (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.59; 464 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). More participants in the Ahmed group required additional glaucoma surgery than the Baerveldt group (RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.02 to 7.54; 514 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The two trials reported specific adverse events but not overall number of adverse events. Neither trial reported visual field or quality-of-life outcomes at one-year follow-up.</P>
<P>One trial compared the Ahmed implant with the Molteno implant for glaucoma over two-year follow-up. Mean IOP was higher in the Ahmed group than the Molteno group (MD 1.64 mmHg, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 57 participants; low-certainty evidence). The differences in logMAR visual acuity (MD 0.08 units, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.40; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and mean deviation in visual field (MD -0.18 dB, 95% CI -3.13 to 2.77; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence) were uncertain between groups. The mean number of antiglaucoma medications was also uncertain between groups (MD -0.38, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.27; 57 participants; low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report the proportion needing additional glaucoma surgery, total adverse events, or quality-of-life outcomes.</P>
<P>Two trials compared the double-plate Molteno implant with the Schocket shunt for glaucoma; one trial reported outcomes only at six-month follow-up, and the other did not specify the follow-up time. At six-months, mean IOP was lower in the Molteno group than the Schocket group (MD -2.50 mmHg, 95% CI -4.60 to -0.40; 115 participants; low-certainty evidence). Neither trial reported the proportion needing additional glaucoma surgery, total adverse events, or visual acuity, visual field, or quality-of-life outcomes.</P>
<P>The remaining 18 trials evaluated modifications to aqueous shunts, including 14 trials of Ahmed implants (early aqueous suppression versus standard medication regimen, 2 trials; anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent versus none, 4 trials; corticosteroids versus none, 2 trials; shunt augmentation versus none, 3 trials; partial tube ligation versus none, 1 trial; pars plana implantation versus conventional implantation, 1 trial; and model M4 versus model S2,1 trial); 1 trial of 500 mm<SUP>2</SUP> Baerveldt versus 350 mm<SUP>2</SUP> Baerveldt; and 3 trials of Molteno implants (single-plate with oral corticosteroids versus single-plate without oral corticosteroids, 1 trial; double-plate versus single-plate, 1 trial; and pressure-ridge versus double-plate with tube ligation, 1 trial).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-24 15:05:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Information was insufficient to conclude whether there are differences between aqueous shunts and trabeculectomy for glaucoma treatment. While the Baerveldt implant may lower IOP more than the Ahmed implant, the evidence was of moderate-certainty and it is unclear whether the difference in IOP reduction is clinically significant. Overall, methodology and data quality among existing randomized controlled trials of aqueous shunts was heterogeneous across studies, and there are no well-justified or widely accepted generalizations about the superiority of one surgical procedure or device over another.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-11 20:06:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-11 02:33:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glaucoma is an important cause of chronic visual loss and the second-leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is estimated that there will be 79.6 million people with glaucoma worldwide by the year 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2006</LINK>). Glaucoma is characterized by a chronic progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic patterns of visual field loss, and it is diagnosed by a combination of features of the ophthalmological examination and ancillary testing. The visual field loss from glaucoma leads to eventual blindness if left untreated (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>). Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a central risk factor for glaucoma. Additional risk factors include older age, African-American ethnicity, family history of glaucoma, low ocular perfusion pressure, myopia, and diabetes mellitus. Studies have demonstrated that lowering IOP decreases the risk of visual loss in glaucoma and prevents the eventual loss of functional vision (<LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CNTGSG-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CNTGSG 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heijl-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijl 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leske-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leske 2003</LINK>). Accordingly, several mainstays of treatment for glaucoma, which include medications, lasers, and surgery, are targeted at lowering IOP.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-11 19:57:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Aqueous shunts are employed as surgical interventions to control IOP in people with advanced glaucoma who fail standard surgery with trabeculectomy, or in people with glaucoma subtypes where trabeculectomy is unlikely to succeed (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>). All aqueous shunts considered in this review are composed of a lumened silicone rubber tube attached to an explant plate. The Molteno implant was the first widely utilized aqueous shunt (<LINK REF="REF-Molteno-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteno 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molteno-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteno 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molteno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteno 2003</LINK>). Newer shunts such as the Ahmed and Baerveldt implants have features in common with the Molteno, but vary in size, shape, composition, and the presence or absence of flow-restricting devices for IOP regulation (<LINK REF="REF-Prata-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prata 1996</LINK>). The Ahmed implant is available in either rigid (polymethylmethracylate) or flexible (silicone rubber) versions in one or two plate models, and contains a flow-restricting valve designed to prevent postoperative hypotony (<LINK REF="REF-Huang-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huang 1999</LINK>). It has been suggested that silicone Ahmed implants may be associated with more effective IOP control but a potentially higher rate of complications compared with polymethylmethracylate implants (<LINK REF="STD-Law-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Law 2005</LINK>). The Baerveldt implant consists of a single plate without a flow-restricting mechanism; intraoperative tube ligation is thus required for formation of a mature space for fluid absorption (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krishna-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishna 2001</LINK>). The Schocket shunt, assembled intraoperatively, utilizes retinal buckling elements and a segment of silicone rubber tubing, and is similar to commercially available devices (<LINK REF="REF-Schocket-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schocket 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sidoti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sidoti 1994</LINK>). The OptiMed, White shunt pump, Joseph implant, and Krupin valve are not in current use.</P>
<P>Ab-interno procedures that do not require scleral dissection, such as trabectome or implantation of the iStent (Glaukos Corp., Laguna Hills, CA), are not covered under the scope of this review. Modified trabeculectomies in which devices are used to control outflow or to modify healing and promote continued drainage from the anterior chamber are not considered aqueous shunts for the purposes of this review. A separate Cochrane review identified low-certainty evidence suggesting that these devices used with standard trabeculectomies may help reduce IOP (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2015</LINK>). Examples of these modified trabeculectomies include the EX-PRESS shunt, Ologen implant, SKgel implant, and T-flux implant. This review also did not discuss current exploration of aqueous drainage into the suprachoroidal space, such as with the Gold Shunt (SOLX Inc., Boston, MA) or the CyPass shunt (Transcend Medical, Menlo Park, CA).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The use of aqueous shunts is increasing. A study of Medicare fee-for-service data reported that the number of aqueous shunt procedures in Medicare increased 184% from 2728 procedures in 1995 to 7744 procedures in 2004. Conversely, the number of trabeculectomies decreased 53% from 51,690 procedures in 1995 to 24,178 procedures in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Ramulu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramulu 2007</LINK>). Additionally, surveys of members of the American Glaucoma Society found that in eight clinical situations (previous failed trabeculectomy, previous intra- or extracapsular cataract extraction, previous phacoemulsification, previous penetrating keratoplasty, previous scleral buckle, previous pars plana vitrectomy, uveitic glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma), aqueous shunts were the primary surgical choice to lower IOP for 17.5% of members in 1996 versus for 50.6% of members in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joshi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 2005</LINK>). There are no data tracking the utilization patterns of aqueous shunts with regard to age, sex, or race, but it has been suggested that they will be applied increasingly to complex glaucomas and for combined procedures at an earlier stage among patients of all ages and races (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2002</LINK>). Commercially available aqueous shunts cost between USD 400 and USD 600, in addition to surgeon fees and other costs associated with surgery.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Indications for use</HEADING>
<P>In the USA, the majority of adult eyes in which aqueous shunts are currently used are pseudophakic (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minckler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 1988</LINK>), though small-incision cataract surgery has been performed in eyes with pre-existing aqueous shunts with maintenance of IOP control (<LINK REF="REF-Gujral-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gujral 2005</LINK>). Aqueous shunts are mainly recommended for people with advanced glaucoma for whom trabeculectomy has failed, and for neovascular, post-traumatic, and inflammatory glaucomas where trabeculectomy is likely to fail (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO 2010</LINK>). Additionally, they are used in congenital glaucomas that fail goniotomy or trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Djodeyre-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djodeyre 2001</LINK>), and they have been demonstrated retrospectively to have moderate long-term success in pediatric patients with both one and two shunts (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ou-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ou 2009</LINK>). Aqueous shunts are also used to manage glaucoma in complex cases where penetrating keratoplasty and retina-vitreous surgery may be simultaneously or serially performed (<LINK REF="REF-Lloyd-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lloyd 1989</LINK>). Aqueous shunts may be preferable to trabeculectomy with adjunctive antifibrotic agents in people who work in dusty or dirty environments or who require contact lenses for functional vision or in those who are immunocompromised, as the risk of late infection may be less.</P>
<P>Flow-restricted devices (Ahmed, Krupin, White shunt pump, Joseph implant, OptiMed) have typically been installed in one stage (complete installation) with immediate function. Non-flow-restricted devices (Molteno, Baerveldt) are typically installed with utilization of a variety of temporary flow-restricting techniques. With all of these devices, the location of anterior edge of the explant plate depends on the quadrant in which the device is implanted (<LINK REF="REF-Minckler-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prata-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prata 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prata-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prata 1995b</LINK>). The delay in the opening of the non-flow-restricted shunts is designed to allow encapsulation to develop over the explant before flow of aqueous humor begins in order to reduce the risk of postoperative hypotony, but this delay can create difficulties with IOP control while encapsulation is developing.</P>

<P>Aqueous shunts may prevent or delay blindness and visual disability in eyes with advanced or complicated glaucomas. Aqueous shunts are currently the standard of care in the USA for complicated glaucomas, especially in pseudophakic eyes that have failed one or more previous trabeculectomies. The long-term outcome for aqueous shunts has not been well studied, but some reports indicate that IOP control benefits may extend for several decades (<LINK REF="REF-Molteno-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteno 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molteno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteno 2003</LINK>). In general, the failure rates per year parallel those of trabeculectomy in similar cases (<LINK REF="REF-FFSSG-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FFSSG 1996</LINK>), though trabeculectomy may be more effective when lower IOP levels are needed (<LINK REF="STD-Tran-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tran 2009</LINK>). A previous case control study suggested that Ahmed and Baerveldt implants may have similar efficacy for glaucoma treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Syed-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Syed 2004</LINK>), though aqueous shunts may be more likely to fail overall in people with a history of glaucoma surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Souza-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Souza 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The principal long-term complication of anterior chamber aqueous shunts is corneal endothelial decompensation. Postoperative hypotony also can occur, likely due to leaking around the tube in limbal tissues or failure of flow-restricting devices to maintain sufficient resistance. Several reports have described a postoperative hypertensive phase that necessitates resumption of topical antiglaucoma medications for many weeks, though it has been suggested that early initiation of postoperative aqueous suppression may improve long-term IOP control (<LINK REF="STD-Law-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Law 2016</LINK>). Postoperative dynamic movement of the Ahmed valve has also been reported and is likely due to long-term dissociation of the fibrovascular capsule and the valve plate from rotation of the globe (<LINK REF="REF-Law-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Law 2009</LINK>). Clinical failure is in many cases due to excessive fibrosis and relative impermeability of the capsule around the explant. Comorbidities, which include optic nerve injury, corneal disease, or other damage related to past trauma or previous surgery, are frequently present in eyes in which shunts are employed. Aqueous shunts likely increase the risk of endothelial failure, and they are widely thought to increase the risk of graft failure after penetrating keratoplasty, especially with the drainage tube installed in the anterior chamber (<LINK REF="REF-Hollander-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollander 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-11 20:06:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since the publication of the original Cochrane review of aqueous shunts in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Minckler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 2006</LINK>), multiple randomized trials have been conducted examining the effectiveness of aqueous shunts versus trabeculectomy and of Ahmed versus Baerveldt implants for glaucoma management. Most surgeons in the USA reserve aqueous shunts until one or more standard procedures have failed, and controversy persists regarding when aqueous shunts should be used in the sequence of glaucoma surgeries as well as the effectiveness of different aqueous shunts. The importance of aqueous shunts has grown substantially in the last few decades in many areas of the world as lifespan has increased and larger numbers of people with advanced glaucoma require vision-sustaining therapies beyond traditional medical and surgical treatments.</P>

<P>All but one trial measured mean IOP at baseline and at varying time points of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Heuer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heuer 1992</LINK>). Nineteen trials had IOP threshold criteria, though none of these trials used the threshold definitions that were specified a priori in this review. As no study reported the mean change in IOP from baseline with standard deviations, we did not compare mean change in IOP from baseline as a continuous IOP outcome in this review.

<P>Mean differences in IOP at time points of 6 months, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years are also summarized in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> used two definitions for IOP success. Complete success was defined as IOP &gt; 5 mmHg and &#8804; 21 mmHg, reduced by at least 20% on two consecutive visits after three months, with no supplemental glaucoma medication, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision. Qualified success was defined as the same but with supplemental glaucoma medication. At all three time points, results favored the trabeculectomy group for complete success and the Baerveldt implant group for at least qualified-success outcomes. IOP threshold outcomes at one, three, and five years are summarized in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, and <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>, respectively.</P>

In participants with previous cataract surgery at five years' follow-up, the rates for complete success and qualified success were 26% and 48%, respectively, in the Baerveldt implant group and 15% and 26%, respectively, in the trabeculectomy group. In participants with previous trabeculectomy at five years' follow-up, the rates for complete success and qualified success were 0% and 46%, respectively, in the Baerveldt implant group and 29% and 29%, respectively, in the trabeculectomy group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-21 04:35:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials of aqueous shunts for glaucoma. The 27 studies included in this review involved a wide variety of participants, interventions, and outcome measures related to the surgical management of glaucoma.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of aqueous shunts versus trabeculectomy</HEADING>
<P>Four trials compared Ahmed or Baerveldt aqueous shunts with trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Pakravan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pakravan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2003</LINK>). Very low-certainty evidence from three trials with one-year follow-up showed that IOP was higher in the aqueous shunt groups than in the trabeculectomy groups. Due to a high amount of statistical imprecision, potential risks of bias, and heterogeneity among trials, we could draw no conclusive findings for this comparison based on the outcomes of our review. The question of the effectiveness of aqueous shunts versus trabeculectomy for glaucoma management has not been clearly resolved, especially in terms of outcomes relevant to patients such as preservation of vision and reduction of glaucoma medication use. After the completion of this review, the TVT study published quality of life outcomes; these findings were not included in the present version of this review but will be included in the five-year review update.</P>
<P>An important consideration in this area of study is the use of mitomycin C (MMC). In two trials comparing the Ahmed implant with trabeculectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 2003</LINK>), MMC was used at the discretion of the surgeon. Participants who did not receive MMC may have had different underlying risks compared with participants who received MMC. In another trial, the Baerveldt implant was compared with trabeculectomy plus MMC (<LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK>). A disproportionate number of participants in the trabeculectomy plus MMC group were classified as failures due to hypotony (31% in the trabeculectomy group versus 13% in the tube group), which may have been related to the higher dose and longer duration of MMC usage in the <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> study (0.4 mg/mL for 4 minutes) compared with other clinical settings (<LINK REF="REF-Caprioli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caprioli 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fontana-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontana 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fontana-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontana 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zahid-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahid 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>A notable finding was the high proportion of participants with persistent diplopia in the Baerveldt group compared with the proportion with diplopia in the trabeculectomy group at all three time points of follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> study. In the Baerveldt group, the proportion of participants with diplopia after Baerveldt implantation in the <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> study was lower than the proportion of participants with diplopia after Baerveldt implantation in the <LINK REF="STD-ABC-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2011</LINK> study and higher than the proportion in the <LINK REF="STD-AVB-2011" TYPE="STUDY">AVB 2011</LINK> study. Rates of diplopia after Baerveldt implantation in retrospective studies have varied widely, however no previous trials other than <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> have compared the risk of diplopia in participants with tube shunt implantation versus trabeculectomy. The large discrepancy in diplopia risk between the Baerveldt and trabeculectomy groups in the <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK> study is concerning and suggests that caution should be taken to avoid this serious complication.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of aqueous shunts to each other</HEADING>
<P>A meta-analysis of two trials suggests that the Baerveldt implant achieved greater IOP reduction at one year compared with the Ahmed implant (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-AVB-2011" TYPE="STUDY">AVB 2011</LINK>), though it is unclear whether the 2 to 4 mmHg mean difference in IOP is clinically significant. Any difference between the two shunts was uncertain in terms of visual acuity outcomes. The Ahmed group had a higher proportion of participants who required reoperation to control glaucoma progression; the mean difference in the number of antiglaucoma medications was less than one between groups. There were similar rates of all complications in both groups including hypotony maculopathy and postoperative motility disturbances, however the number of events was small and therefore the imprecision of results was high. Based on the findings from the <LINK REF="STD-ABC-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ABC 2011</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-AVB-2011" TYPE="STUDY">AVB 2011</LINK> studies, there is some evidence that the Baerveldt shunt may provide more IOP reduction and less risk of reoperation than the Ahmed shunt. After the completion of this review, the AVB study published five year treatment outcomes; these findings were not included in the present version of this review but will be included in the five-year review update.</P>
<P>One trial compared the Ahmed implant to the single-plate Molteno implant for glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Nassiri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nassiri 2010</LINK>). Low-certainty evidence suggests that the Ahmed shunt, when compared with the Molteno shunt, provides less IOP reduction, but it was unclear whether the 1 to 3 mmHg mean difference in IOP is clinically significant. <LINK REF="STD-Nassiri-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nassiri 2010</LINK> was one of the few included studies that reported visual field outcomes, though these outcomes may not be meaningful with only 24 months of follow-up. Based on this trial, it was unclear if either implant demonstrated superiority for the management of glaucoma.</P>
<P>Two studies compared the double-plate Molteno implant with the Schocket shunt (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>), though we did not combine results due to significant heterogeneity between the trials. Both studies had several limitations, which included providing no specific time points of follow-up or reporting six-month outcomes when 12-month follow-up was planned. In light of these limitations and the heterogeneity between the two studies, we could make no definitive conclusions from the findings of either study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison of aqueous shunts with and without modifications</HEADING>
<P>A meta-analysis of two trials evaluated the use of early aqueous suppression when IOP reached more than 10 mmHg after Ahmed valve implantation compared with standard medical management after Ahmed valve implantation (<LINK REF="STD-Law-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Law 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pakravan-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Pakravan 2014</LINK>). Early aqueous suppression was associated with greater IOP reduction at six months, but not at one-year follow-up. Participants in the early-suppression group did not require more medications over long-term follow-up compared with participants without early suppression. Visual acuity, time to onset of the hypertensive phase, mean duration of the hypertensive phase, and proportions of participants with complications were similar between the two groups. These findings suggest that early aqueous suppression may be a favorable modification to current clinical practice for the postoperative management of people receiving Ahmed valves for the control of disease progression through consistent IOP reduction.</P>
<P>Four studies compared any anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent with no anti-VEGF agent in combination with the Ahmed implant (<LINK REF="STD-Arcieri-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Arcieri 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Desai-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Desai 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahdy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mahdy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rojo_x002d_Arnao-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Rojo-Arnao 2011</LINK>). Due to differences in interventions and substantial statistical heterogeneity (greater than 90%), we did not combine individual study results in meta-analysis. One study that included only participants with neovascular glaucoma and used panretinal photocoagulation in both groups reported favorable results for intravitreal bevacizumab versus no intravitreal bevacizumab (<LINK REF="STD-Mahdy-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Mahdy 2013</LINK>). The other three studies showed mixed results; we could draw no conclusions from these studies due to the variability in findings and low certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>Two studies evaluated the Ahmed implant with versus without corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Teixeira-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Teixeira 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yuen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yuen 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Yuen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yuen 2011</LINK> reported outcomes at only 12 weeks of follow-up, which we considered too short for analysis. In <LINK REF="STD-Teixeira-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Teixeira 2012</LINK>, the small number of participants led to imprecise results with wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Three studies compared shunt augmentation for Ahmed implantation (<LINK REF="STD-Hwang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hwang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rho-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Rho 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yazdani-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Yazdani 2016</LINK>). Due to differences in interventions and substantial statistical heterogeneity, we did not combine individual study results in meta-analysis. The three studies showed mixed results; we could draw no firm conclusions from these studies due to the variability in findings and low certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>One study each compared the Ahmed implant with partial ligation of the tube versus with no ligation of tube in participants with neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Kee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 2001</LINK>); the Ahmed implant inserted pars plana versus in the anterior chamber for participants with glaucoma who required concomitant penetrating keratoplasty (<LINK REF="STD-Parihar-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Parihar 2016</LINK>); the Ahmed implant model M4 versus the Ahmed implant model S2 for neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Gil_x002d_Carrasco-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Gil-Carrasco 2016</LINK>); the 500 mm<SUP>2</SUP> Baerveldt implant versus the 350 mm<SUP>2</SUP> Baerveldt implant for non-neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Britt-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Britt 1999</LINK>); the single-plate Molteno implant with oral corticosteroids versus the single-plate Molteno implant without oral corticosteroids for glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Valimaki-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Valimaki 1999</LINK>); the double-plate Molteno implant versus the single-plate Molteno implant for non-neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Heuer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heuer 1992</LINK>); and the pressure-ridge Molteno implant versus the standard Molteno implant with tube ligation for glaucoma (<LINK REF="STD-Gerber-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gerber 1997</LINK>). Limitations in these studies, such as the lack of reporting of outcomes or follow-up times, small sample sizes, and high risks of bias, precluded us from drawing clinically meaningful conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:11:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies in this review compared a broad range of interventions, participants, diagnoses, and outcomes. All but one trial reported mean IOP (<LINK REF="STD-Kee-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kee 2001</LINK>), and 20 trials provided a dichotomized IOP definition of surgical success, though none of these definitions were consistent with our a priori definition of success. Most trials in this review used an IOP of 5 mmHg as the lower limit and 21 mmHg as the upper limit of success, but these parameters may need to be revised as the lower limit is arbitrary and the upper limit does not necessarily represent a clinically relevant level of IOP control.</P>
<P>Other outcomes compared in the included trials were visual acuity, visual field, mean number of glaucoma medications, complication rates, and reoperation. The completeness of the types of outcomes assessed was inconsistent across studies, though we were able to meta-analyze several outcomes for interventions of significant interest such as the Ahmed implant versus the Baerveldt implant.</P>
<P>The majority of studies in this review included adult participants of all ages with many subtypes of glaucoma, and are generalizable to adult participants who undergo glaucoma surgery in the real world. One exception is <LINK REF="STD-TVT-2009" TYPE="STUDY">TVT 2009</LINK>, which included only participants with previous trabeculectomy or cataract surgery and may thus be less generalizable. One issue with the overall applicability of this review is that a large variety of interventions were analyzed, with very few studies that analyzed the same intervention that were amenable to meta-analysis. For improved understanding of the optimal surgical management of glaucoma, it would be beneficial to conduct further trials with comparisons that are relevant to current clinical practice, which include aqueous shunts versus trabeculectomy with MMC and the Ahmed implant versus the Baerveldt implant.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:15:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The certainty of the evidence was generally low across comparisons included in this review. The most common reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision of results and high risk of bias. Many studies reported appropriate randomization methods, though allocation concealment was not reported in most studies. Given that several interventions involved different types of surgery in the two study groups, masking was not possible in all studies. A major flaw was that most studies did not use a strict intention-to-treat analysis and excluded participants from analyses after they were lost to follow-up. Furthermore, few meta-analyses were possible due to the heterogeneity in interventions evaluated, outcomes reported, and length of time participants were followed. The results reported in this review were influenced by these methodological limitations, therefore the evidence must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:26:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original version of this review was published in the Cochrane Library in January 2006 and included 15 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Minckler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 2006</LINK>). The current review has revised inclusion criteria and now includes 27 trials, of which 10 trials were also included in the previous review. Many of the studies in this updated review included different comparisons than those in the original review and thus did not impact the results of the original publication; the more recent studies compared newer models of aqueous shunt devices and included head-to-head comparisons of aqueous shunt devices.</P>
<P>Outside of Cochrane reviews, one systematic review compared the Ahmed implant to trabeculectomy with or without MMC for glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-HaiBo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">HaiBo 2015</LINK>). This review included a combination of prospective and retrospective studies and analyzed six studies with a total of 507 eyes. Unlike our present review, this review reported that the Ahmed implant was equivalent to trabeculectomy for reduction of IOP and reduction of glaucoma medication usage, and that the Ahmed implant was associated with a lower frequency of adverse events compared with trabeculectomy. The <LINK REF="REF-HaiBo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">HaiBo 2015</LINK> review is limited by its inclusion of retrospective studies with variable duration of follow-up, and is also potentially biased by its inclusion of a study that only included participants with neovascular glaucoma, as these patients are known to have higher risks of complications and poorer outcomes overall compared with people with non-neovascular glaucoma.</P>
<P>Another systematic review outside of Cochrane compared the Ahmed implant with intravitreal bevacizumab to the Ahmed implant alone for neovascular glaucoma (<LINK REF="REF-Hwang-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hwang 2015</LINK>). This review included both prospective and retrospective studies and a total of six studies with 256 eyes. Similar to the present review, it reported that the Ahmed implant with adjunctive bevacizumab was more effective than the Ahmed implant alone for IOP reduction in people with neovascular glaucoma. Results from this review are potentially limited by its inclusion of retrospective studies with variable follow-up.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:37:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Findings from this study suggest several relevant implications for clinical practice. Trabeculectomy traditionally has been considered the standard surgery for glaucoma that cannot be managed by medical therapy alone. Studies in this review that compared aqueous shunts with trabeculectomy suggest that trabeculectomy is an equivalent if not better choice for the overall management of glaucoma that is not controlled by maximally tolerated medical therapy.</P>
<P>Studies that compared the Ahmed implant to the Baerveldt implant suggest that the Baerveldt implant may provide more intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction and result in fewer additional surgeries one year after the implant. However, when a wide range of patient-important outcomes are taken into account, including IOP reduction, visual acuity, medication use, complications, and reoperation, it is unclear if one implant is superior to another.</P>
<P>Another notable finding from this review is the possible benefit of early initiation of aqueous suppression at lower IOP levels after Ahmed valve placement for more effective long-term IOP control. Finally, for people with neovascular glaucoma, adjunctive intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy with aqueous shunt placement appears to provide a benefit for long-term IOP control and minimization of complications and reoperation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review raises several issues for future trials of glaucoma surgery. Clinically, future trials should include standardized definitions of success that reflect greater levels of IOP reduction than the current definitions of success included in studies in this review. Standardized definitions of the hypertensive phase would also increase comparability across studies. Several outcomes that were underinvestigated in this study are also important and deserve more attention in future trials: visual field progression, duration or time to onset of the postoperative hypertensive phase, reoperation for glaucoma, and quality of life.</P>
<P>Methodologically, there are several modifications that future trials could make to minimize bias. Specifically, trials would benefit from standardized methods for allocation concealment and from the clear reporting of these methods, as almost no studies in this review reported on allocation concealment. Additionally, studies could decrease bias by following an intention-to-treat analysis and by including all randomized participants in all analyses from all follow-up time points, and use of multiple imputation methods for missing data when necessary. It would also be beneficial to increase the sample size in trials to make subgroup analyses possible. Finally, masking of the surgeon to the intervention is not possible for most comparisons, however masking of outcome assessors could be done for certain measurements such as IOP or visual acuity.</P>
<P>In conclusion, the role of aqueous shunts in the surgical management of glaucoma is a complicated and controversial subject. With the increasing use of aqueous shunts worldwide, further adequately powered trials that compare aqueous shunts to each other and to other types of surgical interventions for glaucoma are needed for improved patient care.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-07-13 22:51:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We updated some methods for this review based on Cochrane methods that have evolved since the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Minckler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minckler 2006</LINK>). We used the 'Risk of bias' tool, produced 'Summary of findings' tables, and assessed the certainty of evidence based on the GRADE approach. Because a substantial number of eligible randomized controlled trials have been identified, we modified the eligibility criteria to exclude quasi-random studies; this modification did not affect inclusion for this review. We also excluded studies that compared the use of mitomycin C versus no mitomycin C in aqueous shunt surgery, as this comparison will be evaluated in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Foo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foo 2015</LINK>). We revised IOP threshold definitions from the original review based on more stringent and detailed criteria reported in the literature.</P>
