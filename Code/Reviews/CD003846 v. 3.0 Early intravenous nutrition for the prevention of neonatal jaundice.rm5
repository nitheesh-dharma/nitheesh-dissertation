</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-16 11:58:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Approximately 65% of newborn infants develop clinically evident jaundice in the first week of life (<LINK REF="REF-Maisels-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisels 1992</LINK>). In the majority of cases, the jaundice results from the increased production and decreased excretion of bilirubin which occurs in all newborns ('physiological' jaundice). In some infants however, jaundice is due to significant underlying disease such as infection, haemolysis or an inborn error of metabolism ('pathological' jaundice). If the hyperbilirubinaemia is principally unconjugated, and if it exceeds the binding capacity of albumin, the unbound fraction can cross the blood brain barrier and have a direct neurotoxic effect on the brain. This can cause a neonatal encephalopathy which may have significant neurodevelopmental sequelae.</P>
<P>Bilirubin metabolism is affected by caloric intake (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1971</LINK>). The effect of timing of introduction of enteral feeds on neonatal jaundice is well recognised; Goodhart et al advocated early feeding of low birthweight infants as a treatment for neonatal jaundice in the early 20th century (<LINK REF="REF-Goodhart-1913" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodhart 1913</LINK>). Subsequently, the early institution of enteral feeds was shown to decrease the severity and duration of neonatal jaundice (<LINK REF="REF-Wharton-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wharton 1965</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennberg 1966</LINK>). This is due to a reduction in intestinal transit time with a resulting decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin (<LINK REF="REF-Wennberg-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennberg 1966</LINK>), and may also be related to the effect of positive nitrogen balance on the hepatic conjugation of bilirubin.</P>
<P>In some newborn infants, enteral feeds cannot be commenced. This is most often due to concurrent illness (e.g. respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support) but may also be necessary if some gastrointestinal pathology precludes feeding (e.g. gastroschisis, oesophageal atresia). In these infants, the institution of enteral feeds may be delayed for many days and caloric support is achieved by the use of intravenous nutrition solutions. Such solutions contain dextrose, electrolytes, amino acids, fats and vitamins. The side-effects of chronic intravenous nutrition administration on the liver (cholestasis) are well known (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1986</LINK>); however, the short term effect on the rate of bilirubin conjugation in the first few days of life is unclear.</P>
<P>This systematic review examined the impact of early intravenous nutrition on the subsequent development of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous nutrition which included amino acids and/or fats with routine intravenous fluids were included. The review also separately examined trials including preterm infants.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this systematic review was to answer the question:</P>
<P>Does the introduction of intravenous nutrition compared with routine intravenous fluids to newborn infants less than 72 hours old who are not being enterally fed decrease the severity, duration and need for treatment of neonatal jaundice?<BR/>The same question was also examined in a subset of trials enrolling preterm infants.</P>

<LI>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002)</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE electronic search (1966-December 2002): Medical Subject Headings - jaundice, jaundice/neonatal, clinical trials, infant/newborn, parenteral nutrition</LI>

<P>
<BR/>Reference lists from identified studies were to have been searched, as well as the reference lists of review articles, but none were identified. Accordingly, there were no primary authors to contact. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. The methodological quality of each eligible trial was to have been assessed by both authors, with the second author blinded to trial author and institution. The following criteria were to have been used to assess trial methodology: blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome assessment. It was planned that both authors would have independently extracted the data and compared results, resolving disagreements by consensus. Contact was to have been made with the primary author of each eligible trial to review the eligible trial list for completeness and to provide additional data if required. The standard statistical methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were to have been used. For categorical data, the relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) were to have been calculated. For outcomes measured on a continuous scale, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was to have been calculated. 95% confidence intervals were to have been used. A fixed effects model was to have been assumed for the meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis, restricted to preterm infants, was planned.</P>

<P>Eight studies were identified using the described search strategy. Four of these were ineligible for inclusion in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Alvear-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Alvear 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Closa-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Closa 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogata-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ogata 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1979</LINK>). The first, Closa et al (<LINK REF="STD-Closa-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Closa 1976</LINK>), was an uncontrolled case series. In two (<LINK REF="STD-Alvear-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Alvear 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 1979</LINK>), intravenous nutrition was compared with enteral feeds rather than with routine intravenous fluids, and in a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Ogata-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ogata 1983</LINK>) two different intravenous nutrition solutions were compared.</P>
<P>This left four trials which were eligible for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pildes-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Pildes 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Lingen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lingen 1992</LINK>). Two (<LINK REF="STD-Rivera-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Rivera 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Lingen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Van Lingen 1992</LINK>) were excluded as no outcomes relevant to this review were reported. The study of Black et al (<LINK REF="STD-Black-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Black 1981</LINK>) reported relevant outcomes but was excluded because the infants were randomised after 72 hours of age. The study of Pildes et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pildes-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Pildes 1973</LINK>) was excluded because some infants in both arms of the study received enteral feeds but no data were separately reported for the subgroup who did not.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Bilirubin metabolism is affected by caloric intake. For infants receiving enteral feeds this may be mediated by a direct effect on nitrogen balance, as well as the indirect effect of decreased intestinal transit time on the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Intravenous nutrition is commonly used in newborn infants who cannot be enterally fed, and is often commenced within the first few days of life at a time when unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is almost invariably present. Although the early institution of intravenous nutrition might be expected to result in lower levels of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, no controlled or uncontrolled data have been published investigating this potential benefit. Future clinical trials investigating the merits of early institution of intravenous nutrition should include outcomes related to neonatal jaundice.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Many factors determine the optimum timing of institution of intravenous nutrition in newborn infants. These include the gestational age of the infant, the perceived adequacy of intrauterine nutrition, and the presence of co-existing morbidities such as sepsis, thrombocytopenia and respiratory disease. There is no evidence from clinical trials regarding the effect of early intravenous feeding on the prevention of neonatal jaundice. Decisions regarding the institution of early intravenous nutrition must therefore continue to be based upon these other factors.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future randomised trials investigating the early institution of intravenous nutrition should include outcomes related to neonatal jaundice.</P>
