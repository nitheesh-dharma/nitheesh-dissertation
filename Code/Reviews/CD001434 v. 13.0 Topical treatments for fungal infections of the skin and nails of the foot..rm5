<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Creams, lotions and gels (topical treatments) for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>We found lots of evidence to show fungal skin infections of the skin of the feet (athlete's foot or tinea pedis) are effectively managed by over the counter topical antifungal creams, lotions and gels. The most effective topical agent was terbinafine. Other topical agents such as azoles, ciclopiroxolamine, butenafine, tolnaftate and undecanoate were also effective in curing athlete's foot. </P>
<P>Evidence for the management of topical treatments for management of dermatophyte infections of the toenails was sparser and the studies are small. There was some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both needed to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year).</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating (rate of treatment failure) fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> <I>Issue</I> 1, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.45); undecanoates RR 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70). Meta-analysis of 11 trials comparing allylamines and azoles showed a risk ratio of treatment failure RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94) in favour of allylamines. Evidence for the management of topical treatments for infections of the toenails is sparser. There is some evidence that ciclopiroxolamine and butenafine are both effective but they both need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). The six trials of nail infections provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine has poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective but more research is required.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Placebo-controlled trials of allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot consistently produce much higher percentages of cure than placebo. Allylamines cure slightly more infections than azoles and are now available OTC. Further research into the effectiveness of antifungal agents for nail infections is required.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-01 14:05:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-01 14:05:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Dermatophyte is a collective term for the most common type of fungi which cause infection of the skin and nail. Dermatophytes have the ability to invade keratinised tissue (skin, hair and nails). Infection is normally restricted to the outermost layer of the skin (epidermis). The skin between the toes is a frequent site of fungal infection (athlete's foot or tinea pedis and this can cause pain and itchiness. The skin may become white and macerated and vesicles (small blisters) may form. These can erupt and spread to other areas of the foot especially the soles where the area becomes reddened and raw. Additionally, patches of hard thickened skin occur on the soles, heels and side of the feet. This can lead to splits (fissures) in the skin. Fungal infections of the nail (onychomycosis) can affect the entire nail plate, and one, several or all nails of the feet can be infected simultaneously. The nails often appear changed in colour; they may be thickened and changed in texture (Beaven &amp; Brooks 1994). Fungal infections of the nail are often associated with a skin infection, in which case they can act as a source of reinfection if only the skin is treated (<LINK REF="REF-Petit-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petit 1983</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot are common, reflecting the contagious nature of the organisms. They are thought to occur when individuals regularly use communal changing rooms and swimming pools. Some groups of workers, e.g. coal miners, have been found to have a prevalence of 80% (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1992</LINK>). However, people living in institutions with shared bathing facilities such as boarding schools and long term care hospitals also show a higher than average prevalence of this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1992</LINK>). The prevalence of onychomycosis has been suggested to increase with age (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1992</LINK>) and to be present at a rate of about 5% in people aged 55 years and older.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-20 14:36:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Cathy Bennett">
<P>Clinicians faced with a public demand for effective treatment for these conditions face a difficult task as the conditions can be resistant to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Brautigam-et-al-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brautigam et al 1995</LINK>). Whilst these superficial infections are not life threatening, chronic fungal infections of the skin and nails carry a considerable morbidity.</P>
<P>There is wide variation in the methods of treating fungal infections of the skin and toe nails of the foot which reflects the uncertainty surrounding efficacy. Uncertainty also extends to the optimal period of treatment, appropriate dosage of drug and frequency of application. Topical preparations are much less costly than orally administered antifungal drugs and cause minimal adverse side effects. However, whilst they may be helpful in treating the symptoms in localised skin infections, uncertainty exists as to their effectiveness in the complete eradication of the infecting organisms. The ideal topical antifungal for the treatment of fungal infection should be fungicidal so that treatment can be of short duration, it should obtain high cure rates, minimise relapses, be conducive to participant compliance and have minimal adverse effects.</P>

<P>We reported results are reported as risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<P>Heterogeneity was assessed using I<SUP>2</SUP>. If substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) existed between studies for the primary outcomes, reasons for heterogeneity, such as language, differences in health care systems, dosage and duration of treatment, were explored. </P>
<P>For major comparisons where overall pooling of the results was considered potentially appropriate, the results were also illustrated using L'Abbé plots (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abbe-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbe 1985</LINK>). For each study, This plot showed the observed treatment failure rate in one group plotted against observed treatment failure rate in the other group. This was useful to illustrate the range of treatment failure rates among the trials, and the amount of heterogeneity between trials and sub groups. The diagonal line indicates no treatment effect (RR = 1). Points below this line correspond to trials where the treatment on the vertical axis has a lower treatment failure rate. The dashed line shows the pooled treatment effect. Each trial is plotted using a circle with size proportional to the standard error of the treatment effect so that trials providing more precise estimates are shown using larger circles.</P>

<P>The primary outcome i.e. rate of treatment failure, was extracted for three time points, considered to reflect clinically important timings. Each time point is analysed separately with sub comparisons within each treatment comparison consistently numbered as below.</P>
<P>1. Short-term (two weeks): the order of preference was two, one, three weeks.<BR/>2. Medium-term (six weeks): the time point closest to six weeks follow-up was used, provided that it was within four to eight weeks. If two time points equally close to six weeks were available then the longer follow-up was used (e.g. eight rather than four weeks). Where a final follow-up endpoint with more participants included was available with four to eight weeks, this was used preferentially. Only &gt; 80% follow-up included. A sensitivity analysis on the medium term data, restricted to data where there was clear documentation of at least 80% follow-up of randomised participants (where follow-up is given by group, at least 80% follow-up was required in both groups).<BR/>3. Long-term (12 weeks onwards): longest follow-up of at least 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Sub comparisons were used to group together treatments by duration (note that for short-term outcomes, grouping by duration was not necessary, since all durations were at least two weeks).</P>

<P>We considered all RCTs that evaluated topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot. For skin infections we included only trials that used microscopy and culture to establish the presence of dermatophytes. For nail infections we included only trials that used culture to do so. We included duplicate trials only once. We excluded trials on fungal infections that contained data on infections at various body sites if foot-specific data could not be extracted separately.</P>

<P>A diagnosis of athlete's foot based on clinical signs and symptoms alone can be inaccurate because there are non-fungal skin conditions which have a similar appearance, e.g. erythrasma. This review only included trials which reported the use of microscopy and culture tests to confirm the presence of fungi. The results from these lab-based diagnostic tests can take up to several weeks to obtain, and often trial participants are randomised to an allocation and begin treatment before the test results are available. When the results show no fungi are present (negative test result) participants are then withdrawn from the study. In order to reduce bias from trials with high loss to follow up whilst recognising the practical constraints in which RCTs of athlete's foot generally take place, we performed a sensitivity analysis only including data which reported follow up data for at least 80% of the randomised sample.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-01 14:27:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>Superficial fungal infections affecting the foot are common and often the first line management strategy is the use of topical agents on both skin and nail infections. The review identified good evidence that allylamines, azoles, butenafine, ciclopiroxolamine, tolciclate and tolnaftate are all efficacious relative to placebo in the management of fungal infections of the skin. Allylamines produced evidence of greater effectiveness when used for longer and there is some evidence that the effect of allylamines increases over time. The observations were collected from a large number of participants (11 trials, n = 1116) providing strong evidence that allylamines are very much more effective than placebo in the management of athletes foot, with an estimated relative reduction in treatment failure at 6 weeks of 67% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.44; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of azoles was also seen to improve over time; at outcomes collected six weeks after baseline greater effectiveness than outcomes taken earlier (two weeks after baseline). In common with the trials of allylamines versus placebo, azole creams are very much more effective than placebo, with an estimated relative reduction in treatment failure at 6 weeks of 60% (13 trials, n = 1235, RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.46; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the strength of the evidence from a large number of trials and people, and the narrow confidence intervals around the estimates for both allylamines and azoles we would not recommend the use of placebo controls in future RCTs evaluating the use of topical treatments for athlete's foot.</P>
<P>Butenafine, ciclopiroxolamine, tolciclate and tolnaftate also showed greater effectiveness than placebo in the treatment of fungal skin conditions. These results are based on a limited number of trials including small numbers of people however and the evidence is consequently less strong than for allylamines and azoles.</P>
<P>Comparisons between different regimes of allylamines provided little evidence that any regime is more effective than another. Different types of allylamines or different doses were not found to have different treatment failure rates. This might be because there are genuinely no differences in the effectiveness of different types or regimes of topical allylamines, or it may because the trials included too few participants to detect differences between groups.</P>
<P>We did not detect any difference in treatment failure rates between any of the individual azoles, but there is some evidence that the length of treatment affects the success of azoles creams: clotrimazole used for four weeks instead of one week was shown to improve its effectiveness in one trial.<BR/>
<BR/>Direct comparisons of allylamines versus azoles show allylamines to be generally more efficacious than azoles. Trials directly comparing the two compounds demonstrate the superiority of allylamines. There is little evidence of superiority at 2 weeks but this effect becomes detectable in outcomes taken 6 weeks after treatment begins and appears to remain at 12 weeks. The meta analysis of 8 trials and outcomes from 962 participants supports the finding that allylamines are more effective than azoles when applied for between 4 to 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, there was a relative reduction in treatment failure with allylamines compared to azoles of 37% (RR 0.63 95% CI 0.42 to 0.94; <LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta analyses of randomised controlled trials of allylamines used for one week versus azoles for four weeks demonstrated fairly similar outcomes at six weeks, though there is insufficient evidence to claim that these regimes are equivalent.</P>
<P>Comparisons of other antifungal agents have found that halprogen is more effective than tolnaftate and that combining salicylic acid with nitrite produces greater effectiveness than that of salicylic acid alone. The small trial of Whitfield's ointment and variotin applied for eight weeks only included ten people with athlete's foot and it is therefore unsurprising that the trialists failed to detect differences between these two compounds. Unfortunately there is little evidence to assess tolnaftate against placebo or to compare butenafine, ciclopiroxolamine, tolciclate and tolnaftate with each other.</P>
<P>The review did not find any evidence to support the use of tea tree oil in the management of athlete's foot. Tea tree oil did not produce a greater benefit than placebo, and was significantly less effective than tolnaftate. In a trial of different concentrations of tea tree oil <LINK REF="STD-Satchell-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Satchell 2002</LINK> did not detect statistically significant differences between concentrations of 50% and 25%. All the randomised evaluations included in this systematic review of tea tree oil suggest that it is ineffective in the management of fungal skin infections.</P>
<P>Evidence about the efficacy of topical treatments for nail infections is sparse. Combining data from 2 trials of ciclopiroxolamine versus placebo found treatments failure rates of 61% and 64% for ciclopiroxolamine. These outcomes followed long treatment times (48 weeks) and this makes ciclopiroxolamine a poor choice for nail infections. Better results were observed with the use of amorolfine lacquer; 6% treatment failure rates were found after 1 month of treatment but these data were collected on a very small sample of people and these high rates of success might be unreliable. Butenafine 2% produced a treatment failure rate of 20%. There is limited evidence about the efficacy of tea tree oil for skin infections; it was evaluated in only one small trial however it was found to be ineffective for fungal nail conditions when compared with topical butenafine.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2008-08-01 14:27:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Diane A  Horsley">
<P>The randomised controlled trials in this review were generally well reported, and follow up rates were reasonable for such a condition.</P>
<P>Since no trial reported the species obtained from participants who were resistant to treatment we cannot draw conclusions about susceptibility to individual compounds to help clinical decision-making. Little data was available about the long term outcomes associated with the use of antifungal creams and there is uncertainty about rates of reinfection and relapse.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>All antifungal compounds demonstrated some success in curing athlete's foot. The best results were observed with the use of allylamines and there is a small amount of evidence that butenafine may be similarly good. Azoles are also very effective and participants should be advised that although all azoles appear to be similarly effective, using an azole cream for four weeks is likely to produce better results than using it for one week. Azoles may also be more efficacious than tolnaftate but they seem no more efficacious than undecanoic acid. There is limited evidence about the efficacy of tea tree oil for skin infections. </P>
<P>There is little evidence that topical anti-fungals are effective in the management of onychomycosis or fungally infected toe nails. The majority of available data demonstrate low cure rates after long treatment times with ciclopiroxolamine. Amorolfine and butenafine may be much more effective than ciclopiroxolamine and tea tree oil but only a few observations are available.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The estimates of effectiveness of allylamines and azoles relative to placebo have conclusively demonstrated these drugs to be of greater effectiveness and we recommend that no more placebo controlled trials of allylamines or azoles should be conducted. </P>
<P>More direct comparisons of undecanoic acid and tolnaftate with allylamines and azoles for athlete's foot are required. Large randomised controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of topical amorolfine and butenafine are needed to establish an alternative to oral treatments for toe nail infections.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2009-03-24 17:35:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the section 'Effects of interventions' part (b) Nails trials, the authors say "A comparison of 2% butenafine versus 5% tea tree oil produced a relative risk 0.03; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47 at 36 weeks showing butenafine + tea tree oil to be statistically significantly more effective than tea tree oil alone (<LINK REF="STD-Syed-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Syed 1999</LINK>). </P>
<P>The study was placebo-controlled. So, the review should say that butenafine + tea tree oil is more effective than placebo. The way you put it provides evidence that tea tree oil is ineffective. The real situation is that there no evidence one way or the other. </P>
<P>You need to check the graphs and tables for the same error. </P>
<P>NOTE: The submitter agrees with the default conflict of interest statement: I certify that I have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with a financial interest in the subject matter of my feedback.</P>

<P>I wish to thank the person who has given us feedback about the mistake in the section 'Effects of interventions' part (b) Nails trials.  I have referred to the original paper (<LINK REF="STD-Syed-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Syed 1999</LINK>) and can confirm that the criticism is valid; the comparisons were 2% Butenafine together with 5% melaleuca alternifolia versus placebo and I agree that the text should read "A comparison of 2% butenafine and 5% tea tree oil produced a relative risk 0.03; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47 at 36 weeks showing butenafine and tea tree oil to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo alone&#8221;.   </P>
<P>Fay Crawford (on behalf of all the authors of this review)</P>
<P>As a result of the above dialogue the editorial base made the appropriate changes to the text in the section 'Effects of interventions' part (b) Nails trials. The graph was moved from Analysis 12.2 'Comparisons between active treatments to Analysis12.1 'Treatments versus placebo'.</P>
