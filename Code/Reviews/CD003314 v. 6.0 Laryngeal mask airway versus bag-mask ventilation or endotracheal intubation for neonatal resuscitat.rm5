Infants who do not have effective breathing soon after birth can become severely depressed. Providing rapid effective ventilation in the delivery room is very important. Ventilation is often started using a manually-pumped oxygen bag to force air into a close-fitting face mask held over the infant's nose and mouth. If breathing remains depressed after using the manual resuscitation bag, a tube is placed directly into the infant's large airway (endotracheal intubation). Bag and mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation may not be possible when infants have airway obstructions or head and face abnormalities that obstruct the normal flow of air into their lungs and/or obstructing the view of the airway by the medical personnel attempting intubation. The LMA is an alternative to bag and mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation. LMA is a small mask attached to a silicone tube fitted into the throat to provide positive pressure ventilation into the airway.</P><P><B>Study characteristics</B></P><P>We included seven trials that recruited a total of 794 infants.

Five studies compared LMA with BMV and three studies compared LMA with endotracheal intubation. We added six new studies for this update (754 infants).</P><P>LMA was associated with less need for endotracheal intubation than BMV (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47 and typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.06; 5 studies, 661 infants; moderate-quality evidence) and shorter ventilation time (mean difference (MD) -18.90 seconds, 95% CI -24.35 to -13.44; 4 studies, 610 infants).

Compared to BMV, LMA is more effective in terms of shorter resuscitation and ventilation times, and less need for endotracheal intubation (low- to moderate-quality evidence). However, in trials comparing LMA with BMV, over 80% of infants in both trial arms responded to the allocated intervention. In studies that allowed LMA rescue of infants failing with BMV, it was possible to avoid intubation in the majority. It is important that the clinical community resorts to the use of LMA more proactively to provide effective ventilation when newborn is not responding to BMV before attempting intubation or initiating chest compressions. </P><P>LMA was found to offer comparable efficacy to endotracheal intubation (very low- to low-quality evidence). It therefore offers an alternate airway device when attempts at inserting endotracheal intubation are unsuccessful during resuscitation.</P><P>Most studies enrolled infants with birth weight over 1500 g or 34 or more weeks' gestation. As such, there is lack of evidence to support LMA use in more premature infants. </P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-03-14 17:19:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-12 13:33:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-12-18 01:55:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>While most newborns are vigorous at birth, 1% to 13% will require assisted ventilation in the delivery room (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kattwinkel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kattwinkel 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niermeyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niermeyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyckoff-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyckoff 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardo 2004</LINK>). Ineffective ventilatory support is the most common clinical event contributing to severe neonatal depression and the need for intensive resuscitation in the delivery room (<LINK REF="REF-Perlman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 1995</LINK>). Providing rapid and effective positive pressure ventilation is considered to be the most important component of successful neonatal resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Niermeyer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niermeyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiner-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 2016</LINK>).</P><P>During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilation is frequently initiated with a manual resuscitation bag and face mask ventilation (BMV) followed by endotracheal intubation if neonatal depression continues. However, these techniques may be difficult to perform successfully. Effective BMV is a skill that must be learned and practiced. Incorrect mask placement allows air to leak around the mask. Excessive pressure to the mask may result in soft tissue damage to facial structures (<LINK REF="REF-Hagberg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagberg 2005</LINK>). Laboratory investigations have suggested that commonly used BMV devices may deliver inconsistent tidal volumes, excessive peak pressures, and inadequate positive end-expiratory pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2001</LINK>). Videotape recordings of neonatal resuscitations demonstrate that resuscitators were frequently unable to achieve adequate chest expansion using BMV (<LINK REF="REF-Carbine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbine 2000</LINK>).</P><P>Endotracheal intubation is attempted when adequate ventilation cannot be established. This procedure requires considerable training, experience, and skill. It has been reported that physicians completing paediatric training frequently fail to intubate the trachea despite multiple attempts (<LINK REF="REF-Falck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck 2003</LINK>). Even experienced resuscitators may at times require prolonged attempts to successfully intubate the neonatal trachea (<LINK REF="REF-Carbine-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbine 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noblett-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noblett 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, providing BMV or endotracheal intubation may not be possible for infants with airway obstructions and craniofacial anomalies such as the Pierre Robin sequence. In these infants, additional airway adjuncts and advanced procedures may be required. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a device that could provide an alternative to either BMV or endotracheal intubation for newborns requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room (<LINK REF="REF-Trevisanuto-2004c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trevisanuto 2004c</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-12-17 23:18:18 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>LMA is a small mask with an inflatable cuff attached to a silicone airway tube. The LMA is inserted orally using the operator's index finger and guided along the hard palate without laryngoscopy or other instruments. When the device is fully inserted, the mask lumen sits over the laryngeal opening and the cuff conforms to the contours of the hypopharynx occluding the oesophagus with a low-pressure seal. After inflating the cuff, LMA ventilation can be used to control the airway of the spontaneously breathing person or to provide positive pressure ventilation. LMA is used for both adult and children's anaesthesia and is the initial adjunctive airway device recommended by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists' difficult airway algorithm (<LINK REF="REF-Apfelbaum-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apfelbaum 2013</LINK>). LMA use has also been tested in preterm neonates in non-resuscitation settings for surfactant administration to avoid endotracheal intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Barbosa-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Barbosa 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbosa-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Barbosa 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinheiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Pinheiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wanous-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Wanous 2017</LINK>). In a review on supraglottic airway devices during neonatal resuscitation <LINK REF="REF-Schmolzer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmolzer 2013</LINK> included four trials that compared positive pressure ventilation delivered by an LMA versus bag and mask or an endotracheal tube. Infants in the LMA group were intubated less frequently than infants in the bag and mask ventilation group; LMA group infants had fewer unsuccessful resuscitations. <LINK REF="REF-Schmolzer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmolzer 2013</LINK> also included two small trials that enrolled preterm infants and compared surfactant administration via LMA versus via endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="STD-Pinheiro-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Pinheiro 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2017</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2017-12-17 23:19:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) have been shown to be effective for ventilating newborns weighing more than 2000 g or who were delivered at 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="STD-Esmail-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Esmail 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gandini-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gandini 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2004a</LINK>). The potential advantages of using LMA for neonatal resuscitation include the ease of insertion without laryngoscopy and minimal instrumentation of the larynx. Potential disadvantages include gastric distention, inadequate alveolar ventilation, and possible difficulty suctioning the airway or administering emergency endotracheal medications.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-12 13:33:51 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care regarding Neonatal resuscitation states that a laryngeal mask is recommended during resuscitation of term and preterm newborns at 34 weeks or more gestation when tracheal intubation is unsuccessful or is not feasible (<LINK REF="REF-Wyckoff-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyckoff 2015</LINK>). However, they did not recommend routine use of LMA either as a primary airway device (as an alternative to BMV) or as a secondary airway device (as alternative to endotracheal intubation). Moreover, LMA has not been evaluated for infants with meconium-stained fluid, during chest compressions, or for administration of emergency endotracheal medications.</P><P>Given that establishing ventilation is the most critical aspect of successful neonatal resuscitation, it is important to answer two questions: does LMA achieve initial ventilation and successful resuscitation faster than BMV, and when BMV is either insufficient or ineffective, does LMA achieve effective ventilation and successful resuscitation faster than endotracheal intubation?</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-27 13:50:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Primary objectives: (1) Among all newborns requiring positive pressure ventilation for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is effective positive pressure ventilation and successful resuscitation achieved faster with the LMA compared to BMV?

The randomisation method was not described. Infants were assigned to one of three arms (25 infants in each). Infants were ventilated with endotracheal intubation, BMV and LMA respectively. Resuscitation was performed by second year residents in anaesthesia who were conversant in neonate resuscitation techniques, and were supervised by a consultant anaesthetist. Where neonates could not be ventilated using endotracheal intubation and BMV, LMA was used. The efficiency of LMA ventilation for infants was evaluated in terms of ease of placement and ventilation. The time required for each technique to provide effective ventilation was reported. The adequacy of ventilation was gauged by the neonate's colour, pulse oximetry, Apgar score (1, 5, 10 minutes), chest movement and heart rate by auscultation.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Pejovic--2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pejovic 2015</LINK> conducted a randomised clinical trial that involved 50 asphyxiated neonates with birth weight over 2 kg who were resuscitated by midwives using a specific LMA device (I-gel) (25 infants) or face mask ventilation (25 infants). A neonatologist or an anaesthesiologist supervised the resuscitation. The interventions were filmed and resuscitation data were collected from video review. Data collected included the total ventilation time, time for heart rate improvement, death or hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in the delivery room or at 24 hours. Procedure-related adverse effects and need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were reported.</P><P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto--2015" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2015</LINK> involved 142 neonates at gestational age of 34 or more weeks, and expected birth weight of 1500 g or more needing positive pressure ventilation at birth. Infants were randomised to laryngeal mask airway ('Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway = 71 infants) or face mask (71 infants). A total of 44 study participants (15 physicians and 29 nurses) were trained in the preparation and insertion of LMA (size 1). After initial steps (warming, clearing airway, drying, and stimulation), positive pressure ventilation with LMA or face mask with bag was initiated in infants with apnoea, gasping, or heart rate less than 100 beats per minute (or any combination). The primary outcome of this study was the success rate of the resuscitation devices (LMA or face mask). Resuscitation success was defined as achieving effective positive pressure ventilation (chest movements and increasing heart rate) preventing the need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included Apgar score at five minutes, time to first breath (defined as the first respiratory effort), time to first cry (defined as the first audible cry spontaneously emitted by the infant), death or moderate to severe HIE within seven days of life, admission to the NICU or general nursery, and complications secondary to the procedure.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Yang--2016" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2016</LINK> involved 68 neonates with a gestational age of 34 or more weeks, or anticipated birth weight of 2 kg or more, with heart rate below 60 beats per minute, despite BMV for 30 seconds. Infants were assigned quasi-randomly (odd and even birth date) to the size 1 classic LMA arm (36 infants) or endotracheal intubation ventilation (32 infants). The primary outcome was to identify any differences in the feasibility, efficacy, and safety between LMA ventilation and endotracheal intubation during neonatal resuscitation. Data collected during resuscitation included Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, time required for device insertion, number of attempts required for successful device insertion, number of newborns successfully resuscitated, time required to achieve successful resuscitation, and the total ventilation time. Successful resuscitation was defined as the infant establishing spontaneous breathing, heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute, and good muscle tone. The number of infants who were assigned to the LMA group and required change to endotracheal intubation was reported. Blood gases and glucose levels were obtained from cord blood immediately after birth, and from peripheral arterial samples one hour after resuscitation.</P><P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK> involved 369 neonates with gestational age of 34 or more weeks, expected birth weight over 2 kg who required positive pressure ventilation at birth. Infants were quasi-randomised to resuscitation by LMA (205 neonates) or bag-mask ventilation (164 neonates), according to date of birth; LMA was used on even dates, and the BMV on odd dates. Seven paediatricians with at least three years experience in neonatology carried out all resuscitations. All were trained in LMA insertion by a tutor who had been trained according to the American Heart Association 2005 neonatal resuscitation guidelines. The standard LMA insertion technique described by <LINK REF="REF-Brain-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brain 1983</LINK> was used. The LMA was held in place and connected to a self-inflating bag for positive pressure ventilation. All infants were resuscitated using 100% inspired oxygen. During resuscitation, positive pressure ventilation was administered at 40 to 60 breaths per minute with oxygen at a flow rate of 6 to 8 L/min. Intubation was performed if the heart rate did not rise or remained less than 60 breaths per minute after 30 seconds of positive pressure ventilation with LMA or BMV. If neonates with meconium-stained amniotic fluid were not vigorous at birth, tracheal suction for meconium was performed before initiating positive pressure ventilation. Data collected during resuscitation included: Apgar score at one and five minutes after birth; LMA insertion time, rate of successful insertion at the first attempt, and the number of attempts required to insert the LMA successfully; duration of resuscitation: response time (the time period from starting LMA resuscitation to achieving an effective response), ventilation time; adverse effects during resuscitation; arterial blood gases, lactic acid and blood sugar level before and after resuscitation in 20 infants from each group. Successful resuscitation with LMA or BMV was defined as preventing the need for tracheal intubation.</P></INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR><EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2017-12-15 00:47:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We excluded 26 studies.

It is, therefore, critically important to identify the most effective device for delivering positive pressure ventilation. BMV and endotracheal intubation are the most common traditional treatment options, but both have limitations including difficulties achieving effective and consistent tidal volumes, obtaining an effective seal, and using either device for newborns with craniofacial anomalies. A further challenge is the requirement for extensive training and practice.</P><P>We included seven randomised controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. Five studies that enrolled a total of 661 infants compared LMA to BMV (<LINK REF="STD-Feroze-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Feroze 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pejovic--2015" TYPE="STUDY">Pejovic 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Singh-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Singh 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Trevisanuto--2015" TYPE="STUDY">Trevisanuto 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK>). Three studies, enrolling 158 infants, compared LMA with endotracheal intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Esmail-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Esmail 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feroze-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Feroze 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang--2016" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2016</LINK>).</P><P>Results show that compared to the BMV, the use of LMA is more effective in terms of lower need for endotracheal intubation and shorter ventilation time. Infants initiated on BMV were more likely to fail the primary modality of providing positive pressure ventilation, although, some could be rescued by LMA, thus preventing endotracheal intubation. Compared to endotracheal intubation, the use of LMA was not associated with clinically significant differences in insertion time or failure to correctly place the device. Both techniques provided effective ventilation with no difference in the short-term clinical outcomes observed. However, most studies included infants with birth weights over 1500 g or 34 or more weeks gestation or both. Evidence relating to less mature infants is limited.</P><P>Theoretically, if LMA achieves effective ventilation faster than BMV, this technique may decrease numbers of newborns who would ultimately require chest compressions or resuscitation drugs. However, some questions remain unanswered, e.g., it would be important to establish whether the LMA can be used effectively during chest compressions . Also, LMA is technically a harder skill to learn as compared to BMV. Although, there was low failure rate in the included trials in terms of ability to initiate LMA in the participants, it is not clear whether same would be the case in real world settings given that LMA is technically a more challenging skill to learn compared to BMV.</P><P>We found higher than expected success rates associated with endotracheal intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Esmail-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Esmail 2002</LINK> 100%; <LINK REF="STD-Feroze-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Feroze 2008</LINK> 90%). This may have limited the investigators' ability to identify a difference between groups for successful placement of airway ventilation devices. In the literature, endotracheal intubation placement failure rates by residents and fellows has been reported to be much higher: <LINK REF="REF-Falck-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falck 2003</LINK> reported that only 50% to 62% of neonatal intubation procedures were successful on the first or second attempt by paediatric residents whereas 35% of the neonates could not be successfully intubated by a paediatric residents despite four attempts. Similarily, <LINK REF="REF-Bismilla-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bismilla 2010</LINK> reported the rate of successful intubation between 63% and 69% among paediatric residents and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) fellows.</P><P>A sizable limitation of the review at study and outcome level is due to high risk of selection bias in the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2011</LINK>) and high risk of performance bias in all the studies. Additionally, at the review level, there was unclear risk of reporting bias in four of the seven trials, as their protocols were not available online for reference.</P><P>Despite the limitations of data, this review suggests that LMA is more effective than face mask ventilation and an effective alternative to endotracheal intubation for neonatal resuscitation.

In addition, there are several case reports in literature citing successful use of LMA as a life-saving rescue airway when both BMV and endotracheal intubation were unsuccessful in resuscitation of neonates (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baraka-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Baraka 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brimacombe-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brimacombe 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brimacombe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brimacombe 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brimacombe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brimacombe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bucx-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bucx 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Denny-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Denny 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gandini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Gandini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mawer-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mawer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Traw_x00f6_ger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Trawöger 1999</LINK>).</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-13 13:28:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-13 13:26:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Despite the limitations of the evidence discussed here, it is reasonable to conclude that in infants with birth weight over 1500 g and more than 34 weeks' gestation, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is more effective during neonatal resuscitation compared to bag and face mask (BMV) for providing positive pressure ventilation. In studies that allowed LMA rescue of infants failing BMV, it was possible to avoid intubation in the majority. It is important that the clinical community resorts to the use of LMA more proactively to provide effective ventilation when a newborn is not responding to BMV before attempting intubation or initiating chest compressions. Further research could help to increase LMA use in practice for the subset of infants that were not included in the existing trials.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-13 13:28:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We found limited evidence of LMA use in very low birth weight newborns (&lt; 1500 g). There was also insufficient evidence to evaluate LMA in the setting of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, chest compressions, or for the delivery of emergency intratracheal medications. Large, international, multi-centre, randomised controlled clinical trials, enrolling both term- and preterm infants, should aim to answer the following questions:</P><OL><LI>The efficacy of LMA devices in specific resuscitation settings, i.e. involving chest compressions, administering emergency intratracheal medications, and for meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Include comparison of strategies using of LMA as the primary mode of ventilation versus use when BMV is unsuccessful.</LI><LI>The efficacy of LMA devices in newborns with orofacial malformations (such as cleft lip and palate) which prevent effective ventilation with a face mask, and clinical conditions involving micrognathia or anterior airways providing difficulty with endotracheal intubation.</LI><LI>Whether LMA would be safer than endotracheal intubation in terms of adverse events associated with endotracheal intubation insertion (e.g. pneumothorax and vocal cord injury).</LI><LI>Whether LMA insertion in newborns is an easier skill to acquire compared to endotracheal intubation insertion.</LI></OL></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-01-05 14:02:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The authors are grateful to Ms Liz Dennett (Librarian, John W Scott Health Sciences Library at the University of Alberta in Edmonton) for providing assistance with the literature search for this review.</P><P>We would like to acknowledge the original review authors, Andrew J.

Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses.

For studies in which study protocols were published in advance, we compared prespecified outcomes versus outcomes eventually reported in the published results. If the study protocol was not published in advance, we contacted study authors to gain access to the study protocol. We assessed the methods as:</P><UL><LI> low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI><LI> high risk (where not all the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI><LI> unclear risk.</LI></UL><P><I><B>7. Other sources of bias.

We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P><UL><LI> low risk;</LI><LI> high risk;</LI><LI> unclear risk</LI></UL><P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.<BR/></P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;7 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7 studies included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1 study included in previous version of review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6 new studies included&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;32 full-text articles assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;102 records screened&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;102 records after duplicates removed&lt;/p&gt;"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;106 records identified through database searching (2004 to 2017)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;20 additional records identified through other sources&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;70 records excluded&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;26 full-text articles excluded, with reasons&lt;/p&gt;"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
