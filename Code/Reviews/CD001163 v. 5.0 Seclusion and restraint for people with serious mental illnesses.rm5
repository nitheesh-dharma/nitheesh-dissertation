<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-05-16 12:22:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches of The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 1999) and The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 1999) were supplemented with additional searches of Biological Abstracts (1989-1999), CINAHL (1982-1999), EMbase (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), MEDIC (1979-1999), PsycLIT (1974-1999), Sociofile (1974-1999), SPRI &amp; SWEMED (1982-1999), Social Sciences Citation Index (1996-1999), and WILP (1983-1999). In addition, trials were sought by hand searching the reference lists of all identified studies and conference abstracts and contacting the first author of each relevant study.</P>
<P>We updated this search 10 May 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials were included if they focused on the use (i) of restraint or seclusion; or (ii) of strategies designed to reduce the need for restraint or seclusion in the treatment of serious mental illness.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Studies were reliably selected, quality rated and data extracted. For dichotomous data relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Normal continuous data were summated using the weighted mean difference (WMD).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-05-16 11:25:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Effect of seclusion and restraint<BR/>The search strategy yielded 2155 citations. Of these, the full articles for 35 studies were obtained. No studies met minimum inclusion criteria and no data were synthesised. Most of the 24 excluded studies focused upon the restraint of elderly, confused people and preventing them from wandering or falling.</P>
<P>2. Prevention of seclusion and restraint<BR/>Work ongoing.</P>
<P>3. Update search 2012: the 2 new citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the results and conclusions of the review once assessed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No controlled studies exist that evaluate the value of seclusion or restraint in those with serious mental illness. There are reports of serious adverse effects for these techniques in qualitative reviews. Alternative ways of dealing with unwanted or harmful behaviours need to be developed. Continuing use of seclusion or restraint must therefore be questioned from within well-designed and reported randomised trials that are generalisable to routine practice.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-16 12:14:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Seclusion and restraint are interventions used in the treatment and management of disruptive and violent behaviours in psychiatry (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1985</LINK>). Seclusion is the placement and retention of an inpatient in a bare room for containing a clinical situation that may result in a state of emergency. Restraint involves measures designed to confine a patient's bodily movements (<LINK REF="REF-Gutheil-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutheil 1995</LINK>). Seclusion and restraint are suggested to prevent injury and reduce agitation, but the use of seclusion and restraint can have substantial deleterious physical and more often psychological effects on both the patient and the staff (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>). It is claimed that seclusion and restraint reduce agitation and prevent injury (<LINK REF="REF-Gerlock-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerlock 1983</LINK>).</P>
<P>The theoretical foundations of seclusion, much debated in the literature, are based on whether it is a valid therapeutic intervention in itself, merely a method of containment of a psychiatric emergency or a form of punishment (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1993</LINK>). The reviewers know of no literature discussing differences between seclusion and restraint. The effect of these interventions on the frequency of aggressive incidents is not known (<LINK REF="STD-Nijman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nijman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of seclusion varies widely across institutions from 0 to 66% (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1992</LINK>). In a single group of state psychiatric hospitals, all operating the same policies and procedures, considerable variation in the rates of seclusion and restraint were found (<LINK REF="REF-Way-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Way 1990</LINK>). Hospitals with high use had a rate more than three times greater than hospitals with low usage. The rate of seclusion and restraint in the 23 hospitals ranged from 0.4 to 9.4% of patients. Only some of the differences between hospitals could be explained by patient characteristics and a large 'facility effect' was found (<LINK REF="REF-Way-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Way 1990</LINK>). The least restrictive principle is inconsistently used, and creative alternatives to confinement are not always employed (<LINK REF="REF-Aschen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aschen 1995</LINK>). There are only very few studies that calculate the relative risk of seclusion and restraint in different populations (<LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_yer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Höyer 1994</LINK>) and the characteristics of secluded or restraint patients also differ widely from one study to another (<LINK REF="REF-Swett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swett 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1995</LINK>). In addition, there are reports of patients treated effectively with no use or very little use of restraint and seclusion in many psychiatric settings (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some follow-up studies, despite political changes and changes in the size and mission of hospitals, rates of seclusion and restraint have not changed (<LINK REF="REF-Crenshaw-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crenshaw 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Salib-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salib 1998</LINK>). This has been used as evidence to show that seclusion of some disturbed patients will inevitably continue to be used. Further it has been suggested that when a patient cannot co-operate and is at a risk of being dangerous to himself or others seclusion may be the safest and most dignified intervention, especially if there are concerns arising from the patient's medical or psychiatric history (<LINK REF="REF-Farnham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farnham 1997</LINK>). Yet, few other forms of treatment which are applied to patients with various psychiatric diagnoses are so lacking in basic information about their proper use and efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Angold-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angold 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Violent incidents in psychiatric settings are frequent, serious, underreported and may be an increasing problem (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 1991</LINK>). They do not happen at random and warning signs often exist. These signs may, however, be difficult to identify and interpret (<LINK REF="REF-Owen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 1998</LINK>). Three means of controlling violence are verbal de-escalation, medication and/or physical restraint (<LINK REF="REF-Tardiff-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tardiff 1992</LINK>). The literature does offer numerous suggestions for aggression-reducing and preventing interventions. These include for instance suggestions for medication, staff training programs, approaches developed to de-escalate threatening situations, behavioral modifications methods and others (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Essock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essock 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Whittington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kalogjera-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalogjera 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 1995</LINK>). Relatively little is known about the effects of these interventions on the frequency of aggressive incidents (<LINK REF="STD-Nijman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nijman 1997</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To estimate the effects of seclusion and restraint measured against 'standard care or other alternative interventions for treating people who are violent or a serious danger to themselves or others. It was also proposed to identify any effects of the different techniques for staff.<BR/>2. To estimate the effects of strategies used to prevent the use of seclusion and restraint of mentally ill people.</P>

<P>3. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group&#8217;s Trials Register (May 2012)<BR/>
<BR/>We updated this search 10 May 2012. The Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group&#8217;s Trials Register. <BR/>
<BR/>The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group&#8217;s Trials Register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, handsearches and conference proceedings (see <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/SCHIZ/frame.html">group module</A>).</P>
<P>Trials identified through the searching activities are each assigned to awaiting classification of relevant review titles.</P>

<OTHER_SEARCHES MODIFIED="2008-10-31 14:42:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Reference searching<BR/>The references of all identified studies were also inspected for more trials. Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) (1974 to May 1999) was used to trace papers that had cited included trials. These reports were inspected in order to identify further trials. SciSearch and Social SciSearch (1974 to May 1998) were to be used to trace papers that had cited included trials. These reports were to be inspected in order to identify further trials.</P>
<P>2. Personal contact<BR/>The first author of each included study was contacted for information regarding unpublished trials.<BR/>
</P>
</OTHER_SEARCHES>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>[For definitions of terms used in this, and other sections, please refer to The Cochrane Library Glossary.] </P>
<P>1. Selection of trials for the review<BR/>The title and abstract of each reference identified by the search was inspected independently by both reviewers to assess its relevance. Where disagreement between the two reviewers occurred, the full article was obtained. Relevance was again assessed independently by both reviewers. Again, where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion and when this was not possible, further information was sought. These trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information.</P>
<P>2. Assessment of the methodological quality of the included trials.<BR/>The criteria included in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1999</LINK>) was used to assess the quality of the trials. It is based on the evidence of a strong relationship between the potential for bias in results and the concealment of allocation and is defined as below:<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment);<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (some doubt about the results);<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment).<BR/>Trials were included if they met the criteria A or B on this quality criteria.<BR/>The Jadad Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) was used to give a second quality rating to the relevant trials. </P>
<P>3. Data collection<BR/>Data from selected trials were independently extracted by both reviewers. When disputes arose, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the disagreement, the decisions documented and where necessary, the authors of the studies were contacted for clarification. Justification for excluding references from the review was documented. </P>
<P>4. Data synthesis<BR/>4.1 Incomplete data.<BR/>With the exception of the outcome of leaving the study early, trial outcomes were not included if more than 40% of people were not reported in the final analysis.</P>
<P>4.2 Dichotomous - yes/no - data.<BR/>As long as over 60% of people completed the study, everyone allocated to the intervention was counted, whether they completed the follow up or not. It was assumed that those who dropped out had the negative outcome, with the exception of death. </P>
<P>Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. If outcomes were heterogeneous calculations were based on the random effects model, as it takes into account any differences between studies. If outcomes were homogeneous, a fixed effects model was applied. Data were inspected to see if analysis using a Mantel Haenszel odds ratio made any substantive difference. Where possible, number needed to treat (NNT) was estimated from the weighted pooled relative risk estimate. </P>
<P>4.3 Continuous data.<BR/>4.3.1 Rating scales: A wide range of instruments are available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments minimum standards were set. They were that the psychometric properties of the instrument should have been described in a peer-reviewed journal.<BR/>4.3.2 Normal data: Mental health continuous data is often not 'normally' distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: <BR/>i. standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; <BR/>ii. if the data were scale-derived, or finite measures from, for example 0-100, the standard deviation was multiplied by two. If the result was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>) data were included in meta-analysis and presented in graphical form.<BR/>Data not meeting these standards were reported in the 'Other data types' of the 'Results' section if they had been analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests.</P>
<P>5. Heterogeneity<BR/>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed both by inspection of graphical presentations and by calculating a chi-square test of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was present any underlying explanation was sought. <BR/>The reviewers undertook a sensitivity analysis to the presence or absence of these data. All data from studies that have been selected were presented.</P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias<BR/>Data from all identified and selected trials were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias.</P>
<P>7. Tables and figures<BR/>Where possible data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for the intervention of interest.</P>

<P>Excluded studies<BR/>All 24 identified studies were excluded. For the full description of why these studies were not included, please see the Excluded studies table. Most did not meet minimum inclusion criteria for their methods, participants or interventions of interest. Most focused upon the restraint of elderly and confused people and on preventing wandering or falling.</P>
<P>Ten studies focused on restraining elderly people with either organic problems or physical ill health. Another was a preliminary report of a trial of room design to aid confused, physically ill people and a further two, investigating the value of restraining elderly confused people, did not use a control.</P>
<P>Four trials did not focus on interventions of interest - either adequate medication or psychosocial environments. A single randomised experiment focused on staff attitudes to using electric shocks of people before and after watching a video of a violent person and another investigated the value of different restraint techniques on healthy volunteers. One randomised trial of a single person investigated the value of different protective clothing on a 13-year-old adolescent with profound learning difficulties, and finally, four were surveys.</P>

<P>1. Effects of seclusion and restraint</P>
<P>Search<BR/>The search strategy yielded 2155 citations. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register yielded 1018 citations, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register 126, Biological Abstracts 207, CINAHL 48, EMbase 360, MEDIC zero, MEDLINE 123, PsycLIT 215, Sociofile 27, SPRI &amp; SWEMED one, SSCI 70 and WILP zero. Of these, the full articles for 35 studies were obtained. These same articles came up in several databases (The Cochrane Library CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycLIT). From these citations, 18 studies for potential inclusion were identified. No relevant additional studies were found by searching the references of excluded studies.</P>
<P>Lack of data<BR/>No studies using restraint or seclusion as an intervention measure in the treatment of psychiatric emergencies were found, but four studies had seclusion or restraint as an outcome. Not one paper fulfilled the pre-stated criteria of the reviewers. As has been discussed above, most studies focused on restraining elderly people with psycho-organic problems or physical ill health in order to prevent them from falling or wandering. There is a surprising and shocking lack of published trials assessing the effects of secluding or restraining people with schizophrenia or similar psychotic illnesses.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The reviewers acknowledge the very great difficulty of carrying out controlled trials in people with challenging behaviours. Nevertheless, the complete lack of trial-derived evidence regarding the effects of seclusion and restraint is surprising given the invasiveness of the intervention and its continued use over time. This dearth may highlight a belief that they are such effective, satisfactory interventions that there is not the need for evaluation in randomised trials. Counter to this is that certain researchers, not satisfied with the effects or nature of seclusion and restraint, have attempted to find creative alternatives (<LINK REF="STD-Nijman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nijman 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Randomising different techniques of seclusion and restraint, or comparing the former to alternatives, may be thought to be controversial. Conversely, continuing to use a poorly investigated set of 'invasive' treatments on very significant numbers of people (<LINK REF="REF-Way-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Way 1990</LINK>) may seem equally questionable. </P>
<P>Three studies were found that reported an improvement in control of aggression with adequate medication (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Essock-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Essock 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Sommerness-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommerness 1957</LINK>). Another trial used a psychosocial programme to reduce the number of episodes of seclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Gudeman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gudeman 1981</LINK>). These trials are not included in the review of effects of seclusion and restraint as they were not the primary interventions of interest. These will be included in the amended review, including also interventions aimed at reducing need for seclusion and restraint in those with serious mental illness.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In the absence of any controlled trials in those with serious mental illness, no recommendation can be made about the effectiveness, benefit or harmfulness of seclusion or restraint. In view of data from non-randomised studies, use should be minimised for ethical reasons. The use of seclusion or restraint should only be continued in the context of simple, pragmatic randomised trials given the marked variation between institutions and reports of harm in qualitative reviews. </P>
<P>No controlled studies to support the continued use of seclusion or restraint in clinical practice were found. As there are reports of serious adverse effects reported in qualitative reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>), randomised controlled trials are needed to test the benefits and harms of seclusion and restraint. Attempts must be made to find alternative methods of dealing with unwanted behaviours.</P>
<P>For those with serious mental illness and their relatives<BR/>No evidence exists to support or refute the use of these interventions. Although seclusion and restraint techniques are undoubtedly unpleasant, as strategies for preventing assault to others or harm to oneself, these containing treatments may still be both practical and safe. On the other hand, the use of seclusion and restraint could lead to greater morbidity and mortality than alternative drug or non-drug approaches. Those with serious mental illness and their relatives could well pre-specify which technique they would find preferable should their mental state or behaviour seriously deteriorate.</P>
<P>For practitioners<BR/>In the absence of any relevant controlled trials, no trial-based recommendations can be made about the effects of seclusion or restraint. In view of data from non-randomised studies, use should be minimised for ethical reasons (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>). It is arguable that, except for extreme circumstances, the use of seclusion or restraint should only be continued in the context of simple, pragmatic randomised trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Seclusion and restraint are used in the hope of preventing injury and reducing agitation, but qualitative studies have reported substantial deleterious physical, and, more often, psychological effects on both patients and staff (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1994</LINK>). Randomised studies are urgently needed. These could compare seclusion and restraint and other interventions such as adequate medication, alternative environments, psychosocial interventions or staff education. Randomised trials should be well planned, executed and reported. Randomising people recognisable in routine practice to generalisable interventions, and measuring simple, clinically relevant outcomes would greatly increase the value of these trials.</P>
