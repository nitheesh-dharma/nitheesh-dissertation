<P>There are no randomised trials that assess the effects of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring for lack of oxygen to babies' brains during labour.</P>
<P>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a light-based way of measuring oxygen flows through the brain. It can be used to try and see if a fetus is at risk of brain injury from lack of oxygen during labour. NIRS involves inserting a cable through the cervix (opening of the womb) and next to the baby's head. Near-infrared light is then transmitted through the skull and brain. The review found no trials assessing the effects of NIRS in labour.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Over the past four decades, continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) has been increasingly employed to detect fetal acidaemia in labour, with a view toward prevention of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, permanent neurologic injury, and death.

This false positive rate has resulted in operative intervention on behalf of many fetuses who were not in fact in danger of neurologic injury or death.

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-05 22:21:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Intrapartum hypoxemia is perhaps the most contentious cause of fetal brain injury. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed with the expectation that recognition of intrapartum hypoxemia followed by expedited delivery would protect fetuses at risk from brain injury or death. While highly sensitive for fetal hypoxemia, EFM has low specificity and a high false positive rate, often leading to unnecessary cesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1996</LINK>). Furthermore, most fetuses experiencing hypoxemia are protected from brain injury by redistribution of cardiac output. These fetuses are also unlikely to benefit from expedited delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Peebles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 1997</LINK>). Although currently accepted obstetric practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to determine whether expedited delivery will prevent fetal brain injury in the setting of fetal hypoxemia (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical technique designed to directly measure cerebral oxygenation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peebles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 1997</LINK>). This modality exploits the differing absorption characteristics of the oxygenated and reduced haemoglobin molecules. During labour, a device containing fibre optic bundles in a silicone rubber molding is introduced through the cervix and placed against the side of the fetal head (<LINK REF="REF-Peebles-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 1992</LINK>). NIR light (750 to 1000 nm wavelength) is transmitted through the fetal scalp, skull and brain and absorption is calculated by measurement of reflected light (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>). NIRS thereby allows for continuous intrapartum monitoring of changes in oxygenated haemoglobin, deoxygenated haemoglobin, and total haemoglobin. From the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin observed during uterine contractions, the mean oxygen saturation of cerebral haemoglobin can also be calculated. NIRS is the only current modality able to detect changes in cerebral blood flow during labour; by contrast, intrapartum fetal pulse oximetry measurement is designed to measure fetal arteriolar saturation, and does not directly assess cerebral oxygen delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Peebles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 1997</LINK>). In theory, NIRS may more accurately identify those fetuses truly at risk for brain injury in whom intervention is justified, and may avert operative intervention on behalf of those fetuses with normal cerebral perfusion. </P>
<P>This application of NIR light is not thought to pose risk to the fetus. The power density of the light emitted by the transmitting fibre is approximately one order of magnitude below international safety standards for skin and eye exposure to laser light (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>In a preliminary NIRS study, Aldrich et al demonstrated a significant positive correlation between intrapartum mean fetal cerebral oxygen saturation and umbilical artery and vein pH at birth. They also found a significant negative correlation between mean cerebral oxygen saturation and base deficit and carbon dioxide pressure at birth (<LINK REF="REF-Aldrich-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aldrich 1994</LINK>). An investigation comparing intrapartum measures obtained by fetal pulse oximetry with those obtained through NIRS found a positive correlation between the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin measured with NIRS and upper body oxygen saturation measured with fetal pulse oximetry (<LINK REF="REF-Seelbach_x002d_Gobel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seelbach-Gobel 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several technical limitations have prevented the development of NIRS technology to the point at which it could be evaluated by randomised trials with a view toward introduction into clinical practice. To date, investigators have found that satisfactory readings with NIRS can be obtained in only 50% to 65% of subjects studied. Poor skin contact and thick black fetal hair may lead to insufficient light penetration, and unsatisfactory readings. In addition, changes in interoptode spacing brought about by moulding of the fetal head or change in the probe position may lead to erroneous measurements (<LINK REF="REF-Chipchase-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chipchase 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peebles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 1997</LINK>). Intrapartum changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin similar to those in living fetuses have been observed in a fetus which had undergone intrauterine fetal demise two days previous to induction of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Until recently, NIRS technology allowed for measurement of only changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. New advances in optical technology, using a technique termed Intensity Modulated Optical Spectroscopy, have allowed calculation of absolute values for cerebral oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, cerebral oxygen saturation, and cerebral blood volume. Some investigators hypothesize that cerebral blood volume will be the parameter that will best allow clinicians to discriminate between those fetuses in whom hypoxemia is well-tolerated and those fetuses who are at risk of intrapartum brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Chipchase-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chipchase 2002</LINK>). However, further modifications of this technology are needed to increase the proportion of fetuses in whom satisfactory measurements can be obtained during labour. Until this is accomplished, randomised trials of this technology in clinical settings cannot be carried out (personal communication with Dr Donald Peebles (<LINK REF="REF-Peebles-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peebles 2005</LINK>)). </P>
<P>In summary, NIRS technology is currently a research tool (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2003</LINK>). This technique has potential clinical benefit because of its ability to directly measure fetal cerebral oxygenation and blood volume during labour. Further technological improvements must be made before it can be tested by randomised controlled trials and potentially introduced into clinical practice.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data if trials are sufficiently similar.</P>

Their sample sizes will be adjusted using the methods described in <LINK REF="REF-Gates-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gates 2005</LINK> using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, this will be reported and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster randomised trials and individually randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>We will apply tests of heterogeneity between trials, if appropriate, using the I² statistic. If we identify high levels of heterogeneity among the trials, (exceeding 50%), we will explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis and perform sensitivity analysis.
