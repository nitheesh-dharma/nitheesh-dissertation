<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-05 12:17:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Variceal bleeding in cirrhosis is associated with a high risk of death. Although banding ligation of varices is considered the choice for endoscopic treatment, emergency sclerotherapy is frequently used particularly where ligation is not available or when it is not feasible. However, vasoactive drugs stop bleeding in most patients, and emergency sclerotherapy may carry risks to the patient and is more demanding on the health-care system. All of the identified randomised clinical trials comparing emergency sclerotherapy with vasopressin (+/- intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide have been reviewed. A total of 17 randomised trials including 1817 patients were included. Sclerotherapy did not appear to be superior to the vasoactive drugs in terms of control of bleeding, number of transfusions, 42-day rebleeding and mortality, or rebleeding and mortality before other elective treatments. However, adverse events were significantly more frequent and severe with sclerotherapy than with vasoactive drugs.</P>

<P>Outcome measures were failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, rebleeding, mortality, number of blood transfusions, and adverse events.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-05 12:17:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Seventeen trials including 1817 patients were identified. Vasoactive drugs were vasopressin (one trial), terlipressin (one trial), somatostatin (five trials), and octreotide (ten trials). No significant differences were found comparing sclerotherapy with each vasoactive drug for any outcome. Combining all the trials irrespective of the vasoactive drug, the risk differences (95% confidence intervals) were failure to control bleeding -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), five-day failure rate -0.05 (-0.10 to 0.01), rebleeding 0.01 (-0.03 to 0.05), mortality (17 randomised trials, 1817 patients) -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.02), and transfused blood units (8 randomised trials, 849 patients) (weighted mean difference) -0.24 (-0.54 to 0.07).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:40:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We found no convincing evidence to support the use of emergency sclerotherapy for variceal bleeding in cirrhosis as the first, single treatment when compared with vasoactive drugs. Vasoactive drugs may be safe and effective whenever endoscopic therapy is not promptly available and seems to be associated with less adverse events than emergency sclerotherapy. Other meta-analyses and guidelines advocate that combined vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy is superior to either intervention alone.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-12 14:54:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Variceal rupture is the cause of 60% to 70% of upper digestive bleeding in patients with cirrhosis; the other more frequent causes are portal hypertensive gastropathy (20%) and gastric varices (5%). The mortality per episode of variceal bleeding ranges from 10% to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Chalasani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalasani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorbi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carbonel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carbonel 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Since it is difficult to define the duration of active variceal bleeding and when a new haematemesis or melaena should be considered a rebleeding episode, several consensus conferences stated definitions to design and report of clinical studies with regard to 'time zero', occurrence of bleeding and clinically significant bleeding, control of bleeding, and separating the index bleeding from rebleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of early rebleeding ranges between 10% to 20% during the first six weeks following variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorbi 2003</LINK>), becoming thereafter virtually equal to that of before bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1981</LINK>). Early rebleeding is significantly related to death within six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2003</LINK>), suggesting that its prevention should be a primary objective in the therapeutic approach to variceal bleeding.<BR/>
<BR/>Endoscopic therapy for bleeding oesophageal varices is widely used and currently recommended as a first-line treatment in combination with vasoactive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2008</LINK>). Moreover, if banding ligation is used, it allows starting a specific treatment for the prevention of long-term rebleeding, since it is also recommended as the preferred endoscopic prevention of variceal rebleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2008</LINK>). However, banding ligation is not always feasible and sclerotherapy is still used in 30% to 50% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Sorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorbi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2008</LINK>). Furthermore endoscopic emergency therapy requires a skilled endoscopist to be available and is associated with serious adverse events in 10% to 20% of the patients, also including some lethal adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norberto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norberto 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Yet, whether to use first vasoactive drugs or endoscopic therapy is still a matter of debate ( <LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorbi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>), and it has never been assessed whether it is more convenient to use endoscopic therapy only in vasoactive drug failures rather than in all patients.</P>
<P>The efficacy of emergency sclerotherapy has been compared with pharmacological treatments in several randomised clinical trials with inconsistent results (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK>), while no randomised trials have been reported comparing banding ligation with vasoactive treatments.</P>
<P>The widespread use of emergency endoscopy in cirrhotic patients with upper digestive bleeding is almost entirely based on the widely perceived superiority of emergency sclerotherapy or band ligation over pharmacological treatments for controlling variceal bleeding. Therefore, if the results of the available randomised trials would not support this superiority, a different approach to the emergency treatment of upper digestive bleeding in cirrhosis could be considered.</P>
<P>To investigate the benefits and harms of emergency endoscopic therapy compared with pharmacological therapy, we have previously performed a Cochrane systematic review including all the randomised trials available until April 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2002</LINK>). The conclusion of that review was that there was no convincing evidence that sclerotherapy is superior to vasoactive drugs for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. Since then, more randomised trials comparing emergency sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs have been published. We have, therefore, updated our previous review.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-08 16:20:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We performed the review following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Inclusion of trials</B>
<BR/>Decisions on which trials to include were taken independently by two of the authors (IT, GP), who were unblinded with regard to the names of the authors, investigators, institution, source, and results of the identified trials. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Excluded trials were identified with the reason for exclusion.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted by two independent authors (IT, GP). Discrepancies were solved by discussion. The following data were extracted from each trial: a) trial characteristics: time interval between hospital admission and randomisation, definition of each of the outcomes of interest; b) patients' characteristics: number of patients, mean age, sex, prevalence of alcoholic cirrhosis, Child-Pugh score, per cent of patients in each Child Pugh class, per cent of patients with ascites; c) treatments: sclerosant, modality of sclerotherapy, type and modality of control treatment, interventions other than the trial treatments and their specific indications; d) outcomes: number of patients with each of the outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>
<B>Methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Methodological quality was defined as the control of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). The randomisation methods (allocation sequence generation and concealment of treatment allocation) were extracted as measures of bias control. The generation of the allocation sequence was classified as adequate if based on a computer, random number table, or similar. Allocation concealment was classified as adequate if based on a central independent unit, serially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes, or on-site locked computer. Randomisation methods were classified as unclear when not described. Control of bias was considered adequate when both the allocation sequence generation and the allocation concealment were adequate. Blinding of outcome assessments, reporting of number and reasons for losses to the follow-up, and reporting of the intention-to-treat analysis were considered additional measures of methodological quality. The use of the same treatment in both trial groups for failures of the trial treatments and for the prevention of rebleeding were considered also additional measures of internal validity. There was only one quasi-randomised study among the retrieved trials, and it was excluded from the analysis. Double blinding was not assessed considering the nature of the interventions.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Combination of trials according to the intervention</B>
<BR/>Sclerosants and different modalities of performing emergency sclerotherapy are considered to be equivalent since there is no evidence that they may have different clinical efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>We decided to perform separate meta-analyses according to the type of vasoactive drug used as a control treatment because there are no definitive, convincing proofs that the vasoactive drugs we assessed as a control treatment for emergency sclerotherapy are equivalent. This position is supported both by haemodynamic and clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Pagan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Pagan 1999</LINK>) and holds true even when the native hormones vasopressin and somatostatin are compared with their analogues terlipressin and octreotide, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Pagan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Pagan 1999</LINK>). Randomised trials and meta-analyses have previously shown that terlipressin significantly reduces mortality when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannau 2003</LINK>). A similar effect has never been shown for somatostatin, octreotide, or vasopressin (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2008</LINK>). Double blind placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that somatostatin significantly reduces the five-day failure rate in controlling bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1990</LINK>). A similar beneficial effect was not found for octreotide (<LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1996</LINK>). Moreover, a meta-analysis has shown that somatostatin significantly reduces the failure rate of initial control of bleeding when compared with vasopressin (<LINK REF="REF-Imperiale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperiale 1995</LINK>). Adverse events are also significantly less frequent and serious with somatostatin and octreotide than with vasopressin or terlipressin (<LINK REF="REF-Imperiale-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imperiale 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ioannau-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannau 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>Analyses were performed by RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). Data were analysed by a random-effects model because of the expected clinical heterogeneity. The outcomes were presented as pooled risk differences according to Der Simonian &amp; Laird (<LINK REF="REF-Der-Simonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der Simonian 1986</LINK>) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Chi-square and I-square statistics are reported as estimates of intertrial heterogeneity. Analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat principle including all patients randomised as they were reported in each single study. For statistically significant risk differences (ie, when the 95% CI of the summary risk difference excludes 0), the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) and 95% CI were calculated by the reciprocal of the risk difference (<LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1988</LINK>). Likewise, the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) was calculated by the reciprocal of the risk difference of adverse events. All the results are plotted so that a risk difference less than zero favours sclerotherapy. The risk difference is reported as rate difference and not as percentage difference (for example, -0.15 instead of -15%).</P>
<P>To explore the robustness of results, we performed the following sensitivity analyses:</P>
<P>1. By combining all the included trials irrespective of the pharmacological treatment. We decided to perform this analysis because this is the most powerful sensitivity analysis, including the largest available number of patients, and because other reviews assessed the clinical efficacy of emergency sclerotherapy by combining all the randomised clinical trials independently on the pharmacological control treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Goulis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goulis 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK>)</P>
<P>1.1. By removing from the above analysis one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>), which included patients only after the control of the initial bleeding for the assessment of treatment effect on mortality.</P>
<P>2. By including only the trials published as full reports.</P>
<P>3. By including only the trials with adequate control of bias.</P>
<P>4. By including only the trials comparing sclerotherapy versus somatostatin but excluding the Escorsell 1998 trial as in 1.1.</P>

<P>The strategy searches yielded a total of 1092 references - full text publications or abstracts. Among these, 1058 were excluded because of the following reasons: a) non-randomised trial; b) duplicate report of the same study; c) emergency sclerotherapy compared with non-pharmacological treatments; d) sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal bleeding; e) sclerotherapy for the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding; f) review articles. Thirty-four studies were eligible for the present meta-analysis according to the above reported criteria: 17 studies were excluded for the reasons reported in the table 'Characteristics of excluded studies' and 17 randomised trials were included. Of the included randomised trials, three are still available only as abstracts (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=72062692966520391505091208152948&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Di-Febo-1990#STD-Di-Febo-1990">Di Febo 1990</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=72062692966520391505091208152948&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Poo-1996#STD-Poo-1996">Poo 1996</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=72062692966520391505091208152948&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Lopez-1999#STD-Lopez-1999">Lopez 1999</A>) after 19, 13, and 10 years of their reports; the remaining 14 randomised trials are available as full reports.</P>
<P>The characteristics of the included randomised trials are reported in the tables 'Characteristics of included studies' and additional <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?version=72062692966520391505091208152948&amp;format=REVMAN#TBL-01#TBL-01">Table 1</A>.

<P>The median (and range) of the most relevant patient and trial characteristics were: sample size 76 patients (40 to 368 patients), median or mean age 55 years (41 to 61 years), males 68% (32% to 83%), alcoholic aetiology of cirrhosis 64% (22% to 91%), Child-Pugh class A 18% (0% to 59%), Child-Pugh class B 42% (31% to 62%), and Child-Pugh class C 34% (13% to 54%). Information on the time frame from hospital admission to randomisation was reported only in seven trials: the median was 5.5 hours (range 2 to 46 hours).</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus vasopressin</B>
<BR/>We only identified one eligible trial (<LINK REF="STD-Westaby-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Westaby 1989</LINK>). Immediate sclerotherapy was compared with a 12-hour vasopressin and nitroglycerin infusion. After 12 hours all the patients in the medical treatment group underwent sclerotherapy, which provided the patients a different and more precise assessment of their bleeding than to patients in the sclerotherapy group. The latter group of patients underwent repeated endoscopy only in the case of suspected persistence of bleeding. Sclerotherapy was thereafter continued weekly in both groups until variceal obliteration.</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus terlipressin</B>
<BR/>We only identified one eligible trial (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 2000</LINK>). This is the largest reported trial of emergency sclerotherapy. Patients were randomised at the time of diagnostic endoscopy, and treatment started immediately. Terlipressin was administered intravenously (iv) 2 mg every 4 hours until control of bleeding up to a maximum of 48 hours, and 1 mg every 4 hours thereafter for five more days. All patients underwent the same long-term rebleeding prevention program after the sixth to seventh study day.</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus somatostatin</B>
<BR/>We identified five trials, one available only as abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Febo 1990</LINK>) and four as full reports (<LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>). Only patients with proven variceal bleeding were included, and randomisation was carried out at diagnostic endoscopy or immediately after in all the four trials. The Escorsell et al trial assessed the treatment efficacy in preventing early rebleeding and death (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>). Patients consecutively admitted for acute, endoscopically proven variceal bleeding were included in this trial after control of acute bleeding: this was defined as a 24 hour bleeding-free period. Only patients achieving control of bleeding within 48 hours of hospital admission were included in the trial. We decided to include this trial for the assessment of the treatment effect on rebleeding, as the trial population was very similar to that of all the other included trials. When assessing the treatment effect for mortality, we decided to perform a sensitivity analysis by excluding this trial since patients who died of uncontrollable bleeding had not been included in the trial resulting in an overall 42-day mortality slightly lower than expected if patients with acute bleeding had been included.</P>
<P>Doses of somatostatin and modality of administration were identical across the five trials (initial bolus of 250 µg followed by continuous iv infusion of 250 µg/h); in only one trial boluses were repeated six-hourly for 24 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>). The duration of therapy was 48 hours in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Febo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>) and 120 hours in the other two. Sclerosant and modality of sclerotherapy were not reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Febo 1990</LINK>). In the other trials, 1% polydocanol or 5% ethanolamine were used. Polidocanol was injected either intra- or para-variceally and ethanolamine intra-variceally. A single sclerotherapy session was performed in the four fully reported trials; no details were given in the abstract. Immediate or 48 hour bleeding control, and five and seven day treatment failure were the principal outcomes assessed. After the initial five-day study period, the same treatment for the prevention of long-term recurrence of bleeding was given in both groups in three fully published trials; no details were reported in the abstract and in one full report (<LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>). Four trials assessed 30- or 42-day outcome, while in one only 7-day mortality was reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus octreotide</B>
<BR/>We identified ten trials. Two are still available only as abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>), and eight are full reports (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>). Only patients with proven variceal bleeding were included, and treatment was started immediately after randomisation, which was performed during the diagnostic endoscopy in eight trials; randomisation was performed immediately after endoscopy in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>) while the time of randomisation was unclear in one (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>). Octreotide was given as a continuous iv infusion of 50 µg/h in all the trials. However, the infusion was continued for 12 hours in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>), 24 hours in one (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>), 48 hours in five (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>), 72 hours in one (<LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>), and 120 hours in one (<LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>). In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>), octreotide was then administered by subcutaneous 100 µg or 50 µg injections every eight hours for 72 hours after the 48 hour iv infusion, making the total therapy duration 120 hours. Sclerotherapy was done by intra-paravariceal 1% to 2% polidocanol, absolute ethanol, sodium tetradecyl sulphate, or ethanolamine (details in table Characteristics of included studies). Following the initial study period, patients entered a long-term elective sclerotherapy program in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>) and a randomised trial for long-term prevention of recurrent bleeding in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>). The treatment given for the prevention of long-term rebleeding was not reported in the two abstracts (<LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>) and in three full reports (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>). The main outcomes reported were failure to control bleeding and rebleeding during the study treatment period (or up to 50 hours thereafter in the <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK> et al trial). Mortality was reported at 3- to 5-day in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>) and at 30- to 60-day in the remainder.</P>
<P>
<B>Definitions of the outcomes in the included trials</B>
<BR/>The details of the used definitions are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Failure to control bleeding</I>
<BR/>In the 17 trials, failure to control bleeding was defined as evidence of haematemesis, melaena, blood in the gastric aspirate, and/or unstable haemodynamic parameters and haemoglobin level. Time to evaluate failure to control bleeding varied markedly across studies, ranging from 10 to 20 minutes to 148 hours. Seven trials did not state a minimum bleeding-free interval to consider the bleeding as having been controlled.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Five-day treatment failure</I>
<BR/>Five-day treatment failure was reported in ten trials, and in eight it was defined as failure to control bleeding or recurrence of bleeding or death within five days of treatment, while no definition was reported in two.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Recurrence of bleeding</I>
<BR/>The evidence for recurrence of bleeding was defined by the same criteria as for failure to control bleeding. We used the 42 days rebleeding rate. When a study reported rebleeding at a different time, the figure at the longest available time interval, up to 42-day, was used.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Recurrence of bleeding before other elective treatments for the prevention of rebleeding</I>
<BR/>This was not specifically defined in any of the included trials. The rebleeding rate recorded at the end of the experimental treatment period was, however, reported in 13/17 trials.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Mortality</I>
<BR/>The overall 42-day mortality was evaluated in this review regardless of the cause of death. This was decided in agreement with several consensus conferences (<LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 2000</LINK>), stating that any death occurring within 42 days after a variceal bleeding should be assumed to be caused by the bleeding per se, independent of the ultimate cause of death. When a study reported mortality at a different time, the figure at the longest available time interval, up to 42 days, was used.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Mortality before other elective treatments for the prevention of re-bleeding</I>
<BR/>As for the recurrence of bleeding, this was not specifically defined in any of the included trials. The mortality recorded at the end of the experimental treatment period was, however, reported in 7/17 trials.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Number of blood transfusions</I>
<BR/>Only eight trials reported criteria to give blood transfusions. These were based on the target of maintaining the haematocrit or haemoglobin within a certain range or to maintain vital parameters stable.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Adverse events</I>
<BR/>No specific definitions were a priori reported.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Serious adverse events</I>
<BR/>No specific definitions were a priori reported. Only three trials stated that adverse events were considered serious when they required specific treatment or withdrawal of the experimental treatment.</P>

<P>Details on the quality of each trial are reported in the <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> 'Methodological quality of included studies'.</P>
<P>Control of bias was adequate only in six trials: one using terlipressin (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 2000</LINK>), two somatostatin (<LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>), and three octreotide (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>) as control treatment. None of the trials reported blinded outcome assessment. Information on patients lost to the follow-up was not reported in five trials, and in eight trials, an intention-to-treat analysis was not reported or the information was unclear. Treatments for failures of the trial interventions and for prevention of rebleeding were not reported in three and four trials, respectively. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>), eight patients were excluded after randomisation because of important protocol violations, which were reported in detail: eligibility criteria were not fulfilled in six and adjunctive sclerotherapy sessions were done in two. The randomised treatment and the outcome of these patients were not reported, and therefore, a complete intention-to-treat analysis was not possible. In general, a major problem in the majority of trials, particularly those of octreotide, was the insufficient methodology for observing and recording adverse events, which were reported without any attempt to graduate their severity.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-02-08 16:27:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus vasopressin</B>
<BR/>Sixty-four patients were included in the trial comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin (<LINK REF="STD-Westaby-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Westaby 1989</LINK>). Randomisation was performed at the time of the first endoscopy when a diagnosis of variceal bleeding was made. Sclerotherapy was performed immediately in patients randomised to this treatment. Failure to control bleeding was significantly reduced by sclerotherapy (RD -0.23; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.03): the potential assessment bias above reported (see description of studies) was not accounted for nor commented upon. Rebleeding and mortality were recorded at the end of the stay in hospital. It is also worth to note that all the patients in both groups were given weekly sessions of elective sclerotherapy until variceal eradication. With these limitations, the risk difference for re-bleeding was -0.04 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.26) and for mortality -0.11 (95% CI -0.34 to 0.11). No significant differences were found between the two intervention groups in the number of transfusions and adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus terlipressin</B>
<BR/>The only trial comparing sclerotherapy with terlipressin (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 2000</LINK>) included 219 patients and showed no significant difference in failure to control bleeding (RD -0.02; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09) and five day treatment failure (RD -0.02; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.11). The 42-day re-bleeding risk difference was 0.01 (95% CI -0.11 to 0.12). However, after the six to seven days study period, the patients were given various types of elective therapy to prevent recurrent bleeding, according to the protocol prevailing at each participating centre. Whether these treatments were comparable between the two study groups was not shown in the trial report, although it is conceivable that they were. The re-bleeding before these treatments was 14% in both groups. Also the 42-day mortality was similar for the two treatment groups (RD -0.08; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.03). However, mortality before other elective treatments was not reported. The mean difference (MD) for the number of blood transfusions was 0.20 (-1.01 to 1.41), and also adverse events were not significantly different in the two intervention groups (RD 0.10; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.21). Eight patients in the sclerotherapy group experienced serious adverse events (three got aspiration pneumonia, four got bleeding oesophageal ulcer, and one got sepsis from pleural empyema resulting in death). In the terlipressin group the patients who experienced serious adverse events were four (two got lower limb ischaemia, one got severe hyponatraemia, and one got seizures). The RD between the two treatments was 0.03 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.09).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus somatostatin</B>
<BR/>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Febo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>), including 237 patients, assessed failure to control initial bleeding and did not observe a significant difference between the two treatments (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.05). Five-day failure was assessed in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>) including overall 249 patients, and no significant difference was found between the two treatments (RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.07). Since the other three trials reported the seven-day treatment failure rate (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Febo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Di Febo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ramires-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ramires 2000</LINK>), we also performed a post-hoc analysis by including all the five trials (406 patients): the overall five to seven day treatment failure rate was -0.07 (95%CI -0.17 to 0.03).</P>
<P>In the Escorsell et al trial (<LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>), the re-bleeding rate was reported both at the end of the five-day somatostatin infusion and at 42 days. In the other trials, re-bleeding was assessed before other elective treatments were started: at five days in Shields et al trial and at seven days in the three remaining trials. No significant difference was found on the overall re-bleeding rate (4 randomised trials, 406 patients: RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.03) or on the re-bleeding before other elective treatments (5 randomised trials, 406 patients: RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.11 to 0.03).</P>
<P>The mortality did not differ significantly between the two interventions (5 randomised trials, 406 patients: RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.05). This was also the case regarding mortality before other elective treatments (reported only by <LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK> and including overall 150 patients: RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.07). Also after exclusion of the Escorsell et al trial, no significant difference in mortality was found (RD -0.06; 95% CI -0.17 to 0.05). When the only trial with adequate control of bias and reporting mortality before other treatments was considered (<LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>), the RD between the two treatments was 0.00 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.15).</P>
<P>The number of blood transfusions was reported in the three fully published trials. No statistically significant differences were found between the treatment groups in any of them. The mean difference was assessable only in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>) including 239 patients: 0.48 (95% CI -1.79 to 2.75). There was an important heterogeneity between the two trials (Chi-square = 3.73, P = 0.05; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 73%), probably accounted for by the different definitions used for the need of the transfusion of one blood unit.</P>
<P>Adverse events were reported in four trials (366 patients) and were significantly more frequent in the sclerotherapy group than in the somatostatin group (RD 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; NNH = 7 patients x 2; 95% CI 4 to 14). Severe adverse events were reported only in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Planas-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Planas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Escorsell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Escorsell 1998</LINK>), including 319 patients, and were observed only in sclerotherapy treated patients: the pooled risk difference was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.13) without significant heterogeneity (Chi-square = 3.51; P = 0.17) (NNH = 14, 95% CI 8 to 100). Severe adverse events were observed in 12/155 patients treated by sclerotherapy and included four deaths (two oesophageal perforation, one sepsis, one pleural empyema), five clinically significant bleeding from oesophageal ulcers, one cerebrovascular accident and pulmonary embolism, one pulmonary embolism, and one bacterial peritonitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Sclerotherapy versus octreotide</B>
<BR/>A total of 1128 patients were included in the ten randomised trials comparing sclerotherapy with octreotide. Failure to control bleeding was not significantly different between the two treatments (RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04).</P>
<P>Five-day treatment failure was reported only in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>): RD -0.14 (95%CI -0.30 to 0.03). In two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>), a similar definition of treatment failure was given, although the outcome was assessed at 48 hours. We, therefore, performed a post-hoc analysis by pooling the four trials (341 patients), which confirmed the lack of significant difference between the two treatments (RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.04).</P>
<P>Re-bleeding was assessed at 48 hours in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>), 72 hours in two (<LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>), 120 hours in two (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>), 168 hours in one (<LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>), and 30 days in one (<LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>). In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>), early re-bleeding was reported without specifying the time frame, and in one, re-bleeding was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>). A total of 1064 patients were included in the nine trials. The pooled RD was 0.02 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.08). The re-bleeding rate before other elective treatments was reported in five trials (486 patients) and the RD was -0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.05).</P>
<P>Mortality was assessed at 72 hours in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>), 120 hours days in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>), 7 days in one (<LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>), 30 days or while in hospital in five (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>), and 42 days in two (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>). The pooled RD (10 randomised trials, 1128 patients) was -0.01 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.04). Mortality before other elective treatments was reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>) including 521 patients, and the RD was -0.00 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.04).</P>
<P>Transfusion requirement was not reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shaikh-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shaikh 2002</LINK>); it was reported as the median number of blood units transfused (3.0 in the sclerotherapy group and 3.5 in the octreotide group, P = 0.34, Mann-Whitney U test) in one (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>). In five trials, the mean number of blood units transfused and standard deviation was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silva-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Silva 2004</LINK>): the mean difference in these four trials, which included 391 patients, was -0.20 (95% CI -0.60 to 0.20), without significant heterogeneity (Chi-square = 3.36, P = 0.36).</P>
<P>Adverse events were reported in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sung-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sung 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poo-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Poo 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jenkins-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Jenkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sivri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sivri 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yousuf-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yousuf 2000</LINK>). Lopez et al reported that thoracic pain was observed in nine patients and oesophageal ulcers in 12 patients in the sclerotherapy group, whereas in the octreotide group only transient hyperglycaemia was observed (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 1999</LINK>). However, the number of patients with hyperglycaemia was not reported. In the other trials, all the observed adverse events were reported without qualification of their severity. Only the <LINK REF="STD-Bildozola-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bildozola 2000</LINK> et al trial stated that sclerotherapy produced four major complications (aspiration pneumonia in two patients, perforation in one, and pericardial effusion in one) whereas no major complications were observed in the octreotide group. When the six trials reporting complete data are combined (529 patients), the pooled RD was 0.06 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.15). However, there was significant heterogeneity (Chi-square = 13.81, P = 0.02; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63.8%).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-08 16:11:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This systematic review included 17 randomised trials and a total of 1817 patients. Although, in general, the combinability of the trials was acceptable and no significant heterogeneity was found, there was appreciable diversity of the methodological quality, and study conduct important to be aware of when translating the overall estimates here provided into clinical practice.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the included trials was in general unsatisfactory, with only five trials reporting adequate control of selection bias as assessed by the method of generation of the randomisation list and of treatment allocation concealment. In none of the included trials a blinded design was adopted. However, it is unlikely that unblinded assessment of bleeding or death, the major outcomes assessed in the included trials and in this systematic review, may lead to biased conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Other criteria of internal validity, like completeness of follow-up, other treatments used for failure of control of bleeding and for prevention of re-bleeding were also unsatisfactorily reported; therefore, any potential bias deriving from them was not adequately evaluable.</P>
<P>There were appreciable differences across trials in the definitions of the major outcomes. This was particularly evident for the definition of failure to control bleeding. The most important difference concerned the time of assessment of the initial control of bleeding, which varied from 10 to 20 minutes in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shields-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shields 1992</LINK>) to 48 hours in most of the other trials. However, a bleeding-free interval was usually required to consider a bleeding as controlled and to separate a re-bleeding from the index bleeding, making the definitions of these outcomes satisfactorily reproducible in clinical practice. Five-day treatment failure was assessed in a few trials, and most of them included in their definition failure to control bleeding, recurrence of bleeding, and death. In some trials these criteria were used to define treatment failure 48 hours or seven days after randomisation.</P>
<P>In most trials the 42-day, or in-hospital re-bleeding, or mortality was reported as a major treatment outcome measure, even when other elective treatments were performed between the end of the experimental treatment and the time when the outcome was recorded. Moreover, these adjunctive elective treatments were not always reported. Although there is consensus that any death, occurring within six weeks after an upper digestive bleeding in cirrhosis, should be considered as a bleeding-related death (<LINK REF="REF-Burroughs-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burroughs 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 2000</LINK>), it is hard to relate this relatively late mortality to a treatment ended 30 or 40 days earlier. Many factors have been reported as being significantly associated with six-week mortality after variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 1997</LINK>). All of them should be properly accounted for when assessing the relation of a treatment with mortality in this time interval. Of course, a major factor to be accounted for is the treatment given for the long-term prevention of recurrent bleeding, since several treatments used to this aim are given as early as possible following the initial control of bleeding and are also associated with significant improvement of survival (<LINK REF="REF-Jalan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jalan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>). To overcome this problem, we abstracted also the re-bleeding and mortality before other elective treatments were given. For re-bleeding, this information was reported in 10/17 trials, including 1071 patients, and for mortality in seven trials, including 681 patients. The analysis of these outcome measures confirmed that emergency sclerotherapy is not significantly superior to vasoactive drugs for acute variceal bleeding.</P>
<P>It is of interest that most of the included trials did not report the criteria to give a patient a blood transfusion although a formal statistical analysis of the difference of blood transfusions between the treatment groups was provided. When significant, this difference was also reported as a proof of treatment efficacy. However, it is hard to draw conclusions using this outcome measure, considering the many variables included in the decision to give a transfusion. Furthermore, as these trials were unblinded, such an outcome measure may be significantly biased. The inconsistency of sensitivity analyses with respect to this outcome may probably be explained at least in part by such considerations.</P>
<P>Problems similar to those encountered with blood transfusions may have affected the assessment of adverse events. The adverse events were never a priori defined and the criteria to assess an event as an adverse event were never reported. Blind assessment of adverse events was never attempted or at least was never reported. Only very few trials reported a distinction between non-serious or serious adverse events. With these limitations, adverse events were more frequent with sclerotherapy than with terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide (significantly so when compared with somatostatin), whereas no significant difference was found in the trial comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin. In the sensitivity analysis including all the trials both adverse events and serious adverse events were significantly more frequent with sclerotherapy.</P>
<P>This systematic review showed that emergency sclerotherapy is not significantly superior to any of the vasoactive drugs - vasopressin (with or without nitroglycerin), terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide - with regard to any of the assessed efficacy outcomes and may even carry a higher burden of adverse events.</P>
<P>Only the trial comparing sclerotherapy with vasopressin showed a significant reduction of failure to control bleeding with sclerotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Westaby-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Westaby 1989</LINK>). In this trial, however, there was an important potential bias in the assessment of this outcome because all the patients in the vasopressin group underwent sclerotherapy at the end of the 12-hour study period. Thus, endoscopy provided a more precise method of evaluating the persistence of bleeding in this group as compared with the sclerotherapy group, in which endoscopy was repeated only if bleeding was clinically suspected. It is hard to evaluate how this potential bias did actually affect the conclusions drawn in the trial. However, it is important to note that among all the included trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs, this trial was the only one showing superiority of sclerotherapy in controlling initial bleeding.</P>
<P>The similar effect of sclerotherapy and pharmacological therapy on re-bleeding and death was also confirmed when the corresponding outcome rates before any other elective treatment were considered. The absence of any significant difference between sclerotherapy and vasoactive drugs was even more evident when all the trials were combined, independently of the control treatment used: in this analysis no significant differences were found with regard to failure to control bleeding, five-day treatment failure, re-bleeding, and mortality, while a significant increase of adverse events and serious adverse events was associated with sclerotherapy. These results were consistently confirmed in the analyses including only the full reports and only the trials with adequate control of bias.</P>
<P>The results of the present meta-analysis are in contrast with a recently reported review of randomised trials comparing sclerotherapy with vasoactive drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK>). However, that review included a total of 15 randomised trials and 1322 patients compared with 17 randomised trials and 1817 patients in the present. Moreover, one of the 15 trials (<LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Jackie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Jackie 1998</LINK>) included by <LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK> was excluded from our meta-analysis because it enrolled only patients with schistosomal portal hypertension, while we included only cirrhotic patients. In fact, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-El_x002d_Jackie-1998" TYPE="STUDY">El-Jackie 1998</LINK> behaved as an outlier in the Triantos' review with the 95% CI for failure to control bleeding completely outside of the CI of the overall estimate. Besides this, that trial is still in abstract 10 years after its initial report. With that trial among the 15 included, <LINK REF="REF-Triantos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Triantos 2006</LINK> et al found a RD of -0.059 (95% CI from -0.103 to -0.015) for failure to control bleeding and -0.043 (95% CI from -0.081 to -0.006) for mortality. It is important to note that the overall estimates are quite similar to those we found, with small differences between the two treatments. However, the inclusion of the trial in non-cirrhotic patients, whose mortality at variceal bleeding is generally lower than in cirrhotic patients, makes the differences to be statistically significant, although the difference for mortality is very close to non significance.</P>
<P>Moreover, we based our meta-analysis on separate analyses according to the different pharmacological interventions, for the reasons reported in the methods, and performed the analysis including all the trials as a sensitivity analysis to identify even small effects by increasing the power of the analysis. We did not find any beneficial effect of sclerotherapy neither when compared with each single vasoactive drug nor when all the trials were included, independently of the pharmacological control therapy.</P>

<P>
<B>Limitations</B>
</P>
<P>There are several major limitations for application of this meta-analysis in clinical practice. First, current guidelines and recent consensus conferences have recommended the use of combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy as a first<B> </B>line treatment for acute variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-De-Franchis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Franchis 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2008</LINK>). This recommendation is based on the evidence that the combination therapy is more effective than either therapy alone (<LINK REF="REF-Banares-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banares 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-G-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico G 2002</LINK>) in the control of bleeding. Second, band ligation is considered to be superior to sclerotherapy for acute variceal bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Lo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Avgerinos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avgerinos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villanueva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanueva 2006</LINK>), and this has been confirmed also in patients receiving somatostatin prior to endoscopic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Villanueva-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanueva 2006</LINK>). Moreover, the administration of somatostatin before sclerotherapy is associated with better control of bleeding and makes sclerotherapy easier (<LINK REF="REF-Avgerinos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avgerinos 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Perspectives</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence shows that emergency sclerotherapy does not significantly improve the outcome of cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding when compared with vasopressin, terlipressin, somatostatin, or octreotide. It is, however, associated with more frequent and serious adverse events, and it puts the treatment of acute variceal bleeding in a new perspective. In fact, sclerotherapy, which is still largely used (<LINK REF="REF-Sorbi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorbi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bosch-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosch 2008</LINK>), may be safely delayed in places where emergency endoscopy is not available on a 24 hours basis. Moreover, endoscopic therapy may be easier and safer if performed after starting vasoactive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Avgerinos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avgerinos 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Villanueva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanueva 1999</LINK>). In fact, vasoactive treatment is recommended as soon as an underlying cirrhosis is suspected in a patient with upper digestive bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>). Since there are no randomised trials comparing emergency band ligation of varices with vasoactive therapy, these conceptions might also be extended to band ligation. Furthermore, it has never been assessed whether the combination of vasoactive and endoscopic therapy in all patients is superior to the association of endoscopic therapy to vasoactive drugs only in pharmacological failures. This is important because the association of endoscopic therapy significantly increases the risk of adverse reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Villanueva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanueva 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-D_x0027_Amico-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">D'Amico 2009</LINK>). Yet, the assumption that emergency band ligation may start the elective treatment for prevention of long-term re-bleeding has been challenged by a recently reported randomised trial, showing that the combination of ligation with nadolol and 5-isosorbide-nononitrate (ISMN) is not significantly superior to nadolol and ISMN (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Pagan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Pagan 2009</LINK>). Therefore, patients with variceal bleeding controlled by vasoactive therapy might not need to be treated also with ligation or sclerotherapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-03 11:40:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Current guidelines for the treatment of variceal bleeding recommend the association of endoscopic and pharmacological therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Tsao-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Tsao 2007</LINK>). However, whether immediate combination of endoscopic therapy with vasoactive drugs is superior to the combination therapy only when pharmacological therapy fails (vasoactive drug plus eventual banding or sclerotherapy), should be assessed in well-planned randomised trials.</P>
<P>In future randomised trials on acute bleeding varices in cirrhosis, the guidelines set at the previous consensus conferences should be followed, including the reporting of results in prognostically important subgroups, criteria for blood transfusions, and the methodology for assessing adverse treatment effects. Such trials ought to be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (www.consort-statement.org).</P>
