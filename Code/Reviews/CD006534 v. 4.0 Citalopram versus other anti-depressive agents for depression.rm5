<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:57:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate-to-severe major depression. During the last 20 years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have progressively become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first SSRIs introduced in the market, is the racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomer. In the present review we assessed the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Thirty-seven randomised controlled trials (more than 6000 participants) were included in the present review. In terms of efficacy, citalopram was more efficacious than other reference compounds like paroxetine or reboxetine, but worse than escitalopram. In terms of side effects, citalopram was more acceptable than older antidepressants, like tricyclics. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations including differences in efficacy and side-effect profiles.</P>

<P>Thirty-seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non-conventional, like <I>hypericum</I>). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively).</P>

<P>Some statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-11 14:18:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Major depression is generally diagnosed when a persistent and unreactive low mood and/or loss of interest and pleasure are accompanied by a range of symptoms including appetite loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, psychomotor symptoms, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). It was the third leading cause of burden among all diseases in the year 2004 and it is expected to be the greatest cause in 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>). This condition is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Although pharmacological and psychological interventions are both effective for major depression, in primary and secondary care settings antidepressant (AD) drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Amongst ADs many different agents are available, including tricyclics (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, such as venlafaxine, duloxetine and milnacipran), and other agents (mirtazapine, reboxetine, bupropion). During the last 20 years, ADs prescription has dramatically risen in western countries, mainly because of the increasing prescription of SSRIs which have progressively become the most commonly prescribed ADs (<LINK REF="REF-Ciuna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciuna 2004</LINK>). SSRIs are generally more acceptable than TCAs, and there is evidence of similar efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). However, head-to-head comparisons have provided contrasting findings (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2006</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-11 14:13:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Citalopram hydrobromide is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has been available as an antidepressant since the 1980s in US and Europe. It is also available in many countries for anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder. Citalopram is a racemic dicyclic phthalane derivative designated (±)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5carbonitrile (www.fda.gov). Citalopram has a chemical structure unrelated to that of other SSRIs or of tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other available antidepressant agents. Therefore, some differential clinical potency may be expected, not only between the drugs classes but also among the SSRIs.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-11 14:14:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhibition of the neuronal transporter for serotonin has long been established as one of the mechanisms of action of numerous antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Barker-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barker 1995</LINK>). Citalopram is a dicyclic phthalide derivative and its effect is due to a specific inhibition of the re-uptake of serotonin in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 1994</LINK>). Citalopram is a highly selective and potent SSRI with minimal effects on the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). Citalopram has no or very low affinity for a series of receptors including serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopamine D1, and D2, a1-, a2-, b-adrenergic, histamine H1, muscarinic cholinergic, benzodiazepine, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and opioid receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Stahl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stahl 1998</LINK>). Citalopram has a pronounced tissue distribution and its binding to human plasma proteins is about 80%. Maximum concentration in blood is reached after one to six hours and the steady state concentration in blood is reached after one to two weeks. Protein binding is about 14L/k and the half-life is about 36 hours, (possibly longer for the elderly). The drug is metabolized before it is excreted. Citalopram is metabolized in the liver and the biotransformation of citalopram to its demethyl metabolites depends on both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, with a small contribution from CYP2D6.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-11 14:15:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To shed light on the field of antidepressant trials and the treatment of major depression, a group of researchers agreed to join forces under the rubric of the Meta-Analyses of New Generation Antidepressants Study Group (MANGA Study Group) to systematically review all available evidence for each specific newer antidepressant. We have up to now completed some individual reviews about fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005a</LINK>), sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009b</LINK>), escitalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009c</LINK>), milnacipran (<LINK REF="REF-Nakagawa-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakagawa 2009</LINK>), fluvoxamine (<LINK REF="REF-Omori-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Omori 2010</LINK>), and a number of other reviews are now underway. Thus, the aim of the present review is to assess the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with TCAs, heterocyclics, MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs and other antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.</P>

We included the following subtypes of depression: chronic, with catatonic features, with melancholic features, with atypical features, with postpartum onset, and with seasonal pattern. We also included studies in which up to 20% of patients presented depressive episodes in bipolar affective disorder. A concurrent secondary diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder was not considered an exclusion criterion. A concurrent primary diagnosis of Axis I or II disorders was an exclusion criterion.

Due to a lack of consistent reporting of side effects, which came primarily from the study authors' descriptions, we combined terms describing similar side effects; for example, we combined "dry mouth", "reduced salivation" and "thirst" into "dry mouth".

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">1. Cross-over trials</HEADING>
<P>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g., pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence, on entry to the second phase, the participants can differ systematically from their initial state, despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in major depression, we only used data from the first phase of the cross-over studies.</P>

<P>
<B>1. Dichotomous data</B>
</P>
<P>Responders and remitters to treatment were calculated on the strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: dropouts were included in this analysis. Where participants had been excluded from the trial before the endpoint, we assumed that they experienced a negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g., failure to respond to treatment). We examined the validity of this decision in sensitivity analyses by applying worst- and best-case scenarios. We applied the loose ITT analyses for continuous variables, whereby all the patients with at least one post-baseline measurement were represented by their last observations carried forward (LOCF), with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced.</P>
<P>When dichotomous outcomes were not reported but baseline mean, endpoint mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the HRSD (or other depression scale) were provided, we converted continuous outcome data expressed as mean and SD into the number of responding and remitted patients, according to the validated imputation method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>). We examined the validity of this imputation in the sensitivity analyses. Where SDs were not reported, authors were asked to supply the data. When only the standard error (SE) or t-statistics or P values were reported, SDs were calculated according to Altman (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). In the absence of data from the authors, we substituted SDs by those reported in other studies in the review (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2012-06-11 14:35:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the primary analysis we used a random-effects model OR, which had the highest generalisability in our empirical examination of summary effect measures for meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002a</LINK>). The robustness of this summary measure was routinely examined by checking the fixed-effect model OR and the random-effects model risk ratio (RR). Material differences between the models were reported. A P value of less than 0.05 and a 95% CI were considered statistically significant. Fixed-effect analyses were performed routinely for the continuous outcomes as well, to investigate the effect of the choice of method on the estimates. Material differences between the models were reported. Skewed data and non-quantitative data were presented descriptively. An outcome was considered skewed when the mean was smaller than twice the SD. In terms of change score, data were difficult to depict as skewed or not, as the possibility existed for negative values; therefore, we entered all of the results of this outcome into a meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2012-06-11 16:47:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>We performed the following subgroup analyses for the primary outcome where possible, for the following <I>a priori </I>reasons. Results were interpreted with caution, since multiple comparisons could lead to false positive conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>1. Citalopram dosing (fixed low dosage, fixed standard dosage, fixed high dosage; flexible low dosage, flexible standard dosage, flexible high dosage)</B> Existing evidence implies that low dosage antidepressants may be associated with better outcomes - both in terms of efficacy and side effects - than standard or high dosage antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Bollini-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bollini 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002b</LINK>). In addition, a fixed versus flexible dosing schedule may affect estimates of treatment effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). In the case of citalopram, based on the Defined Daily Dosage (DDD) by WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>a), low dosage is referred to as &lt; 20, standard dosage to &gt;= 20 but &lt; 40, and high dosage to &gt;= 40 mg/day. We categorised studies by intended maximum dosage of citalopram.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Comparator dosing (low dosage, standard dosage, and high dosage)</B> It is easy to imagine that people taking a comparator drug are less likely to complete a study if they are taking a high dosage of the comparator drug. We categorised studies by the intended maximum dose of the comparator based on the DDD.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Depression severity (severe major depression, moderate/mild major depression)</B> "Severe major depression" was defined by a threshold baseline severity score for entry of 25 or more for HRSD and 31 or more for MADRS (<LINK REF="REF-Dozois-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dozois 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Müller 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>4. Treatment settings (psychiatric in-patients, psychiatric outpatients, primary care)</B> Because depressive disorder in primary care has a different profile than that of psychiatric in-patients or outpatients (<LINK REF="REF-Suh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suh 1997</LINK>), it is possible that results obtained from either of these settings may not be applicable to the other settings (<LINK REF="REF-Depression-Guideline-Panel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Depression Guideline Panel 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>5. Elderly patients (&gt;= 65 years of age), separately from other adult patients</B> Older people may be more vulnerable to side effects associated with antidepressants and decreased dosage is often recommended for them (<LINK REF="REF-Depression-Guideline-Panel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Depression Guideline Panel 1993</LINK>).Because the number of <I>a priori</I> planned subgroup analyses now appears excessive in comparison with the identified studies, we will consider reducing the number of subgroup analyses or adjusting the level of significance to account for making multiple comparisons in the next update.</P>

<OL>
<LI>We excluded trials with unclear concealment of random allocation and/or unclear double blinding.</LI>

<LI>We performed the best-case scenario ITT: that all patients in the experimental group experienced the positive outcome and all those in the comparison group experienced the negative outcome.</LI>
<LI>We excluded trials for which the response rates had to be calculated based on the imputation method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2005</LINK>) and for which the SD had to be borrowed from other trials (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We examined a "wish bias" by comparing the trials where citalopram was used as an investigational drug, the drug that was used as a new compound, to the trials where citalopram was used as a comparator, since some evidence suggests that a new antidepressant might perform worse when used as a comparator than when used as an investigational agent (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We excluded trials funded by, or with at least one author affiliated with, a pharmaceutical company marketing citalopram.

The translation process is still ongoing, so in the present review we considered all Chinese studies as awaiting assessment studies (we will include them in the next update of the review, which is expected to be in a two years time). An additional four studies were considered as awaiting assessment because the papers reported insufficient information to decide about inclusion or exclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Ahlfors-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Ahlfors 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galecki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Galecki 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moeller-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Moeller 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2008</LINK>).

In the remaining three studies the setting was unclear. About two thirds of the participants were women. In 31 RCTs patients had a formal diagnosis of major depression (or major depressive disorder) according to DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria. In six studies the diagnosis was based on different standardized research criteria (i.e., Feighner criteria).</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions and comparators</B>
</P>
<P>We found RCTs comparing citalopram with TCAs (amitriptyline, imipramine and nortriptyline), tetracycles (mianserin and maprotiline), other SSRIs (escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine and paroxetine), one SNRI (namely, venlafaxine), one MAOI (moclobemide), other conventional ADs (mirtazapine and reboxetine) and also only one non-conventional ADs (St John's wort, or <I>hypericum</I>). <I>Hypericum</I>, a member of the <I>Hypericaceae</I> family, has been used in folk medicine for a long time for a range of indications including depressive disorders. It is licensed and widely used in Germany for the treatment of depressive, anxiety and sleep disorders and in recent years it has also become increasingly popular in other European and non-European countries (<LINK REF="REF-Linde-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Details on the included studies are as follows: nine studies (overall 1277 participants) comparing citalopram with TCAs (four studies versus amitriptyline, two versus imipramine and two studies versus nortriptyline and one study versus clomipramine, respectively); three studies (overall 477 participants) comparing citalopram with tetracyclics (two studies versus mianserin and one study versus maprotiline); 18 studies (overall 4200 participants) comparing citalopram with SSRIs (seven studies versus escitalopram, four studies versus fluoxetine), four studies versus sertraline, one study versus fluvoxamine, one study versus paroxetine and one study versus either escitalopram or sertraline); six studies (overall 1137 participants) comparing citalopram with SNRIs (one study versus each of the following drugs: venlafaxine and mirtazapine), comparing citalopram with MAOI (one study versus moclobemide), comparing citalopram with other conventional psychotropic drugs (two studies versus reboxetine), comparing citalopram with non-conventional antidepressants (one study versus <I>hypericum</I>).</P>
<P>There were four three-arm trials: one study comparing citalopram (20 mg/day) with escitalopram 20 mg/day or escitalopram 10 mg/day; one study comparing citalopram (20-60 mg/day) with amitriptyline (150-300 mg/day) or fluoxetine (20-60 mg/day); one study comparing citalopram 10-30 mg/day with citalopram 20-60 mg/day or imipramine (50-150 mg/day); one study compared citalopram (20 mg/day) with escitalopram 10 mg/day or citalopram 10 mg/day. One four-arm trial compared citalopram 20 mg/day with citalopram 40 mg/day or paroxetine controlled-release 12.5 mg/day or paroxetine controlled-release 25 mg/day.</P>

<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Of the included 37 studies, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1986</LINK>) did not report efficacy data and one study reported split data according to different genotypes (<LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2011</LINK>). We were not able to obtain further data for these trials because we could not contact the authors by any means and therefore, could not obtain extra information from these authors. By contrast, all 37 studies did report tolerability/acceptability data that could be entered into a meta-analysis The great majority of the identified studies (34 out of 37 RCTs) used the MADRS or HRSD as the rating scale of choice for primary or secondary outcome measures. Among the 35 studies reporting dropouts due to any reason, 31 reported dropouts due to side effects. Twenty-eight studies reported the number of patients experiencing individual side effects.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-07 11:21:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis included 37 trials that compared citalopram versus other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability. The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review and only a small number of trials per comparison was found for most ADs (with the exception of escitalopram). The present review showed that citalopram should be considered for treating depression because it was significantly more effective than other ADs (reboxetine and paroxetine) and appeared to be more acceptable than other AD, like tricyclics. The finding that citalopram was less effective than escitalopram should be carefully interpreted considering that all trials included in this comparison were sponsored by the manufacturer of both drugs, and therefore, the possibility of wish bias cannot be ruled out (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2004</LINK>). The dataset of the present review collected insufficient randomised evidence to detect a difference in early response to treatment (within four weeks of treatment). Looking at the data reported in the trials included in this systematic review, the question on comparative efficacy of early onset response has yet to be proven and remains a matter of ongoing debate (<LINK REF="REF-Gourion-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gourion 2008</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-11 15:07:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has long been argued that placebo controlled trials are required to adequately demonstrate the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009a</LINK>), however, in the present review we focused only on the comparison between citalopram and other active treatments. Retrieved randomised evidence compared citalopram with a selection of possible comparator antidepressants but only a few studies per comparison were found. Although the search was thorough, it is still possible that there are unpublished studies that have not been identified but the small number of trials identified per comparison hinders the detection of any publication bias. Although we did our very best to retrieve as much data as possible, through asking pharmaceutical companies and study authors to supply all available information, we can assume that data from some trials are still lacking, most of which are likely to be studies with negative findings. We are also aware of the possibility that a number of additional randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing citalopram with other antidepressant drugs are currently being conducted and will be included in future updates of the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-11 16:47:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All included studies were RCTs and were very similar in design and conduct. Using high-quality research evidence is relevant to review results and to speed translation of research in a way that really responds to clinically relevant questions. However, the quality of RCTs is not easy to assess and the problem of study quality is relevant for interpreting results and for usefulness of results in practice. Despite the fact that RCTs are the best methodological standards for clinical research, included studies failed to report key methodological issues. For example, the majority of trials still do not report adequate information about methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. The reporting of the outcomes in the included studies was often unclear or incomplete and the figures used for the analyses not immediately understandable. The scant information about randomisation and allocation concealment may be a matter of reporting in the text rather than real defects in study design. However, sometimes there were some discrepancies between published reports and unpublished data available on the websites of the pharmaceutical industries. When dealing with summary statistics, the quality of information is important. Meta-analyses of poor quality studies may be seriously misleading (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2005</LINK>), because the bias associated with defects in the conduct of primary studies (randomised trials) can seriously affect overall estimates of intervention. Systematic reviewers (not only within The Cochrane Collaboration) should routinely assess the risk of bias in the results of trials, and should report meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-06-11 15:08:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some possible limitations of this review should be noted.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We had to impute the response rate, our primary outcome, for some of the included trials. However, we consider that imputation of response and remission rates by a validated statistical method (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2006</LINK>) in our review should minimize the risk of bias. Nevertheless, we regret that we were unable to do a sensitivity analysis excluding trials with imputed response rates. As we update this review and assemble more trials involving citalopram, we hope to conduct such a sensitivity analysis and be able to examine if our conclusions are robust.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>By making multiple comparisons we might have committed a type 1 error, that is, identifying and reporting a spurious association. As stated in the review protocol, we did not carry out a Bonferroni correction. As many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Pharmaceutical industry sponsor. Most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, and these have been shown to be more than four times likely to demonstrate positive effects of the sponsors' drug as independent studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lexchin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lexchin 2003</LINK>). The sponsorship bias may play a role also in the issue related to the comparison between citalopram and escitalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Leonard-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leonard 2010</LINK>). Citalopram is the racemic mixture of S-citalopram and R-citalopram and escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of the racemate citalopram (<LINK REF="REF-Sanchez-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanchez 2004</LINK>). As for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind, as we found marked heterogeneity for the escitalopram comparisons. So, results reported for comparative efficacy favouring escitalopram have therefore to be viewed with caution because a possible inflation of efficacy in favour of escitalopram cannot be ruled out. We asked Lundbeck to have access to individual patient data and we are still waiting for a reply (last contact via e-mail correspondence: June 2010)</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Economic evaluation. In the present review only one RCT reported economic outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Hosak-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hosak 1999</LINK>). The authors concluded that limitation of prescription of SSRIs in Czech Republic by health insurance companies did not appear to lead to cost savings, while it may have led to unnecessary patients' suffering due to adverse events of TCAs. Given that several SSRIs and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>In this review we decided to focus on treatment response because it is one of the main goals for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The term &#8220;treatment response&#8221; describes a state of improvement in the patient&#8217;s condition of sufficient quality to result in treating the physician&#8217;s impression of at least a moderate degree of global improvement, conventionally defined as a reduction of at least 50% in depressive symptomatology. However, from a clinical point of view, the ultimate goal of the acute treatment phase of major depressive disorder may well be to achieve remission. Full remission from depression correlates with better longer-term functional recovery, lower risk of relapse and higher level of patients satisfaction than partial response (without remission). Thus, one important limitation of the included trials (and consequently of the present review) is that only a few studies reported remission rates, underpowering the analysis and undermining the possibility to find significant differences between comparisons. Moreover, outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians, in particular, patients&#8217; and their carers&#8217; attitudes to treatment, their ability to return to work and resume normal social functioning, were not reported in the included studies.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>In this review we included only RCTs. As debate in the scientific literature, one of the main limitations of efficacy trials is to include patients far from &#8220;real world&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Rothwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rothwell 2005</LINK>). When drafting the systematic review protocol, we did our best to include as much evidence as possible to inform clinical practice, balancing internal with external validity (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009d</LINK>). This is the reason why we included single-blind or non-blind randomised studies, but on the other hand, decided to exclude patients with medical comorbidity.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>As expected, in this review only a few studies reported data about suicide and deliberate self-harm (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2004</LINK>). Deliberate self-harm, particularly suicide, is often thought to be a relatively &#8220;hard&#8221; outcome in studies of antidepressants, but enormous scope exists for ascertainment bias. Observational evidence offers insights into long-term and real-world outcomes for large groups of people, but it can rarely show a convincing causal relation between two events (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2007</LINK>). Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials may increase statistical power, but absolute numbers of patients having rare adverse events such as completed or attempted suicide are low. Thus, reporting or not reporting a few cases can completely change the overall outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2005b</LINK>).</LI>

Results from this review are consistent with this interpretation and might contribute to developing and keeping up to date an evidence-based hierarchy of antidepressants to be used by clinicians (both specialists and general practitioners) (<LINK REF="REF-Barbui-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbui 2011</LINK>). Even though citalopram was not among the best treatments in terms of efficacy, it scored well in terms of acceptability and remains an important option for physicians when an AD is to be prescribed for moderate-to-severe major depression.</P>

<P>Results described in this systematic review come from a set of randomised studies that are in many cases financially supported by pharmaceutical industries. Industry-sponsored trials tend to follow a standard design which involves short-term, double-blind, parallel-group studies of patients with acute episodes or exacerbations of chronic illness. Moreover, it is known that economic support by drug manufacturer can strongly influence progress of research and its results. Consequently, there is a risk that these studies do not provide sufficient and adequate information to clinicians in real-world settings. Studies should be conducted with the intent of provide clinicians with useful practical data regarding the comparative effectiveness of marketed medications, and consider rating scale but also pragmatic outcome measures (for example hospitalisations, return to work, social functioning and so on). Considering the methodological limitation of standard systematic reviews that rely only on evidence from direct comparisons and given the wide spectrum of available comparisons for the treatment of major depression, the use of the methodology of multiple treatments meta-analysis (MTM) may provide a more informative and clinically useful summary of the results that can be used to guide treatment decisions.</P>

<P>The present study was part of the S-citalopram development program for approval in some European Countries through a bridging procedure using results from studies of the racemate, citalopram. Care and medication were free of charge for the patients enrolled in the trial. This study was specifically designed a priori as a superiority study. The sample size was calculated using Singer&#8217;s method. The largest between-group difference was estimated at 5 points, with an SD of 12. Given this assumption, and with an a level of 5% (2-tailed) and a b level of 20%, it was calculated that 100 patients per arm would be needed to achieve sufficient power. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate, 10 additional patients per arm were included in the design to ensure sufficient power, giving 110 patients per arm (330 patients in total). This research was sponsored by OOO ARBACOM (Moscow, Federation of Russia) (it's unclear the relationship with the escitalopram manufacturer).</P>
