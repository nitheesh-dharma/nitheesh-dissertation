<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-22 11:04:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure for inserting a feeding tube that goes into the stomach (through the abdomen) of patients who cannot take food by mouth. Antibiotics are often given intravenously before this surgical procedure, as a precaution to reduce the risk of infection at the site of operation. Thirteen research studies were included in this review, and they confirm that those people who were given antibiotics when their PEG tube was inserted were less likely to suffer an infection at the site than those who were not given antibiotics.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-02-14 17:46:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure performed to maintain nutrition in the short- or long-term. During the procedure, a feeding tube that delivers either a liquid diet, or medication, via a clean or sterile delivery system, is placed surgically through the anterior abdominal wall. Those undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection because of age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression, or underlying disease processes such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus. The increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) contributes both an additional risk to the placement procedure, and to the debate surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement. The aim of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is to establish a bactericidal concentration of an antimicrobial drug in the patient's serum and tissues, via a brief course of an appropriate agent, by the time of PEG tube placement in order to prevent any peristomal infections that might result from the procedure.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-13 12:25:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-11 15:02:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an endoscopic technique used to surgically place a feeding tube into the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Geeganage--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geeganage 2012</LINK>). PEG tubes are used to maintain adequate nutrition in the short- or long-term. PEG placement was first described over 20 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Gauderer-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauderer 1980</LINK>), and has since become a convenient, relatively safe and simple procedure. PEG tubes can be used to deliver a liquid diet, as well as medication, via a clean, or sterile, delivery system.</P>
<P>PEG tube placement may be required when patients have:</P>
<UL>
<LI>an altered level of consciousness;</LI>
<LI>dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing);</LI>
<LI>tumour(s);</LI>
<LI>had a neurological event;</LI>
<LI>tracheal-oesophageal fistula; or</LI>
<LI>chronic reflux problems.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(<LINK REF="REF-Tham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tham 1997</LINK>) suggested that PEG tube placement was contraindicated in patients with rapidly-progressing, incurable disease, and in those who were likely to recover from their swallowing difficulties quickly, for example, some stroke patients. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Skelly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skelly 2002</LINK> did not recommend PEG tube placement in patients who were in a permanent vegetative state, and produced a decision-making algorithm which stated that patients with anorexia-cachexia syndromes should not be offered them either.</P>
<P>Placement of a PEG tube is usually undertaken by a doctor with the aid of an assistant (often a nurse) - although the changing role of the nurse may mean that nurses could undertake this procedure at some point in the future. A choice of techniques is available. These include pushing, or pulling, through an introducer, with the pull through technique being the most widely used. The 'pull' technique involves the use of an endoscope to guide placement of the tube, which is pulled through the mouth, oesophagus, stomach and abdominal wall to the outside. The 'push' technique uses an endoscope to illuminate and insufflate the stomach in order to guide placement of the tube, then a trocar is pushed through the abdominal wall from the outside and the PEG tube is fed into the abdominal wall over a guide-wire.</P>
<P>Those undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection for a variety of reasons including old age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression and underlying disease such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2002</LINK>). As the increase in the incidence of meticillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> (MRSA) poses an additional risk for the procedure, there is debate concerning the merits of antibiotic prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Ogundipe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogundipe 2004</LINK>), and whether MRSA naso-pharyngeal colonisation may be a predictor of peristomal infection in PEG tube placement by means of the pull technique (<LINK REF="STD-Hull-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2001</LINK>). Infection associated with PEG tube placement accounts for many of the minor, major and fatal complications incurred by patients with PEG tubes (<LINK REF="REF-Calton-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calton 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholson 2000</LINK>). Superficial surgical site infections (i.e. peristomal) caused by PEG tube placement involve skin, or subcutaneous tissue, and at least one of the following: pus; a swab with more than 10<SUP>6</SUP> colony forming units (cfu) per mm³ tissue; pain; localised swelling; redness and heat; as diagnosed by the attending clinician (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). The procedure has a mortality rate of approximately 2% (<LINK REF="REF-Skelly-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skelly 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Antimicrobial agents destroy or inhibit the multiplication of bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2002</LINK>). Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery comprises a very brief course of an antimicrobial agent, often initiated intravenously just before the operation begins, which may continue for a set period of time post-operatively. Delivery of the initial dose of an antimicrobial agent ensures that a prophylactic, bactericidal concentration of the drug is present in the serum and tissues by the time the skin is incised (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of prophylactic antibiotics for PEG tube placement was published in 2000 (<LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK>
<U>)</U>. This review supported the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the procedure, and, currently, both national and international guidelines advocate the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rey 1998</LINK>). One US study performed a cost analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement, which was based on seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and found it a cost-effective strategy in the prevention of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Kulling-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kulling 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review on the subject was originally justified, as the review by <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK> has not been updated, and contained methodological weaknesses; specifically, it was limited to published studies, with no attempts made to retrieve unpublished work. For the updated Cochrane review (this is the third update) we undertook new searches and attempted to retrieve unpublished studies as well as any newly-published studies. Before the first update was published in 2008, another systematic review was published that confirmed the need for prophylactic antibiotics<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Jafri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jafri 2007</LINK>), and calculated on the basis of numbers-needed-to-treat that penicillin-based prophylaxis was more effective than cephalosporin-based prophylaxis.</P>

We assessed heterogeneity between study results using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This examines the percentage total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than to chance. Values of I<SUP>2 </SUP>over 75% indicate a high level of heterogeneity. In instances where statistical synthesis would have been clinically inappropriate, we undertook a narrative overview.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Peristomal infection was the primary outcome in all trials. All trials used explicit criteria for assessment of peristomal infection. A wide range of other outcomes were identified by some authors, such as adverse effects of PEG, mortality, gastric pH, high levels of C reactive protein, white blood cell count, cost of antibiotic prophylaxis, major complications, post intervention antibiotic therapy, the role of oropharyngeal flora, and comparison between 'push' and 'pull' techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Akkersdijk-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Akkersdijk 1995</LINK>), however, measurements were individual to each study.</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Panigrahi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Panigrahi 2002</LINK>), used the ASEPSIS criteria (see <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1995</LINK>), while another (<LINK REF="STD-Shastri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shastri 2008</LINK>) used the criteria devised by <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gossner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gossner 1999</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Shastri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shastri 2008</LINK>). Three trials stated specific criteria for diagnosis of peristomal infection; these included redness, purulent discharge and the need for antibiotics based on judgement of physician (<LINK REF="STD-Akkersdijk-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Akkersdijk 1995</LINK>), or a red zone around the catheter, occurrence of pus, subcutaneous swelling and pain on palpation around the catheter, positive bacterial culture, high levels of C reactive protein and a high white blood cell count (<LINK REF="STD-Blomberg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blomberg 2010</LINK>), or redness, tenderness, induration, pus, local fever, and systemic leukocytosis (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 1985</LINK>).

The <LINK REF="STD-Dormann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dormann 2000</LINK> study was based on a minimum group size of 100 at a significance level of P = 0.05, but no power was stated. Four trials based their power calculations on an infection rate of 30% to 35% in the control group reducing to between 7% and 5 % with prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dormann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dormann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saadeddin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Saadeddin 2005</LINK>). In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Preclik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Preclik 1999</LINK>, a sample size of 180 patients was calculated to detect a reduction in peristomal and other infections from 20% to 5% in the antibiotic group. An interim calculation was performed part way through because the reduction in infection had been achieved, and the study was prematurely terminated with 106 patients in two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Blomberg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blomberg 2010</LINK> calculated the need for 89 or 112 patients to establish non-inferiority at 80% power and significance level of 5% assuming infection rates of 15 or 20% in both groups respectively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sources of funding</HEADING>
<P>One study was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Preclik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Preclik 1999</LINK>), and one of the study authors (K Madchka) was employed by the pharmaceutical company that manufactured the antibiotic used in the trial. Another study included data from an ongoing study funded by a pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Dormann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dormann 2000</LINK>) but it is unclear if this introduced bias. Eight trials did not report any sponsorship, and two trials reported 'no grants received' (<LINK REF="STD-Radhakrishnan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Radhakrishnan 2006</LINK>) and 'no disclosures' (<LINK REF="STD-Shastri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shastri 2008</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-19 08:35:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review support the use of systemic antibiotics and show that broad spectrum antibiotics are effective against peristomal infection in PEG tube placement. This supports current UK, European and USA guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BSG-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BSG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Locke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locke 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rey 1998</LINK>), and two previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Jafri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jafri 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The included trials were of a reasonable quality, and, although based on relatively small numbers, power calculations (where performed) suggested adequate sample sizes had been used (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blomberg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blomberg 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dormann-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dormann 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jain-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Preclik-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Preclik 1999</LINK>). The trials with inadequate allocation concealment showed fewer infections in the antibiotic groups than the trials with adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The push method was used in at least two studies. <LINK REF="STD-Shastri-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shastri 2008</LINK> used the push method alone, <LINK REF="STD-Akkersdijk-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Akkersdijk 1995</LINK> compared push and pull methods and one study did not specify the method (<LINK REF="STD-Sturgis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sturgis 1996</LINK>). It is possible that pushing the PEG device through the abdominal wall, rather than pulling it though the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract, could avoid the risk of contamination by naso-pharyngeal organisms including MRSA. This route may therefore negate the need for systemic prophylactic antibiotics. Further robust studies using the push method are needed to establish the evidence base.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis of twelve trials included in the review, comparing antibiotics with antibiotics or placebo or no intervention or skin antiseptic, showed a consistently beneficial effect for antibiotics. In one trial antibiotics plus a skin antiseptic were employed with more favourable results than antibiotic alone (<LINK REF="STD-Radhakrishnan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Radhakrishnan 2006</LINK>), however, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved.</P>
<P>Follow-up was insufficient in some trials (3-30 days) which may have reduced the statistical power of the studies, particularly in the light of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation for a 30-day follow-up period to ensure that all surgical site infections are captured (<LINK REF="REF-Mangram-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangram 1999</LINK>). Blinding in two trials may have been compromised, as PEG delivery of antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Blomberg-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Blomberg 2010</LINK>) and the use of the skin antiseptic could not be disguised (<LINK REF="STD-Radhakrishnan-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Radhakrishnan 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics were used in all the trials reviewed. The type of antibiotics used depended on the origin of the study, as the recommendations given by UK, European and USA societies of gastroenterology cited different evidence available at the times of publication. Much of the current guidance is based on the trials included in this review. For example, one German study (<LINK REF="STD-Gossner-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gossner 1999</LINK>) used piperacillin and tazobactam in comparison with cefotaxime. Both these drugs are recommended as part of the European Society guidance (<LINK REF="STD-Rey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rey 1998</LINK>). One systematic review found that only six patients needed to be treated to prevent one peristomal infection when penicillin-based antibiotics were administered, compared to 10 patients for cephalosporin-based antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Jafri-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jafri 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were prescribing differences between trials with regard to method of delivery, dose, and timing of antibiotics. The method of delivery was intravenous, by bolus or infusion, or by bolus via PEG catheter in all trials. Intravenous delivery is the UK standard for systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-BMA-and-RPS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BMA and RPS 2004</LINK>). The dose of antibiotics given for prophylaxis was generally in accordance with routine formulary prescribing guidance for each drug used. Timing and length of administration of the systemic antibiotics varied between trials. The aim of antibiotics is to establish a bactericidal concentration in the tissues prior to PEG tube placement. This may have been compromised in the trials in which administration was not completed until immediately before PEG tube placement.</P>
<P>In summary, prophylactic antibiotics in PEG tube placement using the 'pull' method result in a statistically significant reduction in the number of peristomal infections.</P>

<P>No further research is needed to answer this question using the pull method. However, the 'push' method is becoming a more popular technique with limited evidence of effectiveness. A robust randomised controlled trial with sufficient power is recommended to compare the need for antibiotics using the push and pull methods. A research study comparing the use of antiseptics with and without antibiotics is recommended as there is some evidence to suggest that antiseptics combined with antibiotics may be more effective than antibiotics alone.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
