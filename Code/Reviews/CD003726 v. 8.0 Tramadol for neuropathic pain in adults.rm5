<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-28 07:50:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Bottom line</B>
</P>
<P>We found low-quality evidence that oral tramadol has any important beneficial effect on pain in people with moderate or severe neuropathic pain. There is very little evidence from which to take these conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain is pain coming spontaneously or abnormally from damaged nerves. It is different from pain messages that are carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (a fall or cut, or burns). Neuropathic pain is often treated by different medicines (drugs) to those used for pain from damaged tissue, which we call painkillers.</P>
<P>Opioid painkillers (drugs like morphine) are sometimes used to treat neuropathic pain. Morphine is derived from plants, but many opioids are made in a laboratory rather than being extracted from plants. Tramadol is a laboratory-synthesised opioid drug.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In January 2017, we searched for clinical trials in which tramadol was used to treat neuropathic pain in adults. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, randomising 438 participants to treatment with tramadol or placebo. Study duration was between four and six weeks. Not all reported the outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>Our definition of a good result was someone who had a high level of pain relief and was able to keep taking the medicine without side effects that made them stop treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results </B>
</P>
<P>Three small studies reported that pain was reduced by half or better in some people. Pain reduction by half or better was experienced by 5 in 10 with tramadol and 3 in 10 with placebo. Side effects were experienced by 6 in 10 with tramadol and 3 in 10 with placebo, and 2 in 10 with tramadol and almost no-one with placebo stopped taking the medicine because of side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was mostly of low or very low quality. This means that the research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect and that the likelihood is very high that the effect will be different from what is shown in the analysis of these trials. Small studies like those in this review tend to overestimate results of treatment compared to the effects found in larger, better studies. There were also other problems that might lead to over-optimistic results. The low-quality evidence and the lack of any important benefit mean that we need new, large trials before we will know if tramadol is useful for the management of neuropathic pain.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-05-23 11:53:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>This review is an update of a review of tramadol for neuropathic pain, published in 2006; updating was to bring the review in line with current standards. Neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, may be central or peripheral in origin. Peripheral neuropathic pain often includes symptoms such as burning or shooting sensations, abnormal sensitivity to normally painless stimuli, or an increased sensitivity to normally painful stimuli. Neuropathic pain is a common symptom in many diseases of the peripheral nervous system.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-04-24 12:34:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the analgesic efficacy of tramadol compared with placebo or other active interventions for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:27:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-01-10 11:00:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing tramadol (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:27:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:28:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>We identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 438 participants with suitably characterised neuropathic pain. In each, tramadol was started at a dose of about 100 mg daily and increased over one to two weeks to a maximum of 400 mg daily or the maximum tolerated dose, and then maintained for the remainder of the study. Participants had experienced moderate or severe neuropathic pain for at least three months due to cancer, cancer treatment, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or polyneuropathy. The mean age was 50 to 67 years with approximately equal numbers of men and women. Exclusions were typically people with other significant comorbidity or pain from other causes. Study duration for treatments was four to six weeks, and two studies had a cross-over design.</P>
<P>Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest, and there were limited data for pain outcomes. At least 50% pain intensity reduction was reported in three studies (265 participants, 110 events). Using a random-effects analysis, 70/132 (53%) had at least 50% pain relief with tramadol, and 40/133 (30%) with placebo; the risk ratio (RR) was 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 4.6). The NNT calculated from these data was 4.4 (95% CI 2.9 to 8.8). We downgraded the evidence for this outcome by two levels to low quality because of the small size of studies and of the pooled data set, because there were only 110 actual events, the analysis included different types of neuropathic pain, the studies all had at least one high risk of potential bias, and because of the limited duration of the studies.</P>
<P>Participants experienced more adverse events with tramadol than placebo. Report of any adverse event was higher with tramadol (58%) than placebo (34%) (4 studies, 266 participants, 123 events; RR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1); NNH 4.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 8.3)). Adverse event withdrawal was higher with tramadol (16%) than placebo (3%) (6 studies, 485 participants, 45 events; RR 4.1 (95% CI 2.0 to 8.4); NNH 8.2 (95% CI 5.8 to 14)). Only four serious adverse events were reported, without obvious attribution to treatment, and no deaths were reported. We downgraded the evidence for this outcome by two or three levels to low or very low quality because of small study size, because there were few actual events, and because of the limited duration of the studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-26 07:56:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>There is only modest information about the use of tramadol in neuropathic pain, coming from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally increase the apparent benefits of tramadol. The evidence of benefit from tramadol was of low or very low quality, meaning that it does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect, and the likelihood is very high that the effect will be substantially different from the estimate in this systematic review.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:29:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>This review is an update of a review of tramadol for neuropathic pain, published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingshead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingshead 2006</LINK>). The standards for Cochrane reviews have changed substantially since 2006, and this review is based on a template for reviews of drugs used to relieve neuropathic pain. The aim is for all reviews to use the same methods, based on new criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:29:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>The 2011 International Association for the Study of Pain definition of neuropathic pain is "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system" (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2011</LINK>), based on a definition agreed at an earlier consensus meeting (<LINK REF="REF-Treede-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treede 2008</LINK>). Neuropathic pain is a consequence of a pathological maladaptive response of the nervous system to 'damage' from a wide variety of potential causes. It is characterised by pain in the absence of a noxious stimulus and may be spontaneous (continuous or paroxysmal) in its temporal characteristics or be evoked by sensory stimuli (dynamic mechanical allodynia where pain is evoked by light touch of the skin). Neuropathic pain is associated with a variety of sensory loss (numbness) and sensory gain (allodynia) clinical phenomena, the exact pattern of which vary between people and disease, perhaps reflecting different pain mechanisms operating in an individual person and, therefore, potentially predictive of response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Demant-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demant 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfert-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfert 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Hehn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Hehn 2012</LINK>). Pre-clinical research hypothesises a bewildering array of possible pain mechanisms that may operate in people with neuropathic pain, which largely reflect pathophysiological responses in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including neuronal interactions with immune cells (<LINK REF="REF-Baron-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baron 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calvo-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvo 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-von-Hehn-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Hehn 2012</LINK>). Overall, the treatment gains in neuropathic pain, to even the most effective of available drugs, are modest (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>), and a robust classification of neuropathic pain is not yet available (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain is usually divided according to the cause of nerve injury. There may be many causes, but some common causes of neuropathic pain include diabetes (painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN)), shingles (postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)), amputation (stump and phantom limb pain), neuropathic pain after surgery or trauma, stroke or spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia, and HIV infection. Sometimes the cause is unknown.</P>
<P>Many people with neuropathic pain conditions are significantly disabled with moderate or severe pain for many years. Chronic pain conditions comprised five of the 11 top-ranking conditions for years lived with disability in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Vos-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vos 2012</LINK>), and are responsible for considerable loss of quality of life and employment, and increased healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014a</LINK>). A US study found the healthcare costs were three-fold higher for people with neuropathic pain than matched control subjects (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2004</LINK>). A UK study and a German study showed a two- to three-fold higher level of use of healthcare services in people with neuropathic pain than those without (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2009</LINK>). For postherpetic neuralgia, for example, studies demonstrate large loss of quality of life and substantial costs (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Hoek-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Hoek 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In systematic reviews, the overall prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population was reported to be between 7% and 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Hecke-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Hecke 2014</LINK>), and about 7% in a systematic review of studies published since 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014a</LINK>). In individual countries, prevalence rates have been reported as 3.3% in Austria (<LINK REF="REF-Gustorff-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gustorff 2008</LINK>), 6.9% in France (<LINK REF="REF-Bouhassira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouhassira 2008</LINK>), and up to 8% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Torrance-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torrance 2006</LINK>). Some forms of neuropathic pain, such as PDN and post-surgical chronic pain (which is often neuropathic in origin), are increasing (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). The prevalence of PHN is likely to fall if vaccination against the herpes virus becomes widespread.</P>
<P>Estimates of incidence vary between individual studies for particular origins of neuropathic pain, often because of small numbers of cases. In primary care in the UK, between 2002 and 2005, the incidences (per 100,000 person-years' observation) were 28 (95% confidence interval (CI) 27 to 30) for PHN, 27 (95% CI 26 to 29) for trigeminal neuralgia, 0.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.1) for phantom limb pain, and 21 (95% CI 20 to 22) for PDN (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2008</LINK>). Other studies have estimated an incidence of 4 in 100,000 per year for trigeminal neuralgia (<LINK REF="REF-Katusic-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katusic 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rappaport-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rappaport 1994</LINK>), and 12.6 per 100,000 person-years for trigeminal neuralgia and 3.9 per 100,000 person-years for PHN in a study of facial pain in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="REF-Koopman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koopman 2009</LINK>). One systematic review of chronic pain demonstrated that some neuropathic pain conditions, such as PDN, can be more common than other neuropathic pain conditions, with prevalence rates up to 400 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-McQuay-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat effectively, with only a minority of people experiencing a clinically-relevant benefit from any one intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Kalso-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>). A multidisciplinary approach is now advocated, combining pharmacological interventions with physical or cognitive (or both) interventions. The evidence for interventional management is very weak, or non-existent (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2013</LINK>). Conventional analgesics such as paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not thought to be effective, but without evidence to support or refute that view (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015a</LINK>). Some people may derive some benefit from a topical lidocaine patch or low-concentration topical capsaicin, although evidence about benefits is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Derry-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2014</LINK>). High-concentration topical capsaicin may benefit some people with PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Derry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Derry 2013</LINK>). Treatment is often by so-called 'unconventional analgesics' (pain modulators) such as antidepressants (duloxetine and amitriptyline; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>), or antiepileptics (gabapentin or pregabalin; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiffen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiffen 2013</LINK>). Evidence for efficacy of opioids is unconvincing (<LINK REF="REF-Gaskell-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaskell 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stannard-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stannard 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proportion of people who achieve worthwhile pain relief (typically at least 50% pain intensity reduction; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>) is small, generally only 10% to 25% more than with placebo, with numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) usually between 4 and 10 (<LINK REF="REF-Kalso-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>). Neuropathic pain is not particularly different from other chronic pain conditions in that only a small proportion of trial participants have a good response to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain suggests offering a choice of amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin as initial treatment for neuropathic pain (with the exception of trigeminal neuralgia), with switching if the first, second, or third drugs tried are not effective or not tolerated (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). This concurs with other recent guidance (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2015</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:29:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>Tramadol hydrochloride is an opioid analgesic originally marketed in West Germany in 1977, and now widely available. In 2016, tramadol - alone or in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) - was available in products for oral use and by injection from almost 90 companies. Oral formulations include those designed for immediate release, and for modified release over a longer time period. Preparations for rectal administration are also available. The total oral daily dosage is usually up to 400 mg, although some licences state that 400 mg is the maximum dose (<LINK REF="REF-Martindale-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martindale 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tramadol is used to treat a range of different pain conditions. It acts as a µ-opioid agonist, but also has a range of other properties that may contribute to its analgesic effect, including serotonin reuptake inhibition and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. It is licensed for use in moderate to severe pain and is less potent than morphine or similar drugs. It is considered to fit into Step 2 of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016</LINK>). In some parts of the world tramadol is classified as a controlled substance (similar to codeine in this respect), but the exact classification and controls on prescribing vary markedly.</P>
<P>Tramadol has reasonable efficacy in acute postoperative pain as a single agent, and in combination with paracetamol (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997</LINK>), but has small benefits in osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>), and the evidence base was inadequate to recommend it as an alternative to paracetamol plus codeine for routine use in people with cancer with mild to moderate cancer pain (<LINK REF="REF-Tassinari-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tassinari 2011</LINK>). The earlier version of this review found that it probably has efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingshead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingshead 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tramadol is associated with typical opioid adverse events of nausea, dizziness, and dry mouth, although vomiting and constipation are considered to be less of a problem than with traditional opioids. Use of tramadol with concurrent serotonergic therapy poses a risk of serotonin syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Beakley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beakley 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Like other opioids, tramadol is potentially subject to abuse. A study in Germany, where tramadol is not scheduled in the German Narcotic Drugs Act, calculated the incidence of abuse as 0.21 cases per million defined daily dosages (DDDs) and dependency as 0.12 cases per million DDDs, with lower incidences in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Radbruch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radbruch 2013</LINK>). The conclusion was that tramadol had a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependency.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-10 11:10:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Tramadol acts centrally, and both tramadol and its O-desmethyl metabolite are selective, weak OP3-receptor (µ) agonists. The mode of action is poorly understood (<LINK REF="REF-Reeves-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reeves 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tramadol is a synthetic 4-phenyl-piperidine analogue of codeine with a central analgesic effect. Tramadol is metabolised by <I>N</I>- and <I>O</I>-demethylation via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 and glucuronidation or sulphation in the liver. Around 40% of the analgesic action is provided by O-desmethyl tramadol (M1) created by rapid metabolism of tramadol in the liver via the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 (<LINK REF="REF-Bozkurt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozkurt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grond 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lintz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lintz 1998</LINK>). Tramadol is also metabolised by <I>N</I>-demethylation via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4, and glucuronidation or sulphation in the liver (<LINK REF="REF-Grond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grond 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tramadol is available as a racemic mixture of (+) and (-) enantiomers. The (+) enantiomer has only a weak affinity to µ-opioid receptors and inhibits serotonin reuptake, while the (-) enantiomer inhibits norepinephrine reuptake in the spinal cord (<LINK REF="REF-Bozkurt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozkurt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>). These different modes action might explain the longer analgesic efficacy and the lower incidence of opioid adverse effects, but a range of other modes of action have been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Bozkurt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bozkurt 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grond-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grond 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tramadol is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and has an absolute bioavailability of 65% to 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Lintz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lintz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2000</LINK>). Generally, there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics (elimination half-life, distribution, serum clearance and concentration of metabolites) of tramadol between adults and children after oral dosing or intravenous injection. Genetic variances probably influence analgesic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Gan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gan 2007</LINK>). About 8% of the white population has cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP2D6) deficiency that reduces the analgesic effects of tramadol, and this may well be greater in some other populations. Other drugs metabolised by CYP2D6 enzymes (ondansetron, for example) can potentially interfere with tramadol metabolism, changing how well it works in individuals, and possible adverse events as well.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:29:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>The earlier version of this review indicated a benefit of tramadol over placebo for relief of neuropathic pain. This was based on pooled evidence from five studies in various different types of neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingshead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingshead 2006</LINK>); since then our understanding of methods and biases relating to opioid use in chronic pain has improved, and more studies have become available. A more recent review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was less positive about the efficacy of tramadol (<LINK REF="REF-CADTH-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">CADTH 2015</LINK>). In addition, data from the US 2005 to 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network showed that visits made to emergency departments involving misuse or abuse of tramadol increased about 250% between 2005 and 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Bush-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standards used to assess evidence in chronic pain trials have changed substantially in recent years, with particular attention being paid to trial duration, withdrawals, and statistical imputation following withdrawal, all of which can substantially alter estimates of efficacy. The most important change is the move from using mean pain scores, or mean change in pain scores, to the number of people who have a large decrease in pain (by at least 50%) and who continue in treatment, ideally in trials of 8 to 12 weeks' duration or longer. Pain intensity reduction of 50% or more correlates with improvements in co-morbid symptoms, function, and quality of life generally (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>), and in people with neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2010</LINK>). These standards are set out in the <I>PaPaS Author and Referee Guidance</I> for pain studies of Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) (<LINK REF="REF-PaPaS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">PaPaS 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review assesses evidence using improved methods that make both statistical and clinical sense, using developing criteria for what constitutes reliable evidence in chronic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010a</LINK>). Trials included and analysed had to meet a minimum of reporting quality (blinding, randomisation), validity (duration, dose and timing, diagnosis, outcomes, etc.), and size. Ideally at least 500 participants are needed in a comparison in which the NNT is 4 or above in order to measure the magnitude of a treatment effect adequately (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). This approach sets high standards for the demonstration of efficacy and marks a departure from how reviews were conducted previously.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:29:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>We anticipated that studies would use a variety of outcome measures, with most studies using standard subjective scales (numerical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale (VAS)) for pain intensity or pain relief, or both. We were particularly interested in Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) definitions for moderate and substantial benefit in chronic pain studies (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). These are defined as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>at least 30% pain relief over baseline (moderate);</LI>

<P>These outcomes are different from those used in most earlier reviews, concentrating as they do on dichotomous outcomes where pain responses do not follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. People with chronic pain desire high levels of pain relief, ideally more than 50% pain intensity reduction, and ideally having no worse than mild pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the Oxford Quality Score as the basis for inclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>), limiting inclusion to studies that were randomised and double-blind as a minimum.</P>
<P>Two review authors (SD, PW) independently assessed risk of bias for each study, using some of the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (Chapter 8, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and adapted by Cochrane PaPaS from those used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. We assessed the following for each study.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). We assessed the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: low risk of bias (any truly random process: random number table or computer random-number generator); unclear risk of bias (when the method used to generate the sequence was not clearly stated). We excluded studies at a high risk of bias that used a non-random process (odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (telephone or central randomisation; consecutively-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); unclear risk of bias (when the method was not clearly stated). We excluded studies that did not conceal allocation and were therefore at a high risk of bias (open list).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias), and blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). We assessed the methods used to blind study personnel and participants (all outcomes were self-assessed) from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed the methods as: low risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded and described the method used to achieve blinding, for example, identical tablets, matched in appearance and smell); unclear risk of bias (study stated that it was blinded but did not provide an adequate description of how it was achieved). We excluded studies at a high risk of bias that were not double-blind.</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data). We assessed the methods used to deal with incomplete data as: low risk of bias (fewer than 10% of participants did not complete the study or used 'baseline observation carried forward' (BOCF) analysis, or both); unclear risk of bias (used 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) analysis); or high risk of bias (used 'completer' analysis).</LI>
<LI>Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size). Small studies have been shown to overestimate treatment effects, probably because the conduct of small studies is more likely to be less rigorous, allowing critical criteria to be compromised (<LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_esch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nüesch 2010</LINK>).

<P>In addition, there may be circumstances where the overall rating for a particular outcome needs to be adjusted as recommended by GRADE guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2013a</LINK>). For example, if there were so few data that the results were highly susceptible to the random play of chance, or if a studies used LOCF imputation in circumstances where there were substantial differences in adverse event withdrawals, one would have no confidence in the result, and would need to grade the quality of the evidence as very low quality.</P>

<P>The original review included five studies that compared tramadol with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Arbaiza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arbaiza 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Erdine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1999</LINK>), one comparing tramadol with clomipramine (<LINK REF="STD-Gobel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gobel 1995</LINK>), and one comparing tramadol with morphine (<LINK REF="STD-Leppert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leppert 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this update we included only double-blind studies, which led to the exclusion of the two active-controlled studies, which were open label (<LINK REF="STD-Gobel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gobel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leppert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leppert 2001</LINK>). We also excluded the short conference abstract, which did not provide any usable data or methodological details (<LINK REF="STD-Erdine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Erdine 1997</LINK>).</P>
<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:32:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>We carried out full, rather than updated, searches because the study inclusion criteria for this update had changed as above. The searches identified 152 records in CENTRAL, 388 in MEDLINE, 737 in Embase, and one additional record in clinical trials registries. They identified all the studies that had been included in the earlier review and six new reports (probably of five studies) that were potentially eligible. After reading the full texts we included four of the original included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arbaiza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arbaiza 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1999</LINK>) and two new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Norrbrink-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Norrbrink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>). We excluded three of the original studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gobel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gobel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leppert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leppert 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erdine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Erdine 1997</LINK>) as above, and three of the new reports (probably two studies) (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00610155" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00610155</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Saxena-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Saxena 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>We placed the remaining new study in 'Studies awaiting classification' (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2009</LINK>). The reason for this was the highly contrived design, with pre-testing selection of participants with two run-in periods, the very large doses of additional drug therapy that could have been taken, the very small numbers of participants, and the short one-week maintenance phase. We are unable at this time to properly classify this study. Moreover, participants had to have painful small fibre sensory neuropathy of two months' or greater duration. This disease duration is below our threshold for inclusion, and there was no indication of what the average or typical duration of the condition actually was.</P>

<P>We included six studies, with 438 participants randomised to treatment with tramadol, placebo, or both (109 participants in cross-over studies) in approximately equal numbers, although efficacy data were not available for all of the randomised participants (<LINK REF="STD-Arbaiza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arbaiza 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrbrink-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Norrbrink 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>). One cross-over study, enrolling 64 participants, included an active treatment arm using a novel analgesic (GRT9906) (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>). Tramadol was started at a dose of about 100 mg daily and increased over one to two weeks to a maximum of 400 mg daily (300 mg daily in people aged 75 years or more in <LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>) or the maximum tolerated dose, and then maintained for the remainder of the study.</P>
<P>Treatment periods were from four to six weeks (45 days), with washout periods of at least one week between treatments in cross-over studies. Most studies specified paracetamol (acetaminophen) as rescue medication. <LINK REF="STD-Arbaiza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arbaiza 2007</LINK> allowed continuation of antiepileptic analgesic therapy with dose reduction if required, and <LINK REF="STD-Norrbrink-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Norrbrink 2009</LINK> allowed unchanged stable pain medication. The other studies required that all previous pain medication was stopped and washed out before the start of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>), or did not report on this aspect (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies enrolled participants who had experienced moderate or severe neuropathic pain for at least three months due to cancer or cancer-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Arbaiza-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arbaiza 2007</LINK>), postherpetic neuralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>), or peripheral diabetic neuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>); at least 12 months due to spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="STD-Norrbrink-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Norrbrink 2009</LINK>); or at least six months due to polyneuropathy (<LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>). The mean age ranged from 50 to 67 years (overall range 26 to 85 years), and there were approximately equal numbers of men and women overall, although the ratio varied between studies from 4:1 to 1:2.6. Three studies were multicentre (<LINK REF="STD-Boureau-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Boureau 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harati-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harati 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sindrup-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Sindrup 2012</LINK>). Exclusion criteria varied between studies, but generally they excluded people with other significant comorbidities or pain from other causes; contraindications to tramadol or other opioids; and a history of addiction or drug or alcohol abuse.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:36:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:36:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>Participants in these studies typically had moderate or severe neuropathic pain, often long-lasting, and with an initial average pain score of around 6/10 at the start of the studies. The primary pain outcomes of this review were 'substantial' pain relief, ideally the reduction in pain intensity by 50% or more, and 'moderate' pain relief, a reduction by 30% or more, both sustained over the duration of the trial, which was typically three months. These outcomes are judged as desirable by people with pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only some of the studies reported pain outcomes of interest to people with neuropathic pain, and we could not perform analyses according to different types of neuropathic pain. This is important because different types of neuropathic pain can respond differently to the same treatment when studies are otherwise identical (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence that tramadol is beneficial for neuropathic pain is very limited, despite it being commonly used and recommended for the condition (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). The conclusion of this updated review is therefore different from that of the original (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingshead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingshead 2006</LINK>). The evidence of any benefit from tramadol was of low or very low quality, meaning that the likelihood is very high that the effect will be substantially different from the estimate in this systematic review. This quality assessment is due predominantly to higher standards of evidence now being applied, including a growing concern about possible overestimation of treatment effect in small studies.</P>
<P>An important issue is that of study size and the overall amount of information available for analysis. There are issues over both random chance effects with small amounts of data, and potential bias in small studies, especially in pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dechartres-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dechartres 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-N_x00fc_esch-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nüesch 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2011</LINK>). Another potentially major positive bias towards experimental intervention is the use of LOCF imputation (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Cochrane Reviews have been criticised for perhaps over-emphasising results of underpowered studies or analyses (<LINK REF="REF-AlBalawi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AlBalawi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2013</LINK>). On the other hand, it may be unethical to ignore potentially important information from small studies or to randomise more patients if a meta-analysis including small studies has provided conclusive evidence.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-24 12:04:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Study participants were typical of people with neuropathic pain who are eligible to take part in clinical trials. As is usual, exclusion criteria included other significant comorbidities or pain from other causes, contraindications to tramadol or other opioids, and a history of addiction or drug or alcohol abuse. The problems that attend small studies, and other methodological considerations make the evidence less than complete and not easily applicable to many people with neuropathic pain. While problems of bias surrounding the studies might be expected to produce a large treatment effect, no such large treatment effect was seen.</P>
<P>Doses of oral tramadol in the range of 200 mg to 400 mg daily were those typically used to treat chronic pain.</P>
<P>One other issue of importance is that study duration was generally four to six weeks, arguably inadequate for a long-term pain condition.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:36:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>Five of the six included studies had at least one major risk of bias. Poor reporting of useful pain outcomes rendered the evidence quality low to very low. Pooled analyses were mostly on only about 200 participants, where chance effects are possible (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). In view of the small sample sizes, as well as uncertainties for other possible risks of bias, we chose to downgrade the quality of most of the evidence by three levels to very low quality. Very low quality means that this research does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect. The likelihood that the effect will be substantially different from the estimate produced here is very high.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>We know of no potential biases in the review process. We had planned to calculate the number of participants who would need to be in trials with zero effect (risk ratio of 1.0) needed for the point estimate of the NNT to increase beyond a clinically useful level (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2008</LINK>), but this method is not applicable with low effect sizes and uncertain results.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:36:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>This updated review comes to a different conclusion to the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Hollingshead-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollingshead 2006</LINK>). That version concluded that tramadol is an effective treatment for neuropathic pain, but did not apply such stringent conditions to quality or bias, or benefit from recent work understanding the overestimation of effect in small studies. Another Cochrane Review examined tramadol for treating osteoarthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Cepeda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cepeda 2006</LINK>). That review concluded that tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreased pain intensity, but the benefits were small (a decrease of about 12% in average pain intensity). Finnerup and colleagues calculated an NNT of 4.7 (3.6 to 6.7) based on six studies with over 700 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2015</LINK>), but used different quality criteria and included one study with a tramadol/paracetamol combination.</P>

<P>There is not enough data of adequate quality to provide convincing evidence to support the suggestion that tramadol has efficacy in relieving neuropathic pain. Any biases in the small studies would be expected to work to increase estimates of efficacy, and the fact that no meaningful efficacy was found strengthens the suggestion that tramadol may be ineffective in a population of patients. This does not preclude some obtaining a good response with tramadol.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>The design of studies in neuropathic pain, and the outcomes, are well understood, but as the number of people experiencing good pain relief with tramadol is likely to be small, an enriched-enrolment randomised-withdrawal (EERW) design might provide the highest sensitivity to detect a signal (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015c</LINK>). Since combination therapy for neuropathic pain has been reported to be more effective than monotherapy with any drug (<LINK REF="REF-Chaparro-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaparro 2012</LINK>), and combination therapy is common clinical practice, studies examining tramadol in combination with a gabapentinoid could be of interest.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>Reporting of clinically relevant outcomes using appropriate imputation for withdrawal would improve the relevance of the findings for clinical practice. The use of EERW designs for comparison with classic trial designs indicates that good quality EERW designs of long duration may be appropriate for neuropathic pain.</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-09-27 11:55:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Methodological considerations for chronic pain</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-06-06 12:49:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="R Andrew Moore">
<P>There have been several recent changes in how the efficacy of conventional and unconventional treatments is assessed in chronic painful conditions. The outcomes are now better defined, particularly with new criteria for what constitutes moderate or substantial benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>); older trials may only report participants with 'any improvement'. Newer trials tend to be larger, avoiding problems from the random play of chance. Newer trials also tend to be of longer duration, up to 12 weeks, and longer trials provide a more rigorous and valid assessment of efficacy in chronic conditions. New standards have evolved for assessing efficacy in neuropathic pain, and we are now applying stricter criteria for the inclusion of trials and assessment of outcomes, and are more aware of problems that may affect our overall assessment. To summarise some of the recent insights that must be considered in this new review:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pain results tend to have a U-shaped distribution rather than a bell-shaped distribution. This is true in acute pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011b</LINK>), back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010c</LINK>), and arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>), as well as in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Straube-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2010</LINK>); in all cases average results usually describe the experience of almost no-one in the trial. Data expressed as averages are potentially misleading, unless they can be proven to be suitable.</LI>
<LI>As a consequence, we have to depend on dichotomous results (the individual either has or does not have the outcome) usually from pain changes or patient global assessments. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) group has helped with their definitions of minimal, moderate, and substantial improvement (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2008</LINK>). In arthritis, trials of less than 12 weeks' duration, and especially those shorter than eight weeks, overestimate the effect of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010c</LINK>); the effect is particularly strong for less effective analgesics, and this may also be relevant in neuropathic-type pain.</LI>
<LI>The proportion of patients with at least moderate benefit can be small, even with an effective medicine, falling from 60% with an effective medicine in arthritis to 30% in fibromyalgia (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2013b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straube-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straube 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2008</LINK>). A Cochrane Review of pregabalin in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia demonstrated different response rates for different types of chronic pain (higher in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia and lower in central pain and fibromyalgia) (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>). This indicates that different neuropathic pain conditions should be treated separately from one another, and that pooling should not be done unless there are good grounds for doing so.</LI>
<LI>Individual patient analyses indicate that patients who get good pain relief (moderate or better) have major benefits in many other outcomes, affecting quality of life in a significant way (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Imputation methods such as last observation carried forward (LOCF), used when participants withdraw from clinical trials, can overstate drug efficacy especially when adverse event withdrawals with drug are greater than those with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>).</LI>
