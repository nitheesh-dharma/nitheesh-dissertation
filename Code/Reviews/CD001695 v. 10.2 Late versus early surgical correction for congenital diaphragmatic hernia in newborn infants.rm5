<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-28 11:12:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No clear evidence about when to perform surgery to correct congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a rare but often fatal condition. It occurs when a newborn baby's diaphragm has a defect in it that allows abdominal organs (such as the stomach or liver) to enter the chest and displace the lung and heart. Surgery can correct the defect, but damage to the lung may be so severe that the baby still cannot survive. It has been thought that correcting the defect was so urgent that emergency surgery should be performed within the first 24 hours following birth, but more recent thinking suggests that a period of stabilization before surgery could help the lung develop. Only two trials have been done, and these provide no clear evidence to support delayed surgery over emergency surgery.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-03-08 13:17:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, although rare (1 per 2-4,000 births), is associated with high mortality and cost. Opinion regarding the timing of surgical repair has gradually shifted from emergent repair to a policy of stabilization using a variety of ventilatory strategies prior to operation. Whether delayed surgery is beneficial remains controversial. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To summarize the available data regarding whether surgical repair in the first 24 hours after birth rather than later than 24 hours of age improves survival to hospital discharge in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who are symptomatic at or immediately after birth.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-08 13:17:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Search of MEDLINE (1966 to Sept 2003), EMBASE (1978 to Oct 2003) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003); citations search, and contact with experts in the field to locate other published and unpublished studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-03-08 13:17:54 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were randomized or quasi-randomized trials that addressed infants with CDH who were symptomatic at or shortly after birth, comparing early (&lt; 24 hours) vs late (&gt; 24 hours) surgical intervention, and evaluated mortality as the primary outcome.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were collected regarding study methods and outcomes including mortality, need for ECMO and duration of ventilation, both from the study reports and from personal communication with investigators. Analysis was performed in accordance with the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two trials met the pre-specified inclusion criteria for this review. Both were small trials (total n&lt;90) and neither showed any significant difference between groups in mortality. Meta-analysis was not performed because of significant clinical heterogeneity between the trials. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no clear evidence which favors delayed (when stabilized) as compared with immediate (within 24 hours of birth) timing of surgical repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but a substantial advantage to either one cannot be ruled out. A large, multicenter randomized trial would be needed to answer this question.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:16:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in approximately 1 in every 2,000 to 4,000 newborn infants, and was generally considered a fatal condition through the early 20th century. Despite many advances in the medical and surgical care of infants, the mortality for this condition remains quite high. CDH also ranks among the most costly of correctable conditions, with an estimated cost per new case of US$250,000, and an overall estimated yearly cost of US$264,000,000 in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Metkus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metkus 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:16:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 1940, Ladd and Gross demonstrated that repair could be successfully undertaken in an infant (<LINK REF="REF-Ladd-1940" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladd 1940</LINK>) Their earliest reports were encouraging, demonstrating a marked improvement in survival compared to the previous approach of watchful waiting. They justified urgent surgery by noting that these infants had a large amount of gas in the bowel and thorax, which was thought to cause lung compression and respiratory distress resulting in the need for urgent correction. A policy of early intervention evolved so that by 1970 CDH was considered one of the true surgical emergencies in the newborn (<LINK REF="REF-Holder-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holder 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guzzetta-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzzetta 1989</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:17:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgery has been shown to be associated with deterioration in lung compliance, which may be ameliorated by preoperative stabilization. Several reports in the 1980s suggested that survival was no different with delayed repair and recommended that a period of stabilization prior to operation was warranted (<LINK REF="STD-Cartlidge-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Cartlidge 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langer-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Langer 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sakai 1987</LINK>). Many pediatric surgeons are currently employing a strategy of delay for some period of time prior to correction of the defect in order to achieve a minimal level of ventilator support, to document absence of pulmonary hypertension, to show improvement in pulmonary compliance, or to show that lung radiographic appearance is improved prior to repair (<LINK REF="REF-Tracy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Breaux-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Breaux 1991</LINK>). Alternative ventilatory strategies such as permissive hypercapnia, nitric oxide administration, and liquid ventilation have been used in an effort to stabilize these infants prior to surgery or as rescue therapy following surgery. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used as an alternative mode of ventilatory support in infants with severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure in the preoperative, intra-operative and post-operative period (<LINK REF="STD-Lally-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lally 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reickert-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Reickert 1996</LINK>). Whether there is any interaction between the use of ECMO or other ventilatory strategies and the timing of surgery is not known.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:27:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies which met the inclusion criteria for the review were evaluated for the presence of allocation concealment in order to ameliorate selection bias. Differences in the conditions under which surgery was performed, and in the indications and/or use of diagnostic and/or therapeutic co-interventions were sought from the trial reports. When information could not be obtained from the reports, it was obtained directly from the investigators when possible. The trials were assessed for differences in withdrawals from the study, and for differences in how the outcome assessments were made between the groups.</P>
<P>For the updated review in 2009, the following information was extracted for the Risk of Bias Table:</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we catagorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we catagorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we catagorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We catagorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  Where needed &#8220;partial&#8221; was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We catagorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>See Table of included studies.</P>
<P>Twenty-six studies were identified, of which 24 were excluded because they did not use a randomized or quasi-randomized trial design. Two trials were included in the analysis. Both trials were randomized, but neither report specified how the randomization was accomplished. The end point for both trials was mortality; however, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>) evaluated survival to hospital discharge (at about 1 to 2 months of age) and the other (<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK>) evaluated survival at 6 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK> studied a total of 32 patients; 14 patients underwent repair within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms (mean age at operation, 10.1 hours) and 18 patients underwent repair at over 96 hours of life. The study was performed in two institutions and the authors provided no information about preoperative or postoperative management, including pharmacotherapy and ventilator management other than the frequency of use of ECMO. The number of patients in the study was too small to detect significant differences.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK> also studied a small number of patients, with a total of 54 infants enrolled in the study from two institutions. There were 26 infants randomized to repair within 4 hours of arrival (all but one repaired at less than 11 hours of age; one infant's surgery was delayed to 296 hours pending genetic evaluation) and 28 infants who had repair after 24 hours. As with the <LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK> study, there was no standardized preoperative or postoperative management described in the report.</P>
<P>Neither report offers specifics about the postnatal management of these patients with the exception of using ECMO in 75% of the patients in the Nio trial (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>) and 4% in the de la Hunt report (<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK>). In neither study were the criteria for ECMO outlined. Other aspects of care that could significantly alter outcome such as the ventilator strategies and use of adjunctive therapies were not controlled for or specified, although <LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK> stated that they were to be the same for both groups.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:40:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In both included studies, allocation was stated to be random but the randomization scheme was not described in the published report. Personal communication with the authors of the Nio study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>) revealed that sealed envelopes were used, with randomization after consent was obtained. Whether allocation was effectively concealed is not clear in either of these reports. Although all patients were accounted for, two patients assigned to early surgical intervention in the Nio study acutely deteriorated and were dropped from the study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>). Information on the outcome of those two patients is being requested from the investigators and will be included in a future update of this review. As expected, neither patients (families) nor clinicians were blinded to group assignment. Data are insufficient to determine the balance of prognostic factors in the two groups in either study. More patients received ECMO therapy in the delayed repair group in the Nio study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>); other co-interventions are not well described.</P>

<P>
<B>Mortality (Outcome 1.1):</B>
<BR/>Mortality was evaluated differently in the two studies, Nio evaluating deaths prior to discharge (which occurred at 1 to 2 months of age for most infants) and de la Hunt evaluating deaths prior to 6 months of age. In the de la Hunt study (<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK>), 43% of the late surgical group and 54% of the early surgical group had died by 6 months (RR for death with delayed surgery 0.80, 95%CI 0.46,1.39; RD -0.11, 95%CI -0.38,0.16). In the Nio study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>), death prior to discharge occurred with almost equal frequency with late and early surgical intervention respectively (RR for death with delayed surgery 1.11, 95%CI 0.32,3.81, RD 0.03, 95%CI -0.29,0.35) .</P>
<P>
<B>Length of stay of survivors (Outcome 1.2):</B>
<BR/>In the de la Hunt study (<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK>), the survivors in the late repair group remained hospitalized for a geometric mean of 32.7 days, compared to 20.7 days for those in the early repair group (SDs not provided.) In the Nio study, surviving patients were discharged at a mean of 63.5 (SD 63.5) days in the late repair group and 49.6 (30.4) days in the early repair group (mean difference 13.9, 95%CI -25.9, 53.7).</P>
<P>
<B>Use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation:</B>
<BR/>In the Nio study (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>), ECMO was used in 89% of those in the delayed surgery group and 67% of those in the early surgery group. Criteria for ECMO use for both groups was an Oxygen Index (mean airway pressure x FIO2/PaO2 x100) &gt; 40 for more than 2 hours. In the de la Hunt study, two infants in the late surgery group and none in the early surgery group received ECMO (criteria not stated).</P>
<P>
<B>Duration of ventilatory support in survivors:</B>
<BR/>In the de la Hunt study, survivors in the late surgery group required more days of ventilation than did those in the early surgery group (geometric mean of 10.7 vs. 5.8 days), but the difference was not significant. Nio did not report duration of ventilatory support.</P>
<P>
<B>Pulmonary function, developmental outcome:</B>
<BR/>Neither pulmonary function nor developmental outcome were evaluated in these two studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Evaluation of heterogeneity:</B>
<BR/>While "early" surgery occurred well before 24 hours of age (means of 6 and 10 hours), the timing of "late" surgery was different in the two studies. In the Nio study, the infants in the delayed surgery arm underwent surgery at a mean of 173 hours of age; in the de la Hunt study, late surgery occurred at a mean of 48 hours of age. In addition, the outcome variable was survival to discharge in the Nio study and survival to 6 months in the de la Hunt study. Because of these clinical differences in the study, meta-analysis with statement of summary estimates was not felt to be appropriate.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-19 11:42:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After the first successful repair of a diaphragmatic hernia in a newborn, the predominant medical opinion expressed was that an emergent operation was required to alleviate compression of the patient's "good" lung. The earliest reports by Ladd and Gross on correction of CDH in the neonate were encouraging, demonstrating a marked improvement in survival compared to the previous approach of watchful waiting (<LINK REF="REF-Ladd-1940" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ladd 1940</LINK>). This prompted most surgeons to correct the defect as early as possible with the hope that removing the bowel and/or liver from the chest would allow the lungs to expand. The majority of pediatric surgeons treated this as a true emergency and the patients were rushed to the operating room a very short time after diagnosis or arrival at the tertiary hospital. Subsequently, Sakai and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Sakai-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Sakai 1987</LINK>), and others, demonstrated that early operation actually worsened pulmonary compliance, which sparked a broader interest in delaying operation until the infant was stable. However, what has been reported as "delayed" operation has not been well defined. One concept is to stabilize for a short period of time and therefore avoid an emergency operation. This approach would have the patient undergo operation within a day or two after birth. An alternative approach would be to delay surgical repair until physiological changes occur, such as improved pulmonary compliance, decreased pulmonary hypertension, or others. With this approach, operation would be delayed for days or weeks as necessary.</P>
<P>The two studies that met criteria for this review actually address two different questions. The Nio study evaluated the potential advantage of a lengthy delay before surgical repair, allowing a physiologic change in the patient's condition and indeed, the average age at operation in the "late" group in that study was 173 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Nio-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nio 1994</LINK>). In comparison, the "delayed" patients in the study by de la Hunt and colleagues underwent repair at an average age of 48 hours (<LINK REF="STD-de-la-Hunt-1996" TYPE="STUDY">de la Hunt 1996</LINK>). The de la Hunt trial primarily focused on a brief period of stabilization compared to emergent operation while the Nio trial allowed for a lengthy period of physiologic stability before operation. Another important difference in the two studies was the availability or actual use of ECMO, with only 4% of the patients in the de la Hunt trial receiving ECMO compared with 75% of patients in the Nio trial.</P>
<P>Current practice has evolved towards avoiding emergent operation and allowing some period of stabilization prior to repair. Data published from a registry of over 1,000 patients with CDH show that most pediatric surgeons are currently employing a strategy of delaying correction of the defect for some period of time, with 62% of patients undergoing operation beyond 24 hours of age (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1998</LINK>). It remains unclear, however, what constitutes an appropriate period of stabilization. Various authors have recommended that patients achieve a minimal level of ventilator support, that pulmonary hypertension be absent, that there be improvement in pulmonary compliance, or the lung radiographic appearance be improved prior to repair (<LINK REF="STD-Nakayama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Nakayama 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tracy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tracy 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The widespread availability of ECMO during the time when delayed repair became more popular led to the use of this intervention to stabilize critically ill infants with CDH. Once the infant is on extracorporeal support, the timing of operative intervention remains controversial. Some initial reports demonstrated a high complication rate associated with repair on ECMO, with bleeding being a significant issue (<LINK REF="STD-Lally-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lally 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1992</LINK>). These studies were not controlled trials. Subsequently, refinements in operative technique such as the use of fibrin glue or aminocaproic acid, diaphragmatic patching, and abdominal wall patching have been associated with lower complication rates. The ideal timing for repair of CDH on ECMO remains unclear.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A large, controlled, randomized trial of this question would be useful. Currently, there is not widespread agreement on a standardized postnatal management strategy. It would be desirable to have some level of agreement on postnatal management prior to a trial. The relative rarity of CDH and the small number of patients seen in each institution will make this type of trial difficult. Given this situation, it will be necessary to select specific issues, such as permissive hypercapnia or "gentle" ventilation as well as indication for ECMO, for future study.</P>
