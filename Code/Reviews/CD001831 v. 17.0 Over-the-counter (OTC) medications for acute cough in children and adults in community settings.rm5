<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We undertook a review to determine the effectiveness of over-the-counter cough medicines in reducing cough in children and adults in community settings. We found 29 trials involving 4835 people.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Acute cough is a common and troublesome symptom in children and adults suffering from acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Many people self prescribe over-the-counter (OTC) cough preparations, and health practitioners often recommend their use for the initial treatment of cough. There is substantial variation between countries in the availability and guidelines for use of many of these preparations.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified a broad range of studies of different types of preparations used at different dosages in both adults and children.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current up to March 2014. We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medications in acute cough. Nineteen studies reported adverse effects of these medications and described infrequent, mainly minor side effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache and drowsiness.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult. While all studies were placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials only a minority reported their methods of allocation and randomisation and there was lack of reporting of blinding of outcome assessors and whether cough outcome measures were validated. In addition, studies supported by pharmaceutical companies or other providers were more likely to have positive results. Studies were very different from each other in terms of treatment types, treatment duration and outcomes measured, making evaluation of overall effectiveness of OTC cough medicines difficult.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 2010 to March 2014), LILACS (January 2010 to March 2014), Web of Science (January 2010 to March 2014) and the UK Department of Health National Research Register (March 2010).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-07-12 06:03:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:22:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate.</P>
<P>We included 29 trials (19 in adults, 10 in children) involving 4835 people (3799 adults and 1036 children). All studies were placebo-controlled RCTs. However, assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was limited by poor reporting, particularly for the earlier studies.</P>
<P>In the adult studies, six trials compared antitussives with placebo and had variable results. Three trials compared the expectorant guaifenesin with placebo; one indicated significant benefit, whereas the other two did not. One trial found that a mucolytic reduced cough frequency and symptom scores. Two studies examined antihistamine-decongestant combinations and found conflicting results. Four studies compared other combinations of drugs with placebo and indicated some benefit in reducing cough symptoms. Three trials found that antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms.</P>
<P>In the child studies, antitussives (data from three studies), antihistamines (data from three studies), antihistamine-decongestants (two studies) and antitussive/bronchodilator combinations (one study) were no more effective than placebo. No studies using expectorants met our inclusion criteria. The results of one trial favoured active treatment with mucolytics over placebo. One trial tested two paediatric cough syrups and both preparations showed a 'satisfactory response' in 46% and 56% of children compared to 21% of children in the placebo group. One new trial indicated that three types of honey were more effective than placebo over a three-day period.</P>
<P>Twenty-one studies reported adverse effects. There was a wide range across studies, with higher numbers of adverse effects in participants taking preparations containing antihistamines and dextromethorphan.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-05 00:15:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small. Availability, dosing and duration of use of over-the-counter cough medicines vary significantly in different countries. Many studies were poorly reported making assessment of risk of bias difficult and studies were also very different from each other, making evaluation of overall efficacy difficult. There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC medicines in acute cough. This should be taken into account when considering prescribing antihistamines and centrally active antitussive agents in children; drugs that are known to have the potential to cause serious harm.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:27:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute cough due to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is one of the most common symptoms worldwide. A large number of people self prescribe non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines for themselves or their children, and many health professionals in primary care settings recommend them to their patients as a first-line treatment (<LINK REF="REF-PAGB-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PAGB 2000</LINK>). OTC medicines are available to the public from pharmacies, chemists and shops without medical or dental prescription in most countries, as opposed to prescription-only medicines (POM). A national telephone survey of medication use in the US indicated that in a given week, 10% of children are given an OTC cough preparation by their carers (<LINK REF="REF-Vernacchio-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernacchio 2008</LINK>). Numerous OTC cough preparations are available, but evidence regarding their efficacy is inconclusive. Some studies of cough preparations have been shown to reduce cough symptoms, whereas others found no effect compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Banderali-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banderali 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freestone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freestone 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kurth-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). In recent years there have been safety concerns that led to the withdrawal of OTC cough medicines containing antihistamines and antitussives in children under six years. These regulatory changes were based on rare fatalities identified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, highlighting the potential of these agents to cause harm, particularly if there is accidental overdosage. However, these medicines are still available for children over the age of six years. In addition, following concerns about QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, the non-narcotic antitussive clobutinol was withdrawn in the European Union in 2008.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:28:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many studies have involved patients from different populations that have included participants with chronic cough due to underlying disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or that were carried out on healthy volunteers in whom cough had been induced by chemical irritants (<LINK REF="REF-Gastpar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gastpar 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). Other randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared active agents and did not include a placebo. Cough preparations may contain different drugs with a variety of modes of action, which can make them difficult to compare (<LINK REF="REF-Morice-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:28:39 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-prescription oral OTC medicines for cough have different modes of action based on their active ingredients as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Antitussives, for example centrally acting opioid derivatives (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1993</LINK>), or other peripherally active agents, act by reducing the cough reflex.</LI>
<LI>Expectorants, i.e. drugs leading to increased bronchial mucus production, make secretions easier to remove by cough or ciliary transport (<LINK REF="REF-Ziment-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziment 1976</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Mucolytics, i.e. drugs aiming to decrease the viscosity of bronchial secretions, act to make secretions easier to clear through coughing (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1993</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Antihistamine-decongestant combinations, i.e. drugs that are combined antihistamine H1-receptor antagonists and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, act by causing vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels thus reducing congestion (<LINK REF="REF-Morice-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morice 1998</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Antihistamines, i.e. antihistamine H1-receptor agonists, act by reducing histamine release and thus reducing local congestion and production of secretions.</LI>
<LI>Other drug combinations, i.e. fixed drug combinations using different ingredients, have mechanisms of action based on individual ingredients.</LI>
<LI>Honey is regarded as having bactericidal properties and there has been recent interest in its potential effectiveness in relieving the symptoms of URTI, including cough. In studies to date it has been administered as a single dose before bedtime or diluted in a non-caffeinated beverage. An existing Cochrane review of honey for acute cough has concluded that there is no strong evidence for or against the use of honey in acute cough in children (<LINK REF="REF-Oduwole-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oduwole 2012</LINK>).</LI>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:29:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previous systematic reviews of OTC cough and cold preparations revealed that there is insufficient evidence for or against an effect of OTC cough preparations compared to placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). However, these reviews did either not use a systematic search for RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1999</LINK>), or performed searches that were limited to the MEDLINE database (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). By using a more extensive search strategy, this systematic review aims to answer the question of whether OTC medications used for the treatment of acute cough associated with URTI are effective.</P>

<P>Our initial search in 2001 identified 328 potentially relevant RCTs, which we screened for retrieval of paper copies.

We retrieved paper copies of 93 RCTs for more detailed evaluation. We excluded a further 72 trials because studies were not RCTs (n = 4); were not placebo-controlled (n = 2); were not testing OTC cough medicines (n = 23); induced cough artificially (n = 3); included participants with chronic cough (n = 25); or did not report any cough outcomes (n = 15).</P>

<P>In this 2014 update we included 29 RCTs involving 4835 participants. Nineteen of these trials were in adults (n = 3799) and 10 in children (n = 1036). The <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table contains data on the number of participants randomised to the interventions, age, sex, smoking status, study setting, definition of illness, drug dosage, frequency and duration of treatment, and outcome information. Most adult trials were in young adults with mean ages ranging from 23 to 48 years. Ages in studies in children ranged from six months to 18 years. Six trials were more than 20 years old. Nearly half of the studies (13 out of 29) were carried out in the US, with the remaining trials located in the UK (five), Finland (three), Germany (two), Italy (one), India (two), South Africa (one), Thailand (one) and Israel (one). The ages of participants ranged from six months to over 70 years. Most studies were different in their definition of illness, the content of the drug preparation, drug dosage, the frequency of doses and the treatment duration (ranging from a single dose to 18 days), making comparison of trials and quantitative analysis difficult. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> provides an overview of the included studies, treatment types, treatment duration and results and highlights this variation.</P>

<P>These are summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. All studies were randomised controlled trials but methods for allocation concealment and random sequence generation were reported in only five of the 29 included studies. All studies were placebo-controlled based on inclusion criteria and the majority reported blinding of providers (24 of 29 studies), but only a minority reported on blinding of outcome assessors (9 of 29 studies). There was minimal risk of attrition bias. There was potential risk of bias related to funding sources as studies funded by pharmaceutical companies or other providers (12 of 29 studies) were more likely to have positive results.</P>
<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:22:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most studies did not report sufficient details on randomisation and allocation schedules to make meaningful conclusions about the potential for selection bias. Only five of the 29 trial reports stated the randomisation process, which was adequate in three trials.</P>
<P>Loss to follow-up was well documented in 20 studies with differential loss to follow-up in the treatment arms reported in five studies, and with the potential for attrition bias difficult to assess for the remaining studies.

<P>We grouped the trials according to drug class into antitussives, expectorants, mucolytics, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, other combinations and antihistamines. The number of studies in each group ranged from one to a maximum of six. Cough outcomes included frequency, severity and night-time symptoms and were measured in many different ways, for example, participant self report by symptom scores (interviews, questionnaires, diaries), physician assessment, observation by parents, cough sound pressure levels obtained by recordings via a microphone and tape recordings. Nineteen studies out of 29 reported data on adverse effects and six studies reported data on compliance with medication. Eleven out of the 29 trials reported quantitative data for the cough that could potentially have been used for meta-analysis. Due to the small numbers of trials in each category, the limited quantitative data available and the marked differences between trials in terms of participants, interventions and outcome measurement, we felt that pooling of the results was inappropriate.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Antitussives</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Studies in adults</HEADING>
<P>We included six trials involving 1526 participants that compared antitussives with placebo.</P>
<P>Codeine was tested in two trials and appeared no more effective than placebo in reducing cough symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freestone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freestone 1997</LINK>). One of these studies (n = 81) tested codeine in a two-phase study (laboratory and home) at a dose of 30 mg four times daily for four days (<LINK REF="STD-Eccles-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Eccles 1992</LINK>), and codeine was no more effective than placebo either as a single dose or in a total daily dose of 120 mg, reported on a five-point cough severity score (cough severity scores were expressed as area under the curve for eight measures over five days with intervention group 17.2 versus control group 18.8, P value = 0.23). The second study of codeine (n = 82) only tested the effect of a single 50 mg dose (<LINK REF="STD-Freestone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freestone 1997</LINK>), and cough was assessed via microphone using cough sound pressure levels 90 minutes after drug administration, cough frequency counts and subjective scores. The mean subjective score on a five-point rating scale was reduced from 2.0 to 1.0, 90 minutes after treatment in both treatment groups (P value = 0.8). Neither study provided any data on side effects.</P>
<P>Dextromethorphan was tested in three of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parvez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parvez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavesi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pavesi 2001</LINK>). One report on a series of three successive studies on a total of 451 adults favoured dextromethorphan 30 mg given in a single dose to placebo in terms of cough counts (measured through cough acoustic signals using a microphone on the nose) and subjective visual analogue scales (<LINK REF="STD-Parvez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parvez 1996</LINK>). Differences in mean changes of cough counts between active treatment and placebo varied from 19% to 36% (P value &lt; 0.05) in the three studies (up to a net difference of eight to 10 coughing bouts every 30 minutes). This study did not report on side effects.</P>
<P>A study involving 44 participants tested a single 30 mg dose of dextromethorphan versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2000</LINK>). Both treatment groups showed a decline in cough frequency (from 50 to 19 per 10-minute period in the active treatment arm compared with 42 to 20.5 in the placebo arm, P value = 0.38 at 180 minutes follow-up). Mean subjective cough scores showed a decline from 2.0 to 1.0 in the active treatment group compared to a decline from 2.0 to 1.5 in the placebo group (mean difference in decline in cough scores 0.5 at 180 minutes, P value = 0.08).</P>
<P>Pavesi and colleagues also tested a single 30 mg dose of dextromethorphan versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Pavesi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pavesi 2001</LINK>). Outcomes were measured through a three-hour continuous cough recording, measuring cough bouts, cough components, cough effort, cough intensity and cough latency. Average treatment difference was 12% to 17% in favour of dextromethorphan for cough bouts (P value = 0.004), cough components (P value = 0.003) and cough effort (P value = 0.001), with an increase in cough latency (P value = 0.002).</P>
<P>One trial in 108 adults comparing moguisteine at a total daily dose of 600 mg for three and a half days with placebo showed no difference apart from cough reduction in individuals with more severe night cough (<LINK REF="STD-Adams-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Adams 1993</LINK>). The overall mean cough score difference was 0.9 (intervention group score 6.4 versus control group score 5.5). There were no differences in the proportion rated as being improved by the investigators (intervention 42/48 versus control 41/48). There were more side effects in the treatment group (22%) compared to placebo (8%), which mainly included nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. There were four withdrawals in the treatment group due to adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.2 Studies in children</HEADING>
<P>We included four trials involving 327 participants that compared antitussives with placebo in children.</P>
<P>One study involving 57 children with night cough compared a single dose for three nights of dextromethorphan or codeine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1993</LINK>). Mean cough and composite scores decreased in each of the three treatment groups on each day of the study. Neither dextromethorphan (cough score reduction of 2.1, P value = 0.41) nor codeine (cough score reduction of 2.2, P value = 0.70) was more effective than placebo (cough score reduction of 2.2) on day three.</P>
<P>Another study involving 50 children compared dextromethorphan 1.5 mg per ml 5 ml three times a day for children under seven years and 10 ml three times daily for older children with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991a</LINK>). There were no differences between the groups in terms of parent-recorded symptom scores (mean difference in cough symptom scores on day 3 of 0.04) or adverse effects, which were generally mild.</P>
<P>A third study involving 100 children compared a single nocturnal dose of dextromethorphan (dose based on child's age: age two to five, 7.5 mg; age six to 11, 15 mg; age 12 to 18, 30 mg with either a single dose of an antihistamine or with placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>). Dextromethorphan was no more effective than diphenhydramine or placebo in reducing cough frequency or impact on child or parental sleep (composite symptom score intervention 10.06 versus control 10.85, mean difference 0.79).</P>
<P>A new study included an arm where 40 children were given 5 mg dextromethorphan six- to eight-hourly for three days and found no difference from placebo treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2012</LINK>). There was no significant difference in composite symptom scores on day three (intervention 4.6 versus control 5.0, mean difference 0.4).

Four participants (two in each group) reported side effects including nausea and hives in the active treatment group and headaches, drowsiness and excessive perspiration in the placebo group.</P>
<P>The second study (n = 65) evaluated an antitussive rather than an expectorant effect of guaifenesin, which is usually classified as an expectorant (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 1982</LINK>). Individuals in both groups reported improvement with respect to cough frequency (100% in the active group versus 94% for placebo, P value = 0.5) and cough severity (100% in the active treatment group versus 91% in the placebo group, P value = 0.2) at 36 hours. Guaifenesin reduced sputum thickness significantly in 96% of participants compared to 54% in the placebo group (P value = 0.001). This study allowed aspirin and paracetamol for participants after inclusion in the study, and the vehicle contained 95% alcohol. Adverse effects were not reported on.</P>
<P>A third new study compared extended-release guaifenesin with placebo in 378 participants aged greater than 12 years over seven days and found no difference in total spontaneous symptom severity scores on day seven but reported day four results in detail, which indicated a reduction in mean score from baseline of 7.1 in the intervention group compared to a reduction of 5.7 in the control group (mean difference (MD) 2.6, P value = 0.04) (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 2012</LINK>).</P>

Thirty per cent of participants in the active treatment group reported adverse effects including dry mouth, headache and insomnia compared to 21% in the control group.</P>
<P>The second trial (n = 73) compared dexbrompheniramine/pseudoephedrine (6 mg/120 mg twice daily for one week) with placebo. The mean severity rank of cough on a scale from zero to four obtained through a patient diary was less in the active treatment group (1.4) than in the placebo group (2.0) on days three to five (P value &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Curley-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curley 1988</LINK>).

<P>Two studies involving 155 children compared antihistamine-decongestant combinations with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Clemens-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Clemens 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hutton-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study including 59 participants found that brompheniramine/phenylpropanolamine (2 mg/12.5 mg, half the dose for children from six months to one year, on a four-hourly 'as needed' basis for 48 hours) was no more effective than placebo in reducing the number of children coughing two hours after each dose (49.0% versus 43.1%, P value = 0.66). A higher proportion of children was reported to be asleep in the active treatment group (46.6%) than in the placebo group (26.5%, P value = 0.53), and no other adverse effects were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Clemens-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Clemens 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the second study (n = 96), a combination of brompheniramine/phenylephrine/propanolamine (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for full dosage details) led to a non-statistically significant improvement in cough in 67% of children (reported by their parents) compared to 58% in the placebo group and 70% in the group receiving no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hutton-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hutton 1991</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">5.1 Studies in adults</HEADING>
<P>Four studies involving 836 people compared other combinations with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Kurth-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thackray-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Thackray 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>). These studies were very heterogeneous and used very different drug preparations and dose frequency, limiting their comparability.<BR/>
<BR/>In one trial (n = 113) EM-Vier (Minetten) given six times daily was more effective in reducing coughing fits (25% versus 11%, P value &lt; 0.01) and the urge to cough (27% versus 14%, P value &lt; 0.01) compared to placebo in the first seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Kurth-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Kurth 1978</LINK>). There were no adverse effects in either group.</P>
<P>In a trial of Vicks Medinite syrup (n = 70) at a single dose at bedtime for two days, 57.6% of participants in the active treatment group rated the formulation as "good" or better in relieving cough compared to 32.2% in the placebo group (P value &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Thackray-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Thackray 1978</LINK>). Seven participants in the active treatment group reported giddiness/drowsiness compared to four participants in the placebo group.</P>
<P>Another study (n = 108) compared a dextromethorphan/salbutamol combination and dextromethorphan alone with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tukiainen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tukiainen 1986</LINK>). There was spontaneous improvement of cough in all groups, and there were no statistically significant differences in cough scores between active treatments and placebo for both cough frequency and severity during the day. Dextromethorphan/salbutamol was superior to placebo or dextromethorphan alone in relieving cough at night (mean symptom score 0.19 versus 0.67 and 0.44, respectively on day four, P value &lt; 0.01). The dextromethorphan/salbutamol combination led to more tremor than placebo (no figures given, P value &lt; 0.05), and no serious adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>A further study (n = 485), identified for the 2009 update of this review, compared a single nocturnal dose of a compound containing four agents each with potential to deal with the different symptoms of the common cold, i.e. paracetamol plus dextromethorphan plus doxylamine plus ephedrine (<LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>). We only report the cough-related outcomes. The outcomes in this study were measured over the following two days and included proportions who reported improvements in cough three hours after taking the treatment and mean cough scores on day one and day two. There was a significant improvement in mean cough score the morning after treatment and the following day (mean cough score 2.5 versus 2.08 on day two, MD 0.42, P value &lt; 0.0001). There were also improvements in the proportion reporting improvement in cough three hours after taking the medication (intervention 57% and control 43%). There were 19 adverse events in the study in 14 patients with no difference between treatment and control. However, there was one serious adverse event described as a severe episode of somnolence in the active treatment group.</P>

<P>We included two trials with 94 participants examining other drug combinations.</P>
<P>One trial involving 43 children tested two paediatric cough syrups (Triaminicol syrup and Dorcol paediatric cough syrup) (<LINK REF="STD-Reece-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Reece 1966</LINK>). Compared to placebo, 69% of children in both active treatment groups showed a satisfactory response reported by their parents compared to 57% of children in the placebo group, which did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.5). Adverse effects were not reported.</P>
<P>One trial in 51 children compared a combination of dextromethorphan 1.5 mg per ml and salbutamol 0.2 mg per ml 5 ml three times daily for children under the age of seven or 10 ml three times a day for older children with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Korppi-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Korppi 1991b</LINK>).

<P>Two trials involving 350 adult participants compared antihistamines with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaffey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gaffey 1988</LINK>). Antihistamines were no more effective than placebo in relieving cough symptoms. Terfenadine was tested in two studies. In one of these studies (n = 100), terfenadine at a dose of 120 mg twice daily for four to five days led to a mean cough score (measured by physicians' evaluation on a scale from zero to three with higher scores meaning more coughing) of 0.8 in the active treatment group compared to 0.65 in the placebo group (MD 0.15, P value = 0.35) (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1991</LINK>). Possible adverse effects were rare in both groups, with headache being the most common complaint (6.1% of participants in the active treatment group compared to 4% in the placebo group).</P>
<P>The second study (n = 250) tested terfenadine at a dose of 60 mg twice daily for three and a half days (<LINK REF="STD-Gaffey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Gaffey 1988</LINK>). There were no statistically significant differences in self reported symptoms scores for cough (exact figures not reported) between groups.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.2 Studies in children</HEADING>
<P>We included three trials involving 363 children comparing antihistamines with placebo.</P>
<P>One study compared the antihistamines clemastine (0.05 mg/kg/day) and chlorpheniramine (0.35 mg/kg/day) for three days with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Sakchainanont-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sakchainanont 1990</LINK>). There was spontaneous improvement in all groups. In both active treatment groups, cough scores observed by physicians and participants improved in 39.6% of individuals compared with 27.6% in the placebo group, which did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.2). Drowsiness and sleepiness were reported in 20% of children with no difference between the groups.</P>
<P>The second trial included an arm in which children received diphenhydramine in a single nocturnal dose and were compared with children receiving placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>). Diphenhydramine was no more effective than dextromethorphan or placebo in reducing cough frequency or impact on child or parental sleep.</P>
<P>The third study, added in the current update, had one arm with 40 children who received promethazine at a dose of 0.5mg/kg/dose eight-hourly (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2012</LINK>).

<P>One new study compared two days of treatment with three types of honey with placebo in 300 children aged one to five years (<LINK REF="STD-Avner-Cohen-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Avner Cohen 2012</LINK>). Children were administered 10 g of honey (eucalyptus honey, citrus honey or labetiae honey) or silan date extract as placebo, all provided in identical containers. Parents were told to give it as a single dose or to dilute it in a non-caffeinated beverage 30 minutes before the child was due to go to sleep.

<P>We found no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) medications in acute cough, which confirms the findings of two previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Anonymous-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anonymous 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). The number of trials in each group of drugs was small, there was poor overall quality of the studies and studies showed conflicting evidence. In total, 11 of the 29 included trials showed a positive result, whereas 18 did not show active treatment to be superior to placebo. Eight out of the 12 studies that were supported by the pharmaceutical industry showed positive results compared to four positive studies out of the 15 trials that did not report any conflict of interest. The results of trials did not appear to be related to their sample size or length of follow-up. We did not formally examine the trial efficacy versus trial quality because of the lack of reported data.</P>

<P>The results of this systematic review have to be interpreted with caution as the number of trials in each group was small. There were marked differences between the studies even within groups of drugs with similar mode of action, making it difficult to compare trials directly. In addition, there is variation between countries in relation to medications available OTC, making international comparisons more difficult. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants varied, and active drugs were administered in different total daily doses. The duration of drug therapy varied from a single-dose treatment to an 18-day course. For example, six studies testing antitussives, either alone or in combination with other agents, used short-term cough relief after a single dose as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Freestone-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Freestone 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parvez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parvez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavesi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pavesi 2001</LINK>), whereas more relevant outcomes for patients would be the effect after one day, three days or a week. Outcomes were assessed and measured in many different ways, which included questionnaires, cough severity scores, acoustic signals, tape recordings, daily diaries and assessment by a physician.</P>
<P>Most studies failed to provide quantitative data on cough as our main outcome of interest, which made it very difficult to assess whether positive study results were clinically relevant. Quantitative data that could be combined showed wide confidence intervals, although there was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Many included studies failed to report adverse effects adequately, and patient compliance with the treatment was not discussed in the vast majority of study reports. Four studies carried out multiple comparisons, thereby increasing the probability of a type I error (<LINK REF="STD-Albrecht-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Albrecht 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parvez-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Parvez 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pavesi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pavesi 2001</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:22:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) cough medicines, and from the studies included in this review it remains unclear whether these medications are helpful for the treatment of acute cough. Although a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared OTC cough preparations with placebo, the number of trials in each group was small. This review suggests that most preparations appear to be safe, based on those studies reporting side effects, which only described a low incidence of mainly minor adverse effects. However, more serious concerns about the safety of OTC cough medicines have arisen since this review was last updated, particularly in young children and, in general, larger numbers of patients are required in order to identify serious, though less common adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2008a</LINK>). This systematic review confirms the lack of evidence for or against an effect of OTC cough preparations despite using an extensive search strategy. This lack of evidence of effectiveness also has implications for the regulatory bodies and brings into question how these products can continue to be promoted using language that implies that their effectiveness is not in doubt.</P>
<P>The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because study designs, populations, interventions and outcomes varied markedly between studies, limiting the generalisability of the results. All results were based on a small number of studies. It is also questionable as to whether all of the positive results obtained with unclear outcome measures are clinically relevant.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-07 21:22:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further high-quality RCTs of OTC cough preparations are needed as the results of this review are based on a small number of often underpowered studies. More evidence about the effectiveness of OTC cough preparations would be helpful, particularly in relation to the use of honey in adults and children, as identification of effective self care treatments may help reduce the burden of days lost at work due to acute cough as well as the number of consultations in primary care. Research should also include individuals who self medicate with OTC cough preparations, as there is likely to be a variation between countries in the proportion of individuals using these medications, with or without professional advice, particularly given the international variation in what products are available OTC or on a prescription basis. There is also a need to identify ineffective preparations in order to lower costs for consumers and healthcare providers. Studies will need to be rigorously designed and should use clinically relevant outcome measures, including cough frequency, severity and duration. It is important that future RCTs use OTC drugs in doses recommended by the manufacturers for an appropriate length of time, as drugs tested in a single and possibly too low a dose are likely to be ineffective. Trials should also report details on effect sizes and provide data on adherence and adverse effects. This review also highlights a need for an outcome measure for acute cough that is clinically relevant, valid, reliable and easy to use in RCTs.</P>

<P>A single randomised controlled trial (RCT) was added to this review in the 2008 update (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2004</LINK>). Paul et al tested a single nocturnal dose of dextromethorphan, or a single nocturnal dose of diphenhydramine versus placebo. The outcomes in this study were measured the following morning and included a cough severity index and a measure of sleep difficulty both for the affected children and their parents. This study showed no significant treatment differences between the two intervention groups and the control group. Average treatment differences were between 12% and 17% in favour of dextromethorphan for cough bouts (P value = 0.004), cough components (P value = 0.003) and cough effort (P value = 0.001) with an increase in cough latency (P value = 0.002).</P>
<P>A further single RCT was added for the 2010 update (<LINK REF="STD-Mizoguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mizoguchi 2007</LINK>). Mizoguchi et al compared a single nocturnal dose of a combination test syrup containing dextromethorphan, doxycycline, ephedrine and paracetamol with placebo. The outcomes in this study were measured over the following two days and included proportions reporting improvements in cough three hours after taking the treatment and mean cough scores on day one and day two. This study showed significant treatment differences between the two intervention groups and the control group in terms of reduction in mean cough scores on day two.</P>
