<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:24:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many patients in primary care suffer from mental health and psychosocial problems. These problems often involve feelings of sadness, nerves or stress. Many of these problems may be due to personal and social problems or reactions to life events such as physical illness or unemployment.</P>
<P>&#8216;Counselling&#8217; is a recognised psychological therapy that is often provided to such patients. In the United Kingdom, counsellors have often been employed to deliver psychological therapy to patients in primary care settings. Providing counselling alongside other treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy means that patients have greater choice, and that alternatives can be found for patients who either do not benefit from standard treatments or who do not find them acceptable.</P>
<P>However, recent clinical guidelines in the United Kingdom have highlighted the lack of evidence for counselling compared to other treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy, and have not been able to clearly recommend the use of counselling in primary care.</P>
<P>In this review we found nine studies involving counselling in primary care for 1384 participants. There were some problems with the methods in some studies. The evidence suggested that counselling is better than usual general practitioner care in improving mental health outcomes in the short term, although the advantages are modest. People who receive counselling in primary care from a trained counsellor are more likely to feel better immediately after treatment and be more satisfied than those who receive care from their general practitioner. However, in the long term, counselling does not seem to be any better than GP care. Although some types of healthcare utilisation may be reduced, counselling does not seem to reduce overall healthcare costs. There is very limited evidence comparing counselling with other psychological therapies (2 studies with 272 participants) or with antidepressant medication (1 study with 83 participants).</P>

<P>To update the review, the following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis (CCDAN) trials registers (to December 2010), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to May 2011).</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-07-18 11:20:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of counselling for mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-07-27 08:40:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction sheet by two reviewers. Trials were rated for quality by two reviewers using Cochrane risk of bias criteria, to assess the extent to which their design and conduct were likely to have prevented systematic error. Continuous measures of outcome were combined using standardised mean differences. An overall effect size was calculated for each outcome with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Continuous data from different measuring instruments were transformed into a standard effect size by dividing mean values by standard deviations. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the results. Economic analyses were summarised in narrative form. There was no assessment of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-07-27 08:45:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Nine trials were included in the review, involving 1384 randomised participants. Studies varied in risk of bias, although two studies were identified as being at high risk of selection bias because of problems with concealment of allocation. All studies were from primary care in the United Kingdom and thus comparability was high. The analysis found significantly greater clinical effectiveness in the counselling group compared with usual care in terms of mental health outcomes in the short-term (standardised mean difference -0.28, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.13, n = 772, 6 trials) but not in the long-term (standardised mean difference -0.09, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.10, n = 475, 4 trials), nor on measures of social function (standardised mean difference -0.09, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.11, n = 386, 3 trials). Levels of satisfaction with counselling were high. There was some evidence that the overall costs of counselling and usual care were similar. There were limited comparisons between counselling and other psychological therapies, medication, or other psychosocial interventions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-07-26 07:31:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Counselling is associated with significantly greater clinical effectiveness in short-term mental health outcomes compared to usual care, but provides no additional advantages in the long-term. Participants were satisfied with counselling. Although some types of health care utilisation may be reduced, counselling does not seem to reduce overall healthcare costs. The generalisability of these findings to settings outside the United Kingdom is unclear.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-07-27 14:50:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>The prevalence of mental health and psychosocial problems in primary care is high (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2001</LINK>). These problems include diagnosed mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, through to less well defined psychosocial difficulties or &#8216;problems in living&#8217; which may be associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, but may be linked to financial, domestic or interpersonal pressures.</P>
<P>In the United Kingdom, surveys indicate that around 2.6% of adult patients in the community would meet diagnostic criteria for a &#8216;depressive episode&#8217; but the broader category of &#8216;mixed depression and anxiety&#8217; would apply to 11.4% (<LINK REF="REF-Singleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singleton 2001</LINK>). When all &#8216;common mental health disorders&#8217; are included (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>), surveys indicate that one in six adults may meet diagnostic criteria (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 2009</LINK>). &#8216;Common mental health disorders&#8217; include a range of conditions, such as depression, anxiety, panic, PTSD and antenatal and postnatal mental health (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>). Many of these disorders are associated with significant impact on health related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>), social function and economic outcomes within and outside health care (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:25:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organisation has outlined reasons why treatment for mental health and psychosocial problems should be based in primary care, including the overall burden, the link between mental and physical health, and the potential for primary care services to offer accessible, effective and efficient management (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite this potential, there are concerns that service provision by general practitioners (GPs) and the primary care team for patients with mental health and psychosocial problems is variable, sometimes unresponsive to the needs of patients, and not always achieving the best outcomes for patients (<LINK REF="REF-Katon-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ustun-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ustun 1995</LINK>). This may reflect a lack of focus on the development of primary care mental health services or limitations in the training of and resources available to primary care practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many different ways of delivering services for mental health and psychosocial problems (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2005;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Cape-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cape 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Gask-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gask 1997</LINK>). One model involves mental health specialists working directly in primary care to provide psychological therapies. In the United Kingdom, developing evidence of clinical effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>) and economic benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Layard-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Layard 2006</LINK>) and patient preferences for psychological therapies over medication (<LINK REF="REF-Priest-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priest 1996</LINK>) has led to this model receiving significant support in health policy. This in turn has led to the introduction of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2009</LINK>), which provided funding to develop psychological therapy services along a stepped care model (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Stepped care provides a range of treatments of different intensity and cost, designed to maximise access to care and ensure treatment is commensurate with severity and capacity for benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2005a</LINK>). This can include &#8216;low intensity&#8217; interventions such as guided self help (<LINK REF="REF-Gellatly-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gellatly 2007</LINK>), computerised interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2006</LINK>), exercise, and group psychological therapies. More severely ill patients or those who fail to benefit from these treatments may receive medication and conventional &#8216;high intensity&#8217; psychological therapies (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapy is generally focused on cognitive behaviour models, which dominate current guidelines for the delivery of IAPT and stepped care (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Nevertheless, a  variety of mental health specialists work in primary care settings to deliver psychological therapy, and this includes counsellors. The first reports of counsellors working in primary care in the United Kingdom were published in the 1970s (<LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harray-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harray 1975</LINK>). In England and Wales, at one point between one third and one half of general practices reported on-site counselling services (<LINK REF="REF-Mellor_x002d_Clark-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellor-Clark 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sibbald-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sibbald 1993</LINK>). Counsellors come from different professional backgrounds and use a variety of treatments on a wide range of clients (<LINK REF="REF-Bolger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolger 1989</LINK>). Counselling in primary care is often associated with brief treatments (6 to 12 sessions) provided for a wide range of psychosocial problems, and can involve a range of different theoretical approaches, including &#8216;person-centred&#8217; and &#8216;psychodynamic and psychoanalytic&#8217; therapies, as well as &#8216;integrative&#8217; (involving a mixture of therapeutic strategies, including cognitive behaviour therapy), &#8216;systemic&#8217;, and &#8216;supportive&#8217; therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Stiles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiles 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiles-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiles 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-07-27 09:01:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There is an extensive body of literature on the effectiveness of psychological therapies in a range of mental health disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Chambless-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambless 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weston-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weston 2004</LINK>) although there is less consensus over the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies and the exact mechanisms by which these interventions achieve their effects (<LINK REF="REF-Holmes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luborsky-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luborsky 1975</LINK>). Non-directive, experiential or person-centred approaches share a number of assumptions about curative mechanisms, including a focus on enhancing subjective experience during treatment, and the crucial role of the therapeutic relationship as a platform for change (<LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1994</LINK>). Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic counselling may focus on a range of issues and conflicts, including needs, drives, relationships and attachments, while cognitive behaviour counselling considers maladaptive beliefs and behaviours and may use more structured and directive methods to encourage change (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>). It has been suggested that providing such treatments in primary care will enhance their effectiveness because the primary care setting enhances access and minimises stigma (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:26:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Concerns remain as to whether counselling in primary care represents a cost-effective use of resources, both compared to usual general practitioner care, and compared to other psychological therapies such as cognitive-behaviour therapy. Initial uncontrolled studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Booth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Booth 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coe-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coe 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harray-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harray 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keithley-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keithley 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waydenfeld-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waydenfeld 1980</LINK>) reporting reductions in consultation and prescription rates and high levels of patient and professional satisfaction were important in the early development of counselling in primary care. However, the methodological limitations of these early studies meant that concerns about the efficacy of counselling in primary care began to be expressed (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>). The place of counselling in stepped care models of treatment delivery is currently unclear. Providing counselling alongside other treatments such as cognitive behaviour therapy means that patients potentially have greater choice, and that alternatives can be found for patients who either do not benefit from cognitive behaviour therapy or who do not find that therapy acceptable. Making services &#8216;patient-centred&#8217; is an increasing focus of health policy (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2010</LINK>), and there is evidence that a significant proportion of patients will choose psychological therapies such as counselling if provided a choice (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the United Kingdom, the recent clinical guidelines for depression published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence suggested that professionals should &#8216;consider counselling for people with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression&#8217; but should &#8216;discuss with the person the uncertainty of the effectiveness of counselling...in treating depression&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Such uncertainty is unhelpful for patients, professionals and commissioners, highlighting the need for regular and comprehensive summaries of current evidence.</P>

Many trials of counselling in primary care are &#8216;pragmatic&#8217; RCTs, which seek to determine the relative 'value' of treatments as they would be provided in routine care settings, and seek to increase external validity without significantly compromising internal validity (<LINK REF="REF-Roland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roland 1998</LINK>). In primary care, this means that interventions are not highly standardised, so as to reflect the clinical variation that exists in routine care contexts. The control group ('usual general practitioner care') is the mix of interventions that patients would usually receive, and may include interventions similar to counselling (such as referral to NHS psychological therapy services). Although lack of control over these aspects of the trial can make interpretation of findings complicated, the external validity of study findings is increased and such studies provide a relevant comparison group for estimates of cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>Males and females of all ages, consulting a primary care practitioner with mental health or psychosocial problems considered suitable for counselling were eligible for the review.</P>
<P>Traditionally, counsellors have worked with people with situational or life-adjustment problems rather than mental health problems per se, although referrals will vary depending upon counsellor expertise, doctor and patient choice and the availability of alternative mental health services. The review included patients with a defined diagnosis of a mental health problem (such as depression or anxiety), those who were defined on the basis of symptom severity (such as a score on a depression scale) and those who were referred on the basis of clinician judgment that the patient had a problem that would benefit from counselling in primary care. This might include acute or chronic presentations. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Experimental conditions</HEADING>
<P>As noted above, counselling is a generic term that can be used to describe a range of mental health and psychosocial interventions provided in primary care. The precise boundaries of counselling interventions for the present review are described below. For the purposes of the review, counselling was not an integral component of other mental health care activities (e.g. nursing, medical care) but constitutes a distinct and separate treatment intervention, offered as a series of sessions, following an assessment which generates a therapeutic plan. The definition of counselling used was derived from the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-BACP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">BACP 1992</LINK>): "Counselling is the skilled and principled use of relationships which develop self-knowledge, emotional acceptance and growth, and personal resources. The overall aim is to live more fully and satisfyingly. Counselling may be concerned with addressing and resolving specific problems, making decisions, coping with crises, working through feelings and inner conflict, or improving relationships with others. The counsellor's role is to facilitate the client's work in ways that respect the client's values, personal resources and capacity for self determination".</P>
<P>Counselling may be described using a number of specific terms and may involve a number of different therapeutic techniques, including non-directive, person-centred and process-experiential methods, as well as cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic approaches (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elliott-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Counselling may be offered by a variety of professionals (e.g. counsellors, community nurses, social workers, clinical psychologists, and primary care professionals). In this review, there were no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria related to professional background. However, formal counselling training was considered essential, to standardise expertise and practice. Only practitioners with a formal counselling qualification equivalent to BACP accreditation levels (<A HREF="http://www.bacp.co.uk/accreditation/">http://www.bacp.co.uk/accreditation/</A>) were included in the review.</P>

<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 27,000 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO; quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organisation&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, the hand-searching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-07-28 08:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Most outcomes used were measured on continuous scales, but different studies used different outcome measures. In order to provide an overall measure of treatment effect, all data (even from identical outcome measures) were translated to a standardised mean difference by dividing the difference in mean values between treatment and control group by the pooled standard deviation. Short-term (one to six months), long-term (7-12 months) and very long-term data (&gt; 12 months) were analysed separately.</P>
<P>Clinical effectiveness data were analysed using RevMan software. Generally trials reported multiple outcomes, so the analysis either used the identified primary outcome measure within each trial, or the reviewers selected the optimal (i.e. most widely used and validated) measure of anxiety and depression symptoms, which make up the bulk of symptoms in patients in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1992</LINK>).

</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:31:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As counselling is an individual level intervention aimed at psychological and behavioural change, non standard designs (such as cluster randomised and cross-over trials) are not generally applicable, but would be included if identified. If results of cluster trials were reported without correction for clustering, they were adjusted to an effective sample size as outlined in the Handbook. Studies including multiple treatment groups were analysed including each pair-wise comparison separately, but with shared intervention groups divided out approximately evenly among the comparisons.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-07-26 18:33:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

All trials described therapeutic interventions with individual clients involving face to face contact between patient and counsellor. Although there were differences in the therapeutic models used (e.g. non-directive counselling, psychodynamic counselling, cognitive-behavioural counselling), the interventions were considered homogenous for the purposes of analysis. Planned treatment duration in the studies were as follows: 8 to 12 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>), 6 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Boot-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Boot 1994</LINK>), approximately 6 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Chilvers-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chilvers 2001</LINK>), 6 to 12 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>), up to 6 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1998</LINK>), 6 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Hemmings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemmings 1997</LINK>), 6 to 12 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>), 12 or 24 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Schroer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schroer 2009</LINK>) and 6 to 12 sessions (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>).  Most treatments were delivered weekly and the session length was usually around one hour.</P>

<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>), poor recruitment meant that participants were screened in surgery waiting rooms rather than referred by the GP. It is possible that these participants would differ from those in the other trials, possibly having lower levels of distress (although this was one of the trials that used a severity criterion) and lower motivation for treatment. In addition, this trial specifically recruited participants with chronic problems, defined as problems of six months or more. Some of the other trials included a mix of acute and chronic problems, although two specifically excluded chronic patients (<LINK REF="STD-Boot-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Boot 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>) As no data were available on the exact mix of acute and chronic patients in each trial, it was impossible to determine if the participants in the Simpson trial were qualitatively different. Nevertheless, the effect of the exclusion of this trial was examined in sensitivity analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Types of comparison group</HEADING>
<P>The comparison group in one trial was GP antidepressant treatment, as opposed to usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Chilvers-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chilvers 2001</LINK>). GPs were given guidelines concerning appropriate antidepressant treatment. There were no data available concerning the magnitude of the differences between GP management of participants in this group and 'usual care' in the other trials, although correspondence with the authors suggested that the former involved higher rates of antidepressant use than usual care, and also involved the expectation of antidepressants on the part of both participants and GPs. As stated above, this trial was initially excluded from the analysis of counselling versus 'usual care' and the effect of its inclusion examined in sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Two trials reported comparisons of counselling with cognitive-behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Barrowclough-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Barrowclough 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>).

<P>The test for heterogeneity approached significance in some of the sensitivity analyses: for the short-term effects on mental health after the exclusion of the studies at high risk of bias (p = 0.10, I<SUP>2</SUP>=52.4%, moderate heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis 1.1.1, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>); for the sensitivity analysis of short-term mental health outcomes in studies comparing counselling and 'usual care' including the GP antidepressant trial (p=0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> 46.8%, moderate heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis 1.1.2, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>); and in the analysis of long-term effects on mental health excluding the trials with inadequate allocation and chronic patients (p = 0.06, I<SUP>2</SUP>=71.4%, substantial heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis 2.1.4, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The low power of tests of heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 1998</LINK>) suggests some caution in the interpretation of the aggregated results, although it should be noted that the variation concerns the size of the treatment effect rather than its direction.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-04 08:38:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The updated review added only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Schroer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schroer 2009</LINK>), which was a pilot study prior to a fuller trial (listed in the &#8216;<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>&#8217; table). Although outcome data were collected as part of this pilot, they were not included in the published paper, and correspondence with one of the authors suggested that the study was not designed as an assessment of effectiveness and thus the outcomes from the pilot should not be included in the meta-analysis. There were therefore no major changes to the overall conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>In summary, there is evidence that counselling is more effective than usual care in terms of mental health outcomes in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.28, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.13, n = 772, 6 trials). However, these advantages do not endure in the longer term (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.10, n = 475, 4 trials). Counselling may not differ in effectiveness from medication and cognitive-behavioural therapy, although the precision of these estimates (especially differences in outcomes between cognitive-behavioural therapy and counselling in older patients with anxiety) are necessarily limited. Counselling may be associated with some reductions in aspects of health service utilisation in the United Kingdom, but overall costs did not seem to be reduced, and may be increased, based on the individual patient data analysis across several of the included studies, conducted outside the Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2003a</LINK>). Participants were generally satisfied with counselling in primary care, but any benefits of counselling did not seem to extend to measures of social function.</P>
<P>Issues of relevance to the interpretation of the review are considered below.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of participants</HEADING>
<P>Clinical diagnosis was not a factor in selecting and recruiting participants in a number of trials included in this review. It has been argued that studies lacking confirmation of caseness or diagnosis are limited, since outcomes cannot be divorced from the natural history of a condition (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1998</LINK>). Lack of diagnostic assessment has meant that some studies included in the review have been excluded by clinical guidelines, because not all participants have a confirmed diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). While it is possible that interventions targeted to a specific diagnostic group may be more likely to demonstrate positive outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>), such trials may not accurately reflect how psychological therapies such as counselling are delivered in routine primary care, where GPs may be more likely to consider the frequency and severity of symptoms or problems than diagnosis (King 1998).</P>
<P>In terms of severity at baseline, the most frequently used measure in the included studies was the Beck Depression Inventory, and the baseline scores in trials using that measure were around 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>.<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>), 26 (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>) and 27 (<LINK REF="STD-Chilvers-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chilvers 2001</LINK>). An examination of baseline scores found in studies of cognitive behaviour therapy for diagnosed major depression found in the United Kingdom NICE depression guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>) and other sources found baseline scores that were not dissimilar: 24 (<LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 1981</LINK>), 27 (<LINK REF="REF-Elkin-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkin 1989</LINK>), 29 (<LINK REF="STD-Scott-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1997</LINK>). However, it was more difficult to compare other studies included in the review which used different outcomes, and there may be other differences between patients with similar symptom scores but different rates of diagnosed disorder (e.g. duration of disorder). </P>
<P>Generally GPs were encouraged to recruit all participants they considered suitable for counselling, but they may have been reluctant to recruit some participants to the study, and some authors reported that gathering information on such participants from GPs is difficult (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harvey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Harvey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>). While it is inappropriate to assume that patients participating in these trials were representative of eligible patients generally, all the included trials used similar procedures, so they can reasonably be combined. Nevertheless, caution must be exercised when generalising the results to the wider population of patients in primary care. The new study included in the updated review used referral from primary care practitioners and recruitment of cases through computerised primary care databases (<LINK REF="STD-Schroer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schroer 2009</LINK>). Such searches are increasingly used to recruit depressed patients in primary care and can be more efficient. However, such methods potentially access a different population of patients from those recruited by the GP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<P>There is a tension in the present review between the international nature of a Cochrane review, and the topic of 'counselling in primary care', which has developed largely within the context of health care in the United Kingdom. The use of definitions of counselling and accreditation criteria based on a single national organisation creates a number of difficulties. First, the results of the review may not be generalisable to other healthcare contexts. Second, it is not clear whether the inclusion criteria developed for the review will be appropriate if trials are identified from other countries. Finally, the inclusion or exclusion of particular therapies has not been made on the basis of empirically justified criteria. For example, a therapist in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hemmings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemmings 1997</LINK>) was reported as having trained in cognitive analytic therapy, which is not generally seen as a mainstream form of counselling. However, the counsellors in this trial did meet the BACP criteria and the author confirmed that the interventions offered were consistent with the BACP definition of counselling.</P>
<P>At present, the literature on counselling in primary care is largely restricted to the United Kingdom, as studies in the United States have tended to focus more on defined therapies such as cognitive behaviour therapy and interpersonal therapy. At present, the results of the review are more clearly applicable to the United Kingdom health care system.</P>
<P>None of the trials attempted to standardise 'usual care', and the GP interventions were monitored only from the perspective of gathering health service utilisation data. While some information about medication and referrals was available, there are no other details of the therapeutic encounter between GPs and their patients. Again, it is possible GPs were offering a sympathetic listening approach and that the interventions of counsellors and GPs were somewhat similar (<LINK REF="REF-Tylee-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tylee 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The practices and GPs recruited to the studies were volunteers rather than a random sample. The doctors who participated may have been particularly interested in the research question and may have used therapeutic techniques to a greater extent than is usual, thus reducing the additional effect of counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>). In addition, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hemmings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemmings 1997</LINK>), GPs participated in an Action Learning programme, in which they learned about counselling and counselling skills. This may have influenced their consultation style and referral practices.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Types of outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Almost all the outcomes were reported in terms of continuous scales, which may provide a more accurate and sensitive assessment of outcomes than dichotomising outcomes, but can make interpretation more difficult. The current study used the standardised effect size as a useful summary measure, which has also been used in major meta-analyses in the general psychological therapy literature. There are a number of ways of interpreting such an effect. Assuming that the scores of the treatment and control groups correspond to a normal distribution, effect sizes can be converted into percentiles (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>). The effect size of -0.28 found in the main short term comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) is relatively modest, and indicates that the average treated patient had a score approximately at the 60th percentile of scores for the untreated group. If the treatment had no effect, the scores of the average treated patient would be at the 50th percentile of scores (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1996</LINK>). A standardised mean difference can also be converted to an estimate of number needed to treat (NNT) if certain assumptions are upheld, and the present estimate would represent an NNT of around 6 (<LINK REF="REF-Kraemer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraemer 2006</LINK>). Finally, of those studies in the review which used the Beck Depression Inventory, the pooled standard deviations of scores at short term follow up was 9.3, and an effect size of -0.28 would represent a reduction of around 2.6 on that scale associated with the provision of counselling.  </P>
<P>Comparisons with the effects of alternative treatments in other reviews is problematic, as differences may relate to variation in study settings, patient populations and study quality. However, it should be noted that the effect size reported in the current review is not markedly different from those reported in other published meta-analyses of psychological and organisational interventions for depression, where they have been restricted to primary care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Bortolotti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bortolotti 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cape-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cape 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Participants allocated to counselling tended to be satisfied with the help they received from counsellors, and more satisfied than those who remained under 'usual care'. However, satisfaction is not necessarily related to outcome, and satisfaction measures are open to response bias associated with the trial, such as a desire to please the therapist, and to be seen as a polite and courteous person (<LINK REF="STD-Hemmings-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hemmings 1997</LINK>). The comparison of counsellors and GPs is also confounded with the time available to the two types of professionals: differences in satisfaction may be reduced or disappear entirely if both professionals were able to provide 50 minute sessions. Although patient satisfaction is increasingly seen as an important outcome in its own right, its status as a factor in decision-making about treatment provision in clinical guidelines is more ambiguous.</P>
<P>The analysis of economic outcomes was complicated by the range of different analytic techniques used, ranging from simple analyses of health service utilisation through more sophisticated net mean benefit calculations and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Given the difficulty of synthesising results across all the included studies, the included individual patient data analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2003a</LINK>) may represent the best current estimate of the effects of counselling on costs. The data would suggest that counselling is associated with an increase in costs, although that finding is sensitive to assumptions made in the analysis. Whether those cost increases are justified is dependent on the value placed on the significant though modest benefits in patient outcomes.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-07-15 11:24:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Although the review was concerned with mental health and psychosocial problems, and the studies included participants considered relevant for counselling by general practitioners, the primary outcome assessed was usually depression, and the impact of counselling on other outcomes is less well understood. As highlighted above, the topic of 'counselling in primary care' has developed largely within the context of health care in the United Kingdom and the evidence available is restricted to this setting.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:39:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review included nine studies and 1384 randomised patients, allowing estimates of the short term effects of counselling on mental health with a reasonable degree of precision, although the confidence intervals included effects which may not represent a clinically significant impact. There is clearly scope for further studies to improve the precision of estimates, allow estimation of the long-term benefits of counselling, and to explore effectiveness in different patient populations and against different comparator treatments. The review has identified methodological limitations in the studies, although some of these (i.e. blinding) reflect difficulties in applying methodological safeguards in the context of psychological therapy generally, rather than weaknesses of the studies included in the review. Patient self-reported measures used with patients who are unblinded to their treatment were judged as being at high risk of bias in the current review, although some researchers question whether such measures are as vulnerable to bias as unblinded observer measures (<LINK REF="STD-Friedli-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Friedli 1997</LINK>). However, given the consistency of the rating across studies, this would be unlikely to have a substantive effect on the results of the review.  </P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:39:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The definitions of counselling adopted in the review represent the United Kingdom context which means that relevant international evidence may have been excluded, although the list of excluded studies did not appear to include studies that were excluded arbitrarily. Sensitivity analyses on types of interventions, populations and on quality were based on issues identified during the review, rather than being pre-specified, which may have introduced bias. The identified economic analyses were not subject to formal critical appraisal and, as such, it is important to consider that in drawing conclusions about relative resource use, costs or efficiency of counselling in primary care compared with usual care.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-08-01 11:40:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As noted previously, the short term effects of counselling reported in the current review are not markedly dissimilar to those reported in other published meta-analyses of psychological and organisational interventions for depression, where they have been restricted to primary care settings. For example, cognitive behaviour therapy demonstrates an effect size of -0.33 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.06, 4 studies) in depression and  -0.26 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.08, 2 studies) in mixed anxiety and depression, while problem solving treatment demonstrates an effect of -0.26 (95% CI -0.49 to -0.03, 6 studies) in depression and -0.17 (95% CI -0.41 to 0.07, 6 studies) in mixed anxiety and depression (<LINK REF="REF-Cape-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cape 2010</LINK>). A large review of collaborative care interventions in primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbody-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbody 2006</LINK>) demonstrated an effect size of -0.25 (95% CI -0.18 to -0.32, 35 studies). Another review of psychological treatments in primary care reported an effect size of -0.42 (95% CI -0.59 to -0.26, 6 studies) for major depression (<LINK REF="REF-Bortolotti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bortolotti 2008</LINK>)</P>
<P>It has been suggested that counsellors working in primary care can lead to a reduction in health service utilisation, including fewer referrals to psychiatric services, fewer prescriptions and fewer GP consultations. Another Cochrane review which included some of the studies from the present review among a larger data set suggested that this may occur for mental health professionals generally, but that the effects are limited in scope and consistency (<LINK REF="REF-Harkness-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harkness 2009</LINK>). The current data reflected the findings of the wider review, as there was some evidence that modest reductions in health service utilisation did take place. Some studies suggested that the provision of counselling was not associated with increased costs, but such analyses are hampered by small sample sizes (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2000</LINK>) and the finding of no differences in costs must be interpreted cautiously, particularly since the exploratory individual patient data meta analysis indicated that the costs associated with counselling may be higher, which supports the argument that previous analyses were underpowered (<LINK REF="REF-Bower-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bower 2003a</LINK>). </P>

<P>Although the exact estimate of effect size depends on the trials included in the analysis, the results demonstrate some consistency in suggesting that counselling is significantly more effective in reducing mental health symptoms in the short-term, but appears to provide no additional advantage in the long-term.</P>
<P>The implication of this finding for the provision of counselling in current stepped care models depends fundamentally on the importance attached the size of the short-term effect, and the comparison with the effects found in relation to alternative treatments, especially cognitive behaviour therapy. Although some reviews suggest that the overall effects of different therapies are similar in primary care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Cape-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cape 2010</LINK>), evidence reviews undertaken for clinical guidelines in the United Kingdom are not generally restricted to a single setting such as primary care (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). There is some evidence that treatments provided in primary care may demonstrate smaller effects than those in secondary settings (<LINK REF="REF-Raine-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 2002</LINK>) although it is not clear whether this represents differences in patients, treatments or study quality (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The results can only be generalised to similar patients and counsellors. This means that the evidence is restricted to counsellors with BACP accreditation or equivalent. Some of the trials have been restricted to patients with a certain level of disorder, such as a threshold score on the Beck Depression Inventory or Patient Health Questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schroer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schroer 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>). Although such severity scores may not be generally available to practitioners in all contexts, such measures are incentivised for use in some primary care settings such as the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Kendrick-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendrick 2009</LINK>).<I> </I>
</P>
<P>Factors predicting which patients benefit most from counselling and other psychological therapies in primary care are not well understood at present. The United Kingdom Department of Health guidelines suggest that age, sex, social class and ethnicity should not determine access to psychological therapies such as counselling (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The current evidence suggests that provision of counselling may make a useful addition to primary care services alongside other mental health treatments. Commissioners of services can use the information contained in this review to assist in decision-making about current and future service provision.</P>
<P>The ongoing trial identified in this updated review will add significantly to the evidence base for counselling when it reports in the next 18 to 24 months. The trial has randomised 755 participants between counselling, acupuncture and usual care.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-08-04 08:41:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although pragmatic trials do not attempt to instigate the highest levels of experimental control, it is important that studies adequately describe the participants, treatments and other factors that are involved in the trial. For example, although 'patients suitable for counselling' is a pragmatic criterion for entry to a trial, it would still be helpful to provide information on all types of problems that were eventually referred (e.g. diagnoses). Equally, although treatments may not be highly standardised, it is important to know that treatments were distinct, which may require more extensive descriptive work (especially of the content of GP care) or use of validated rating scales of therapy content (<LINK REF="STD-King-2000" TYPE="STUDY">King 2000</LINK>). Data extraction and quality ratings in the review would be improved if sufficient information on key methodological details were always provided, and the importance of concealment of allocation suggests that routine use of an external randomisation agency is justified.</P>
<P>Although the review provides information on comparisons between counselling and three other treatments (usual care, GP antidepressant treatment and cognitive behaviour therapy), the evidence is limited with respect to two of those treatments. Given the importance of cognitive behaviour therapy in current delivery of care for depression and other mental health problems, there is clearly a need to further assess the comparative effectiveness of counselling and cognitive behaviour therapy to increase the precision of the current estimate, and there is scope to compare counselling with other psychological therapy treatments, such as problem-solving (<LINK REF="STD-Mynors_x002d_Wallis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mynors-Wallis 1997</LINK>) or interpersonal therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Schulberg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schulberg 1996</LINK>) and the new generation of guided self-help treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Gellatly-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gellatly 2007</LINK>). The ongoing trial identified in this updated review is assessing the effectiveness of counselling against both usual general practitioner care and acupuncture (<LINK REF="STD-Schroer-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Schroer 2009</LINK>). As outlined in the introduction, extending the evidence base in this way would have the potential to increase patient choice about psychological therapies, if other interventions are demonstrated to be effective. Questions about the importance of patient preferences as determinants of outcome also remain (<LINK REF="REF-King-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2005</LINK>), although there are significant methodological barriers to the assessment of the effects of preferences (<LINK REF="REF-Torgerson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torgerson 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research into the long-term outcome of patients treated with psychological therapies is a key priority. Although one trial included outcomes at 36 months (<LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2000</LINK>), this was in a population of chronically ill patients who did not demonstrate gains in the short term. More research is required into the long-term clinical and economic impacts of psychological therapies such as counselling, although the methodological and logistical challenges are significant.</P>

<P>Details of the search for the first version of the review, published 2001.<BR/>
<BR/>1. Electronic searching of databases. A qualified librarian assisted researchers with electronic searches of several databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, ASSIA, HLPA/HEALTHSTAR, DHSS DATA, DARE, NHSeed, HELMIS, ECONLIT and CINAHL. Searches commenced in 1996 and were updated throughout the review.<BR/>2. Specialised databases were searched including PSYCLIT and COUNSEL.LIT. Searches commenced in 1996 and were updated throughout the review period.<BR/>3. Hugh McGuire, Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis (CCDAN) Trials Co-ordinator, searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on the Cochrane Library, 1997; Issue 2. In addition, the CCDAN Review Group trials register was searched.<BR/>3. Handsearching of a specialist counselling journal was undertaken by one of the reviewers (NR), in consultation with the Baltimore Cochrane Centre, which is co-ordinating the development of the International Register of Clinical Trials for the Collaboration, including the co-ordination of handsearching efforts.<BR/>4. Grey literature (e.g., Conference proceedings, dissertations, government documents, internal reports, agency reports) was searched. The grey literature database, SIGLE, was searched electronically, as was DISS (Dissertations Index).<BR/>5. Reference lists from books, journal publications and grey literature were scanned, and references followed up.<BR/>6. Personal communication. The researchers contacted subject experts and CCDAN members to identify further published or unpublished controlled trials.<BR/>
<BR/>SEARCH TERMS<BR/>The electronic search of databases was comprehensive. The breadth of the key word search (terms for counseling/psychotherapy in general practice/primary care) meant that the reviewers identified many studies that were not controlled trials. The key word search was deliberately not restricted to methodological key words, because it was anticipated that some controlled trials would be missed due to poor indexing. Moreover, given the range of patients that counsellors treat, and the range of professionals who offer counselling, a broad search strategy was considered essential in order to include all relevant trials. DARE (Database of Reviews of Effectiveness) and NHSeed (NHS Economic Evaluations database) were searched at the outset of the Review (1996) and again in 1998. Both databases are produced by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at York, England.</P>
<P>
<U>Search update 2001</U>
<BR/>For the first update of the review (May 2001), searches were restricted to those databases judged to be high yield in the first version of the review: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCLIT and CINAHL, the Cochrane Controlled Trials register and the CCDAN trials register. These databases were searched using the same keywords, from the date of the original searches to June 2001.</P>
<P>
<U>Search update 2005</U>
</P>
<P>For the second update of the review, searches were conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane trials register and the CCDAN trials register (25-10-2005).</P>
<P>For a comprehensive list of search terms used, see previous versions of this review (available on the Cochrane Library).</P>
