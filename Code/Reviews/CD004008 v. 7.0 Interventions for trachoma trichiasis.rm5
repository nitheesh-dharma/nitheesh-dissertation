<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>This review addressed the question: "Which interventions improve the results of the treatment for trichiasis (in-turned eyelashes) caused by trachoma?"</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Trachoma is the commonest infectious cause of blindness in the world. It is caused by a bacterium called <I>Chlamydia trachomatis. </I>This infection causes inflammation and scarring of the surface of the eye, which results in the eyelid turning in (entropion) so that the eyelashes touch the eyeball. This is known as trachomatous trichiasis. The lashes can scratch the corneal surface, leading directly or indirectly (from secondary infections) to corneal opacity. Surgery to correct the eyelid deformity is the main treatment for the late stages of the disease. Most cases of trachomatous trichiasis occur in sub-Saharan Africa. They are generally treated by nurses with limited surgical training. Unfortunately the results of the surgery can be quite variable, with frequent post-operative trichiasis reported. Therefore, we wanted to find out what types of surgery and other interventions give the best results in treating this condition.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>We identified 13 randomised controlled trials. They were all conducted in trachoma-endemic countries (mostly in sub-Saharan Africa) with surgical interventions carried out by non-physician surgeons. Five studies compared different surgical treatments. Three studies investigated whether azithromycin antibiotic treatment after surgery improves the results. One study compared different types of sutures. One study compared surgery to the pulling out of eyelashes (epilation). One study compared the outcomes of treatments provided in the community with hospital care. One study compared the results of surgery performed by eye doctors with those of non-specialist technicians. The evidence is current to May 2015. Most studies were funded by government research councils or charitable foundations.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>These trials suggested that the most effective surgery requires full-thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the edge of the eyelid. The use of a surgical lid clamp improves eyelid contour outcomes and reduces granuloma formation. Silk and absorbable sutures give comparable results. The addition of azithromycin treatment at the time of surgery may reduce post-operative trichiasis under certain conditions. Epilation is less effective than surgery at treating trichiasis, but has comparable results for vision and corneal change two years after intervention. Community-based surgery was more convenient for patients by reducing the time and expense of travelling to a conventional hospital, and it did not increase the risk of complications or recurrence. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and by integrated eye care workers were both similarly effective. Destroying the lash roots by freezing or electrical ablation appeared to have low success rates and the equipment required is costly and can be difficult to maintain.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>The quality of the evidence from these randomised controlled trials was variable. Most were of a high quality. However, several were relatively small in size and several had potential bias problems due to the method of randomisation and masking.</P>

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2015), the ISRCTN registry (<A HREF="http://www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch">www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 7 May 2015. We searched the reference lists of included studies to identify further potentially relevant studies. We also contacted authors for details of other relevant studies.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-10-21 18:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We included randomised trials of any intervention intended to treat trachomatous trichiasis.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-09-14 22:36:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three review authors independently selected and assessed the trials, including the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for missing data when necessary. Our primary outcome was post-operative trichiasis which was defined as any lash touching the globe at three months, one year or two years after surgery.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-14 21:54:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria with 8586 participants. Most of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of the studies were of a low or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Five studies compared different surgical interventions. Most surgical interventions were performed by non-physician technicians. These trials suggest the most effective surgery is full-thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the terminal tarsal strip. Pooled data from two studies suggested that the bilamellar rotation was more effective than unilamellar rotation (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.50). Use of a lid clamp reduced lid contour abnormalities (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.98) and granuloma formation (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.97). Absorbable sutures gave comparable outcomes to silk sutures (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.20) and were associated with less frequent granuloma formation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99). Epilation was less effective at preventing eyelashes from touching the globe than surgery for mild trichiasis, but had comparable results for vision and corneal change. Peri-operative azithromycin reduced post-operative trichiasis; however, the estimate of effect was imprecise and compatible with no effect or increased trichiasis (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; 1954 eyes; 3 studies). Community-based surgery when compared to health centres increased uptake with comparable outcomes. Surgery performed by ophthalmologists and integrated eye care workers was comparable. Adverse events were typically infrequent or mild and included rare postoperative infections, eyelid contour abnormalities and conjunctival granulomas.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-30 08:18:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No trials were designed to evaluate whether the interventions for trichiasis prevent blindness as an outcome; however, several found modest improvement in vision following intervention. Certain interventions have been shown to be more effective at eliminating trichiasis. Full-thickness incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the lash-bearing lid margin was found to be the best technique and is preferably delivered in the community. Surgery may be carried out by an ophthalmologist or a trained ophthalmic assistant. Surgery performed with silk or absorbable sutures gave comparable results. Post-operative azithromycin was found to improve outcomes where overall recurrence was low.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Features</HEADING>
<P>Trachoma is a form of chronic conjunctivitis caused by <I>Chlamydia trachomatis</I>. Following repeated infections, the upper tarsal conjunctiva becomes scarred. As the scar tissue contracts, it shortens the posterior lamella (inner surface) of the upper lid causing the eyelashes to turn in (entropion) and rub against the transparent cornea. This contact between one or more lashes and the surface of the eye is called trichiasis. Trichiasis due to trachoma has a wide spectrum of severity from a single lash touching the eye through to the entire upper lid being rolled in (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2011</LINK>). It may result from misdirected or metaplastic eyelashes, in the absence of frank entropion (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2011</LINK>). Corneal opacification and the resulting blindness probably develop primarily as a result of this trauma and secondary bacterial corneal infection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) estimates suggest that about 40 million people have active trachoma and about 8.2 million have trichiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Mariotti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mariotti 2009</LINK>). The signs of active trachoma are usually most frequently found in young children, with males and females equally affected. The scarring complications become evident in later life. Women are usually more frequently affected by trichiasis than men (<LINK REF="REF-West-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1991</LINK>). The rate at which the scarring complications of the disease progress varies, possibly reflecting variation in the pressure of <I>C. trachomatis</I> infection and immunogenetic predisposition of different populations (<LINK REF="REF-Hu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2013</LINK>). Trachoma is most prevalent in hot, dry areas and is associated with poverty (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 2000</LINK>). The greatest burden of disease is in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trachoma control</HEADING>
<P>The eradication of blinding trachoma is one of the objectives of the global Vision 2020 programme to eliminate avoidable blindness, led by the WHO and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. In 1997 the WHO launched an initiative on trachoma control based on the 'SAFE' strategy. SAFE stands for Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. Improved facial cleanliness and environmental hygiene are effective at reducing transmission by removing the conditions that promote spread of the disease. Antibiotics reduce the risk of disease transmission by treating the infectious agent. Surgery to correct the lid deformity is the only treatment that is likely to be beneficial in the late stages of the disease; however, once corneal opacification has occurred, management options are very limited. Cochrane reviews of the optimum antibiotic regimen for trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 2011</LINK>), environmental sanitation (<LINK REF="REF-Rabiu-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabiu 2012</LINK>), and face-washing promotion (<LINK REF="REF-Ejere-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ejere 2015</LINK>), are published on the Cochrane Library.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trichiasis treatment options</HEADING>
<P>The primary aim of treatment for trichiasis is to prevent blindness due to trauma from the lashes abrading the cornea (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2012</LINK>). Treatments may be divided into non-surgical treatments and surgical treatments:</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Non-surgical treatments</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>epilation (manual removal of eyelashes, usually with forceps);</LI>
<LI>eyelid-taping (to force eyelashes back to correct position)</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical treatments</HEADING>
<P>Surgical procedures for lash ablation or removal:</P>
<UL>
<LI>electrolysis (fine needle used to pass electric current to base of lash follicle);</LI>
<LI>cryotherapy (freezing treatment to the lash follicles)</LI>
<LI>excision of lash-bearing tissue</LI>
</UL>
<P>A wide variety of surgical options are available for the treatment of upper lid entropion (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2012</LINK>), and it is likely that certain operations are more successful than others. In trachoma-endemic countries the most commonly used procedures are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>bilamellar tarsal rotation (BLTR): full-thickness incision through the eyelid, including the scarred tarsal plate, orbicularis oculi and the skin, fixation with everting sutures;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (PLTR)/Trabut: incision through the scarred tarsal plate and conjunctiva only, leaving the skin and orbicularis oculi intact, fixation with everting sutures;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>tarsal advance and rotation: incision of the tarsal plate and rotation of the terminal portion. The upper part of the tarsus is separated from the anterior lamellar, advanced and fixed with sutures.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These techniques are illustrated in the WHO's publication - Trichiasis surgery for trachoma (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-14 21:54:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The lash treatments directly remove or ablate the follicles. They do not correct any underlying anatomical abnormality such as entropion and are, therefore, generally not suitable if there is a significant degree of entropion. The lid rotation procedures correct the underlying entropion by an incision through the scarred tissue, outward turning of the lid and fixation with sutures. Generally, this will correct the trichiasis in most cases, although in more severe cases this might be insufficient. Post-operative trichiasis can occur either through inadequate surgery or progressive scarring disease.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-20 14:34:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Evidence from case series and randomised controlled trials suggests that upper lid surgery can be successful at abolishing trichiasis; however, typically 20% to 40% of eyelids suffer from post-operative trichiasis by one year (<LINK REF="REF-Bog-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bog 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>); and up to 60% at three years (<LINK REF="REF-Khandekar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khandekar 2001</LINK>). Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of a good treatment outcome and identify strategies that lead to this.</P>
<P>Risk factors associated with post-operative trichiasis include the severity of pre-operative trichiasis (<LINK REF="STD-Alemayehu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alemayehu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2013</LINK>); chlamydial infection (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2004</LINK>); inflammation of the tarsal conjunctiva (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ward-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2005</LINK>); bacterial infection (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>); and left eyes (<LINK REF="REF-Merbs-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merbs 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The choice of treatment will depend on factors such as available resources and expertise, location (opportunity for follow up) and how advanced the disease is. The WHO strategy for the control of blinding trachoma calls for lid surgery to be delivered by ophthalmic assistants as well as ophthalmologists (<LINK REF="REF-Habtamu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habtamu 2011</LINK>), because the numbers of ophthalmologists are insufficient to provide the service. Ophthalmic assistants are usually taught to perform only one type of operation so it is important to ensure that the operation they use is known to be effective.</P>
<P>Although surgery generally produces good results, in many settings only a minority of patients with trichiasis will attend for surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Courtright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtright 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1994</LINK>). Delivery of surgery in the community or non-surgical management of trichiasis may be more acceptable than surgery in a conventional hospital setting (<LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011a</LINK>).</P>

<P>The interventions tested were varied and there was considerable heterogeneity. We present a descriptive summary of the results rather than a single summary statistic. Where the unit of randomisation was a cluster rather than an individual, data were analysed by cluster. The principal outcome measure was post-operative trichiasis, which was defined as any lash touching the globe in the primary position. Odds ratios were calculated for the different interventions. Visual acuity data were presented as dichotomous data<B>&#8212;</B>statistically significant improvement or no improvement from pre- to post-intervention. Data on adverse effects and acceptance of surgery were also presented as dichotomous data. The exception to this was the three studies examining the effect of azithromycin on the outcome of surgery. A meta-analysis was performed for the dichotomous outcome of post-operative trichiasis using a Mantel-Haenszel, random-effects model. For trials where there were more than two arms these were considered separately in relation to the reference intervention where appropriate, such as different surgical options. However, if two arms utilised the same intervention, they were combined.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Surgical technique</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK> study a successful outcome was defined as no post-operative trichiasis (no lashes in contact with the globe after surgery) and complete gentle closure of eyelids. There was no pre-defined outcome point, and in the group with major trichiasis follow-up varied from 5 to 11 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK> defined a successful surgical outcome as no post-operative trichiasis, no further epilation/surgery during follow up period, complete lid closure, no over-correction of lid margin, acceptable appearance to patient and examiner, and no onset of phthisis. They also examined the effect on visual acuity and the complication rate. Follow-up points were not defined in the methodology, but occurred (on average) at 9 and 21 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Adamu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adamu 2002</LINK> defined success as no eyelash-eyeball contact, complete lid closure and no over- or under-correction. Recurrence was defined as eyelash-eyeball contact in all positions of gaze or inward rotation of the lid margin. Visual acuity was measured pre- and post-operatively. Final follow up was planned at three months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2005</LINK> used several outcome measures at six months: trichiasis and/or entropion recurrence, palpebral aperture, an acceptable cosmetic appearance.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Gower-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gower 2013</LINK>, the primary outcome was the presence of one or more of the following unfavourable outcomes: post-operative trichiasis; eyelid contour abnormality; or granuloma formation. Participants were re-examined at six weeks, 12 months and 24 months. Both eyes in bilateral cases were included in the analysis, with an appropriate adjustment.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epilation</HEADING>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011a</LINK>, the primary outcome measure was "failure" which was defined as either (1) five or more eyelashes touching the globe; or (2) a history of surgery performed in the trial eye at any point during the two-year follow-up period (in the case of the surgical arm this would be repeat surgery). Participants were re-examined every six months for two years.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK> collected data at 1, 4 and 12 weeks and recorded recurrence of trichiasis, visual acuity, patient discomfort and any adverse events.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Antibiotic treatment</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes in the <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK> study were assessed at 6 and 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was post-operative trichiasis. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity and patient perception of improvement by asking whether vision and pain was 'worse', 'same' or 'better'.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK> the primary outcome was post-operative trichiasis. This was assessed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Patients were examined again at 2 and 3 years.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK> evaluated three outcomes: post-operative trichiasis; chlamydial infection; and active trachoma. Participants were re-examined at 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively. If the participant developed "surgical failure", which was defined as five or more lashes touching the eye by three months, they were excluded from the analysis.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK> The primary outcome measure was the proportion of those individuals seen at the 12-month follow-up who were found to have either (1) post-operative trichiasis; or (2) a history of repeat TT surgery during the first year. Participants were re-examined every six months for two years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Surgery setting</HEADING>
<P>There were three main outcomes in the <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK> study: (1) uptake of treatment in the local village compared to the health centre; (2) post-operative trichiasis); (3) complication rate. Other parameters measured included time taken by the patient to travel to the operating room and cost implications associated with presenting for surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Personnel performing surgery</HEADING>
<P>The first follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-Alemayehu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alemayehu 2004</LINK> study was at seven days post-operatively: those with post-operative trichiasis at this assessment were deemed surgical failures and were excluded from the primary analysis; the main outcome was post-operative trichiasis rate at three and six months. Those with post-operative trichiasis at three months were excluded from the six-month assessment. Analysis was by randomised group and also by presenting severity.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-21 18:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Trachomatous trichiasis is a significant ophthalmic public health problem in several regions of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence identified in this review serves to highlight not only what is currently known about the effectiveness of treatment for this condition but also the challenges involved in delivering the necessary care and achieving good long-term outcomes to prevent blindness.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgical interventions</HEADING>
<P>Detailed descriptions of the different surgical procedures are provided elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2012</LINK>). Some evidence suggests that operations in which the full-thickness of the tarsal plate is incised and the terminal lash-bearing tarsus is rotated so that the lid margin is everted are more effective than procedures that do not involve this (<LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK>). It was possible to pool the results of <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK>, which found evidence that bilamellar tarsal rotation has lower post-operative trichiasis rates than tarsal advance and rotation. This unilamellar procedure was performed by placing the sutures through the marginal strip of the tarsal plate and a second set from the upper end of the tarsal plate into the anterior lamella. In <LINK REF="STD-Adamu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adamu 2002</LINK> a variant of the bilamellar tarsal rotation was compared to the posterior lamellar tarsal rotation (also known as the Trabut procedure), in which the sutures were placed above the lashes, similar to the bilamellar technique. The same unilamellar technique as that used by <LINK REF="STD-Adamu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adamu 2002</LINK> was used in a case series in East Africa with similar anatomical success (<LINK REF="REF-Bog-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bog 1993</LINK>). It is possible that the difference in results reflects the difference in technique, but the studies also had differing follow-up periods (times of assessment), which may have influenced the outcomes.</P>
<P>At present both the bilamellar and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation operations are both extensively used in trachoma-endemic countries. There is currently no conclusive evidence that bilamellar surgery is superior to the posterior lamellar operation. Although cases of overcorrection and exposure were more common following bilamellar lid surgery, the risk was very low and the difference was not statistically significant in any study. It appears that both bilamellar and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation procedures are safe operations. The only common complication was post-operative trichiasis.</P>
<P>The use of a lid clamp in the bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure did not reduce post-operative trichiasis but was associated with better eyelid contour outcomes and fewer granulomas (<LINK REF="STD-Gower-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gower 2013</LINK>). Both lid rotation operations are relatively simple and require little equipment. Ophthalmologists, nurses, ophthalmology trainees and IECWs undertook the surgery in the included studies. It is possible that certain types of surgery are more effective than other types in specific situations. To our knowledge this has not yet been tested in any trial.</P>
<P>Interventions to treat minor trichiasis by destroying the lashes, such as cryotherapy and electrolysis, appear to have low success rates in preventing recurrent trichiasis compared to bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK>). As the equipment required is costly and can be difficult to maintain, this strategy is not recommended.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epilation</HEADING>
<P>Epilation is widely practised in most regions that have a high prevalence of trichiasis and it may have a role in the management of minor trichiasis where there are only a few peripheral lashes and a patient declines surgery. The study that investigated this was a non-inferiority trial comparing enhanced epilation (high-quality forceps and training) to posterior lamellar tarsal rotation surgery for minor trichiasis cases only (<LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011a</LINK>). The primary endpoint in that trial was progression to major trichiasis with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The cumulative risk of failure was 13.2% in the epilation group and 2.2% in the surgical group, with a risk difference of 11% (95% CI 8.1% to 13.9%, which includes the 10% non-inferiority margin). Therefore, the trial provided an inconclusive result relative to the predefined 10% non-inferiority margin. The proportion having any degree of trichiasis during follow-up was significantly higher in the epilation group. However, over a two-year period the important secondary outcome measures of change in visual acuity and corneal opacity showed no significant difference. It is notable that at two years only 31% of those still epilating accepted the offer of surgery.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lid-taping</HEADING>
<P>Double-sided sticking plaster requires replacement of the plaster every week. As a temporary measure, however, the use of sticking plaster to evert the lashes is useful and in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK> was superior to, and more comfortable than, epilation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic treatment</HEADING>
<P>Post-operative trichiasis was observed more often when the tarsal conjunctiva was inflamed (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). This clinically apparent inflammatory reaction could arise for a number of reasons: a smouldering immunologically driven process, infection with chlamydia or other bacteria, or mechanical irritation from the lashes (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2010;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2012</LINK>). It is likely that chronic inflammation is the basis of progressive conjunctival scarring. Adjuvant therapy may reduce the risk of recurrent scarring and trichiasis.</P>
<P>Three studies with heterogeneous designs, populations and study participants have investigated whether azithromycin can reduce trichiasis recurrence. Azithromycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic with some anti-inflammatory properties. The first study was conducted in a programmatic context where many different surgeons were operating in The Gambia, a country with a very low prevalence of chlamydial infection, and recruited only major trichiasis cases (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>). This study did not find an effect from azithromycin at one or four years, and overall recurrence rates were relatively high with significant inter-surgeon heterogeneity. The second (and largest) study, which included both major and minor trichiasis from an area of Ethiopia with high chlamydial infection rates and a limited number of surgeons, found a significantly lower trichiasis recurrence rate in the azithromycin arm at one year, but not at three years (<LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>). The third study, from Nepal, did not find an overall significant difference at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>). A sub-group analysis suggested a possible effect for major trichiasis cumulatively to one year. None of the other sub-groups showed a significant effect. It is not possible to draw a definite conclusion about the impact of azithromycin on post-operative trichiasis due to the study heterogeneity. The pooled analysis did not find a significant reduction in post-operative trichiasis. It appears that where post-operative trichiasis rates are low, there may be some benefit of azithromycin treatment; however, under operational/programmatic conditions with higher overall post-operative trichiasis rates there was no observed effect. Non-chlamydial bacteria have been frequently cultured from the conjunctiva of people with trichiasis (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Alternative suture materials</HEADING>
<P>The study comparing silk with absorbable sutures found no difference in the recurrence rates at one or two years (<LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>). In many settings patients with trichiasis have to travel long distances to obtain surgical services. The typical practice is to use silk sutures, which have to be removed a week to 10 days post-operatively. This incurs additional transport and time for both the patient and surgical team, adding to the overall cost of surgery. However, in many settings absorbable sutures are substantially more expensive than silk sutures. Occasionally silk sutures are not removed, which can cause granuloma formation and serious complications for the cornea if left in long-term. Therefore, the use of absorbable sutures may be preferable for cost reasons where these can be afforded; a formal cost benefit analysis is needed to answer this question. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Surgery setting</HEADING>
<P>The uptake of trichiasis surgery is often low (<LINK REF="REF-Courtright-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Courtright 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 1994</LINK>); strategies that increase the proportion of patients who attend for surgery need to be developed. <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK> showed that it was less costly, and took less time, for participants to attend surgery in the community and that community-based surgery was as safe and as effective as surgery in a health centre. However the uptake of surgery was only 20% better for village-based surgery than for health centre-based surgery (when analysed by cluster). It is not mentioned whether the resource implications for setting up village-based surgery were greater than those required for health centre-based surgery and it may be that this needs to be considered in the light of the reasonably small improvement in uptake. The village-based approach to delivering surgery may work better in certain environments than others and should be considered along with other strategies for further research.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Personnel performing surgery</HEADING>
<P>Most regions where trichiasis is prevalent have few ophthalmologists, and other health workers need to be trained to undertake the surgery in order to provide an adequate level of service. The evidence from the <LINK REF="STD-Alemayehu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alemayehu 2004</LINK> study suggests that surgery performed by a specially-trained integrated eye worker is as successful as that undertaken by an ophthalmologist. Some caution needs to be applied in interpreting this result as the early recurrences (occurring by seven days) were excluded from the analysis. While this is very encouraging in terms of providing not only man-power but also a high-quality service, care needs to be taken to ensure appropriate specialist training is in place. Multiple studies have shown that success rates vary across surgeons (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). This finding probably reflects varying levels of training, innate skill and experience, and serves to highlight the need not only for a high standard of basic training but also for ongoing monitoring and support.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Improvement in visual acuity or prevention of visual acuity deterioration is the primary long-term aim of treating trachomatous trichiasis. However, this requires long-term studies and therefore such evidence would be very difficult to obtain. The studies included here do not provide the opportunity to evaluate whether trichiasis surgery prevents long-term loss of vision, because surgery has never been compared directly with no treatment. However, several studies have found modest but significant improvement in vision following surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>). Some of the visual impairment prior to surgery may be due to photophobia, lacrimation or irritation, or combinations of these three factors, caused by trichiatic lashes. Correction of the trichiasis should relieve these symptoms. Corneal scarring generally does not improve following surgery, although one study which compared corneal photographs before surgery to those at 2 years did find a degree of improvement in a minority of people (<LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some trials have reported relatively high rates of eyelid contour abnormalities, which were less frequent with the use of a lid clamp (<LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gower-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gower 2013</LINK>). Other factors that are likely to affect patient satisfaction with surgery are comfort and appearance. Despite a lack of evidence for improvement or preservation of vision, <LINK REF="REF-Bowman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 2002</LINK> reported 85% of operated patients were pleased with the outcome of surgery and 94% would recommend the operation to others. In the <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK> study, 94% of patients said they were more comfortable a year after surgery, compared to their pre-operative condition. Careful study of these important subjective factors may help provide a more complete picture of successful treatment and maybe even identify motivators for attendance.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-21 18:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>It is important to recognise the real difficulties of conducting studies in areas where resources and access to health care are limited, but there are several quality issues that must be highlighted in order for the studies to be interpreted appropriately. The grade of the evidence presented by many of the thirteen studies was high; however, there was some variability in the quality either due to small sample size or unclear or sub-optimal methodology.</P>
<P>For several the sample size was relatively low and probably insufficient to address the question (<LINK REF="STD-Dhaliwal-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Dhaliwal 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most studies randomised participants; for several, however, sufficient information is not provided to determine the risk of bias associated with randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Adamu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adamu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alemayehu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Alemayehu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK>). In one study patients were assigned on an alternating basis (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2006</LINK>), and this approach is vulnerable to bias because the assignment coordinator could adjust the enrolment order based on his/her preferences or beliefs. </P>
<P>Participant masking to intervention was not possible in most studies and would not be expected to influence the outcome, since typically an independent observer evaluated a non-subjective outcome (presence of lashes touching the eye). Masking of outcome assessors is more crucial for unbiased reporting; however, in four studies it is unclear whether masking was done (<LINK REF="STD-Adamu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Adamu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bowman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bowman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Graz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Graz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1990</LINK>). While this must be considered a quality concern, the reality may have been that researchers were working with a limited number of eye care professionals and did not have the resources to exclude some staff from delivery of care in order to ensure adequate masking.</P>
<P>The length of follow-up in many of the included trials is quite short, limiting information regarding the long-term effectiveness of the treatments. Long-term follow-up studies indicate that trichiasis continues to return after several years, but at a slower rate than during the first year post-operatively (<LINK REF="REF-Rajak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rajak 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>). With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Reacher-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reacher 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Burton-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-West-2006" TYPE="STUDY">West 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011a" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Rajak-2011b" TYPE="STUDY">Rajak 2011b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gower-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gower 2013</LINK>, all studies had less than 12 months of follow-up. Many areas where trachomatous trichiasis remains a significant public health problem are isolated and poor, and some of the population may be semi-nomadic, making longer follow-up difficult to achieve. The relatively short duration of follow-up did, however, mean there were generally high levels of follow-up.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-14 19:30:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The evidence summarised in this review provides some indication of the basis for practice but one must remember that there are weaknesses in some of the data that may make the results unreliable.</P>
<P>There is less risk of recurrence if the full thickness of the tarsal plate is incised and the lash-bearing tissue is rotated away from the globe to evert the lid margin compared to procedures that do not involve a full-thickness tarsotomy. This can be achieved by either unilamellar or bilamellar lid surgery. Operations such as tarsal grooving, tarsal advance and eversion splinting are less effective. The bilamellar tarsal rotation is better than either cryotherapy or electrolysis in rendering a patient trichiasis-free.</P>
<P>The optimal management of minor trichiasis remains uncertain. However, for patients with minor trichiasis who refuse surgery or where surgery is unavailable, epilation is a generally acceptable second-line alternative treatment with comparable visual outcomes.</P>
<P>Post-operative azithromycin may be associated with reduced risk of post-operative trichiasis; however, this effect is less certain under programmatic conditions than under high-quality surgery by a few highly-skilled integrated eye care workers.</P>
<P>Silk and absorbable sutures have comparable outcomes. However, absorbable sutures have practical operational advantages in settings where they are affordable.</P>
<P>Local health workers (nurses, medical assistants or non-ophthalmologist doctors) may be trained to a level where they can perform trichiasis surgery as effectively as an ophthalmologist; however, it is essential that local health workers receive good training, surgical certification and follow-up supportive supervision in order to help ensure high-quality surgery is maintained.</P>
<P>If uptake for trichiasis surgery is low in central settings, consideration should be given to providing it in patients' own communities.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-14 17:54:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<I>
<B>Recurrent trichiasis: </B>
</I>the recurrence rate of trichiasis following surgery remains high in most programmatic settings, regardless of the intervention used. Recurrence is strongly associated with tarsal conjunctival inflammation, the cause of which is not well understood. Research is needed to improve understanding of the reasons why trichiasis recurs and to investigate targets for possible adjuvant therapy. Further trials are needed to compare the long-term results of bilamellar and posterior lamellar tarsal rotation surgery, the two most commonly used operations. Since it is now known that the risk of recurrence is influenced by entropion severity, this must be taken into account in the design of future trials.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Acceptability of treatment:</B> </I>a major obstacle to successful trichiasis surgery is failure to attend for an operation. Further research is required to identify other means of increasing the proportion of people who attend for surgery. It may be possible to identify the perceived benefits of lid surgery to the patient&#8212;such as free transport or improved cosmesis&#8212;and to use these perceived benefits to persuade others to attend.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Pattern of surgical provision: </B>
</I>we do not yet know the most effective way of delivering trichiasis surgery: is it through a high-volume surgical camp, or through a single surgeon working long-term in a specific district? Further studies are required to determine not only which method will give the best uptake, but also which is most cost effective and is associated with the lowest recurrence rate.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Quality of surgery: </B>
</I>there is a need for research to understand the determinants of a successful surgical training programme. There is a need to assess methods to audit the outcome of surgery by individual surgeons. This information then needs to be fed back to improve training programmes.</P>
<P>
<I>
<B>Quality of life:</B> </I>although it has been shown that most trichiasis patients are happy with the results of their surgery the impact of surgery on quality of life and what might enhance this is a neglected area of research,</P>
