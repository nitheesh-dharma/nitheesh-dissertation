<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Serious congenital heart disease leads to abnormal blood flow through the heart and lungs. This results in an inability to carry enough oxygen around the body which makes patients blue (cyanotic) and severely limits their physical activity. People with cyanotic congenital heart disease are at risk of developing brain abscess. This condition is serious and can lead to death because the abscess causes abnormal brain function. Treatment includes antibiotic therapy to kill the bacteria that cause the infection. In people with a large abscess, an operation to drain the abscess may be carried out. Antibiotic therapy for brain abscess should include drugs that penetrate into the abscess cavity. The drugs chosen should also be matched to the sensitivity of the bacteria obtained from the abscess in laboratory culture. There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to show the best antibiotic regimen for treating people with cyanotic congenital heart disease who develop brain abscess. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-09 10:31:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Brain abscess</HEADING>
<P>Brain abscess is a focal, intracerebral infection that begins as a localized area of infection and develops into a collection of pus surrounded by a well-vascularized capsule (<LINK REF="REF-Mathisen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathisen 1997</LINK>). It can originate from infection of contiguous structure (e.g. otitis media, dental infection, mastoiditis, sinusitis), as the result of hematogenous spread from a remote site (particularly in people with cyanotic congenital heart disease), after skull trauma or surgery and, rarely, following meningitis. In at least 15% of cases no source can be identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cyanotic congenital heart disease</HEADING>
<P>Cyanotic congenital heart disease is a congenital defect of the heart that leads to hemodynamic abnormality. Systemic venous return to the right-side of the heart is shunted across the defect into the systemic circulation, resulting in persistent arterial desaturation and cyanosis. People with cyanotic congenital heart disease are at risk of developing brain abscess. Intracardiac right-to-left shunt bypass, by which blood is not filtered through pulmonary circulation where bacteria are intercepted by phagocytosis, may allow direct entry to cerebral circulation. In addition, decreased arterial oxygenation can result in compensatory polycythemia. Increased blood viscosity can cause a focal area of ischemia that serves as a nidus for infection. Shunted blood containing micro-organisms may be seeded in such lesions, forming a cerebral abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Matson-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matson 1961</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fischbein-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbein 1974</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Size of the problem</HEADING>
<P>Brain abscess is not common and is a rare complication of cyanotic congenital heart disease. In one study the frequency of brain abscess in people with cyanotic congenital heart disease was 2% among 1,270 patients during a 13-year period (<LINK REF="REF-Fischbein-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbein 1974</LINK>). The peak incidence occurs when the patient is between 4 years and 7 years of age, although cases of brain abscess may occur in adults with cyanotic congenital heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kagawa-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagawa 1983</LINK>). Among the 149 patients with brain abscess in one report, 103 (69.1%) had cyanotic congenital heart disease. In this study, the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease was tetralogy of Fallot (51 patients), followed by complete transposition of the great arteries (12 patients) and double outlet of right ventricle (10 patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Takeshita-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeshita 1997</LINK>). The reported case fatality rates for cyanotic brain abscess in the pre-computerized tomography (CT) era were 38% (<LINK REF="REF-Fischbein-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischbein 1974</LINK>), 40% (<LINK REF="REF-Brewer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brewer 1975</LINK>) and 37% (<LINK REF="REF-Kagawa-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kagawa 1983</LINK>). In the CT era, the in-hospital case fatality in one report was 13.3% (<LINK REF="REF-Prusty-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prusty 1993</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions used</HEADING>
<P>Treatments include intravenous antibiotics alone, or concomitantly combined with surgical interventions such as aspiration of the abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Takeshita-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeshita 1997</LINK>) and /or abscess excision (<LINK REF="REF-Mathisen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathisen 1997</LINK>). The most common organisms isolated in cyanotic brain abscess include <I>Streptococcus viridans</I>, microaerophilic streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and occasionally, <I>Haemophilus </I>species (<LINK REF="REF-De-Louvois-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Louvois 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saez_x002d_Llorens-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saez-Llorens 1989</LINK>). On theoretical grounds, antibiotic therapy for bacterial brain abscess should include agents that penetrate into the abscess cavity and have in vitro activity against the pathogens isolated. Drugs should be given intravenously in order to yield high serum levels and therefore high levels in the abscess cavity. Other adjunctive therapy includes the use of corticosteroid to control cerebral edema in patients with potentially life-threatening complications such as impending cerebral herniation. Severe brain edema may also necessitate the administration of intravenous mannitol and intubation with forced hyperventilation. Rarely, placement of a ventriculostomy catheter for cerebrospinal fluid drainage, to relieve intracranial pressure, may prove lifesaving. Seizures are a frequent complication of brain abscess and anticonvulsants may be needed (<LINK REF="REF-Mathisen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathisen 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Specific antibiotic treatment</HEADING>
<P>For the past 20 years high dose intravenous penicillin G and chloramphenicol have been used to treat brain abscess in this setting with satisfactory outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Jadavji-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadavji 1985</LINK>). The most important drawback of chloramphenicol is its toxic hematologic effect including a common and predictable, but reversible, erythroid suppression of the bone marrow. However, serious irreversible aplastic anemia, leading in many cases to fatal pancytopenia, has been described in patients who received chloramphenicol (<LINK REF="REF-Jimenez-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jimenez 1987</LINK>). Third generation cephalosporins, either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone have good central nervous system penetration (<LINK REF="REF-Sjolin-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjolin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamamoto-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamamoto 1993</LINK>), and excellent in vitro activity against many pathogens isolated from bacterial brain abscess. Metronidazole is highly active against anaerobic bacteria, including <I>Bacteroides fragilis</I>, the most resistant anaerobe. Therefore, metronidazole is usually combined with third generation cephalosporins or penicillin G for the treatment of cyanotic brain abscess (<LINK REF="REF-Sjolin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjolin 1993</LINK>). As third generation cephalosporins are much more expensive than penicillin G there is a need to evaluate the effects of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of brain abscess in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.</P>

Binary outcomes would be expressed as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data would be analysed using weighted mean difference. Depending on the presence or absence of trial variability (significant heterogeneity defined as P &lt; 0.1) a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) or a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Demets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demets 1987</LINK>) would be used. Rare events would be estimated by Peto odds ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1998</LINK>). In case of significant heterogeneity, the potential causes for the heterogeneity would be explored by performing sensitivity analyses. All studies would be combined. Subgroup analyses would be performed analysing all-cause mortality, type of cyanotic congenital heart disease, according to methodological quality, class of antibiotics and duration of treatment. If sufficient trials were found the presence of publication bias would be assessed by funnel plots (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>We found no studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this review. There are no ongoing studies on antibiotic regimens for brain abscess in cyanotic congenital heart disease.</P>
<P>The updated search in June 2009 found an additional 63 references none of which met the inclusion criteria.</P>
<P>The updated search in January 2013 identified 158 new references, none of which met the inclusion criteria. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The treatment of brain abscess requires a multidisciplinary approach. Imaging studies allow early diagnosis and permit rapid and precise localization of brain lesions that may require surgical intervention. Stereotactic needle aspiration permits therapeutic drainage and provides diagnostic specimens for identification of the causative organisms. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started on the basis of the likely associated pathogens which depend on the presumptive precipitating source of infection and the Gram stain results. The antibiotic regimen can be modified, if necessary, once culture results on aspirated pus are available. Serial imaging studies are done to monitor the therapeutic response and identify recurrent or secondary lesions that may require repeated drainage. </P>
<P>Not surprising, as brain abscess is a rare condition, randomized controlled trials of different therapies do not appear to have been conducted. All of the published studies were retrospective, and most of the reports focused on neurosurgical and radioimaging, and as a result did not contain comprehensive information on microbiological data or details of the antibiotic regimens used. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Yang-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1981</LINK> reviewed 400 cases of brain abscess treated in China over 20 years (April 1952 to December 1972). Sixteen cases had congenital heart disease as a predisoposing factor. The antibiotic regimens were penicillin and streptomycin in the earlier cases, when they routinely used penicillin and chloramphenicol. <LINK REF="STD-Mampalum-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mampalum 1988</LINK> described 102 cases over 17 years. They grouped their patients according to the treatment received: excision, aspiration and nonsurgical therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1983</LINK> reported 34 children treated for brain abscess during 15 years. Thirteen cases had cyanotic heart disease. Their treatment included puncture of the abscess, antibiotic administration and redraining if indicated. <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez_x002d_Garcia-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez-Garcia 1999</LINK> retrospectively analysed 100 cases of brain abscess diagnosed between 1979 and 1998. <LINK REF="STD-Abdullah-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullah 2001</LINK> reported 60 cases of brain abscesss during the 7-year period from 1990 to 1996. Twenty patients had cyanotic heart disease. The combination of a beta-lactam agent with chloramphenicol and/or metronidazole was used as standard treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2002</LINK> reported 123 cases of brain abscess over a period of 15 years (January 1986 to December 2000). Of these 123 patients, 103 had community-acquired infections, while the other 20 were diagnosed with nosocomial infection. The portal of entry in 94 culture-positive cases included hematogenous spread (n = 32), postneurosurgical states (n = 17), contiguous infection from parameningeal foci (n = 22) and unknown (n = 24). No information regarding congenital heart disease as a predisposing factor was described. <LINK REF="STD-Seneviratne-Rde-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seneviratne Rde 2003</LINK> reported 41 patients with cerebral abscess, 30% of cases had congenital heart disease as the predisposing factor. The antibiotic regime used in this neurosurgical unit consisted of cefotaxime and metronidazole and the result of treatment was satisfactory. <LINK REF="STD-Jansson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Jansson 2004</LINK> described 66 cases of brain abscess treated initially with cefotaxime over a period of 10 years (January 1990 to December 1999). The predisposing factor was cardiopathy (type not specified) in nine cases. Sixty-two of these patients were treated additionally with metronidazole and surgery was also performed in 53 patients. Side effects which included nonpruritic rash, leukopenia, drug fever etc., were reported in 42 patients, of whom cefotaxime was terminated prematurely in 38 patients. The overall mortality was 12%.The Infection in Neurosurgery Working Party of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy reviewed the rational use of antibiotics in the treatment of brain abscess by reviewing all English language publications between 1975 and 1999. They found no randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-British-Society-2000" TYPE="STUDY">British Society 2000</LINK>). Their recommendations are inevitably based on pathological and surgical principles of choosing the most appropriate antibiotic combination based on likely pathogens and in vitro antibiotic sensitivity, abscess drainage and supportive treatment. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The clinical management of people with cyanotic congenital heart disease who developed a brain abscess has to rely on the results of retrospective studies and previous clinical experience other than that obtained through randomized controlled or controlled clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As it is unlikely that a trial of treatment of brain abscess will be conducted owing to the rarity of the condition and concensus about the approach to choice of antibiotic regimens and indications for surgical drainage, future research may be best directed towards diagnosis and early detection of brain abscess, molecular methods to detect the infecting organism as an alternative to culture, and exploring more effective and practical drainage methods to improve quality of care.</P>
