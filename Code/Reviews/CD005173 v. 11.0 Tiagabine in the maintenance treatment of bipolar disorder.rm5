<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>People with bipolar disorder suffer from repeated episodes of severe mood disturbance. These can vary from mania to severe depression.  Sometimes manic and depressive symptoms can occur at the same time. Episodes may also fluctuate frequently, so-called 'rapid cycling'. Periods of normal mood and function may occur in between these episodes, but this is not always the case.</P>
<P>Medications are used to treat these mood episodes and to prevent their recurrence. Tiagabine could be one such medication. Currently, it is only licensed for the treatment of epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy appear to tolerate tiagabine relatively well. However, the following adverse effects have been reported: dizziness, tiredness, sleepiness and incomplete seizure control.</P>
<P>This systematic review investigated the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine compared to placebo and other mood stabilisers in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. No randomised controlled trials were found. Currently, there is insufficient evidence on which to base any conclusions regarding the use of tiagabine in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Tiagabine, an anticonvulsant, has been reported to have efficacy in prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder in case reports and in case series.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:10:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>To assess the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine, relative to placebo, and other agents in the prevention or attenuation, or both, of episodes of bipolar disorder in adults. The efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine were considered in terms of mood symptoms, mortality, general health, social functioning, adverse effects and overall acceptability to participants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-05-09 11:11:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis review group's specialised register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) was searched to April 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder were examined. Authors, other experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies were contacted for knowledge of suitable published or unpublished trials. Specialist journals and conference proceedings were handsearched.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-08-11 11:08:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of tiagabine versus placebo, alternative mood stabilisers or antipsychotics, for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder in adults, male and female, aged 18 to 74 years.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:10:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Data were to be extracted from the original reports of included studies independently by two authors. The main outcomes to be assessed were:</P>
<P>(1) the efficacy of tiagabine treatment in preventing or attenuating further episodes of bipolar disorder, including its efficacy in rapid cycling disorder;<BR/>(2) the acceptability of tiagabine treatment to participants;<BR/>(3) the prevalence of side effects; and<BR/>(4) mortality, if any, on tiagabine treatment.</P>
<P>Outcomes concerning relapse or recurrence were to be analysed excluding data from studies using discontinuation protocols, which were to be analysed separately. Subgroup analyses were to be performed to examine the effects of tiagabine treatment in rapid cycling bipolar disorder and previous mood stabiliser non-responders. Data were to be analysed using Review Manager 5.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder were found.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 14:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There is an insufficient methodologically rigorous evidence base to draw any conclusions regarding the use of tiagabine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. There is a need for randomised controlled trials examining the therapeutic potential of this agent in bipolar disorder. There have been some reports of syncope or seizures, or both, when tiagabine has been used for the acute treatment of mania. It needs to be established if such adverse effects occur in the maintenance phase as well.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-05-10 10:55:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder with a life-time prevalence of 1% to 5% (<LINK REF="REF-Akiskal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akiskal 2000</LINK>) and carries with it significant morbidity, socio economic costs and risk of suicide. Classically, it is manifested in repeated manic, depressed or mixed mood episodes.</P>
<P>In the acute phase of the disorder it can present as an:</P>
<P>1. acute manic episode, where there are symptoms of elated mood, disinhibition and rapidity of thought.</P>
<P>2. acute depressive episode, where mood is lowered and there are a range of changes in thoughts, emotions, and bodily functions such as sleep and appetite.</P>
<P>3. a mixed episode, where there are features of 1 and 2.</P>
<P>After the acute phase is over, by nature, bipolar disorder tends to have repeated relapses. Medications which would prevent such relapses are considered as maintenance agents. Ideally, an agent used in the maintenance therapy of this disorder should be able to prevent the occurrence of all forms of affective episodes.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Different medications are recommended for the various stages and episodes of the illness (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2009</LINK>). A broad class of drugs used to treat the the manic episode are the antimanic agents. These agents could be antipsychotic medications (such as olanzapine, quetiapine etc); or drugs traditionally used in the treatment of epilepsy such as sodium valproate, iamotrigine or lithium. The antimanic agents may be used in conjunction with drugs that help the person become calmer and sedated e.g. iorazepam (given orally or by an injection). The depressive episode, on the other hand, can be treated with a combination of antidepressants and an anti-manic agent. Lastly, a mixed episode is treated by a combination of medications.</P>
<P>Lithium acts as an antimanic agent as well as for long term control over mood as a mood stabiliser. It is the longest used pharmaceutical agent. However, the response to lithium treatment is often unsatisfactory (<LINK REF="REF-Bowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowden 1996</LINK>). It has a narrow therapeutic window and is often associated with side effects, even at therapeutic doses. It is thought to precipitate episode recurrence on withdrawal, making its use in the non-compliant patient problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Over the past 20 years other agents have been used in maintenance treatment. The anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate have become established as adjunctive and alternative treatments to lithium. In addition, recent data on atypical antipsychotics have supported their prophylactic activity (<LINK REF="REF-Tohen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tohen 2003</LINK>). However, even with these advances, treatment resistance persists; new medications with mood stabilising properties are required.</P>
<P>Tiagabine, which is also an anticonvulsant, might have a role in bipolar disorder. Patients with epilepsy appear to tolerate tiagabine well (<LINK REF="REF-Sachdeo-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sachdeo 1997</LINK>). However, the following adverse effects have been reported: dizziness, tiredness, somnolence, other signs of central nervous system suppression and incomplete seizure control (<LINK REF="REF-Leppik-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leppik 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Recently the application of several anticonvulsant agents, previously unused in bipolar disorder, has been explored. Tiagabine is an anticonvulsant prescribed in adjunctive treatment of focal and secondary generalised epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Genton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Genton 2001</LINK>) and it might have a role in bipolar disorder. The role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems in bipolar disorder has been confirmed by postmortem and genetic studies <LINK REF="REF-Charych-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charych 2009</LINK>; as tiagabine modulates the GABA system, there might be a role of this agent in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Anecdotal reports suggest that this may be the case, however, this needs to be further investigated. Though the mechanism of action in bipolar disorder is not known, putatively it might be linked to its action as an uptake-reuptake blocker of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Suzdak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzdak 1995</LINK>). The drug is completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and achieves peak serum concentrations in one to two hours.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane collaboration and specifically the Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) has performed a number of reviews on various pharmaceutical agents in the treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Cipriani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cipriani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2003</LINK>). Such reviews are an attempt to better inform the management of this disabling condition. This particular review is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. That review did not find any evidence regarding the effectiveness of tiagabine in the treatment of bipolar disorder primarily because of a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This updated review attempts to find out if there has been any change in the evidence available.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:31:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>To assess the effects of tiagabine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>The following were the outcome criteria:</P>
<P>(1) to determine the efficacy of tiagabine compared to placebo, or an alternative drug, in maintenance treatment.</P>
<P>(a) in preventing or attenuating manic, depressive and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder.<BR/>(b) in preventing or attenuating episodes of bipolar disorder patients with rapid cycling disorder.<BR/>(c) on patients' general health and social functioning, as measured by clinicians global impression, by global impression of the participant, family members or significant others and by employment and marital stability.</P>
<P>(2) to review the acceptability of maintenance tiagabine treatment to patients, measured by: numbers of patients failing to complete studies; their reasons for dropping out; by measures of compliance; and by reference to the expressed views of patients regarding treatment.</P>
<P>(3) to investigate the adverse effects of tiagabine treatment, including general prevalence of side effects. Specific unwanted effects were also studied.</P>
<P>(4) to determine overall mortality rates, if any, on tiagabine maintenance treatment.</P>

<P>Adults aged 18 to 74 years old with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder approximating to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) Code F31* (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) 296* (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), or both, were to be included. This definition of diagnosis included previous versions of ICD and DSM. All subtypes of bipolar disorder were included: rapid cycling (those suffering from four or more affective episodes per year); types I and II and other; cyclothymia was excluded.</P>
<P>It was recognised that some trials may involve heterogenous groups of participants: in particular, they may include schizo-affective disorder and unipolar depressive disorder (diagnoses approximating to ICD 10 F25 and DSM 295.70, and ICD 10 F33 and DSM IV 296.2x/3x, respectively). Where possible, data from these studies were to be separated into diagnostic groups. If necessary, the authors of the studies were to be requested to provide original data. Where such separation was impossible, the studies were to be included only if at least 80% of randomised participants had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.</P>
<P>Where the information was available, previous mood stabiliser treatment was to be noted. When possible, subgroup analyses would be undertaken in participants defined as non-responsive to previous treatment.</P>

</P>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) maintain two clinical trials registers at their editorial base in Bristol, UK, a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 29,000 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 60% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Please contact the CCDAN Trials Search Co-ordinator for further details. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-); quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses.</P>

<I>Comprehensive psychiatry</I> (2001 to 2010) was handsearched. We had mentioned in our protocol that the <I>Journal of Bipolar Disorder</I> would also be handsearched. However, this journal is now handsearched in the compilation of the CCDANCTR. The annual conference proceedings of the <I>American Psychiatric Association</I> (2001 to 2004), <I>Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (</I>CINP) (2001 to 2004) and the <I>British Association of Psychopharmacology</I> (2001 to 2004) were handsearched.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Studies relating to tiagabine generated by the electronic search of CCDANCTR-Studies were scanned by one review author (AV). The abstracts of these studies were individually read to check if they fulfilled the following preliminary criteria for inclusion:</P>
<P>a) randomised controlled trial</P>
<P>b) comparing tiagabine with a comparator</P>
<P>c) participants with bipolar disorder, of whatever type</P>
<P>Such studies were highlighted for discussion with the second author (KM). After agreement, studies fulfilling the above criteria were ordered from the local medical library. All the full text articles from this preliminary list were then assessed by two review authors (AV and KM) independently to see if they met the stricter inclusion criteria for the review. If the raters disagreed the final ratings were made by consensus with the involvement (if necessary) of another member of the author team. Non-congruence in selection of trials was reported as percentage disagreement. Care was taken to avoid duplicating trials by inclusion of multiple papers reporting on the same trial, instead these were linked together as multiple references to the same trial.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-02-03 13:19:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (AV and KM) independently extracted data concerning participant characteristics (age, sex, bipolar diagnosis, comorbidity, severity of episode, treatment history, study setting), intervention details (intended dosage range, mean daily dosage actually prescribed, co-intervention if any, tiagabine as investigational drug or as comparator drug, sponsorship) and outcome measures of interest from the included studies. Any disagreements were to be resolved by consensus discussions with a third member of the review team.</P>
<P>Non-concurrence in selection and quality assessment were to be reported.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>In the original version of this review, we assessed methodological quality of included studies by criteria sent out in the Cochrane Handbook (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>); however, following the publication of the revised and expanded Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>), we updated our methods accordingly.</P>
<P>Working independently, AV and KM assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the tool described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following items were assessed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>sequence generation: was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>
<LI>allocation concealment: was allocation adequately concealed?</LI>
<LI>blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors for each main outcome or class of outcomes: was knowledge of the allocated treatment adequately prevented during the study?</LI>
<LI>incomplete outcome data for each main outcome or class of outcomes: were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</LI>
<LI>selective outcome reporting: were reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</LI>
<LI>other sources of bias: was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI>
</OL>
<P>We included quotations from the text of included studies; comments on how we assessed the risk of bias; and judgements as follows:</P>
<P>Low risk of bias<BR/>Unclear risk of bias<BR/>High risk of bias</P>
<P>If disputes arose as which judgement should be given, then resolution was achieved after consulting with the third review author (SNR).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2011-02-03 13:21:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes the odds ratio was calculated with 95% confidence limits. For continuously distributed outcome data the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence limits was used if all the trials used the same assessment scale. However if the trials use different assessment scales, the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence limits was calculated. If different assessment scales are used, then this potential source of heterogeneity was to be assessed.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Study responders were calculated on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; this implies that drop-outs were always included in the analysis. Where participants withdrew from the trial before the study endpoint, it was assumed that they would have experienced a negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). Where there were missing data and the method of 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. When dichotomous or continuous outcomes were not completely reported in the published literature, trial authors were asked to supply the data on an individual basis. The results arising from these two methods were compared during sensitivity analysis. Where ITT analysis was not possible, end-point data for trial completers were used. When only the standard error (SE) or t-statistics or P values were reported, standard deviations (SDs) were imputed for changes from baseline as described previously (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Heterogeneity between studies was to be assessed using the chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of heterogeneity and also by visual inspection of the forest plots as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>). Stastical significance value (p) of 0.1 was used for this test. If significant heterogeneity was identified, sources were to be investigated. Potential sources include the presence of schizo-affective and unipolar groups in the study sample, variation in dose and duration of treatment, demographic factors and illness characteristics. Any other potential source of heterogeneity which was apparent on examining the studies was also included. We also planned to calculate the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, an estimate of inconsistency and measured by the percentage of variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance), as suggested by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:32:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Data were entered into Review Manager 5 software by one reviewer (AV).</P>
<P>The primary analysis was to be a random-effects model using odds ratios (OR), which had the highest generalisability in our empirical examination of summary effect measures for meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Furukawa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furukawa 2002</LINK>). The robustness of this summary measure was to be routinely examined by checking the fixed-effect model OR and the random-effects model risk ratio (RR). Material differences between the models were to be reported. Fixed-effect analyses were undertaken routinely for the continuous outcomes as well, to investigate the effect of the choice of method on the estimates. Material differences between the models were to be reported.</P>
<P>When it appeared that the data were skewed, using recommended methods for identifying skewness from summary data (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>), they were to be reported descriptively. A negative outcome was to be assumed if participants dropped out of the study for any other reason than response to treatment. Non-quantitative data were to be presented descriptively. Outcomes concerning relapse/recurrence of affective disorder were to be analysed excluding data from studies of discontinuation design. Data from these studies were to be analysed separately, to assess the effects of tiagabine discontinuation.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Subgroup analyses, as recommended by the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>) were to be performed as defined a priori to assess the outcomes of tiagabine treatment for:</P>

<P>No randomised-controlled trials were found comparing tiagabine to an alternative agent; therefore no study met our criteria for inclusion in the review. We found no reports of ongoing studies of tiagabine in bipolar disorder in our searches. No studies await further assessment. The presence of publication bias was not examined in this systematic review because no trials were found, and so a meaningful formal assessment using funnel plots was not possible.</P>

In all of the three studies participants were initiated with tiagabine when they were acutely unwell (hypomanic/manic/depressed/rapid cyling) and this was followed by maintenance therapy after remission of their acute illness. Besides all of these studies being open-label, another deficiency was that none of these reports used objective or subjective rating of social functioning. From these limited studies it was observed that tiagabine was not well tolerated as there was high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:38:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>Over the five years since our last review, there have been no new published or unpublished randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder. Though the reason for the lack of this data is unknown, it could be that scientists and clinicians have been missing out testing this particular GABAergic agent. Indeed a frequently used agent in bipolar disorder, valproate, mediates its activity via the GABAergic system and has been found safe and and efficacious (<LINK REF="REF-Macritchie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macritchie 2003</LINK>). Newer studies continue to implicate the GABA system in bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Fatemi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fatemi 2011</LINK>); good quality prospective randomised controlled trials of tiagabine in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are needed.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There were no randomised controlled trials of tiagabine, hence efficacy of the agent in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder cannot be commented upon. However, open-label data (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>) suggests that adjunctive tiagabine may have efficacy in some patients with bipolar disorder. None of these reports used objective or subjective rating of social functioning. There is evidence that the agent is not well tolerated as there was high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">
<P>There were no studies which met the inclusion criteria; it is difficult to comment on the applicability of the results of the review.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-17 11:06:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review had a broad criteria of inclusion, hence it was expected that the external validity of the findings would be high. However, as there were no RCTs which were identified, the actual validity cannot be commented upon.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Attempts were made to procure all studies that would meet the inclusion criteria of the review. Hence potential for study selection bias was relatively low.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:38:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Chris Champion">

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient published evidence from randomised controlled trials on which to base any recommendations regarding the use of tiagabine in any phase of bipolar disorder, either in monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment. However, in view of the concerns raised regarding episodes of syncope or seizure, or both, in our review of tiagabine in acute episodes of bipolar disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2006</LINK>), clinicians should prescribe tiagabine with caution in bipolar disorder, particularly in polytherapy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-11-08 21:21:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for data from randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy and acceptability of tiagabine in the treatment and prevention of relapse of different affective states during the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. These studies should follow clarification of the nature of the episodes of syncope or seizure, or both, described in the acute episode review (<LINK REF="REF-Vasudev-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasudev 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The design of trials should incorporate the following general features. An appropriate method of treatment assignment should be used in order to prevent knowledge of the participant's treatment allocation prior to it taking place. Where possible, that allocation should be concealed from the participant and the assessor throughout the trial, although this may not be practical. The outcome in all participants allocated to each treatment should be reported, including those who drop out early. In those who do drop out early, the reason should be recorded. These factors are discussed in more detail in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>). Careful consideration should be given to the number of participants required to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the two treatments in the chosen primary outcome measure. Outcome measures should include factors that are relevant to patients, such as potential improvements in social function and the length of admissions to hospital.</P>
<P>In bipolar disorder studies, particular attention should be given to the reporting of the characteristics of the participants' illnesses, their previous treatment and the withdrawal of any psychotropic medication before and during the trial period.</P>

<P>Case series of 22 adult patients suffering from refractory bipolar disorder, tiagabine was added open-label to previous medication at a dose of 1 mg/day, dosage was increased by up to 1 mg per week. No exclusion criteria were applied. Patients had been on multiple other medications, details of which were not described. A mean dose of 4.1 mg (2.2 SD) of tiagabine was used. A priori positive response to tiagabine was measured on the clinical global impression-bipolar version (CGI-BP)(<LINK REF="REF-Spearing-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spearing 1997</LINK>) Eight of the 22 patients (36%) responded to tiagabine. All of the 14 non-responders withdrew from the treatment; 13 withdrew because of unacceptable adverse effects and one due to poor compliance. Adverse effects leading to discontinuation included overactivation (five patients), oversedation (four patients), cognitive impairment (two patients) and headaches (two patients). One patient with epilepsy suffered a recurrence of absence seizures which had previously been controlled with gabapentin. All side effects were resolved within one to two days of tiagabine discontinuation. The report did not mention the methods used for assessment of adverse effects, including any laboratory investigations or subjective adverse effect scores.</P>
