One previously included trial was excluded and 10 new studies have been excluded. The conclusions have changed as a consequence of information from two large RCTs of hormone replacement therapy, such that urinary incontinence is likely to worsen with systemic conjugated equine oestrogens. However, there may still be benefits from local administration of oestrogens.</P>

<TITLE>Oestrogens for urinary incontinence in women</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is the leakage of urine when coughing or exercising (stress urinary incontinence) or after a strong uncontrollable urge to urinate (urgency urinary incontinence). In women who have gone through the menopause, low oestrogen levels may contribute to urinary incontinence. The review found 34 trials including more than 19,000 women of whom over 9000 received oestrogen. The review found that significantly more women who received local (vaginal) oestrogen for incontinence reported that their symptoms improved compared to placebo. There was no evidence about whether the benefits of local oestrogen continue after stopping treatment but this seems unlikely as women would revert to having naturally low oestrogen levels. Trials investigating systemic (oral) administration, on the other hand, found that women reported worsening of their urinary symptoms. The evidence comes mainly from two very large trials including 17,642 incontinent women. These trials were investigating other effects of hormone replacement therapy as well as incontinence, such as prevention of heart attacks in women with coronary heart disease, bone fractures, breast and colorectal cancer. In addition, in one large trial women who did not have incontinence at first were more likely to develop incontinence. There may be risks from long-term use of systemic oestrogen, such as heart disease, stroke and cancer of the breast and uterus.</P>

<P>Trials were evaluated for risk of bias and appropriateness for inclusion by the review authors. Data were extracted by at least two authors and cross checked.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-four trials were identified which included approximately 19,676 incontinent women of whom 9599 received oestrogen therapy (1464 involved in trials of local vaginal oestrogen administration). Sample sizes of the studies ranged from 16 to 16,117 women. The trials used varying combinations of type of oestrogen, dose, duration of treatment and length of follow up. Outcome data were not reported consistently and were available for only a minority of outcomes.</P>
<P>The combined result of six trials of systemic administration (of oral systemic oestrogens) resulted in worse incontinence than on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48). This result was heavily weighted by a subgroup of women from the Hendrix trial, which had large numbers of participants and a longer follow up of one year. All of the women had had a hysterectomy and the treatment used was conjugated equine oestrogen. The result for women with an intact uterus where oestrogen and progestogen were combined also showed a statistically significant worsening of incontinence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18).</P>
<P>There was some evidence that oestrogens used locally (for example vaginal creams or pessaries) may improve incontinence (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86). Overall, there were around one to two fewer voids in 24 hours amongst women treated with local oestrogen, and there was less frequency and urgency. No serious adverse events were reported although some women experienced vaginal spotting, breast tenderness or nausea.</P>
<P>Women who were continent and received systemic oestrogen replacement, with or without progestogens, for reasons other than urinary incontinence were more likely to report the development of new urinary incontinence in one large study.</P>
<P>One small trial showed that women were more likely to have an improvement in incontinence after pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) than with local oestrogen therapy (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.50 to 3.52).</P>
<P>The data were too few to address questions about oestrogens compared with or in combination with other treatments, different types of oestrogen or different modes of delivery.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence may be improved with the use of local oestrogen treatment. However, there was little evidence from the trials on the period after oestrogen treatment had finished and no information about the long-term effects of this therapy was given. Conversely, systemic hormone replacement therapy using conjugated equine oestrogen may worsen incontinence. There were too few data to reliably address other aspects of oestrogen therapy, such as oestrogen type and dose, and no direct evidence comparing routes of administration. The risk of endometrial and breast cancer after long-term use of systemic oestrogen suggests that treatment should be for limited periods, especially in those women with an intact uterus.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are three major naturally occurring oestrogens in women (oestradiol, oestriol, oestrone). It is possible that oestrogen deficiency, for example after the menopause, may be an aetiological factor in the development of urinary incontinence in women. However, it is not known whether oestrogen replacement will help in the treatment of this condition.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary incontinence is a common and embarrassing problem which may affect women of all ages. Although not life threatening, incontinence can lead to loss of confidence and in some cases social isolation. Urinary incontinence is the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine (<LINK REF="REF-Haylen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haylen 2010</LINK>). Although treatment may be started based on symptoms alone, investigations may be used to accurately diagnose the underlying cause of the incontinence. The value of urodynamics in the management of urinary incontinence has yet to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is the symptom of involuntary loss of urine associated with coughing, sneezing or physical activity, is the most common type (<LINK REF="REF-Haylen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haylen 2010</LINK>). Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) is the involuntary loss of urine accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency, which is a sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer. Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is diagnosed when women have urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without UUI, and in the absence of other pathology such as urinary tract infection (UTI) (<LINK REF="REF-Haylen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haylen 2010</LINK>). These symptoms may also occur when the bladder is overactive, known as detrusor overactivity (DO), when it is diagnosed using urodynamics. Urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) is diagnosed when stress incontinence is confirmed in the absence of DO, using urodynamic studies. However, many women have a combination of problems including urinary frequency, urgency, and urgency urinary incontinence. Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is diagnosed when SUI and UUI, or SUI and DO, co-exist.</P>
<P>Early studies of oestrogen therapy for incontinence were performed before the widespread use of urodynamic investigation. Therefore, it is likely that those earlier studies included a heterogeneous group of women, some of whom may have had a number of different types of urinary symptoms such as overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) or voiding difficulties (VD) in addition to incontinence.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oestrogen can be given to post-menopausal women to prevent osteoporosis as well as treat symptoms of menopause, such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, fatigue, irritability, sweating and incontinence. Synthetic oestrogen can be given using a variety of different doses, routes and modes of delivery or formulations (oral or vaginal tablet, cream, skin patch, subcutaneous implant). Routes include systemic, such as oral and transdermal; or local, including vaginal and into the bladder (intravesical). Duration of therapy and assessment of effect also vary widely. The situation may be confounded by the concurrent use of progestogens to prevent endometrial hyperplasia in women who have not had a hysterectomy, which may themselves exacerbate both irritative urinary symptoms and incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Benness-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benness 1991</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The female genital and urinary tracts both arise from the primitive urogenital sinus and develop in close anatomical proximity. Oestrogen receptors have been identified in the tissues of the vagina, bladder, urethra and muscles of the pelvic floor (<LINK REF="REF-Blakeman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blakeman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iosif-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iosif 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1993</LINK>). Sex hormones such as oestrogen have a substantial influence on the female bladder throughout adult life with fluctuations in their levels leading to macroscopic, histological and functional changes. Urinary symptoms may therefore develop during the menstrual cycle, in pregnancy and following the menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Barlow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barlow 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cutner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Geelen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Geelen 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>As the tissues involved in the female continence mechanism are oestrogen sensitive, it is possible that oestrogen deficiency may be an aetiological factor in the development of urinary incontinence. Epidemiological surveys have shown that the peak prevalence of stress incontinence occurs around the time of the natural menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Jolleys-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolleys 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kondo-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kondo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1980</LINK>). In addition, 70% of incontinent post-menopausal women have been reported to relate the onset of their incontinence to the time of their final menstrual period (<LINK REF="REF-Iosif-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iosif 1984</LINK>). On the other hand, many studies show that more pre-menopausal women are affected by incontinence than post-menopausal women, with the prevalence of stress incontinence actually falling following the menopause (<LINK REF="REF-Hannestad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannestad 2000</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A variety of other options are available for the treatment of incontinence, including pelvic floor muscle training (<LINK REF="REF-Dumoulin-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dumoulin 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbison-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbison 2002</LINK>; Kovoor 2008; Patel 2008), vaginal ring pessaries (<LINK REF="REF-Lipp-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipp 2011</LINK>), a number of different types of medication (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madhuvrata-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madhuvrata 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roxburgh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roxburgh 2007</LINK>) and surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Dean-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dean 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glazener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazener 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirchin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirchin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapitan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapitan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liapis-2010-L" TYPE="STUDY">Liapis 2010 L</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogah-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogah 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rehman-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rehman 2011</LINK>). The female hormone oestrogen has been used to treat incontinence over a number of years, either alone or in combination with some of these other options. However, most trials involve only a small number of women and few have attempted long-term follow up. Two very large trials of women receiving hormone replacement therapy have been published showing a negative effect of hormones on incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Grady-2001-S" TYPE="STUDY">Grady 2001 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2005-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2005 S</LINK>). This review will consider all of the evidence regarding oestrogen therapy as a treatment for incontinence.</P>

<P>Trials under consideration were evaluated for risk of bias and appropriateness for inclusion by at least two review authors, without prior consideration of the results. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or with a third party. Assessment of risk of bias was undertaken by at least two authors using the Cochrane Collaboration's assessment criteria, which include quality of random allocation concealment, description of dropouts and withdrawals, analysis on an intent to treat, and 'blinding' at treatment and outcome assessment.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Included trial data were processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When appropriate, meta-analysis was undertaken of the parallel group studies. For categorical outcomes the numbers in each group reporting an outcome were related to the numbers at risk to derive a risk ratio (RR), where sufficient data to calculate an RR were available. The data were combined using the Mantel-Haenszel method. For continuous variables we used means and standard deviations to derive a mean difference (MD). When summary data were not available from all trials for a particular outcome and only adjusted risk ratios were reported, the generic inverse variance method was used to combine risk ratios. A fixed-effect model was used for calculation of pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data from these trials were presented in 'Other data' tables only.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-24 11:19:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials were only combined if the interventions were similar enough based on clinical criteria (types of interventions). Differences between trials were investigated if significant heterogeneity was found at the statistical significance level of 10% or by using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), or it appeared obvious from visual inspection of the results. If there was no obvious reason for the heterogeneity, use of a random-effects model was considered. If a reason was found then a judgement was made as to whether it was reasonable to combine the results.</P>

When these data were combined (using generic inverse variance) with the results from five other small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cardozo-1993-S" TYPE="STUDY">Cardozo 1993 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-1999-S" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 1999 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rufford-2003-S" TYPE="STUDY">Rufford 2003 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walter-1990-S" TYPE="STUDY">Walter 1990 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1987-S" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1987 S</LINK>) the net effect was to suggest that systemic oestrogen treatment resulted in more urinary incontinence than placebo (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.48) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The statistical heterogeneity was high and the result was no longer statistically significant if a random-effects model was used (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.28). Under this model the much larger Hendrix trial received less weight.</P>
<P>The women included from the Hendrix study in this meta analysis had all had a hysterectomy and the incontinence was measured at one year (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix (hysterectomy) S</LINK>). The Jackson and Rufford trials included women who had had a hysterectomy; the other trials made no mention of whether women had hysterectomies. Only Hendrix reported data separately. The result of this meta analysis was based mainly on the Hendrix trial, which received the highest weighting. This is related to the large number of participants (approximately 9000) who were involved. The RR of any urinary incontinence becoming worse was consistently higher in the group treated with oestrogen compared with placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.82) (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix (hysterectomy) S</LINK>).</P>

Statistical heterogeneity was demonstrated in this meta-analysis.

PPA is used in prescription and over-the-counter nasal decongestants and appetite suppressants, and has an alpha-adrenergic mode of action. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the outcomes for which data were available but the CIs were wide.

The Grady trial received the highest weighting at 75.3% (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>.1) in the meta-analysis due to less variance in the results. Both the Grady and Hendrix trials included women with all types of incontinence and all had an intact uterus. Fantl included only women with stress incontinence.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data from the small trials which evaluated local administration of oestrogen suggested that oestrogens may improve urinary incontinence. However, the data regarding systemic administration suggested that hormones (either oestrogen alone or in conjunction with progesterone) made incontinence worse. There was, however, too little evidence from a direct comparison of local versus systemic administration to assess this reliably. The data addressing the other comparisons in the review were relatively few.</P>
<P>The results of the small trials comparing local administration of oestrogen with placebo were generally consistent in suggesting better outcomes associated with oestrogen treatment. However, there was limited evidence from two small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Henalla-1989-L" TYPE="STUDY">Henalla 1989 L</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henalla-1990-L" TYPE="STUDY">Henalla 1990 L</LINK>) that pelvic floor muscle training was more effective than local oestrogen treatment in the management of stress incontinence and from one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hilton-1990-SL" TYPE="STUDY">Hilton 1990 SL</LINK>) that local oestrogen plus PPA was more effective than local oestrogen alone in stress incontinence. Data from the Hilton trial also showed that oestrogen plus PPA was more effective than PPA alone. PPA is used in prescription and over-the-counter cold and cough preparations and appetite suppressants and has an alpha-adrenergic action, but it has been associated with an increased risk of stroke in younger women (<LINK REF="REF-Kernan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kernan 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two very large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving systemic hormone replacement therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Grady-2001-S" TYPE="STUDY">Grady 2001 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2005-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2005 S</LINK>), where the main objectives were to investigate effects such as cardiac events and bone fractures, reported that both oestrogen treatment alone (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-_x0028_hysterectomy_x0029_-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix (hysterectomy) S</LINK>) and combined with progestogen (<LINK REF="STD-Grady-2001-S" TYPE="STUDY">Grady 2001 S</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-_x0028_no-hysterect_x0029_-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix (no hysterect) S</LINK>) made incontinence worse. Both studies used conjugated equine oestrogen. The result for oestrogen versus placebo is heavily weighted by the larger Hendrix trial. All the women in this subset had had a hysterectomy. Furthermore, in another subset of one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2005-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2005 S</LINK>) a group of women who were continent at baseline reported more incontinence after one year of treatment with oestrogen plus progestogen compared with women on placebo treatment (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.52 for women with a uterus; RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.71 for women after hysterectomy and treated with oestrogen alone). This is consistent with other evidence about the effects of progesterone on urinary symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Benness-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benness 1991</LINK>). Therefore, post-menopausal women who are considering receiving systemic hormone replacement therapy for reasons other than incontinence should be warned that they may develop urinary incontinence or their urinary symptoms may get worse.</P>
<P>In summary, local rather than oral preparations may reduce the risks of long-term treatment. There was some evidence from three small trials that local (vaginal) administration might improve continence, whereas evidence from the two large trials suggested that systemic administration made it worse.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>There were no serious adverse effects related to treatment for incontinence reported in the trials; however, the reader should consider longer-term side effects of hormone therapy presented in other reports (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2012</LINK>). The most common side effects were vaginal bleeding (about one in four women treated) and breast tenderness (about one in five women treated). There are, however, concerns about risks of unopposed oestrogens (continuous oestrogens without intermittent progestogen supplementation), particularly amongst women who have an intact uterus. Such women may develop endometrial hyperplasia, which increases the risk of endometrial cancer. In addition, the risk of breast cancer is increased by prolonged use of oestrogens (for example for five years) (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2012</LINK>) and women who have predisposing factors for deep venous thrombosis are also advised that oestrogens may increase their risk (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, combined continuous hormone replacement therapy (HRT) significantly increases the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary events (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer, gall bladder disease and dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2012</LINK>). Long-term oestrogen-only HRT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gall bladder disease but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, there is some evidence that oestrogen use before the age of 60 years is relatively safe (<LINK REF="REF-Rossouw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossouw 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most of the reviewed trials, oestrogen was not given for prolonged periods and only three trials gave any information about the women after the end of treatment. One risk of unopposed oestrogen (oestrogen alone) is endometrial cancer. Pending further research, women with an intact uterus should receive combined oestrogen and progestogen for limited periods. Women who have had a hysterectomy can receive oestrogen alone but again this should be for limited periods due to the risks already mentioned (<LINK REF="REF-Marjoribanks-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marjoribanks 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>PPA has been associated with an increased risk of stroke in younger women, however this adverse effect was not reported in the women involved in the included trials.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While the data from the other comparisons were generally consistent with the findings for oestrogen alone (for example a higher dose of oestrogen appeared to have a greater benefit on incontinence than a lower dose using local administration) they were too few to allow these other questions to be addressed reliably. In particular, there was little direct evidence to address the choice of oestrogen type (oestriol, oestradiol, oestrone, quinestradiol or conjugated equine oestrogens) and the alternative methods of delivery (oral, subcutaneous implant, transdermal cream, gel or patch, vaginal cream, pessary or ring, or intravesical).</P>
<P>The conflicting evidence on the effects of oestrogens while on treatment together with the concerns about longer-term risks of unopposed oestrogens (oestrogen alone) raise questions about length of treatment. No trials addressed the question of whether the effects of oestrogen therapy were sustained after treatment was stopped but this seems biologically unlikely.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both the Hendrix (<LINK REF="STD-Hendrix-2005-S" TYPE="STUDY">Hendrix 2005 S</LINK>) and Grady (<LINK REF="STD-Grady-2001-S" TYPE="STUDY">Grady 2001 S</LINK>) trials were of good quality and had the longest duration of follow up (one year in the Hendrix trial, four years in the Grady trial). The Grady trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grady-2001-S" TYPE="STUDY">Grady 2001 S</LINK>) included only women with heart disease so the results may not be generalisable, although the results from the Hendrix trial concur with the Grady trial. In the Hendrix trial, women on active treatment may have more visits to the doctor for side effects such as vaginal bleeding and hence would have been more likely to report incontinence symptoms, but there is no evidence for this. There was differential withdrawal at one year within the Hendrix trial, with 9.7% of women taking oestrogen plus progesterone and 6.6% taking placebo stopping taking the medication.</P>
<P>The interpretation of the review is complicated by differences between trials. There were marked variations in the type and dose of oestrogen used, route of administration, type of incontinence and the types of populations studied. The risk of bias was generally moderate and most of the trials were small. Also, the fact that data for each of the pre-chosen measures of outcome were available for only a minority of trials raised the possibility of selective reporting, which causes bias.</P>
<P>The situation may be confounded by the concurrent use of progestogens to prevent endometrial hyperplasia in women who have not had a hysterectomy, which may exacerbate both irritative urinary symptoms and incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Benness-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benness 1991</LINK>).</P>

<P>Local oestrogen treatment may improve or cure incontinence. Data from two small trials, however, suggest that pelvic floor muscle training was more effective in the control of stress incontinence than local oestrogen and one trial stated that local oestrogen combined with PPA was more effective than treatment with PPA or oestrogen alone.</P>
<P>Systemic use of combined conjugated equine oestrogen and progestogens or conjugated equine oestrogen alone given to women for reasons other than incontinence appears not to improve incontinence and may in fact make incontinence worse. This should be discussed with women who use HRT for relief of menopausal symptoms, and particularly those who are incontinent. The risks of long-term treatment with oestrogens (endometrial and breast cancer, thrombosis causing cardiovascular disease and stroke) suggest that treatment should be for limited periods and using local (vaginal) rather than systemic administration, if possible, especially in women with an intact uterus.</P>
<P>It was not possible to clarify the implications for practice of differing types of oestrogen, routes of administration, or combinations of oestrogen with treatments other than progesterone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-09-10 10:40:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger studies comparing different routes of administration of oestrogen are required. While the review suggests that local oestrogen therapy for urinary incontinence may be effective, the currently available evidence may not be convincing to all people because of generally small sample sizes and the different types, dosages and durations of oestrogen treatment. In that case, further well designed randomised controlled trials should be mounted with adequate sample sizes to assess the effectiveness of oestrogens in comparison to placebo, as well as compared to and as supplements to other non-surgical and surgical management options. These trials should include follow up after oestrogen therapy has stopped to assess whether any benefits are sustained and if so, for how long and any adverse effects. Further research is needed to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of alternative types of oestrogen, the effect of the addition of progesterone in women with an intact uterus, routes of administration and durations of treatment.</P>
<P>Two large RCTs of systemic HRT using conjugated equine oestrogens in women whose primary complaint was not urinary incontinence suggest strongly that existing urinary incontinence may become worse, and women who are initially dry are more likely to become wet. This outcome should therefore be included in future trials involving HRT. It would also be of interest to compare different types of systemic oestrogen (other than conjugated equine oestrogen) and monitor the effects on urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>Future research on incontinence treatments should incorporate standardised, validated, preferably reproducible and simple outcome measures that are relevant to women who have incontinence in order to allow comparisons between trials. In particular, research in this area should include measures of quality of life and formal economic evaluations.</P>
<P>Long-term follow up is essential for the proper evaluation of incontinence treatments and the evaluation of the risk of adverse effects.</P>
