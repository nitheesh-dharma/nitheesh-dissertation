<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-14 13:34:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with heart failure experience marked reductions in their exercise capacity, which has detrimental effects on their activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and ultimately their hospital admission rate and mortality.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments in which two or more interventions, possibly including a control intervention or no intervention, are compared by being randomly allocated to participants) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise on heart failure in adults over 18 years of age. The inclusion criteria of this updated review were extended to consider not only HF due to reduced ejection fraction (HFREF or 'systolic HF') (ejection fraction is a measure of how well your heart is pumping), but also HF due to preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF or 'diastolic HF'). The search is current to January 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found 33 RCTs that included 4740 participants. The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2010) version of this Cochrane review and show important benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of hospital admissions due to HF and improvements in health-related quality of life compared with not undertaking exercise. There was a high level of variation across studies in health-related quality of life outcome. While the majority of evidence was for exercise-based rehabilitation in people with HFREF, this update did identify a broader evidence base that included higher risk (New York Heart Association class IV) and older people, people with HFPEF and more programmes conducted in a home-based setting. We found no evidence to suggest that exercise training programmes cause harm in terms of an increase in the risk of death in either the short or longer term. A small body of economic evidence was identified indicating exercise-based rehabilitation to be cost-effective. Further evidence is needed to understand the effect of exercise training in people with HFPEF better and the costs and effects of exclusively home-based exercise rehabilitation programmes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The general lack of reporting of methods in the included trial reports made it difficult to assess their methodological quality and thereby judge their risk of possible bias.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-10 13:57:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses consistently show the positive effect of exercise-based rehabilitation for heart failure (HF) on exercise capacity; however, the direction and magnitude of effects on health-related quality of life, mortality and hospital admissions in HF remain less certain. This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2010.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-04-10 14:58:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>To determine the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation on the mortality, hospitalisation admissions, morbidity and health-related quality of life for people with HF. Review inclusion criteria were extended to consider not only HF due to reduced ejection fraction (HFREF or 'systolic HF') but also HF due to preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF or 'diastolic HF').</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-10 14:00:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue1, 2013) from January 2008 to January 2013. We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO (Ovid) (January 2008 to January 2013). We handsearched Web of Science, bibliographies of systematic reviews and trial registers (Controlled-trials.com and Clinicaltrials.gov).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-10 14:01:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of exercise-based interventions with six months' follow-up or longer compared with a no exercise control that could include usual medical care. The study population comprised adults over 18 years and were broadened to include individuals with HFPEF in addition to HFREF.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-04-10 14:02:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently screened all identified references and rejected those that were clearly ineligible. We obtained full-text papers of potentially relevant trials. One review author independently extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-23 11:55:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 33 trials with 4740 people with HF predominantly with HFREF and New York Heart Association classes II and III. This latest update identified a further 14 trials. The overall risk of bias of included trials was moderate. There was no difference in pooled mortality between exercise-based rehabilitation versus no exercise control in trials with up to one-year follow-up (25 trials, 1871 participants: risk ratio (RR) 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.27, fixed-effect analysis). However, there was trend towards a reduction in mortality with exercise in trials with more than one year of follow-up (6 trials, 2845 participants: RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, fixed-effect analysis). Compared with control, exercise training reduced the rate of overall (15 trials, 1328 participants: RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92, fixed-effect analysis) and HF specific hospitalisation (12 trials, 1036 participants: RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80, fixed-effect analysis). Exercise also resulted in a clinically important improvement superior in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (13 trials, 1270 participants: mean difference: -5.8 points; 95% CI -9.2 to -2.4, random-effects analysis) - a disease specific health-related quality of life measure. However, levels of statistical heterogeneity across studies in this outcome were substantial. Univariate meta-regression analysis showed that these benefits were independent of the participant's age, gender, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, type of cardiac rehabilitation (exercise only vs. comprehensive rehabilitation), mean dose of exercise intervention, length of follow-up, overall risk of bias and trial publication date. Within these included studies, a small body of evidence supported exercise-based rehabilitation for HFPEF (three trials, undefined participant number) and when exclusively delivered in a home-based setting (5 trials, 521 participants). One study reported an additional mean healthcare cost in the training group compared with control of USD3227/person. Two studies indicated exercise-based rehabilitation to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years saved.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-23 16:27:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated Cochrane review supports the conclusions of the previous version of this review that, compared with no exercise control, exercise-based rehabilitation does not increase or decrease the risk of all-cause mortality in the short term (up to 12-months' follow-up) but reduces the risk of hospital admissions and confers important improvements in health-related quality of life. This update provides further evidence that exercise training may reduce mortality in the longer term and that the benefits of exercise training on appear to be consistent across participant characteristics including age, gender and HF severity. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the small body of evidence seen in this review for the benefit of exercise in HFPEF and when exercise rehabilitation is exclusively delivered in a home-based setting.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-23 16:37:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>People with heart failure (HF) present with a variety of symptoms most of which are non-specific (<LINK REF="REF-Watson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 2000</LINK>). The most frequently presenting symptom is exertional breathlessness. Other important symptoms are fatigue and lethargy in addition to swelling of the feet and ankles. There is no single diagnostic test for HF and diagnosis relies on clinical judgement based on a combination of history, physical examination and appropriate investigations. The symptoms and functional exercise capacity are used to classify the severity of HF, using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (<LINK REF="REF-NYHA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">NYHA 1994</LINK>), and to judge responsiveness to treatment. While diagnosis is based upon symptoms, disease severity can be quantified using objective measures, for example echocardiographic assessment of ejection fraction.</P>
<P>People with HF experience marked reductions in their exercise capacity, which has detrimental effects on their activities of daily living, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and ultimately their hospital admission rate and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-WGCR-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WGCR 2001</LINK>). While survival after HF diagnosis has improved (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2014</LINK>), HF has a poor prognosis as 30% to 40% of people diagnosed with HF die within one year although thereafter the mortality is less than 10% per year (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2014</LINK>). Hospital admission rates for HF in the US appear to have fallen between 1998 and 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2011</LINK>). However, in the UK, despite a progressive reduction in age-adjusted hospital admission rates since 1992 to 1993, admissions due HF are projected to rise by 50% over the next 25 years, largely due to the ageing of the population (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). It is estimated that the total annual cost of HF to the UK National Health Service (NHS) is around GBP1 billion, or around 2% of the total UK NHS budget; approximately 70% of this total is due to the costs of hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Editorial-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Editorial 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence and incidence of HF is steadily increasing, with approximately 825,000 new cases annually in the US (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2014</LINK>). While improved management of hypertension has reduced this condition as an aetiological factor in the development of HF, the increased survival rate from myocardial infarction has led to a subsequent increase in the number of cases of HF (<LINK REF="REF-Kostis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kostis 1997</LINK>), as has increasing longevity in developed countries. Estimates of the prevalence of HF in the US range from 0.7% to 1.5% in adults aged 40 to 59 years; over 80 years of age the prevalence of HF is in the region of 8.6% to 11.5% (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been increasingly recognised that HF has two subcategories. People with HF can be categorised as having impaired left ventricular contraction, which results in a reduced ejection fraction (less than 35% to 50%), known as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) or 'left ventricular dysfunction' or 'systolic HF'. The other category is HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) with an ejection fraction of greater than 35% to 50% and also known as 'diastolic HF' (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Owen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owen 2006</LINK>). Prognosis in HFPEF is better than HFREF. One meta-analysis reported a mortality of 32.1% in HFPEF versus 40.6% in HFREF (risk ratio (RR) 0.79) over a mean of 47 months' follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Somaratne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Somaratne 2009</LINK>). Although individuals with HFPEF are thought to contribute 54% of all people with HF, most trials to date of drug and medical device therapies have recruited only people with HFREF. This limited number of studies examining the effect of different pharmacological agents with proven use in HFREF has largely been disappointing in the HFPEF group (<LINK REF="REF-Holland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holland 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>National and international evidence-based guidelines have been developed to help improve diagnosis and treatment for people with HF. These guidelines cover aetiology, prevention, diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions that increasingly include exercise rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-ACCF_x002f_AHA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCF/AHA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>While there are many definitions of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), the following presents their combined key elements: "The coordinated sum of activities required to influence favourably the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, as well as to provide the best possible physical, mental and social conditions, so that the patients may, by their own efforts, preserve or resume optimal functioning in their community and through improved health behaviour, slow or reverse progression of disease" (<LINK REF="REF-BACPR-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">BACPR 2012</LINK>). A central component of CR is exercise training (<LINK REF="REF-Piepoli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Piepoli 1998</LINK>). However, in addition to exercise, programmes are encouraged also provide risk factor and lifestyle education on risk factor management plus counselling and psychological support, so-called 'comprehensive CR' (<LINK REF="REF-Corra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corra 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Based on current evidence of clinical outcomes and costs, national and international guidelines on the management of HF including the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK consistently recommend CR as an effective and safe intervention (<LINK REF="REF-ACCF_x002f_AHA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACCF/AHA 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McMurray-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McMurray 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). However, these guidelines are not fully implemented in practice and the current uptake of CR for HF appears to be suboptimal (<LINK REF="REF-Dalal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalal 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2011</LINK>). A key driver of this poor uptake has shown to be that CR programmes are not offering rehabilitation to people with HF due to lack of resources and exclusion of HF from local commissioning agreements (<LINK REF="REF-Dalal-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalal 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">How the intervention works</HEADING>
<P>The precise mechanism(s) through which exercise training benefits people with HF remains unclear. One explanation, applicable to people with Ischaemic causes of HF, is that exercise training improves myocardial perfusion by alleviating endothelial dysfunction, therefore dilating coronary vessels and by stimulating new vessel formation by way of intermittent ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-ExTraMatch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ExTraMatch 2004</LINK>). Indeed, Belardinelli and colleagues have demonstrated that aerobic training improves myocardial contractility and diastolic filling (<LINK REF="REF-Belardinelli-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belardinelli 1998</LINK>). One meta-analysis by Haykowsky et al. demonstrated the benefits of exercise training on cardiac remodelling as measured by ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume (<LINK REF="STD-Haykowsky-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Haykowsky 2007</LINK>). Regardless of cause, there are important neurohormonal and musculoskeletal abnormalities in HF. Exercise training may reduce adrenergic tone and increase vagal tone, as suggested by an assessment of variability in heart rate. Skeletal muscle dysfunction and wasting may also respond to exercise training (<LINK REF="REF-ExTraMatch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ExTraMatch 2004</LINK>). Hambrecht et al. have demonstrated that regular physical activity in people with HF stimulates vasodilation in the skeletal muscle vasculature (<LINK REF="STD-Hambrecht-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hambrecht 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do this review</HEADING>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2010. The first Cochrane systematic review of exercise-based interventions for HF in 2004 concluded that exercise training clearly improved short-term (up to one-year follow-up) exercise capacity compared with no exercise control (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smart-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smart 2004</LINK>). However, only one of the 29 included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was powered to report hospitalisations and mortality. Few trials assessed HRQoL. Accepting the evidence for improvement in short-term exercise capacity, the updated 2010 Cochrane review focused on trials of follow-up of six-months or longer that reported clinical events (mortality, hospitalisation) or HRQoL (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2010</LINK>). The 2010 review of 19 RCTs (3647 participants) showed no difference between exercise and control in either short or long-term all-cause mortality, a reduction in HF-related hospitalisations (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.99) and improvement in patient-reported HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 20.63; 95% CI 20.37 to 20.80) with exercise therapy. The majority of trials included in the 2010 review were in men at low-to-medium risk (NYHA class II to III). None of the trials included people with HFPEF and programmes delivered in a centre-based setting.</P>
<P>Using additional RCT evidence, since the 2010 Cochrane review, the aim of this update was to reassess the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation on mortality, hospital admissions, morbidity and HRQoL of people with HF compared with no exercise training. In particular, we sought to identify additional evidence: 1. for those individuals poorly represented in previous reviews (i.e. older individuals, females and people with HFPEF), 2. for programmes specifically delivered in a home- or community-based setting and 3. on costs and cost-effectiveness.<BR/>

<P>For the previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2004</LINK>), the review authors searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2001; Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (1984 to January 2008) (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). The search strategy developed in 2008 included broader terms as this search was part of review strategy that sought to identify evidence for CR that included an update of this review and exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2011</LINK>), and home- versus centre-based CR (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>This search was updated from the last version (2008) and included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid, January 2013, week 4 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid, 5 February 2013), EMBASE (Ovid, January 2013, week 5), CINAHL (EBSCOhost, 5 February 2013) and PsycINFO (Ovid, January 2013, week 5). A small addition to the search strategy was made to reflect the more recent use of the terms 'HFPEF' and 'HFREF'.</P>

We considered variations in terms used and the spelling of terms in different countries, so that studies were not missed by the search strategy. We designed the search strategies with reference to those of the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2010</LINK>), and in accordance with the <I>Cochrane Handbook of Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>

<P>We expressed dichotomous outcomes as RR and 95% CI for each study. For continuous variables, we compared net changes (i.e. exercise group minus control group to give differences) and calculated mean difference (MD) or SMD and 95% CI for each study. For each trial, we sought the mean change (and standard deviation (SD)) in outcome between baseline and follow-up for both exercise and control groups and when not available, we instead used the absolute mean (and SD) outcome at follow-up for both groups. For trials with more than one relevant intervention arm, we divided the number randomised in the control group by the number of intervention arms to obtain the denominator for data analysis. Where trials reported more than one HRQoL outcome, we included the first outcome reported in the paper in the meta-analysis. We tabulated all reported HRQoL outcomes at all follow-up times for each included study. We reported outcome results at two time points: 1. up to and including 12 months' follow-up and 2. longer than 12 months' follow-up. The latest follow-up was used in each of these time point analyses.</P>

<P>We explored the potential heterogeneity in exercise-based rehabilitation by two approaches: 1. within-trial subgroup analyses (supported by subgroup x intervention/control interaction terms) and 2. between-trial analyses using meta-regression. Meta-regression was used to examine the association between the effect of exercise on all-cause mortality, all hospitalisation and HRQoL (MLWHF or other measures) up to 12 months as these three outcomes contained the most trials. Specific study covariates included in the meta-regression included: mean per cent left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); dose of aerobic exercise (calculated as the overall number of weeks of training multiplied by the mean number of sessions per week multiplied by the mean duration of sessions in minutes); type of exercise (aerobic training alone or aerobic plus resistance training); mean age; sex (per cent male); setting (hospital only, home only, both hospital and home); type of rehabilitation (exercise only versus comprehensive); overall risk of bias ('low', i.e. absence of bias in five or more of eight of risk of bias items; 'high', i.e. absence of bias in fewer than five of eight of risk of bias items); single versus multicentre; and publication date. We added year of publication as an additional study level factor (pre versus post 2000) in order to assess the potential effect of a change in the standard of usual care over time, that is to reflect when beta-blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors became established therapies for HF (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 2003</LINK>). Given the relatively small ratio of trials to covariates, meta-regression was limited to univariate analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

Nevertheless, none of the studies had objective evidence of imbalance in baseline characteristics. Most studies performed an intention-to-treat analysis, comparing exercise and control group outcomes according to the initial random allocation. Given the nature of an exercise intervention, is not possible to blind participants and carers.

Although not reported in their original publication (<LINK REF="STD-Belardinelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Belardinelli 2012</LINK>), we obtained mortality data at 10 years by contacting the study authors. There was a trend towards a reduction in all-cause mortality when pooled across longest follow-up point of the six trials with more 12 months' follow-up (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; P value = 0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 7.54, P value = 0.18, fixed-effect analysis) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health-related quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Nineteen out of the 33 included trials (20 comparisons) reported a validated HRQoL measure (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The majority of studies reported disease-specific quality of life using the MLWHF, the <LINK REF="STD-HF-ACTION-2009" TYPE="STUDY">HF ACTION 2009</LINK> trial using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Generic HRQoL was also assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D), SF-36, Psychological General Wellbeing index (PGWB), Patient's Global Assessment of Quality of Life (PGAQoL) and Spritzer's Quality of Life Index (QLI). The study by <LINK REF="STD-Gottlieb-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gottlieb 1999</LINK> reported HRQoL values at follow-up for the exercise group but not the controls. Eleven of the 19 trials (58%) reported superior HRQoL at follow-up in people who exercised compared with controls and in no case was HRQoL score lower with exercise than control (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was evidence of high levels of statistical heterogeneity in the exercise-control difference in MLWHF scores at follow-up across studies. When pooled across the 13 studies that reported the total MLWHF score up to 12 months' follow-up, there was a clinically important improvement with exercise (MD -5.8; 95% CI -9.2 to -2.4; P value = 0.0007, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 40.24, P value &lt; 0.0001, random-effects analysis) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). Pooling across all studies, regardless of the HRQoL measure used, there was also evidence of a significant improvement with exercise (19 trials [21 comparisons], SMD -0.46; 95% CI -0.66 to -0.26; P value &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 80%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 93.86, P value &lt; 0.0001, random-effects analysis) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). The three trials that reported MLWHF score at follow-up greater than 12 months also showed greater improvement compared with control (MD -9.5; 95% CI -17.5 to -1.5; P value &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 73%; Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 7.33, P value &lt; 0.02, random-effect analysis) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). Where studies reported more than one total HRQoL measure score, we selected the first cited score reported in the trial publication for meta-analysis to prevent double counting of a study; the inference of the SMD meta-analysis did not change when selecting the alternative HRQoL measure score.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cost and cost-effectiveness</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported economic data, two undertaking a cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Georgiou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgiou 2001</LINK>), and one reporting costs (<LINK REF="STD-Witham-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Witham 2012</LINK>) (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Based on the Belardinelli trial (<LINK REF="STD-Belardinelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belardinelli 1999</LINK>), Georgiou and colleagues estimated an additional mean healthcare cost in the training group compared with controls of USD3227/person (<LINK REF="REF-Georgiou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Georgiou 2001</LINK>). This cost was calculated by subtracting the averted hospitalisation cost, USD1336/person, from the cost of exercise training and wages lost due to exercise training, estimated at USD4563/person. Using exponential survival modelling to 15.5 years, the estimated increment in life expectancy with exercise was 1.82 years/person compared with people in the control group and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD1773/life-year saved. The HF ACTION group estimated a mean gain in QALY of 0.03 at an additional mean cost of USD1161/person at 2.5 years' follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Flynn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flynn 2009</LINK>). Although an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not reported, the authors stated that there was a 89.9% probability that exercise training was more cost-effective than usual care at a maximum willingness to pay threshold of USD50,000. Witham and colleagues reported the mean cost in the exercise group were lower (-GBP477.85/person) than the control group at six months' follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Witham-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Witham 2012</LINK>). This cost difference was primarily the result of a reduction in the days of hospital admission in the exercise group compared with the control group. None of the between-group differences in costs or outcomes across these three studies achieved statistical significance at P value 0.05 or less level.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Meta-regression</HEADING>
<P>Predictors of all-cause mortality, hospitalisation and HRQoL intervention effects (12 months or less of follow-up) were examined using univariate meta-regression. No significant associations were seen on all-cause mortality, all hospitalisation and HRQoL at the P less than 0.05 level with the exception of risk of bias and setting for HRQoL (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). The HRQoL mean effect size for studies with a higher risk of bias was larger than for studies with lower risk of bias (MLWHF MD: high risk: -14.4 vs. low risk -4.2, P value = 0.04): and higher for single-centre studies (all HRQoL SMD: single centre: -0.90 vs. multicentre -0.35, P value = 0.04).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Within-trial subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Several studies reported that they had undertaken subgroup analyses. However, most of these analyses were not based on a formal subgroup interaction test with the intervention effect but instead a cross-sectional association between particular participant characteristics and outcome (e.g. association between participant age at baseline and mortality (regardless of exercise or control group allocation)) (<LINK REF="STD-Austin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Austin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belardinelli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Belardinelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belardinelli-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Belardinelli 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davidson-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Davidson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klocek-2005-_x0028_Const_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Klocek 2005 (Const)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klocek-2005-_x0028_Prog_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Klocek 2005 (Prog)</LINK>). Two studies reported subgroup analyses where the methods were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Pozehl-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Pozehl 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeh-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Yeh 2011</LINK>). Only the large HF ACTION trial undertook a pre-defined formal interaction tests of differences in intervention effects between subgroups. The HF ACTION authors reported no evidence of difference in the intervention effects as assessed on either the primary outcome (all-cause mortality or hospitalisation) or HRQoL (KCCQ overall score) across a number of participant-defined subgroups (see <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). The HF ACTION group also undertook a large post hoc observational analysis in those people assigned to exercise training (<LINK REF="REF-Keteyian-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keteyian 2012</LINK>). This analysis showed that the volume of exercise undertaken by participants was associated with the risk for clinical events and moderate levels (3 to 7 MET-h per week) of exercise was needed to observe a clinical benefit.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:54:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update review shows that, when compared with no exercise control, exercise-based rehabilitation did not significantly impact on short-term (up to 12-months' follow-up) all-cause mortality. There was trend towards a reduction in all-cause mortality in trials with follow-up in excess of 12 months. We also found a reduction in hospitalisations related due to HF and higher levels of HRQoL following exercise training programmes compared with no exercise control. It is important to note that there was significant heterogeneity in our observations on HRQoL. Univariate meta-regression analysis shows that the benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation to be independent of participant age, gender, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, type of CR (exercise only versus comprehensive), mean dose of exercise intervention, length of follow-up, overall risk of bias and trial publication date. Whilst the majority of included participants in this review were HFREF and NYHA class II to III, more recent trials have recruited those who with HFPEF and NHYA IV and a greater proportion of females and older patients. Evidence from two trials support the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:54:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The generalisability of the previous version of this review was limited as most included studies recruited only low- to moderate-risk younger men. However, with the inclusion of more women, older age and people with HFPEF in recent trials, the findings of this updated review have potential greater external validity.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:54:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The general lack of reporting of methods in the included RCT reports made it difficult to assess their methodological quality and thereby judge their risk of bias. There was evidence of large treatment effect for HRQoL outcomes in studies judged to be overall higher risk of bias compared with lower risk of bias studies, suggesting that risk of bias may be a major driver of the substantive statistical heterogeneity seen across trials in this outcome. There appeared to be improvement in the quality of reporting in more recent trials.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:53:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We believe this is the most comprehensive systematic review to date of RCT-based evidence for the impact of exercise-based rehabilitation for people with HF. However, our review has some limitations. Funnel plot asymmetry for HRQoL is indicative of small-study bias and possible publication bias. Although a specific goal of this updated review was to clarify the impact of exercise training programmes on clinical events, many included trials were relatively small and of short-term follow-up so that the number of deaths and hospitalisations reported by most trials was small. Indeed, in many studies, we located event data in the trial descriptions of losses to follow-up and exclusions rather that as reported outcomes per se.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-19 14:53:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on an individual participant data pooled analysis, the ExTraMATCH Collaborative Group concluded that exercise training for HF significantly reduced overall mortality (hazard ratio 0.65; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92) at mean follow-up of approximately two years (<LINK REF="REF-ExTraMatch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ExTraMatch 2004</LINK>). The ExTraMATCH study was based on a limited bibliographic literature search (MEDLINE plus handsearching of selected leading cardiac journals), was limited to trials that reported survival data, and included unpublished data. Therefore, it has been difficult to verify the data and the comprehensiveness of this meta-analysis; in addition, several of the RCTs included in the Cochrane review were not included in the ExTraMATCH review. Re-analysis of the ExTraMATCH data using formal meta-analytic methods (taking account of outcome clustering at the trials level) has shown that the effect of exercise training was not statistically significant when compared with control (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.10) (<LINK REF="REF-Gotzsche-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gotzsche 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The impact of exercise training on mortality in people with HF may depend on the length of follow-up and age of studies. While we found no improvement (or worsening) in overall survival with exercise compared with control in trials with short-term follow-up, there was a trend towards an improved survival with exercise in trials with follow-up beyond 12 months. More recent trials included in this review have been conducted in the era of optimal medical therapy. For example, at entry to the HF-ACTION trial, 94% of participants were receiving beta-blockers and angiotensin-receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (<LINK REF="REF-Whellan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whellan 2007</LINK>). Forty-five per cent had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or implanted biventricular pacemaker at the time of enrolment. Given the proven survival advantage of these medical treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Shekelle-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekelle 2003</LINK>), any incremental all-cause mortality benefit with exercise is likely to be small.</P>
<P>This update review found the exercise group scored on average 5.8 points higher than the control group at up 12 months' follow-up on the MLWHF questionnaire. A difference of four points or larger on the MLWHF questionnaire has been shown to represent a clinically important, meaningful difference for patients (<LINK REF="REF-McAlister-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAlister 2004</LINK>). The improvements in HRQoL seen with exercise training are in accordance with the previous systematic review of van Tol and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-van-Tol-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Tol 2006</LINK>), but not with that of Chien, which focused on home-based exercise training and concluded that exercise training compared with usual care or activity did not improve the HRQoL of people with HF (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 2008</LINK>). Five studies included in this update review were conducted in an exclusively home-based setting (<LINK REF="STD-Dracup-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dracup 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2010-_x0028_comp_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2010 (comp)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gary-2010-_x0028_exalone_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Gary 2010 (exalone)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jolly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jolly 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Passino-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Passino 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wall-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wall 2010</LINK>). Our meta-regression analysis showed no difference in the reduction in hospitalisations and improvement in HRQoL with exercise training between those studies based in a hospital versus home based setting.</P>

<P>This review shows that exercise rehabilitation provides important benefits by improving health-related quality of life and reducing heart failure (HF)-related hospitalisation in people predominantly with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF or 'systolic HF') ranging from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I to IV. We found no evidence to support that exercise training programmes increase (or decrease) the risk of death in the short term but there was trend towards reduced mortality in trials with follow-up beyond 12 months. The benefits of exercise training programmes appears to be independent of participant characteristics (e.g. age, gender, degree of left ventricular dysfunction) and the characteristics and setting of the exercise programmes. Programmes are typically based on aerobic exercise training with or without a resistance exercise element. Despite clinical guidelines stating their support of exercise-based rehabilitation in the management of HF, the provision and uptake of rehabilitation in HF remains poor. Future robust evidence of the economic value (costs and cost-effectiveness) of cardiac rehabilitation is likely to be important to encourage hospital and primary care providers to extend the current provision of exercise-based programmes for HF</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-14 16:25:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The majority of trials in this review have investigated exercise training as a single intervention and against a no exercise control. However, in practice, exercise-based rehabilitation is often an adjunct to other HF management interventions, such as specialist HF nurse support or disease management programmes. While trials have demonstrated the benefits of such HF management interventions alone, few trials have compared such interventions with and without adding a structured exercise training programme (<LINK REF="STD-Jolly-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jolly 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mudge-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Mudge 2011</LINK>). This is an important clinical question for the future design of HF services, because the addition of an exercise programme adds considerably to staffing and equipment costs. Future clinical trials of exercise rehabilitation in HF also need to consider: the generalisability of trial populations (women, older people and people with HFPEF remain under-represented in trial populations); interventions to enhance the long-term maintenance of exercise training; and outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness of exercise-based programmes delivered exclusively in a home-based setting.</P>
