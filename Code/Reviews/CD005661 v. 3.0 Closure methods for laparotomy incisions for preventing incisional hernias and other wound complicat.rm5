<P>
<B>What is the Issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Laparotomy, an incision through the abdominal wall to access the abdominal cavity, is performed for a variety of surgical procedures. Incisional hernia, infection, dehiscence (an opening of the wound or muscle layers) and chronic drainage from the wound, are potential complications of this procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is it Important?</B>
</P>
<P>Incisional hernias affect up to 20% of people undergoing a laparotomy. Incisional hernias, as they enlarge over time, cause patient discomfort, which in turn, result in patients restricting their work and other physical activities. Cosmetic concerns may also arise.</P>
<P>
<B>We asked:</B>
</P>
<P>Does the type of suture material, or type of closure prevent these complications? We compared absorbable sutures (sutures that lose their tensile strength as they are dissolved by the patient's body) versus non-absorbable (permanent) sutures; mass closure (closure of all anatomical layers of abdominal wall at once) versus layered closure (closing the anatomic layers individually); continuous closure (running suture) versus interrupted closure; monofilament sutures versus multifilament (braided) sutures; and slow absorbable sutures (those that maintain their tensile strength for more than 30 days) versus fast absorbable sutures (those that lose their tensile strength within 30 days).</P>
<P>
<B>We found:</B>
</P>
<P>A search of all relevant publications (up to date as of 8 February 2017) found a total of 55 studies with 19,174 participants to include in the review. The included studies differed greatly in the type of suture materials used, the closure technique and the type of underlying surgical procedures performed. We found that using monofilament sutures reduced the occurrence of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures reduced the risk of chronic drainage from the wound (sinus or fistula formation).</P>
<P>This review included a notably large number of trials; however, we had concerns regarding their collective methodological design and scientific reporting.</P>
<P>
<B>This means:</B>
</P>
<P>Monofilament sutures can be considered for abdominal closure to reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures can be considered to reduce the risk of chronic drainage from the wound.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-10-30 09:23:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Surgeons who perform laparotomy have a number of decisions to make regarding abdominal closure. Material and size of potential suture types varies widely. In addition, surgeons can choose to close the incision in anatomic layers or mass ('en masse'), as well as using either a continuous or interrupted suturing technique, of which there are different styles of each. There is ongoing debate as to which suturing techniques and suture materials are best for achieving definitive wound closure while minimising the risk of short- and long-term complications.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-10-20 09:18:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions, by assessing the following comparisons: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures; mass versus layered closure; continuous versus interrupted closure techniques; monofilament versus multifilament sutures; and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable sutures. Our objective was not to determine the single best combination of suture material and techniques, but to compare the individual components of abdominal closure.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-20 09:19:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On 8 February 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trials registries, and Science Citation Index. There were no limitations based on language or date of publication. We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify trials that our searches may have missed.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-20 09:20:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared suture materials or closure techniques, or both, for fascial closure of laparotomy incisions. We excluded trials that compared only types of skin closures, peritoneal closures or use of retention sutures.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 12:28:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We calculated a summary risk ratio (RR) for the outcomes assessed in the review, all of which were dichotomous. We used random-effects modelling, based on the heterogeneity seen throughout the studies and analyses. We completed subgroup analysis planned a priori for each outcome, excluding studies where interventions being compared differed by more than one component, making it impossible to determine which variable impacted on the outcome, or the possibility of a synergistic effect. We completed sensitivity analysis, excluding trials with at least one trait with high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro guidelines.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-20 09:33:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifty-five RCTs with a total of 19,174 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in the type of sutures used, methods of closure and patient population. Many of the included studies reported multiple comparisons.</P>
<P>For our primary outcome, the proportion of participants who developed incisional hernia at one year or more of follow-up, we did not find evidence that suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.32, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.35, very low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, moderate-quality evidence) resulted in a difference in the risk of incisional hernia. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that monofilament sutures reduced the risk of incisional hernia when compared with multifilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 30%, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>For our secondary outcomes, we found that none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound infection, whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30, low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Similarily, none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound dehiscence whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.64, moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable sutures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, low-quality evidence) reduced the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation. None of the other comparisons showed a difference (slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.05, very low-quality evidence; mass versus layered, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62, low-quality evidence; continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.61, very low-quality evidence).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-20 09:35:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on this moderate-quality body of evidence, monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures may also reduce the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation, but this finding is based on low-quality evidence.</P>
<P>We had serious concerns about the design or reporting of several of the 55 included trials. The comparator arms in many trials differed by more than one component, making it impossible to attribute differences between groups to any one component. In addition, the patient population included in many of the studies was very heterogeneous. Trials included both emergency and elective cases, different types of disease pathology (e.g. colon surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, etc.) or different types of incisions (e.g. midline, paramedian, subcostal).</P>
<P>Consequently, larger, high-quality trials to further address this clinical challenge are warranted. Future studies should ensure that proper randomisation and allocation techniques are performed, wound assessors are blinded, and that the duration of follow-up is adequate. It is important that only one type of intervention is compared between groups. In addition, a homogeneous patient population would allow for a more accurate assessment of the interventions.</P>

<P>Laparotomy is a surgical incision used to gain access to the organs of the abdominal cavity and is one of the most common surgical procedures performed globally. Sutures, most commonly, provide mechanical support for the closed wound during its initial healing. They approximate the wound edges and help to maintain wound closure until the healing process provides sufficient strength for the wound to withstand stress and strain. Surgeons have several choices for closing the abdominal fascia, but there is currently scant consensus as to the best suture material or closure method. For the majority of surgeons, the choice of a suture material in a given instance has mostly been directed by training exposure and local opinion, with many surgeons reluctant to attempt different techniques once their personal preferences have been established (<LINK REF="REF-Anthimidis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthimidis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chalya-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalya 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tully-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tully 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of laparotomy. It is a late manifestation of failure to secure fascial closure. The incidence following major abdominal surgery is reported to range from 2% to 20% across studies, depending on patient and wound factors (incidence may go up to 40% in those with wound infections) (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Huu-Nho-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Huu Nho 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santora-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santora 1993</LINK>). Incisional hernias, as they enlarge over time, cause the patient discomfort, which in turn, result in patients restricting their work and other physical activities. Cosmetic concerns may also arise. Overall, patient quality of life can be greatly affected. Complications of incisional hernias include pain, bowel obstruction, incarceration and strangulation and the risk of need for repeat surgery. In 2011, the number of incisional hernia repairs in the USA alone was estimated to be between 190,000 to 200,000, with approximately 1% to 2% annual growth in volume (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). In addition, this volume reflects the economic impact of the condition given the surgical manpower and expensive mesh materials employed in hernia repairs (<LINK REF="REF-Rutkow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutkow 2003</LINK>). Incisional hernia repair is also associated with hernia recurrence, ranging from 10% to 50%, and considerable morbidity and mortality. The rate of hernia recurrence is largely unchanged over time as surgeons continue to face increasing formidable patient factors such as older, more comorbid and more obese patients undergoing primary surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Anthony-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthony 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helgstrand-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgstrand 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langer-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leber-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leber 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mudge-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mudge 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stey-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stey 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large, prospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Itatsu-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Itatsu 2014</LINK>), in which patients were examined for hernia every 3 months following surgery, assessed the time from index surgery to the diagnosis of hernia. The study authors found that there was no time point in which the diagnosis of incisional hernia plateaued over the first two years following surgery. Approximately 5.2% of incisional hernias were diagnosed within the first 12 months, while 10.2% of hernias were diagnosed within the first 24 months. An additional study (<LINK REF="REF-Goodenough-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodenough 2015</LINK>) found that of those who developed an incisional hernia within 5 years of surgery, more than half were diagnosed within the first 12 months.</P>
<P>Several comorbid conditions have also been shown to be associated with the development of incisional hernia and these are listed in the right half of <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Connelly-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connelly 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goodenough-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodenough 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamont-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sugerman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sugerman 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies have reported that the majority of incisional hernias occur within the first two years after surgery, suggesting that initial wound closure is an important factor in hernia prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamont-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamont 1988</LINK>). However, the limited follow-up in these studies may have underestimated late occurrence of incisional hernia, as suggested by long-term studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mudge-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mudge 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pollock-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spencer-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spencer 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of incisional hernia has been reported to vary with the type of incision, with a greater incidence reported with midline incisions compared to paramedian incisions (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guillou-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guillou 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1991</LINK>). However, the midline incision remains the workhorse of open surgery due to its ideal properties in regards to optimal intraperitoneal access, exposure, speed and the simplicity of the incision and postoperative pain characteristics relative to the paramedian approach (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2009</LINK>). One of the benefits of the modern uptake of laparoscopic surgery was thought to be a reduced rate of incisional hernias due to the use of smaller incisions. However, the modern evidence is variable in this regard and some studies demonstrate that laparoscopic surgery still results in notable rates of incisional hernia, in some cases, no different than when compared to the open approach (<LINK REF="REF-Benlice-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benlice 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ihedioha-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ihedioha 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Llaguna-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llaguna 2010</LINK>). In addition, many laparoscopic procedures (e.g. colectomy, splenectomy) require an incision to remove the specimen, and have an inherent hernia risk.</P>
<P>A number of factors influence the occurrence of postoperative wound infection and incisional hernia (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Some of these factors are considered to be under the control of the surgeon (such as the choice of incision), while others are only partly (e.g. the length of the incision or the duration of the operation), or not at all (e.g. most patient factors including diabetes and chronic lung disease) influenced by the surgeon. Risk factors for surgical wound infection should be considered additionally as incisional hernia risk factors, as infection disrupts wound healing, which in turn increases the risk of fascial dehiscence (<LINK REF="REF-Bucknall-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bucknall 1982</LINK>). Fascial dehiscence that is not acutely diagnosed and repaired, or occurs in a delayed fashion, will ultimately become an incisional hernia.</P>
<P>This review explores how variations in the selection of closure techniques and suture materials in closing laparotomy (not laparoscopy) incisions affects the occurrence of post-operative wound complications, such as development of incisional hernia and wound infection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-20 11:38:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fascial closure following laparotomy involves several key decisions. The first decision is whether to close the layers of the abdominal wall in separate anatomic layers (peritoneum, posterior fascia, anterior fascia, subcutaneous tissues) or 'en masse' (incorporating all layers of the fascia, with or without the peritoneum, into one suture line). We have considered layered closure to be closure of the peritoneum and linea alba separately in midline incisions. For non-midline incisions, we defined layered closure as closure of the fascial layers (posterior fascia, anterior fascia) and peritoneum separately.</P>
<P>The second decision for surgeons is whether to close the fascia using an interrupted or a continuous method. We defined continuous closure as the use of a running suture on the fascia with knots only at either extreme of the wound, or the use of two running sutures with knots at the extremes of the wound, and tied together in the middle of the wound. We defined interrupted closure as the use of multiple knotted sutures to close the fascia. We did not distinguish between the types of interrupted closures (e.g. Smead Jones, simple, figure of eights). Interrupted closure has the advantage of ensuring closure, even if one of the suture knots breaks, but requires a longer closure time. Continuous closure is advantageous in that it disperses the tension more evenly and is more quickly completed. The disadvantage is that if the suture breaks, the entire incision may fall apart (dehisce).</P>
<P>The third decision is the type of suture material. Surgeons may choose from absorbable (i.e. sutures which will lose their tensile strength over time as the body breaks down the material) or non-absorbable sutures (i.e. permanent). We further classified absorbable sutures into fast absorbable (those with loss of tensile strength within 30 days) and slow absorbable (loss of tensile strength greater than 30 days) in this review. A surgeon may also choose between monofilament or multifilament sutures.</P>

<P>Closing the abdominal wall allows for approximation of the cut edges from the laparotomy. Suturing the fascial layer closed protects the abdominal contents from critical dehydration, hypothermia, injury and infection, helps with pulmonary mechanics, and should reduce or eliminate the development of abdominal wall hernias postoperatively.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-20 11:40:11 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is apparent that a multitude of factors play a role in the selection of an appropriate suture material in a given situation, including costs. The sequelae of a poorly closed wound can be considerable. Early wound failure (wound infection and dehiscence) can lead to a return to the operating room, and increased length and cost of stay. Late wound failures (incisional hernia, sinus and fistula formation) can lead to additional surgical procedures and can affect a patient's quality of life. Determining the optimal closure technique could help to reduce these issues. This review was concerned with suture materials and closure techniques in the closure of laparotomy incisions. Many randomised controlled trials have studied suture materials and closure techniques employed for fascial closure after laparotomy incisions. We have attempted to summarise the evidence and provide conclusive comments on the efficacy of different suture materials and closure techniques in prior meta-analyses and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rucinski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rucinski 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van_x0027_t-Riet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van't Riet 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiland 1998</LINK>). However, each of the reviews was limited either by methodology, lack of comprehensive literature searching, restricted inclusion criteria, or a combination of these issues.</P>

<P>The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions by assessing the following comparisons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures;</LI>

<P>We classified the suture material as absorbable or non-absorbable. Absorbable suture materials included, but were not limited to, surgical catgut, polyglactin, polyglycolic acid, polydioxanone and polyglyconate. We further classified absorbable sutures into fast absorbable (those with loss of tensile strength within 30 days) and slow absorbable (loss of tensile strength greater than 30 days). Non-absorbable (i.e. permanent) suture materials included, and were not limited to, silk, polypropylene, stainless steel and nylon.</P>
<P>We also classified sutures as either monofilament or multifilament (i.e. braided). We did not exclude studies that compared monofilament versus multifilament sutures with different absorptive characteristics (e.g. we included studies that compared non-absorbable monofilament sutures to absorbable multifilament sutures).</P>
<P>If multiple types of sutures were used, we categorised the trial based on what type of suture was used on the fascial layers (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded trials that compared materials or techniques, or both, for the closure of the skin or peritoneum only. The use of retention sutures (defined as sutures that encompassed the entire abdominal wall (including the skin), placed in addition to the primary method of fascial closure) was also not compared in this review. We also excluded trials that only assessed stitch bites (small versus large) and not one of our other techniques.</P>

<P>We assessed selective reporting for whether hernia outcomes were determined at a minimum of one year's follow-up, and whether wound infection and dehiscence were reported in the perioperative period.

<P>In studies with multiple comparison arms, we included pair-wise data in all applicable meta-analyses, as long as the groups were independent (i.e. did not share participants) and compared an intervention of interest. If two or more groups shared an intervention of interest and could be compared to a separate group (e.g. two groups using absorbable sutures, with a third using non-absorbable sutures), we combined the two comparable groups for analysis. The exception was if an intervention differed by more than one component between groups. In this case, we included the groups differing by only one intervention in the meta-analysis. For example, if there were three groups, group one using interrupted absorbable sutures, group two using continuous absorbable sutures and group three using non-absorbable continuous sutures, we would compare group one to group two for analysis of continuous versus interrupted sutures, and group two to group three for analysis of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.1 Excluding high risk of bias and multiple comparison studies</HEADING>
<P>After excluding trials that had at least one category of 'high risk of bias' and trials that compared groups that differed by more than one component, we undertook a sensitivity analysis for our primary outcome, incisional hernia.</P>
<P>For the absorbable versus non-absorbable analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>), across nine qualifying studies with 2949 participants, there was no significant effect seen (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.49, P = 0.07, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>In the continuous versus interrupted analysis of three studies with 869 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>), the sensitivity analysis was similar to the overall analysis, in showing no evidence of a difference in hernia, by technique (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.64, P = 0.26, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%).</P>
<P>For the analysis of monofilament versus multifilament sutures (<LINK REF="CMP-006.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.3</LINK>), the sensitivity analysis of five studies with 1336 participants resulted in the same direction of effect (favouring monofilament sutures) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.01, P = 0.05, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 9%).</P>
<P>We did not undertake a sensitivity analysis in the fast versus slow absorbable sutures comparison or in the mass versus layered analysis, as there was an insufficient number of trials with a low risk of bias to analyse (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">6.2 Accounting for missing data in studies with high losses to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies that had a high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data (i.e. high losses to follow-up) assessed hernia as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Askew-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Askew 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Docobo_x002d_Durantez-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Docobo-Durantez 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gislason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gislason 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gys-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gys 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sahlin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sahlin 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wissing-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wissing 1987</LINK>). Of these, two did not have group-wise data available for inclusion in this sensitivity analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Gys-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Gys 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sahlin-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sahlin 1993</LINK>). To account for missing data, we undertook two series of sensitivity analyses. The first (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>) assumed that all those lost to follow-up all developed an incisional hernia. The second (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.5</LINK>) assumed all those lost to follow-up did not develop an incisional hernia.</P>
<P>In the first series of analyses where hernia was assumed in those lost to follow-up, we found the following results: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, no difference (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30, P = 0.28, I<SUP>2</SUP> =54%); mass versus layered closure, no difference (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.81 to 4.10, P = 0.15, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 59%); continuous versus interrupted closure, no difference (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.26, P = 0.58, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 64% RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30, P = 0.55, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 76%); monofilament versus multifilament sutures, significantly less hernia in the monofilament population (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95, P = 0.01, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 43%); and slow versus fast absorbable suture material, no difference (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07, P = 0.21, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 27%).</P>
<P>In the second series of analyses where no hernia was assumed in those lost to follow-up, we found the following results: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, no difference (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27, P = 0.40, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%); mass versus layered closure, no difference (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.57 to 5.62, P = 0.31, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57%); continuous versus interrupted closure, no difference (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34, P = 0.96, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39%); monofilament versus multifilament sutures, significantly less hernia in the monofilament population (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97, P = 0.03, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24%); and slow versus fast absorbable suture material, no difference (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.08, P = 0.16, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39%).</P>
<P>Furthermore four studies with high attrition bias are missing from the above list (<LINK REF="STD-Bresler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bresler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leaper-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Leaper 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ullrich-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Ullrich 1981</LINK>). Data from Bresler 1995 is included in sensitivity analysis for monofilament versus multifilament and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable. Data from Cameron 1980 and Leaper 1985 was not included in hernia analysis due to inadequate duration of follow up, which is why the data are not included in the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore data from Ulrich 1981 did not assess hernia as an outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">7. Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We assessed publication bias for the incisional hernia outcome. We examined three analyses (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, continuous versus interrupted closure, and monofilament versus multifilament sutures), each including at least 10 trials (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).<BR/>In these funnel plots there appears to be adequate symmetry, suggesting no overt publication bias.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-27 14:37:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review included 55 studies that assessed the effects of suture materials, and closure techniques and methods on the development of incisional hernia, wound infection, wound dehiscence, or sinus or fistula tract formation. The combination of suture material (absorbable or non-absorbable, monofilament or multifilament, fast or slow absorbable), suture technique (continuous or interrupted) and closure method (mass or layered) differed greatly between studies. As such, our focus was on determining the outcomes associated with each individual component.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures</HEADING>
<P>Despite the hypothesis that non-absorbable sutures would result in less incisional hernia formation, we did not find evidence of this effect when assessing and including all applicable trials. Even within the subgroup analysis, excluding those trials with differing technique and methods, there was no evidence that a treatment difference exists.</P>
<P>In terms of the other outcomes assessed, absorbable sutures decreased the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.94). There was high heterogeneity within this outcome (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 52%). Heterogeneity was reduced when we assessed studies comparing groups with the same closure technique and methods as a subgroup (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 22%). We did not find evidence that absorbable or non-absorbable sutures reduced the risk of dehiscence or wound infection.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mass versus layered closure</HEADING>
<P>Few studies assessed the effect of mass versus layered closure on the risk of hernia formation. Overall, there was no evidence that mass or layered closure resulted in a higher risk of hernia. Only one study compared mass versus layered closures, using the same suture material and closure technique in each group (<LINK REF="STD-Ausobsky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ausobsky 1985</LINK>). This study found that mass closure increased the risk of hernia, but it suffered from methodological deficiencies (unclear method of randomisation, unclear allocation concealment and unclear blinding of wound assessors). As such, the confidence we can have in this conclusion is low.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes, it appeared that mass or layered closure had no effect on wound infections, wound dehiscence or sinus or fistula tract formation. These outcomes suffered from the fact that only one study had a common suture material and closure technique between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Ausobsky-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ausobsky 1985</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Continuous versus interrupted closure</HEADING>
<P>We found no benefit of continuous or interrupted closure in terms of hernia risk. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis did not show any evidence that one technique or another resulted in a decrease in the risk of hernia. None of the secondary outcomes (wound infection, dehiscence or sinus or fistula formation) was associated with continuous or interrupted closure. Neither wound dehiscence nor sinus or fistula tract formation seemed to be affected by the closure technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Monofilament versus multifilament sutures</HEADING>
<P>The risk of hernia was reduced with monofilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98). Despite the commonly held belief that multifilament sutures are associated with an increased risk of wound infection, we found no evidence of this within our analysis. The risk of dehiscence was not different between monofilament and multifilament sutures (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67). Sinus or fistula tract formation was not affected by monofilament or multifilament sutures (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.73). This result had high heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 51%), which was not resolved with subgroup analysis. This heterogeneity may have been persistent, as only one study defined the outcome adequately (<LINK REF="STD-Wissing-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Wissing 1987</LINK>). In addition, there was variable duration of follow-up to assess this outcome (from three months to two years).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Slow versus fast absorbable sutures</HEADING>
<P>There did not appear to be a benefit for slow or fast absorbable sutures for hernia formation, wound infection or sinus formation. There was evidence to suggest a potential increase in dehiscence with slow absorbable sutures (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61). The finding that slow absorbable sutures may increase the risk of dehiscence is difficult to explain, as we expected that the longer duration of absorption would result in reinforcement of the wound edges for a longer period of time. One possible explanation for this may be the knot characteristics of polydioxanone versus Vicryl, etc. with the former, commonly-used slow absorbable suture material having much poorer handling and knotting profiles than the latter, common absorbable suture agent.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Midline incision</HEADING>
<P>We undertook subgroup analyses to determine whether incidence of the primary outcome (hernia) was affected by the type of incision; sufficient data were available only for midline incision. We found no evidence of a subgroup effect in the absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures or continuous versus layered closure comparisons. For the monofilament versus multifilament comparison, we did find evidence of subgroup effect. The effect estimate favoured monofilament sutures in both the overall analysis as well as the midline incision subgroup.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-20 14:00:17 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine what a surgeon can do in terms of technique and material selection to prevent hernia, wound infection, wound dehiscence, and sinus or fistula formation following closure of a laparotomy incision. We assessed the surgeon-controlled risk factors (the choice of closure material and techniques), which have been implicated in closure failure in previous reviews. It is important to remember that patient factors (e.g. diabetes) and surgical pathology (e.g perforated diverticulitis with fecal peritonitis) also affect the risk of surgical wound complications, but the surgeon has no control over these.</P>
<P>The most discussed technique that was not included in this review was the short-stitch method described by <LINK REF="STD-Millbourn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Millbourn 2009</LINK> and others, as these trials had not been published at the time of acceptance of this study protocol. Although the early results appear promising, a limited number of trials are available for review.</P>
<P>The evidence presented in this review is applicable to any patient undergoing a laparotomy closure. We were able to identify over 19,000 participants from 55 studies for inclusion. This was a heterogeneous patient population and included patients undergoing emergency and elective procedures.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome, incisional hernia</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for each intervention using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>. The quality of evidence can be found in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>. For our primary outcome, incisional hernia, we found that there was moderate-quality evidence for absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, continuous versus interrupted closure, monofilament versus multifilament sutures and slow versus fast absorbable sutures. We downgraded this outcome within these comparisons due to serious concerns regarding methodological quality and risk of bias. A rating of moderate quality (by definition) indicates that future research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We graded the quality of evidence as very low for the mass versus layered closure outcomes. We downgraded this outcome for serious concerns about methodological quality, inconsistency and imprecision (few trials, with wide confidence intervals). A very low-quality grade indicates that we are very uncertain about the estimate and that future research is definitely required to better the estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>We minimised potential biases in the review process through duplication of study screening and data collection. We translated and included foreign language trials. We assessed all relevant studies and included them if they met our inclusion criteria. We included a transparent search strategy and full details of why we excluded studies from analysis. Additional sources of potential bias include the decision to base analyses on intention-to-treat analyses, or the decision to only include trials with a follow-up of more than one year for the primary outcome, incisional hernia. Finally other potential sources of bias include the variability in the definition of individual studies of a hernia, wound infection and sinus.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2000</LINK> identified 13 trials for inclusion, and compared the effect of non-absorbable versus absorbable sutures and six trials comparing continuous versus interrupted sutures. They found a reduced odds of hernia with non-absorbable sutures (odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to0.87), with no evidence of a difference in wound infection or dehiscence between groups. Sinus formation was higher in the non-absorbable sutures groups (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.22). Continuous closure was found to decrease the odds of hernia (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99), with no difference in the odds of wound infection or dehiscence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Rucinski-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rucinski 2001</LINK> assessed non-absorbable versus absorbable braided sutures or absorbable monofilament sutures (the number of trials is unclear). They found that the use of absorbable braided sutures increased the risk of hernia, compared with non-absorbable sutures (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.76), with no difference between monofilament absorbable and non-absorbable sutures.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sajid-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sajid 2011</LINK> compared slow absorbable sutures (polydioxanone) to non-absorbable sutures. Using eight trials, they found no difference in incisional hernia, wound infection, dehiscence or sinus formation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Van_x0027_t-Riet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van't Riet 2002</LINK> compared continuous versus interrupted closure, as well fast absorbable versus slow absorbable, fast absorbable versus non-absorbable and slow absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures. They found non-absorbable sutures and slow absorbable sutures decreased the risk of hernia formation (one study for each analysis). They found no difference in hernia formation in the slow absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures comparison (five studies). Interrupted or continuous closure did not appear to affect incisional hernia risks. They did not find a difference in wound infections or wound dehiscence in any of the comparisons (slow versus fast absorbable, slow versus non-absorbable, fast versus non-absorbable, continuous versus interrupted closure).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Weiland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiland 1998</LINK> compared continuous versus interrupted sutures, absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures and mass versus layered closures. They found that continuous sutures decreased hernia (seven studies) and wound infection (eight studies). They also found that non-absorbable sutures decreased hernia compared with absorbable sutures in continuous closures (seven studies) and interrupted closures (three studies). No difference was seen in wound infections. Dehiscence was less in the non-absorbable groups versus the absorbable group for both continuous closures (seven studies) and interrupted closures (four studies). Layered closures were found to decrease hernia over mass closure (nine studies). This meta-analysis included two non-randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>None of the reviews specifically addressed monofilament versus multifilament sutures. Of these reviews, only the one by van't Riet specified a required follow-up duration for inclusion in analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Van_x0027_t-Riet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van't Riet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A summary of the findings from these meta-analyses for incisional hernia can be found in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. We found no evidence of a difference between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures (16 trials), although the effect estimate favoured non-absorbable sutures. We found no difference between mass and layered closures (five trials), which differs from the study by <LINK REF="REF-Weiland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiland 1998</LINK>. The previous study did not have clear criteria for follow-up duration for hernia, and this likely explains the differences in our results. Our results showed no difference between continuous and interrupted sutures (11 trials), whereas two previous meta-analyses did find a reduction in hernia (<LINK REF="REF-Hodgson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weiland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiland 1998</LINK>). However, our analysis incorporated more studies and previous analyses did not define a required follow-up duration.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-10-20 14:00:54 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We investigated the effect of suture material, method and technique for laparotomy closure on hernia occurrence and other important outcomes. Due to limitations in the quality of included studies, we cannot draw firm conclusions on suture material, closure method and technique. We do not have evidence to determine the best type of suture material (absorbable versus non-absorbable; fast absorbable versus slow absorbable) or closure method (continuous versus interrupted, mass versus layered) to reduce hernia in patients undergoing a laparotomy. Monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of hernia in patients and can be considered (compared with multifilament sutures).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-20 14:00:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has assessed many trials that have attempted to compare the effects of suture materials, methods or techniques on several important outcomes. The main limitation of this review was the study design and reporting limitations of many of the included trials. We felt that only a small proportion of trials did not have at least one category of 'high risk of bias'. This review has not definitively resolved the question of which materials and methods are best for wound outcomes. As such, surgeons should demand the performance of further, higher-quality research on this topic.</P>
<P>The mass versus layered comparison was based on a small number of trials, with all but one comparing more than one intervention between groups. As such, there is a role for further work in this area.</P>
<P>With these factors in mind, further trials assessing laparotomy closure need to be more rigorously performed and reported. Adequate randomisation and allocation techniques, blinding of outcome assessors and adequate follow-up for long-term hernia outcomes are essential. In addition, it is important that future trials only compare one closure component between groups. Many of the included trials compared a combination of materials, methods or techniques, and thus it was difficult to determine the effect of each component on the outcomes. At the very least, trials seeking to assess multiple components should employ factorial designs.</P>

<LI>We analysed hernia outcomes at one year or later follow-up. We did not include this outcome for trials that did not follow up participants for at least one year. If a trial had multiple follow-up periods after one year, we only included the results at one year.</LI>
<LI>Due to the heterogeneous interventions used in the studies, we did not assess suture material and technique as a whole. Instead we compared sutures based on absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable and fast absorbable versus slow absorbable, any closure technique or method), closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, any suture material or method), closure method (mass versus layered, any suture material or technique) and filament (multifilament versus monofilament, any absorption, material, technique or method).</LI>
<LI>We did not explore further subgroup analyses (such as classification of wound contamination, type of surgery, etc.) due to the high variability between studies for these factors which make defining these factors for these potential analyses very difficult.</LI>
