Just one point: I was confused by the contradictory participant numbers given in the first line of the summary of main results: &amp;quot;For this systematic review update, a total of 12 RCTs (2,171 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These report the effects of injectable pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in 2245 participants with COPD.&amp;quot; - please check. Similarly, at the start of the methodological limitations section it states: &amp;quot;Twelve studies involving 2245 participants contributed data to this review&amp;quot;. (Can be resolved post peer review).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sept 07 2016: CJC signed off data. Thanks very much for making these corrections Julia! I have added a Cates plot for the exacerbation outcome, but if you do not want to use it then you can take it out again! The 95% CI did not quite match the SoF so please feel free to recheck my results from Visual Rx using CER of 60.82% with the OR of 0.6(0.39 to 0,93) which I have put in the SoF and the text with Figure 7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT: Minor edits to the text to approve = tracked changes document to be returned alongside peer review comments.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC contact editor comments Aug 16th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the evidence comes from 23 valent vaccine studies and there is not enough evidence to compare the efficacy or safety of the different vaccine types. I think this could be made more explicit in the abstract and conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JRT 10th August&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- &lt;/b&gt;Please ensure that it is clear in the 'What's new' in the 'Conclusions changed' box, what new information this review adds to the last version ie why should former readers re-read the review? Please complete the detail highlighted. &lt;b&gt;JW MADE NEW RESULTS CLEAR&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I wonder if there might be a chance of dumbing-down, or explaining instead, some of the text used in the Abstract to make it a little more lay-friendly. May be impractical with this topic though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the Plain Language Summary you say 'We believe people with COPD should be given a pneumococcal vaccination to provide some protection against community-acquired pneumonia, and to reduce the chance of an acute exacerbation.' in the conclusions, which, for Cochrane may be seen as a little strong, although I see it's value. However, it doesn't quite say the message as strongly in the Abstract - Could the Contact Editor let us know if it's OK to make this statement and if it should also be made in some form therefore in the abstract?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JW revised abstract &lt;/b&gt;Similarly, if so, should this be reflected in the main text conclusions, as it is not currently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The Background text has been substantially updated since the last publication in 2010, partly because of the new headings, please confirm that no material from the former review has been deleted that should not have been? &lt;b&gt;JW CHECKED, JT TO REVIEW&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;JRT: OK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Under 'Measures of treatment effect' the 'Deeks 2004' reference is no longer in the references, please check and correct. &lt;b&gt;JW REFERENCED TO CHAPTER 9 COCHRANE HANDBOOK &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: Great!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please include the number of participants in both the Included study results and Discussion &lt;b&gt;JW DONE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: Great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Please note the title change since the last publication, and explain the change, in 'Differences between the protocol and the review', also note changes to the Background text, further changes to the outcomes since the last update, added risk of bias, Summary of findings tables and added new standard Cochrane headings, please note any other changes to the review since the last update in this section. &lt;b&gt;JW DONE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Some edits made to the text for the authors to approve. &lt;b&gt;JW APPROVED&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;JRT: great&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CJC data check August 9th. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No major issues at all with data entry. Thank you!!! However I wonder if the Kostinov data is correctly entered. AGREEE THERE WAS AN ERROR &amp;#8211;SEE LATER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have made a few changes to the way the Forest plots are displayed and changed 3.6 so it is no longer Peto OR. I think there may be an error in the total for control in 2.4 (90 entered in place of 91?) JW AGREE CHANGED TO 91&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.10 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Trofimov 2010&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Trofimov 2010&lt;/a&gt; has an extraordinarily large treatment effect. I have only seen this caused by bias rather than a true treatment effect! I do not have the paper for this one either. &lt;b&gt;JW TROVIMOV REPORTED SOMETHING CALLED &amp;#8220;STABLE REMISSION OF DISEASE DURING 6 MTH FOLLOW UP. ALL PAPTIENTS IN VAC GROUP WERE STABLE, 20% IN CONTROL GROUP WERE STABLE. NO DEFINITION OF INSTABLITY GIVEN, WHETHER THIS WAS AN EXACERBATION AS DEFINED IN OTHER STUDIES. NO RESPONSE TO A LETTER FOR INFORMATION. WE AGREE THIS OUTCOMES FROM TROVIMOV SHOULD BE EXCLUDED. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also numbers entered for &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Kostinov 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Kostinov 2014&lt;/a&gt; do not seem to match the translation sheet (The translation sheet suggests 54 people had an exacerbation on treatment and 67 who were not vaccinated. This does not match your numbers of 58 and 87?) I could not find the &lt;a link_type=&quot;STUDY&quot; href=&quot;Kostinov 2014&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Kostinov 2014&lt;/a&gt; data for 1.6?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;jw AGREE THERE WAS ERROR IN DATA EXTRACTION.

This is ready to copy edit for publication. I agree that the changes are sufficient to call this update substantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12/08/10 JW responded to reviewers comments in work document .Send to RWB. Has punam responded to your contact? I will try one more time and send copy of review. JW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 2010_06_15 I am very happy with Julia's responses so this is ready for peer review&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I note that the primary outcome has been changed to pneumonia, so this should be mentioned in the differences between protocol and review.&amp;#160;Noted there as &amp;#8220;Pneumonia has been promoted from a secondary to a primary outcome for the 2010 update. Additionally Risk of Bias tables have been added to the review.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new says the direction of effect has changed with the new data, but it is actually the size not the direction so I have altered this.There is considerable heterogeneity in this outcome which should be mentioned in the abstract. Just because I2 is below 50% does not mean this can be ignored as the power for testing heterogeneity is low. How much clinical heterogeneity is there (eg in the definition of a diagnosis of pneumonia, and how would you ideally like this to be diagnosed)? Comment on heterogeneity added to abstract &amp;#8220;In six studies (n = 1372) the reduction in likelihood of developing pneumonia with pneumococcal vaccination compared to control did not achieve statistical significance, odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.01, with moderate heterogeneity present between studies.&amp;#8221;I do not think you can suggest that more severe patients may benefit more from a sub-group analysis in one trial that did not show a positive test for interaction? this may need to be toned down In discussion comment added &amp;#8220;The results in one study suggest a possible benefit against pneumonia for those with greater lung function impairment (Alfageme 2006) although the test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (Chi2 = 2.36, df = 1 (P = 0.12), I2= 57.6%) and further studies are required to investigate this.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;but is an appropriate topic for further research, I agree. Added in Implications for research &amp;#8220;To confirm efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in COPD and investigate any possible differential benefit in more severe COPD, large adequately powered randomised placebo-controlled trials in participants with COPD with disease of defined severity are needed.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;I suggest that you exclude the three studies with no control as part of sensitivity analysis based on risks of bias? Sensitivity analysis done by control/no control injection. Text added &amp;#8220;No placebo or control injection was used in four studies, Alfageme 2006, Steentoft 2006, Teramoto 2007 and YaTseimakh 2006. In sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome of pneumonia excluding these studies, the effect direction and lack of statistical significance was unchanged with the confidence intervals being wider, OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.34 to 2.18). For acute exacerbations there was only one study with a control injection group showing an effect size of similar magnitude, OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.00).&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;I am not sure about the additional bias column in the RoB figure. What is this about? You need to add some text to the RoB for this outcome or it will not show on the figure. This row did not add any useful information and I have removed it from all template for table.&lt;br&gt;Toby noted from check in message that Punam Mangtani did not respond to requests for her comments on the draft is this still the case? If she does not get back to us about this review it will prove difficult to get her signature on the licence forms. Shall I give her one more try? I note from your check in message that Punam Mangtani did not respond to requests for her comments on the draft is this still the case? If she does not get back to us about this review it will prove difficult to get her signature on the licence forms. Shall I give her one more try? Her email address is correct as she responded to my initial inquiry about her interest in remaining as author positively, but did not respond when I sent request for her comments/input. Yes could you try once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing 26/05/2010 (I think I should now come off the author list and just edit this review!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

I think it reads much better now. I have reworded some sentences in red to reflect the fact that the available RCT evidence does not show significant benefit (whilst the confidence intervals are too wide to exclude either important harm or benefit from most of the outcomes). The changes are in red. I have removed the comment about mortality in the implications for practice as the CI is too wide to exclude an increase in mortality and Toby has come out of acknowledgements. Should Liz get a mention here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of minor matters to clarify below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During spell check I changed the intervention dosage - please confirm it should be 50 mcg not 50 mg for the dose of 14 valent vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results describe episodes of pneumonia per subject, is this patients who developed peumonia as this is what we need for a dichotomous outcome? I have altered text in red - please check this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ED is missing its CI for rate ratios. PLEASE COULD THESE BE ADDED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be able to get this onto the next submission if these minor changes can be attended to in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;====================================================================&lt;br&gt;Revision June 2006&lt;br&gt;In response to the reviewers comments and further thought we have removed all reference to oral immunomodulators and revised the title to reflect the fact that only studies of injectable vaccines have been included.&lt;br&gt;RWB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.5&lt;br&gt;Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revision September 2005&lt;br&gt;We have added 0.5 to the placebo cell in the Alfageme table which changes the rate ratio to 0.91, but this is slightly irrelevant as this data (pneumococcal pneumonia) is not included in any of the outcomes in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree there is a wide variation in the acute exacerbation rates for Orcel &amp;amp; Foschino. It is not clear how comparable their definitions were, and I have added something to the discussion to reflect this (marked text). However, I suspect the most likely explanation for the differences lies not in the definition of an exacerbation, but in the participants included in the studies. I am dubious whether all participants in the Foschino study had COPD (as we defined it), given the lower end of the age range is 27 years. I have added a cautionary note regarding this to the discussion. Looking at the original papers, Orcel reported a significant difference between interventions for this outcome (p&amp;lt;0.01), but Foschino did not report any statistical comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wide variation in the rates for pneumonia (outcome 1.02), with the Davis and Alfageme studies having similar rates of 0.04 per person year for the placebo arm, while Orcel is much higher at 0.3. However, the mean age of participants was some 20 years greater in the Orcel study than Davis or Alfageme, which could explain the much higher incidence of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced we should be separating the injectable and oral vaccines, we have no evidence that they are not equivalent, largely because there are few outcomes which include both. The exception is mortality, where the outcomes are similar for oral and injectable forms. We also state in the first part of the discussion section that we have divided the analyses according to vaccine type, to enable any difference between oral/14-valent/23-valent to be assessed by sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would vote for leaving things as they are, including some further discussion on the limitations of the study as per the new text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RWB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC relook Jun9 2005&lt;br&gt;Dear Rob,&lt;br&gt;I am very sorry for the long delay on this. I have looked at the rate data that you used. This is not going to be easy! Firstly you need to add 0.5 to the placebo cell as well in the Alfageme table, making it 5.5. Secondly looking across all the data there is pretty wide variation in annual rates suggesting that the same outcome may not have been used. Orcel has a placebo rate that is 7 times lower than Foschino for example. These should probably therefore not be pooled. Davis and Alfageme on the other hand look very similar in their rates, but again vary markedly from Orcel.&lt;br&gt;I would propose that you divide up the studies into two separate comparisons, the injectable vaccines (and I am happy for you to pool these results) and the oral vaccines (which I would advise not to pool exacerbations but you could pool the mortality data). This advice is partly based on a clinical judgement that the oral vaccine is not equivalent to injectable. Does Phillippa agree with this?&lt;br&gt;The lack of placebo in Alfageme is more of a threat to objective outcomes (such as exacerbations etc) than to mortality as an outcome. I agree that the study should be included and you have covered this in the discussion section.&lt;br&gt;Could you discuss these comments with Phillippa and if she agrees with the split you will need to set up a second comparison for the oral vaccines. I am afraid this will also mean changing the way you report the results, and I suggest starting with the injectable vaccines as these are the ones that are currently used.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 22 March 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: &amp;quot;Adults with COPD defined by the American Thoracic Society &amp;quot; Did all the patients fit this categorisation in all the trials (including data from trials of patients with mixed lung disease if separate data was available for COPD patients? SOME OF THE TRIALS WERE BASED ON PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE AS WELL?). Also couild you clarify what you mean by &amp;quot;8. Cost of pneumococcal vaccination.&amp;quot;? Price of the vaccine or something more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - minor alteration in red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract- ditto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - It would help me a great deal to see the data trial for the calculations in the Rate Ratio results that you have put into RevMan. I need to see the figures that were reported in the paper and the calculations that you made with them (eg on a spreadsheet etc.) There is a danger in getting the variance wrong if the duration is doubled? COULD YOU SEND THIS ON TO ME. Did the studies report a Rate Ratio or did you take the number with an exacerbation over the study duration and turn that into a ratio yourselves? If the patients may have had more than one exacerbation each how did you take this into account? Toby had rate ratio data that was presented as such with a standard error but I guess you did not have this luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - I will come back to this after the above have been clarified. There is no data under your Cost outcome???&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues - there is a trade off here between lumping and splitting for the two types of vaccine.

Average age of participants was 66 years, male participants accounted for 67% and mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) was 1.2 L (five studies), 54% predicted (four studies). We assessed risks of selection, attrition and reporting bias as low, and risks of performance and detection bias as moderate.</P><P>Compared with control, the vaccine group had a lower likelihood of developing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (odds ratio (OR) 0.59 , 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.85; six studies, n = 1372; GRADE: moderate), but findings did not differ specifically for pneumococcal pneumonia (Peto OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.31; three studies, n = 1158; GRADE: low). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) (preventing one episode of CAP) was 19 (95% CI 13 to 52). Mortality from cardiorespiratory causes did not differ between vaccine and control groups (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.66; three studies, n = 888; GRADE: moderate), nor did all-cause mortality differ (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; five studies, n = 1053; GRADE: moderate). The likelihood of hospital admission for any cause, or for cardiorespiratory causes, did not differ between vaccine and control groups. Vaccination significantly reduced the likelihood of a COPD exacerbation (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93; four studies, n = 446; GRADE: moderate). The NNTB to prevent a patient from experiencing an acute exacerbation was 8 (95% CI 5 to 58). Only one study (n = 181) compared the efficacy of different vaccine types - 23-valent PPV versus 7-valent PCV - and reported no differences for CAP, all-cause mortality, hospital admission or likelihood of a COPD exacerbation, but investigators described a greater likelihood of some mild adverse effects of vaccination with PPV-23.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-12-21 14:11:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>Injectable polyvalent pneumococcal vaccination provides significant protection against community-acquired pneumonia, although no evidence indicates that vaccination reduced the risk of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonia, which was a relatively rare event.

Data from 12 countries in the Burden of Lung Disease (BOLD) initiative show that more than 10% of adults have COPD at Stage II or higher, as defined by <LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>. Prevalence and staging vary across countries between men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Buist-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buist 2007</LINK>) and increase with age.

Exacerbations are a major contributor to healthcare costs, especially for hospital admission (<LINK REF="REF-Wedzicha-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wedzicha 2003</LINK>).</P><P>The clinical onset of an acute exacerbation is defined according to symptoms, although definitions vary (<LINK REF="REF-Rodriguez_x002d_Roisin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodriguez-Roisin 2000</LINK>). Anthonisen defined type 1 exacerbations on the basis of three major symptoms: increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence. Type 2 exacerbations required two major symptoms, and type 3 exacerbations required one major symptom plus cough, wheeze or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1987</LINK>). A later definition required an increase in two 'major symptoms' of dyspnoea - sputum volume and sputum purulence - or an increase in one major symptom and in one 'minor symptom' for two days (wheeze, sore throat, cough or common cold symptoms) (<LINK REF="REF-Seemungal-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seemungal 2000</LINK>). Researchers recently developed a standardised measure for assessing the frequency, severity and duration of exacerbations of COPD using patient-reported outcomes as described in clinical studies (<LINK REF="REF-Leidy-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leidy 2010</LINK>).</P><P>Patients with COPD with persistent lower airway bacterial colonisation when stable are at increased risk of exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Bogaert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogaert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2002</LINK>). Infection is frequently detected during exacerbations; one study found that 48.4% of participants had viral causes and 54.7% had bacterial causes of infection (<LINK REF="REF-Papi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2006</LINK>). Infection-associated exacerbations required longer hospitalisation and resulted in greater impairment of lung function than exacerbations in which no infection was present (<LINK REF="REF-Papi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papi 2006</LINK>). Investigators in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2002</LINK>) recovered <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae</I> (<I>S pneumoniae</I>) from the sputum of 33% of participants. Risk of exacerbations of COPD is increased among patients with pneumococcal colonisation (<LINK REF="REF-Bogaert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bogaert 2004</LINK>). Researchers have discovered an association between detection of <I>S pneumoniae</I> as a new organism in the sputum of patients with COPD and significantly increased risk of an exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Sethi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sethi 2002</LINK>).</P><P>Pneumonia is usually a serious illness, and diagnosis is based on the presence of radiological infiltrates, symptoms (cough, expectoration, fever, dyspnoea, pleuritic pain, altered mental status), signs of pulmonary consolidation on auscultation and leukocytosis (<LINK REF="STD-Ochoa_x002d_Gondar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ochoa-Gondar 2008</LINK>). Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem among adults over 65 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Welte-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Welte 2009</LINK>), and prevalence of 14 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.7 to 15.3) has been reported. Hospitalisation rate is high (75%), and in-patient stays are often lengthy (mean 10.4 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Ochoa_x002d_Gondar-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ochoa-Gondar 2008</LINK>). Overall mortality estimates are high: 6% in Canada, 20% in the USA and Spain, 13% in the UK and 8% in Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-File-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">File 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mandell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 2007</LINK>). Patients with COPD who develop CAP have more severe pneumonia, are admitted to the intensive care unit more frequently and have significantly higher 30- and 90-day mortality than non-COPD patients (<LINK REF="REF-Molinos-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molinos 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Restrepo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Restrepo 2006</LINK>). <I>S pneumoniae</I> is the predominant pathogen among all patients with CAP (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 2007</LINK>) and among patients with COPD and CAP, for whom a 43% pneumococcal aetiology has been found (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torres-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torres 1996</LINK>). Progression from COPD to CAP has been shown to be strongly associated with the presence of <I>S pneumoniae</I> (57.3%), and other pathogens were predominant among exacerbations that did not progress to CAP (61.7%) (<LINK REF="REF-File-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">File 2009</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-12 02:50:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>On the basis of differences in polysaccharide capsules, investigators have identified 91 different serotypes of <I>S pneumoniae.</I> Capsule polysaccharides have antiphagocytic activity, which affects the pathogenesis of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including CAP (<LINK REF="REF-Postma-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Postma 2012</LINK>), and the incidence of IPD differs between serotypes. In the late 1970s, a 14-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-14) was registered in the United States; this was replaced in the 1980s by a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) (Pneumovax/Pneumo 23) in the USA and Europe. This vaccine contains purified capsular antigens from 23 serotypes that cover 85% to 90% of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among adults (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS 2014</LINK>). The vaccine induces T-cell-independent short-lived B-cell immune responses by causing B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, producing antibodies without producing memory B cells. The immunological antibody response is age- and serotype-dependent and generally is lower among elderly people than in younger adults. A booster vaccination produces no memory response.</P><P>To enhance the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccines, researchers have developed conjugate vaccines. Polysaccharide antigens are chemically joined to a highly immunogenic protein carrier (such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid). This process leads to the induction of B cell-dependent and T cell-dependent responses as well as a memory response to a booster dose of the vaccine. Healthcare providers have administered pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing capsular polysaccharides from seven pneumococcal serotypes (PCV-7) to young children since the 2000s, with a resulting striking decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes. As children are the main reservoir of <I>S pneumoniae</I> (60% are carriers), a reduction in the carrier rate has had beneficial effects among children and a protective herd effect in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2013</LINK>).</P><P>Investigators are evaluating new conjugate vaccines, including 7-valent (PCV-7), 10-valent (PCV-10) and 13-valent (PCV-13) vaccines, for use in children and adults, although respiratory guidelines in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-ERS-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">ERS 2014</LINK>) and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-COPDX-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">COPDX 2016</LINK>) recommend immunisation with the PPV-23 polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine for adults at risk of pneumococcal disease, including those with COPD. The PCV-13 and the PCV-10 are not recommended for patients with COPD in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2013</LINK>).

In this current review of effects of pneumococcal vaccines for preventing pneumonia, only three studies reported the proportion of participants using corticosteroids; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2013</LINK> indicated that 100% of participants were taking inhaled corticosteroids, <LINK REF="STD-Steentoft-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Steentoft 2006</LINK> revealed that 24% used oral corticosteroids in the comparison with control and <LINK REF="STD-Dransfield-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dransfield 2009</LINK> described use of inhaled corticosteroids by 65% of participants in comparisons of PPV-23 versus PCV-7.

COPDX guidelines for Australia and New Zealand state that "pneumococcal immunisation (polyvalent covering 23 virulent serotypes) is recommended in people with COPD", and evidence for this recommendation is graded at level II (<LINK REF="REF-COPDX-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">COPDX 2016</LINK>). The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines published jointly by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the USA and the World Health Organization (WHO) advise that "pneumococcal vaccination should be offered to every COPD patient; vaccine appears to be more effective in older patients and those with more severe disease or cardiac comorbidity" (<LINK REF="REF-GOLD-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">GOLD 2016</LINK>).</P><P>The WHO (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>) has made recommendations for use of pneumococcal vaccines in children, which are influencing pneumococcal disease, carriage and herd protection. Pneumococcal conjugated vaccines PCV-10 and PCV-13 are licensed for prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by respective vaccine serotypes in children from six weeks to five years of age, with high vaccine efficacy. The WHO recommends that inclusion of PCVs be given priority in childhood immunisation programmes worldwide, especially in countries with under-five-mortality of &gt; 50/1000 live births. Although herd effects of immunisation in children have reduced invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), it is recommended that adults over 65 should be immunised.</P><P>The studies included in this review reported a low frequency of proven pneumococcal pneumonia; thus we acknowledge the possibility of a type 2 error, given the rare events reported. Investigators have found that the overall contribution of pneumococcal pneumonia to overall CAP varies (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2015</LINK>); between 2008 and 2013, rates of 17.1% to 37.3% were reported.</P><P>A recent systematic review aimed to determine the incidence and burden of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal disease in the adult population in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 2016</LINK>).

However, the incidence of PCV13 serotype IPD among people &gt; 65 years of age was 10.33 per 100,000 population from 2008 to 2010, and fell to 3.72 per 100,000 in 2013-2014.

For the 2016 version of the review, review authors have changed the title to highlight the focus on the clinically relevant outcome of pneumonia. We have updated the Background by including information on new vaccines and guidelines. Studies comparing different types of vaccines have been conducted since the 2010 update, and we have included one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Dransfield-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Dransfield 2009</LINK>). Since the last update (in 2010), we have added new standard Cochrane headings and tables assessing risk of bias and providing a summary of findings.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES MODIFIED="2010-10-04 17:26:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh"/></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-03-19 12:09:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Dennett">

MODIFIED="2018-03-19 12:05:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>Thank you for your comprehensive review on the potential benefit of pneumococcal vaccination in patients with COPD. We are concerned with your main conclusion, that "injectable polyvalent vaccination provides significant protection against community-acquired pneumonia" (CAP), for a number of reasons.</P><P>Firstly, of the 12 studies with 2171 participants included in your review, only 6 studies (1372 participants) were included in the meta-analysis of CAP (Analysis 1.1). It appears that five of the excluded trials evaluated the efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination compared to placebo or no comparator, and thus it seems reasonable to have CAP as a reported outcome. Given the effect size reported (63 versus 81 cases in the vaccine and control group, respectively), the missing data from these trials (425 patients), could significantly impact the results of Analysis 1.1. We are curious to know whether efforts were made to collect this data from the original authors. Moreover, the reporting of results from Furomoto 2008 appears discordant with your criteria to include studies that have at least 80% of participants with COPD, as the proportion was 33% (55/167) in the per-protocol results of this paper.</P><P>Our review of Teramoto 2007, which contributed substantial weight to Analysis 1.1, raised significant doubt regarding the reliability of information from this abstract. For example, their objective was &#8220;to test the effect of tiotropium bromide on lung functions, respiratory muscle function and dyspnoea sensation during exercise,&#8221; a statement clearly inconsistent with the remainder of the abstract. We believe the results of the sensitivity analysis which excluded this paper (showing a non-significant effect) merits greater emphasis as it represents a major caveat to your main conclusion.</P><P>We also have minor concerns regarding the reported number of CAP events in the placebo group cited from Davis 1987 for Analysis 1.1 and the number of deaths due to cardiorespiratory causes reported from Alfageme 2006 in Analysis 1.4. In both cases, the numbers reported in your meta-analyses do not appear in the original publications. We believe that providing the source of this information would offer greater clarity to your readers.</P><P>Based on these concerns and the current available evidence presented in your review, we believe it remains inconclusive whether pneumococcal vaccination in COPD patients leads to a reduction in pneumonia. We suggest that this uncertainty be reflected in the final conclusion regarding the benefits for pneumococcal vaccine in COPD patients.</P><P>Elaine Tung, Priscilla Shum, Jinglin Tang</P></FEEDBACK_SUMMARY><FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2018-03-19 12:07:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Dennett"><P>We thank the contributors for this feedback.</P><P>In five included studies no outcome data on CAP were available, either in publications or from requests to authors, when made.

The criterion to include studies that have at least 80% of participants with COPD only applies where separate results for participants with COPD are not available.</P><P>The data for Teramoto 2007 were extracted from a published abstract. A request was sent September 2009, without response. We concluded it was highly likely that the objective was not accurately stated, possibly an error in English writing. Title was &#8216;Clinical efficacy of anti-pneumococcal vaccination in elderly patients with COPD&#8217;. While the study does contribute significant weight to the overall result, so does that of Alfageme 2006, reflecting the size and event rates of the two studies. We reported no heterogeneity (Chi = 5.52, df = 5 (P = 0.36); I = 9%) and an effect size OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; 6 studies , n = 1372. With the removal of these 2 studies (which contributed 45% participants), the effect was lessened and non significant, but direction was the same (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.25; 4 studies, n = 803). We believe this is consistent with a lack of power, resulting from the removal of participants, rather than a change in the effect.</P><P>Regarding the reported number of CAP events in the placebo group cited from Davis 1987 for Analysis 1.1 OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89 [Heterogeneity: Chi = 5.52, df = 5 (P = 0.36); I = 9%], we thank the contributors for pointing this out. The figure for the placebo group for CAP at least 1 episode should be 7 (N=53) and with the corrected data outcome 1.1 is OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85, Heterogeneity: Chi = 5.67, df = 5 (P = 0.34); I = 12%.

JW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 2010_06_15 I am very happy with Julia's responses so this is ready for peer review&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I note that the primary outcome has been changed to pneumonia, so this should be mentioned in the differences between protocol and review.&amp;#160;Noted there as &amp;#8220;Pneumonia has been promoted from a secondary to a primary outcome for the 2010 update. Additionally Risk of Bias tables have been added to the review.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new says the direction of effect has changed with the new data, but it is actually the size not the direction so I have altered this.There is considerable heterogeneity in this outcome which should be mentioned in the abstract. Just because I2 is below 50% does not mean this can be ignored as the power for testing heterogeneity is low. How much clinical heterogeneity is there (eg in the definition of a diagnosis of pneumonia, and how would you ideally like this to be diagnosed)? Comment on heterogeneity added to abstract &amp;#8220;In six studies (n = 1372) the reduction in likelihood of developing pneumonia with pneumococcal vaccination compared to control did not achieve statistical significance, odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.01, with moderate heterogeneity present between studies.&amp;#8221;I do not think you can suggest that more severe patients may benefit more from a sub-group analysis in one trial that did not show a positive test for interaction? this may need to be toned down In discussion comment added &amp;#8220;The results in one study suggest a possible benefit against pneumonia for those with greater lung function impairment (Alfageme 2006) although the test for subgroup differences was not statistically significant (Chi2 = 2.36, df = 1 (P = 0.12), I2= 57.6%) and further studies are required to investigate this.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;but is an appropriate topic for further research, I agree. Added in Implications for research &amp;#8220;To confirm efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination in COPD and investigate any possible differential benefit in more severe COPD, large adequately powered randomised placebo-controlled trials in participants with COPD with disease of defined severity are needed.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;I suggest that you exclude the three studies with no control as part of sensitivity analysis based on risks of bias? Sensitivity analysis done by control/no control injection. Text added &amp;#8220;No placebo or control injection was used in four studies, Alfageme 2006, Steentoft 2006, Teramoto 2007 and YaTseimakh 2006. In sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome of pneumonia excluding these studies, the effect direction and lack of statistical significance was unchanged with the confidence intervals being wider, OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.34 to 2.18). For acute exacerbations there was only one study with a control injection group showing an effect size of similar magnitude, OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.00).&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;I am not sure about the additional bias column in the RoB figure. What is this about? You need to add some text to the RoB for this outcome or it will not show on the figure. This row did not add any useful information and I have removed it from all template for table.&lt;br&gt;Toby noted from check in message that Punam Mangtani did not respond to requests for her comments on the draft is this still the case? If she does not get back to us about this review it will prove difficult to get her signature on the licence forms. Shall I give her one more try? I note from your check in message that Punam Mangtani did not respond to requests for her comments on the draft is this still the case?

I think it reads much better now. I have reworded some sentences in red to reflect the fact that the available RCT evidence does not show significant benefit (whilst the confidence intervals are too wide to exclude either important harm or benefit from most of the outcomes). The changes are in red. I have removed the comment about mortality in the implications for practice as the CI is too wide to exclude an increase in mortality and Toby has come out of acknowledgements. Should Liz get a mention here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of minor matters to clarify below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During spell check I changed the intervention dosage - please confirm it should be 50 mcg not 50 mg for the dose of 14 valent vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results describe episodes of pneumonia per subject, is this patients who developed peumonia as this is what we need for a dichotomous outcome? I have altered text in red - please check this is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ED is missing its CI for rate ratios. PLEASE COULD THESE BE ADDED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be able to get this onto the next submission if these minor changes can be attended to in the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;====================================================================&lt;br&gt;Revision June 2006&lt;br&gt;In response to the reviewers comments and further thought we have removed all reference to oral immunomodulators and revised the title to reflect the fact that only studies of injectable vaccines have been included.&lt;br&gt;RWB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.8&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.5&lt;br&gt;Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revision September 2005&lt;br&gt;We have added 0.5 to the placebo cell in the Alfageme table which changes the rate ratio to 0.91, but this is slightly irrelevant as this data (pneumococcal pneumonia) is not included in any of the outcomes in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree there is a wide variation in the acute exacerbation rates for Orcel &amp;amp; Foschino. It is not clear how comparable their definitions were, and I have added something to the discussion to reflect this (marked text). However, I suspect the most likely explanation for the differences lies not in the definition of an exacerbation, but in the participants included in the studies. I am dubious whether all participants in the Foschino study had COPD (as we defined it), given the lower end of the age range is 27 years. I have added a cautionary note regarding this to the discussion. Looking at the original papers, Orcel reported a significant difference between interventions for this outcome (p&amp;lt;0.01), but Foschino did not report any statistical comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wide variation in the rates for pneumonia (outcome 1.02), with the Davis and Alfageme studies having similar rates of 0.04 per person year for the placebo arm, while Orcel is much higher at 0.3. However, the mean age of participants was some 20 years greater in the Orcel study than Davis or Alfageme, which could explain the much higher incidence of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced we should be separating the injectable and oral vaccines, we have no evidence that they are not equivalent, largely because there are few outcomes which include both. The exception is mortality, where the outcomes are similar for oral and injectable forms. We also state in the first part of the discussion section that we have divided the analyses according to vaccine type, to enable any difference between oral/14-valent/23-valent to be assessed by sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would vote for leaving things as they are, including some further discussion on the limitations of the study as per the new text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RWB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;CJC relook Jun9 2005&lt;br&gt;Dear Rob,&lt;br&gt;I am very sorry for the long delay on this. I have looked at the rate data that you used. This is not going to be easy! Firstly you need to add 0.5 to the placebo cell as well in the Alfageme table, making it 5.5. Secondly looking across all the data there is pretty wide variation in annual rates suggesting that the same outcome may not have been used. Orcel has a placebo rate that is 7 times lower than Foschino for example. These should probably therefore not be pooled. Davis and Alfageme on the other hand look very similar in their rates, but again vary markedly from Orcel.&lt;br&gt;I would propose that you divide up the studies into two separate comparisons, the injectable vaccines (and I am happy for you to pool these results) and the oral vaccines (which I would advise not to pool exacerbations but you could pool the mortality data). This advice is partly based on a clinical judgement that the oral vaccine is not equivalent to injectable. Does Phillippa agree with this?&lt;br&gt;The lack of placebo in Alfageme is more of a threat to objective outcomes (such as exacerbations etc) than to mortality as an outcome. I agree that the study should be included and you have covered this in the discussion section.&lt;br&gt;Could you discuss these comments with Phillippa and if she agrees with the split you will need to set up a second comparison for the oral vaccines. I am afraid this will also mean changing the way you report the results, and I suggest starting with the injectable vaccines as these are the ones that are currently used.&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 22 March 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: &amp;quot;Adults with COPD defined by the American Thoracic Society &amp;quot; Did all the patients fit this categorisation in all the trials (including data from trials of patients with mixed lung disease if separate data was available for COPD patients? SOME OF THE TRIALS WERE BASED ON PHYSICIAN ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE AS WELL?). Also couild you clarify what you mean by &amp;quot;8. Cost of pneumococcal vaccination.&amp;quot;? Price of the vaccine or something more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - minor alteration in red&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract- ditto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - It would help me a great deal to see the data trial for the calculations in the Rate Ratio results that you have put into RevMan. I need to see the figures that were reported in the paper and the calculations that you made with them (eg on a spreadsheet etc.) There is a danger in getting the variance wrong if the duration is doubled? COULD YOU SEND THIS ON TO ME. Did the studies report a Rate Ratio or did you take the number with an exacerbation over the study duration and turn that into a ratio yourselves? If the patients may have had more than one exacerbation each how did you take this into account? Toby had rate ratio data that was presented as such with a standard error but I guess you did not have this luxury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - I will come back to this after the above have been clarified. There is no data under your Cost outcome???&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues - there is a trade off here between lumping and splitting for the two types of vaccine. Pending the details above I would guess it would be safer to put them into two separate comparison groups as we have no idea how much difference the other components of the oral vaccine made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked - not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - back to reviewers for the above data please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;================================================&lt;br&gt;Assessment of studies for inclusion completed 01/03.&lt;br&gt;Final search completed in April 2004.&lt;br&gt;Search strategy section and references checked &amp;amp; amended 21/2/05 Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in patients with COPD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby,&lt;br&gt;Could you please add co-reviewers details for those appropriate whom I do not have.&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in patients with COPD (WITH CHRIS 210205)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in patients with COPD&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in patients with COPD (WITH CHRIS 210205)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;RHG (May 22, 2006): have added dichotomous data table for hospital admissions (all causes), and need to do the same for acute exacerbations and pneumonia...therefore requiring events for those studies contained within.
