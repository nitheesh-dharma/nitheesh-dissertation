When the main thigh artery has a long blockage, the best option is to insert a bypass to carry the blood from an artery with good blood flow to the affected artery below the blockage. Bypass is intended to improve walking, or to save limbs that might otherwise require amputation. The different types of material available to create the bypass include the person's own vein (autologous vein), human umbilical vein, and the prosthetic materials polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or Dacron, alone or with the blood thinning agent heparin bonded to the inside of the graft. Bypass grafts extending to below the knee are not as effective at remaining patent (open) with good blood flow as those above the knee. The aim of this review was to determine the most effective type of material to use for above-knee and below-knee bypass grafts.</P><P><B>Study characteristics and key results</B></P><P>We identified 19 randomised controlled trials that included a total of 3123 people. Of these people, 2547 were given above-knee bypass grafts and 576 were given bypass grafts below the knee. The evidence in our review is current until 13 March 2017. From our analysis, we found that grafts made from a person's own vein had a better primary patency (blood flow) rate than the prosthetic materials PTFE or Dacron for above-knee bypass grafts. Meanwhile, Dacron (and possibly also human umbilical vein) achieved better blood flow (patency) than PTFE. We also found that Dacron with supporting rings around it (designed to prevent external compression) showed worse patency than non-supported Dacron when used in grafts above the knee.</P><P>Adding a 'cuff' of vein did not improve the patency of PTFE for grafts extending to below the knee. The included trials provided few results on how long people's limbs survived following the bypass procedure. There was not much consistency between the trials (and sometimes within the trials) with regards to people taking additional medications such as antiplatelets or anticoagulants, and this might have affected the results.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Issues which affected the quality of the evidence included differences in the design of the trials, and differences in the types of grafts they compared. These differences meant we were often only able to combine and analyse small numbers of participants and this resulted in uncertainty over the true effects of the graft type used.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:31:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:28:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Femoro-popliteal bypass is implemented to save limbs that might otherwise require amputation, in patients with ischaemic rest pain or tissue loss; and to improve walking distance in patients with severe life-limiting claudication.

In total, nine graft types were compared (autologous vein, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with and without vein cuff, human umbilical vein (HUV), polyurethane (PUR), Dacron and heparin bonded Dacron (HBD); FUSION BIOLINE and Dacron with external support). Studies differed in which graft types they compared and follow-up ranged from six months to 10 years.</P><P><B>Above-knee bypass</B></P><P>For above-knee bypass, there was moderate-quality evidence that autologous vein grafts improve primary patency compared to prosthetic grafts by 60 months (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.80; 3 studies, 269 limbs; P = 0.005). We found low-quality evidence to suggest that this benefit translated to improved secondary patency by 60 months (Peto OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.74; 2 studies, 176 limbs; P = 0.003).</P><P>We found no clear difference between Dacron and PTFE graft types for primary patency by 60 months (Peto OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.90; 2 studies, 247 limbs; low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that Dacron grafts improved secondary patency over PTFE by 24 months (Peto OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28; 2 studies, 528 limbs; P = 0.03), an effect which continued to 60 months in the single trial reporting this timepoint (Peto OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.53; 167 limbs; P = 0.005).</P><P>Externally supported prosthetic grafts had inferior primary patency at 24 months when compared to unsupported prosthetic grafts (Peto OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.35; 2 studies, 270 limbs; P = 0.003). Secondary patency was similarly affected in the single trial reporting this outcome (Peto OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.07; 236 limbs; P = 0.008). No data were available for 60 months follow-up.</P><P>HUV showed benefits in primary patency over PTFE at 24 months (Peto OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.76 to 13.06; 82 limbs; P = 0.002). This benefit was still seen at 60 months (Peto OR 3.75, 95% CI 1.46 to 9.62; 69 limbs; P = 0.006), but this was only compared in one trial. Results were similar for secondary patency at 24 months (Peto OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.44 to 11.17; 93 limbs) and at 60 months (Peto OR 3.87, 95% CI 1.65 to 9.05; 93 limbs).</P><P>We found HBD to be superior to PTFE for primary patency at 60 months for above-knee bypass, but these results were based on a single trial (Peto OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.72; 146 limbs; very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in primary patency between HBD and HUV for above-knee bypass in the one small study which reported this outcome.</P><P>We found only one small trial studying PUR and it showed very poor primary and secondary patency rates which were inferior to Dacron at all time points.</P><P><B>Below-knee bypass</B></P><P>For bypass below the knee, we found no graft type to be superior to any other in terms of primary patency, though one trial showed improved secondary patency of HUV over PTFE at all time points to 24 months (Peto OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.97; 88 limbs; P = 0.005).</P><P>One study compared PTFE alone to PTFE with vein cuff; very low-quality evidence indicates no effect to either primary or secondary patency at 24 months (Peto OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.01; 182 limbs; 2 studies; P = 0.80 and Peto OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.23; 181 limbs; 2 studies; P = 0.51 respectively)</P><P>Limited data were available for limb survival, and those studies reporting on this outcome showed no clear difference between graft types for this outcome. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant protocols varied extensively between trials, and in some cases within trials.</P><P>The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Issues which affected the quality of the evidence included differences in the design of the trials, and differences in the types of grafts they compared. These differences meant we were often only able to combine and analyse small numbers of participants and this resulted in uncertainty over the true effects of the graft type used.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:31:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There was moderate-quality evidence of improved long-term (60 months) primary patency for autologous vein grafts when compared to prosthetic materials for above-knee bypasses. In the long term (two to five years) there was low-quality evidence that Dacron confers a small secondary patency benefit over PTFE for above-knee bypass. Only very low-quality data exist on below-knee bypasses, so we are uncertain which graft type is best. Further randomised data are needed to ascertain whether this information translates into an improvement in limb survival.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-09 08:59:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:34:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Femoro-popliteal bypass grafting for lower limb ischaemia is one of the most common procedures undertaken by vascular surgeons. Since its inception in the 1940s the procedure has evolved significantly in terms of technical intricacy, graft type, anticoagulant medication use and patient selection. Various graft types have been used, including: autologous vein (in situ or reversed), human umbilical vein (HUV), synthetic polymers, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Dacron; and more recently heparin-bonded synthetic polymers.</P><P>During femoro-popliteal bypass grafting, the proximal anastomosis is taken from the common, superficial or profunda femoris artery and the distal anastomosis may be to the popliteal artery either above or below the knee (referred to as above- and below-knee grafts).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:34:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Controversy still exists over the most appropriate type of graft to use in bypass surgery. It is generally accepted that autologous vein should be used wherever possible, but there are surgeons who believe that using vein is a more demanding and time-consuming operation that involves a longer duration of anaesthesia in relatively frail patients. When vein is unavailable there are widespread differences in the material used. This is due, in part, to a lack of relevant randomised evidence. Early trials did not separate above- and below-knee grafts, were underpowered, had inadequate randomisation and the patient populations were less relevant to modern practice. As new materials became available they were implemented as standard practice for many surgeons, but with a lack of high-quality supporting evidence. Even fairly recent meta-analyses have relied heavily on non-randomised, retrospective data (<LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2006</LINK>).</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:34:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Arterial bypass grafting works by routing arterial blood around blocked or narrow sections of artery using an alternative conduit. This conduit may either be a section of the patient's own vein (reversed or with the valves cut and disrupted); or an alternative biological conduit such as human umbilical vein; or an artificial material.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-06 13:34:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Outcomes from infrainguinal bypass grafting continue to be poor; at a median follow-up of five years, the landmark randomised trial comparing bypass surgery to angioplasty in severe limb ischaemia reported overall survival of less than 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Bradbury-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradbury 2010</LINK>). There are economic and patient advantages to successful bypass grafting (<LINK REF="REF-Luther-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luther 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perler 1995</LINK>).

Some of the main reasons we excluded trials were because they failed to randomise patients, they did not report the data for above- and below-knee procedures separately, or because they had severe methodological flaws which led to significant bias within the trial.</P><P>We only found low numbers of trials for some analyses, especially for below-knee bypass, which is partly indicative of the numbers of new graft types being introduced and partly indicative of the reduced numbers of lower-limb bypass procedures now performed. Inclusion criteria for randomised controlled trials produce the potential problem of reducing the applicability of the results to the overall patient population. This was especially a problem in older trials, which included stable or long-distance claudicants, who are generally not offered surgery in contemporary practice. A subcomponent of any trial including such patients will therefore not be applicable to the overall patient population, but should have a minimal effect on the overall results as these trials have smaller numbers than the more recent included trials. The included trials are largely reflective of modern surgical practice in the UK and are therefore relevant. </P><P>Data on limb salvage and survival with limb intact were generally not included for analysis in trials. In the future this should be included as it is an important outcome, both for the patient and from a health economics point of view (<LINK REF="REF-Luther-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luther 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perler 1995</LINK>), and may therefore influence practice significantly. Quality-of-life data would also be useful in influencing treatment strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Nolan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nolan 2007</LINK>). This information might augment the applicability of bypass surgery in general, as evidence is still lacking when comparing infrainguinal bypass with other treatments for lower limb ischaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Fowkes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowkes 2008</LINK>).</P><P>Human umbilical vein (HUV) has primary patency results comparable with other non-vein graft types, and may show an improvement in primary and secondary patency compared to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) below the knee. However, in one trial up to 30% of HUV grafts showed graft dilation and aneurysm formation (<LINK REF="STD-Aalders-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Aalders 1992</LINK>). This, in combination with other data at the time, has led to the diminished popularity of HUV in recent years. More recent reviews did not find these factors to be a significant issue (<LINK REF="REF-Dardik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dardik 2002</LINK>) and the patency data from this meta-analysis infer that HUV may be a suitable alternative to synthetic materials when no autologous vein is available.</P><P>Heparin bonded Dacron is showing promising early results in randomised trials (<LINK REF="STD-Devine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Devine 2004</LINK>). Heparin bonded PTFE is also being widely utilised in contemporary practice. While there are case series data implying that this is an effective material, we could not include data from randomised trials in this review because the results are either awaited (see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>), unavailable due to the trial being terminated early (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00617279" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00617279</LINK>), or reported in a way that does not separate above- and below-knee results (<LINK REF="STD-Lindholt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lindholt 2011</LINK>).</P><P>A single small trial examined the use of polyurethane (PUR) grafts (<LINK REF="STD-Gloor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gloor 1996</LINK>). The trial was stopped early due to astonishingly poor primary and secondary patency rates in the limbs treated with the new graft material, so this material cannot be recommended.</P><P>Several specific problems could not be assessed in this analysis. Firstly, infection of synthetic bypasses has disastrous consequences for the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Siracuse-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siracuse 2013</LINK>), whereas infection of venous bypasses tends not to, and is easier to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Reifsnyder-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reifsnyder 1992</LINK>). Occlusion of synthetic bypasses appears to lead to limb loss more frequently than venous (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2000</LINK>), which is why it is so important that future trials measure limb survival. A second limitation of this review is the lack of information on antiplatelet and anticoagulant protocols in the included studies; this may have produced bias in the results and their interpretation. Finally, the majority of included studies were not stratified according to graft length, inflow site quality or inflow procedures, or patency of runoff vessels. While the randomisation of participants should have achieved balance with respect to these factors, the small numbers of participants could potentially have led to imbalance between treatment arms, in turn leading to biased results.</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:08:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>While there were low numbers of trials for some comparisons, these trials are mainly of reasonable methodological quality with acceptable allocation concealment techniques, though often simple sealed envelopes were used and little&#8212;if any&#8212;effort appeared to have been made to blind participants, practitioners or outcome assessors (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). As a result, we assessed the majority of the evidence contributing to above-knee bypass comparisons as low quality, which rose to moderate quality for one outcome. We assessed the quality of the evidence on below-knee bypass comparisons as very low-quality. Further details are included in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK> and <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>.</P><P>All trials included a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and most supplemented this with numbers-at-risk and life table analyses. The numbers of participants at each stage of the trial were usually clear. However, antiplatelet protocols were generally lacking. There is clear evidence for antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular stenting (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2003</LINK>), which may be applicable to lower-limb arterial stents (<LINK REF="REF-Twine-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twine 2009</LINK>). While the evidence is less clear for lower-limb bypass grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorffler_x002d_Melly-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorffler-Melly 2003</LINK>); clear protocols should be set in future trials to avoid the potential bias caused by individual preferences by surgeons or centres for particular antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Choice of anticoagulant for lower-limb bypass grafts requires good-quality randomised controlled trials to determine efficacy.</P></QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE><POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:09:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Although we are confident that a thorough search was carried out for all relevant studies, we were unable to separate data from trials from patients of below- and above-the-knee bypasses in all cases. It has been clear for some time that below-knee bypass grafts have significantly inferior patency rates to above-knee grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Cranley-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranley 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1991</LINK>). Most trials since the early 1990s have therefore separated the two types of bypass for reporting results, to avoid bias. This led to the division of above- and below-knee procedures in this review. Three trials which were included in previous editions of the review have been excluded in this update or previous updates (or both) as the above- and below-knee data were inseparable (<LINK REF="STD-McCollum-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McCollum 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moody-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Moody 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Watelet-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Watelet 1997</LINK>). More recent trials with combined above- and below-knee procedures had other severe methodological flaws which, in combination, led us to exclude them (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2003</LINK>). In addition, we excluded two more recent trials either because of combined above- and below-knee numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Lindholt-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lindholt 2011</LINK>), or combined below-knee and distal bypass numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Lundgren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Lundgren 2013</LINK>). See the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-09 08:48:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There are several recent meta-analyses of graft type for femoro-popliteal bypass grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Albers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rychlik-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rychlik 2014a</LINK>). In <LINK REF="REF-Albers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albers 2005</LINK>, alternative autologous vein (defined as any autologous venous conduit other than a single section of great saphenous vein) was compared with PTFE, HUV and cryopreserved vein. Randomised controlled trials and cohort controlled trials were considered for inclusion. The authors included retrospective data and combined above- and below-knee bypasses. Thirty-two articles with 2618 patients from studies conducted between 1982 and 2004 were included. Pooled estimate analysis was performed in which the authors found no difference in primary patency between autologous vein and PTFE, but reported a significant improvement in secondary patency and foot preservation for alternative autologous veins. While not directly comparable with our analysis, these data provide more evidence for autologous vein over prosthetic grafts.</P><P>In <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2006</LINK>, above-knee autologous vein, PTFE and below-knee autologous vein were compared. Randomised controlled trials and cohort trials were considered for inclusion. Forty-nine retrospective articles and 24 prospective articles from 1986 to 2004 were included. As well as including retrospective data, the authors included several studies which we excluded from our analysis because of inadequate randomisation. Pooled estimate analysis was performed, in which the authors found a significant improvement in primary patency for above-knee autologous vein when compared with PTFE. Secondary patency was lower for all graft types and showed no significant difference. Therefore, <LINK REF="REF-Pereira-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pereira 2006</LINK> also broadly agrees with the findings of this analysis that autologous vein performs better than PTFE above the knee. The authors' findings should, however, be interpreted with caution due to the nature of the data included.</P><P>One meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Roll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 2008</LINK>), compared Dacron with PTFE and found no difference between the graft types. The authors included bypasses other than femoro-popliteal (axillo-bifemoral, aorto-bifemoral, etc.) but had strict inclusion criteria and therefore included good-quality trials. Our analysis is in broad agreement with the findings of <LINK REF="REF-Roll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 2008</LINK> in terms of primary patency, though we did find an improvement in secondary patency at 24 months and five years, the latter as a result of data from the van Det study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Det-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Det 2009</LINK>), published after Roll (<LINK REF="REF-Roll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 2008</LINK>). Therefore, the findings of our analysis are broadly in agreement with <LINK REF="REF-Roll-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roll 2008</LINK>. For this reason, the long-term secondary patency benefit towards Dacon is tentative, as discussed throughout the text.</P><P>One meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Rychlik-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rychlik 2014a</LINK>) compared Dacron with PTFE above the knee.It had similar exclusion criteria to our review and found results from five studies which are included in our analysis, in addition to one study which we excluded from our meta-analysis due to its methodological flaws (<LINK REF="STD-Davidovic-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Davidovic 2010</LINK>). They chose to include the results of <LINK REF="STD-Devine-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Devine 2004</LINK>, which compared heparin bonded Dacron with PTFE, alongside the four studies comparing standard Dacron with PTFE (<LINK REF="STD-Abbot-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Abbot 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Post-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Post 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Det-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Det 2009</LINK>). Their conclusions were similar to our results in this context: that Dacron has superior patency to PTFE at 2 and 5 years follow-up.</P><P>A previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Twine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twine 2012</LINK>) has shown benefit for PTFE with vein cuff for below-knee bypass. This analysis included non-randomised studies, and based on the results seen in our analysis, the benefit shown in <LINK REF="REF-Twine-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twine 2012</LINK> may be because of selection bias in the non-randomised data. It is unlikely that another RCT of cuffed bypass will be performed, and most surgeons will perform a cuffed anastomosis for synthetic bypass distal to the knee. Registry data is becoming increasingly prevalent in vascular surgery and may help to answer this question more definitively in the future.</P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:10:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:10:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We found moderate-quality evidence that autologous vein grafts improve long-term (60 months) primary patency over prosthetic graft materials for femoro-popliteal bypass above the knee. There was low-quality evidence that Dacron grafts had improved long-term (two to five years) secondary patency compared to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) above the knee. External reinforcement of Dacron grafts had inferior primary patency above the knee. Human umbilical cord (HUV) and heparin bonded Dacron (HBD) may also have superior patency to PTFE, but the results are from only one trial in each case. There was no evidence to support any one synthetic material for bypasses below the knee. Further randomised data are needed to ascertain whether this information translates into an improvement in limb survival.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:10:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Randomised trials of synthetic materials versus autologous vein and other prosthetic materials are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00205790" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00205790</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00147979" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00147979</LINK>). While data on new graft types are invaluable, further randomised data are needed on 'established' materials used for femoro-popliteal bypasses. This especially includes the use of vein cuffs with different prosthetic materials below the knee. Randomised trials of HBD versus Dacron would also be useful, as would randomised data comparing 'alternative' autologous vein (for example profunda femoris, arm vein and 'inadequate' saphenous vein) with prosthetic materials.</P><P>Future trials need to include data on limb survival, quality of life and costs, as well as patency rates, to ascertain whether the improvements in patency found in this analysis translate into improvements in these important outcomes. It would also be helpful if infection rates could be reported in future trials, though the low event rates seen in observational studies of graft infection would suggest that studies looking at this issue might need to be very large.</P><P>While vein cuffs or pre-cuffed grafts are widely utilised below the knee, this practice is based on case-series data. This would be a useful topic to study in future trials, since vein is not always available and the results of randomised studies of this technique are conflicting.</P><P>The effects of antiplatelets or anticoagulants on graft patency also need to be investigated further in the context of randomised controlled trials. This would facilitate graft-type trial medication protocols and remove a major potential source of bias from future studies.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2017-12-15 08:13:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>We are grateful to Drs Cathryn Broderick, Marlene Stewart and Karen Welch for their invaluable help and assistance in the preparation of this review.</P></ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS><CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST MODIFIED="2018-02-09 09:40:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>GA: has declared that he previously held a National Institute for Health Research Academic clinical fellowship (2011-2014) and that he received funds for a grant from Heath and Care Research Wales regarding research for patient and public benefit (grant number 1198); there are no known conflicts of interest with this review.</P><P>CT: has declared that he received money from Cook Medical for travel/accommodation/meeting expenses unrelated to this review and that he received funds for a grant from Heath and Care Research Wales regarding research for patient and public benefit (grant number 1198); there are no known conflicts of interest with this review.<BR/></P></CONFLICT_OF_INTEREST><CONTRIBUTIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:10:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>GA: identified relevant trials, assessed quality for all included trials, extracted data and updated the text of review.</P><P>CT: identified relevant trials, assessed quality, extracted data, wrote text of previous version of review, and reviewed updated text.<BR/></P></CONTRIBUTIONS><PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2018-02-06 14:11:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>For this update, the risk of bias in all included studies was assessed using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool and a 'Summary of findings' table has been added.</P><P>We reworded the objective so to adhere better to the Cochane guidelines.</P><P>We amended the 'types of studies' to include all possible graft types.</P><P>We provided definitions of the outcomes primary and secondary patency.</P><P>We analysed and presented data into groups according to whether the distal anastomosis was above or below the knee.</P></PRO_REV_DIFF><PUBLIC_NOTES/></MAIN_TEXT><STUDIES_AND_REFERENCES MODIFIED="2018-02-09 10:06:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart">
