<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of inhaled corticosteroids in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Repeated chest infections in people with cystic fibrosis cause inflammation and damage to the lungs which, in the long term, is the most common reason for death in people with cystic fibrosis. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat inflammation, but may cause some side effects. Some of these side effects are less serious, for example oral thrush, but others are more serious, such as reduced growth rate in childhood. This is an update of an earlier review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The last search for evidence was on 15 August 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>In this updated review, 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 506 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 6 and 55 years. Three trials were in children only, four in adults only and four were mixed ages; two trials did not describe the ages of the volunteers. The lung function and severity of disease of the volunteers varied across trials and only two trials gave information about their genetic mutations. All trials took place in Europe. In 10 of the trials, all volunteers were in the same group up to the end of the trial (either a treatment group or a group receiving no treatment or a placebo (treatment that appeared the same as the steroids, but did not have any active medicine in it)), but in three trials they swapped groups halfway through the trial. In most of the trials volunteers started taking steroids or placebo at the start of the trial, but one trial was a withdrawal trial, where all volunteers were already taking steroids and half of them carried on and the rest took a placebo, in effect stopping the treatment. The trials lasted between three weeks and two years.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The clinical trials have not been able to prove that inhaled corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. One trial has shown that these drugs can slow down children's growth when used in high doses. Furthermore it has been shown that under close supervision of the cystic fibrosis team, it may be safe for people who have been taking inhaled corticosteroids for some time to stop doing so.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>A lack of information meant we were often not able to judge if the way the trials were designed or run could have affected our confidence in the results. Only two trials gave details of how they made sure volunteers had equal chances of being in the treatment or placebo groups and only five supplied information on how they made sure the people recruiting volunteers didn't know which groups they would be going into. In most cases, we didn't think that once the trials started the volunteers or their doctors knew whether they were getting steroids or placebo. However, we did have some concerns that five of the trials had not been published in journals, that would send the reports to experts to check for accuracy and we were not sure how this might affect our confidence in the results.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2016-08-22 14:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-22 14:23:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Reduction of lung inflammation is one of the goals of cystic fibrosis therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are often used to treat children and adults with cystic fibrosis. The rationale for this is their potential to reduce lung damage arising from inflammation, as well as their effect on symptomatic wheezing. It is important to establish the current level of evidence for the risks and benefits of inhaled corticosteroids, especially in the light of their known adverse effects on growth. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:10:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To assess the effectiveness of taking regular inhaled corticosteroids, compared to not taking them, in children and adults with cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-22 14:23:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We requested information from pharmaceutical companies manufacturing inhaled corticosteroids and authors of identified trials.</P>
<P>Date of most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 15 August 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:11:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised trials, published and unpublished, comparing inhaled corticosteroids to placebo or standard treatment in individuals with cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:18:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two independent authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro formas.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:18:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The searches identified 34 citations, of which 26 (representing 13 trials) were eligible for inclusion. These 13 trials reported the use of inhaled corticosteroids in 506 people with cystic fibrosis aged between six and 55 years. One was a withdrawal trial in individuals who were already taking inhaled corticosteroids. Methodological quality and risk of bias were difficult to assess from published information. Many of the risk of bias judgements were unclear due to a lack of available information. Only two trials specified how participants were randomised and less than half of the included trials gave details on how allocation was concealed. Trials were generally judged to have a low risk of bias from blinding, except for two which were open label or did not use a placebo. There were some concerns that a number of trials had not been published in peer-reviewed journals, but the risk of bias from this was unclear. Inclusion criteria varied between trials, as did type and duration of treatment and timing of outcome assessments. Objective measures of airway function were reported in most trials but were often incomplete. Significant benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated. Four trials systematically documented adverse effects and growth was significantly affected in one study using high doses.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:12:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Evidence from these trials is insufficient to establish whether inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in cystic fibrosis, but withdrawal in those already taking them has been shown to be safe. There is some evidence they may cause harm in terms of growth. It has not been established whether long-term use is beneficial in reducing lung inflammation, which should improve survival, but it is unlikely this will be proven conclusively in a randomised controlled trial.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-08-22 14:29:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-11 10:08:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disorder, of autosomal recessive inheritance, which principally affects the respiratory tract, pancreas, gastro-intestinal tract and liver. In the respiratory tract, abnormalities result in mucus plugging of the airways and susceptibility to respiratory tract infection. This leads to neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation with consequent lung damage (bronchiectasis), and eventually respiratory failure and death. Inflammation is also important in the development of the bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) and airway instability that may be associated with CF. Up to half of people with CF have measurable BHR, which seems unrelated to atopic status (<LINK REF="REF-Burdon-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burdon 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1980</LINK>). Although prognosis and survival continue to improve, it is the lung damage which is the single most important factor responsible for premature death. Lung damage also has implications for quality of life, and slowing of the rate of progression of lung disease is an important goal in the management of CF. The search for a suitable anti-inflammatory strategy has gone on for over two decades, but unfortunately there is still no ideal agent available (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 2007</LINK>). Lung inflammation may commence very early in life (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1995</LINK>), and may be present even in those without clinical manifestations of lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1995</LINK>) or positive bacterial culture (<LINK REF="REF-Balough-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balough 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1994</LINK>). Although a normal inflammatory response is beneficial to host defence mechanisms, the exaggerated response seen in CF contributes to the morbidity and ultimately the mortality associated with the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hilliard-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilliard 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-07 12:42:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Corticosteroids (glucocorticoids) are potent non-specific anti-inflammatory agents which have been widely used in a variety of inflammatory disorders. They can be administered topically or systemically, but this review is concerned only with corticosteroids given by the inhaled route.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 12:55:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>In asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce BHR and airway inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Booth-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Booth 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Djukanovic-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Djukanovic 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Grunsven-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Grunsven 1999</LINK>) and lead to modest improvements in airway function (<LINK REF="REF-Calpin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calpin 1997</LINK>). Although beneficial effects on pulmonary function, but not BHR, have been reported in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Renkema-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renkema 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weir-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1993</LINK>), there is proven benefit only in certain aspects of COPD management (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, a COPD biopsy study showed that three months of inhaled fluticasone did not reduce the neutrophilic inflammation, despite improvement in symptoms and exacerbation rate (<LINK REF="REF-Hattotuwa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hattotuwa 2002</LINK>).The rationale for their use in CF lies in observations that inflammation occurs early in the course of CF and may contribute to lung damage. The Cochrane Review of evidence for the effectiveness of oral corticosteroids in CF concluded that treatment with a prednisolone equivalent dose of 2 mg/kg on alternate days appeared to slow the progression of lung disease but was associated with a high risk of important side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are associated with a wide range of potential adverse effects, all of which tend to be more severe with oral or other systemic preparations (<LINK REF="REF-ABPI-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">ABPI 1999</LINK>). Oral administration over prolonged periods may lead to a Cushingoid appearance with redistribution of fat to the central areas of the body, obesity, muscle wasting, acne, bruising, thinning of the skin and skin striae. High doses can also precipitate or exacerbate impaired glucose metabolism. Prolonged use is associated with reduced bone mineral density and posterior subcapsular cataracts. In children, one of the most important side effects is growth suppression. There are also concerns that substantial inhibition of inflammation could impair innate immunity and make the patient more susceptible to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Koehler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koehler 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Inhaled preparations of corticosteroids have been developed to maximise effective treatment of lung inflammation and reduce the frequency of harmful effects, but these have not been completely eliminated (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2004</LINK>). Systemic adverse effects occur with all ICS, although to a lesser degree than seen with oral preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1999</LINK>). These appear to be related to both dose and duration of treatment. In one meta-analysis, an increased risk of adrenal suppression and bone thinning was found at daily doses above 1.5 mg (budesonide equivalent) per day (which equates to above 0.75 mg per day for fluticasone) (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1999</LINK>). Over the last decade there has been increasing concern about the potential effects of ICS on adrenal function, with several case series reporting symptomatic adrenal suppression including hypoglycaemia, coma and even death in asthmatic adults and children taking high (and less often standard) dose ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Drake-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drake 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macdessi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macdessi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 2002</LINK>). More recently, there has been a population-based case controlled study suggesting an association of high doses for long duration may be associated with cataracts in those over 40 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Smeeth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smeeth 2003</LINK>). Other less severe adverse effects include hoarseness of voice and oral candidiasis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-08-22 14:29:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In 1994, in the UK, 34% of adults with CF surveyed reported that they took inhaled steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 1995</LINK>) and this had risen to 51% in a subsequent survey conducted in 2000 (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2001</LINK>). National databases showed there to have been an increase in prescribing and use both in Europe and the USA. In 1994 and 1995 (snapshot data), databases of annual review returns recorded the ICS use as 36% in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1997</LINK>), and 26% in North America (1995 snapshot data) (<LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1999</LINK>). Clinicians at CF centres treating children reported prescribing them to a median of 44% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 1999</LINK>). Data from 2001 entries showed that in the UK (CF Trust Database) 52% children and 55% adults were prescribed ICS, whilst in the USA they were given to 41% children and 48% adults (Epidemiologic Study of CF). Whilst more recent data from UK CF Trust Registry shows that in 2007, 21% children under 16 years and 23% adults were prescribed regular ICS; and North American data from the CFF registry showed that in 2005, 46% patients received ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of ICS may be justified as a form of symptomatic prophylaxis for those with recurrent wheezing or CF asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Balfour_x002d_Lynn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balfour-Lynn 2002</LINK>), but they are also prescribed by many clinicians purely for their perceived benefit as an anti-inflammatory agent. It is therefore important to establish whether this practice is beneficial overall for patients with CF or whether their potential for harm overrides any benefit.</P>

<P>Relevant studies were identified from the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register using the terms: anti-inflammatory AND steroid AND (inhaled or unknown).</P>
<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>), weekly searches of MEDLINE, a search of Embase to 1995 and the prospective handsearching of two journals - <I>Pediatric Pulmonology </I>and the <I>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</I>. Unpublished work is identified by searching the abstract books of three major CF conferences: the International Cystic Fibrosis Conference; the European Cystic Fibrosis Conference and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference. For full details of all searching activities for the register, please see the relevant sections of the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/CF/frame.html">Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Module</A>.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-09-08 16:19:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To ensure consistency, each author independently extracted data using a standard data extraction form. The outcome measures listed above were assessed in the short term (between 2 and 12 weeks), the medium term (between 3 and 12 months) and long term (over 12 months).</P>
<P>The WISE trial is a withdrawal study and all participants had been on steroids for a number of years before these were withdrawn. The other studies present data from the start of treatment with steroids. The review authors decided that the data from the withdrawal study should be presented on a different graph to the data from the other studies since the populations in the placebo arms of the studies are heterogeneous and that there may possibly be carry over effect which will tend to reduce the difference. </P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-05 14:14:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>We used the criteria for assessing risk of bias as provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We asked if the six domains listed below were considered to be adequate.There were three possible responses, 'yes', 'no' or 'unclear'. &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicated a low risk of bias, and &#8216;no&#8217; indicated high risk of bias. If insufficient detail was reported the judgement was &#8216;unclear&#8217; risk of bias. We assessed the new studies included in the updated review and we reassessed the studies already included in the old review using the new criteria.<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sequence generation</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if the allocation sequence was generated using techniques such as a random number table; a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice.</P>
<P>'No', if the allocation sequence was generated using techniques such as odd or even date of birth; date (or day) of admission;  hospital or clinic record number.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if the allocation concealment used methods such as central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomization); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
<P>'No', if the participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on; using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;. This was usually the case if the method of concealment was not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement for example if the use of assignment envelopes was described, but it remained unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if there was no blinding, but the review authors judged that the outcome and the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; blinding of participants and key study personnel was ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others unlikely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>'No', if there was no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding;  blinding of key study participants and personnel was attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken; either participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, and the non-blinding of others was likely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217; or the study did not address this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete data assessment</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if there were no missing outcome data; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to true outcome; missing outcome data was balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes was not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; missing data were imputed using appropriate methods.</P>
<P>'No', if reason for missing outcome data were likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk was enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes was enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size;  &#8216;As-treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization; potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was insufficient reporting of attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217; (e.g. number randomized were not stated, no reasons for missing data were provided); the study did not address this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective outcome reporting</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if the study protocol was available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that were of interest in the review were reported in the pre-specified way; the study protocol was not available but it was clear that the published reports included all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified.</P>
<P>'No', if not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes were reported; one or more primary outcomes was reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. sub scales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting was provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review were reported incompletely so that they could not be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was insufficient information to permit judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217;.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>'Yes', if the study appeared to be free of other sources of bias.</P>
<P>'No', if there was at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or stopped early due to some data-dependent process (including a formal-stopping rule); or had extreme baseline imbalance; or has been claimed to have been fraudulent; or had some other problem.</P>
<P>'Unclear', if there was either: insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias existed; or insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem would introduce bias.</P>

Following communication with the authors of the Canadian trial, data on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> have been provided (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>). Two cross-over trials reported FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>). The Dutch trial reported mean absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC but without the standard deviations (SDs) for each treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>). The 1997 UK trial reported the mean per cent predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>). In further communication with the author of the latter trial, data (SDs) have been provided for FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC and have been updated in the relevant graphs. In the Swiss trial, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC were reported as mean change in per cent predicted but without SDs (<LINK REF="STD-Swiss-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss Trial 1996</LINK>). In the 1983 Danish trial, the median and range at baseline and after treatment were reported for these lung function data (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1983</LINK>). In the 1996 UK trial, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC were reported as absolute means and SDs at baseline, 6 months and 24 months (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>); and in the 1997 Danish trial, as absolute change from baseline but without SDs at three and six months (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>); whereas, in the German trial they were reported as mean per cent predicted and SD at baseline and after 21 days treatment (<LINK REF="STD-German-Trial-1999" TYPE="STUDY">German Trial 1999</LINK>). The CF-WISE trial reported mean % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC at baseline, two, four and six months and mean % change in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and FVC at the same time points. In the de Boeck trial, mean % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> were reported at baseline, 6 and 12 months pre- and 20 minutes post-salbutamol (bronchodilator) as a measure of bronchial lability (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>). Mean change in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> post-salbutamol and % predicted FVC were also reported.</P>
<P>Bronchial reactivity was assessed in four trials: by histamine challenge alone (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>); histamine challenge or exercise test (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>); or by methacholine challenge (<LINK REF="STD-Irish-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irish Trial 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Turkish-Trial-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Turkish Trial 2008</LINK>). In the Dutch cross-over trial, results were expressed as mean log PC20 and as geometric mean PC20 at baseline and after budesonide, but no data were reported for the placebo treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>). In the 1997 Danish trial, data were expressed as mean change in histamine dose steps from baseline within each group, but without SDs, and as mean difference in mean change in histamine dose steps with 95% CI between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>).

<P>Hospital admissions and antibiotic usage were specified as outcomes in the Dutch trial, but no data were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>). Overall antibiotic usage was reported in the 1996 UK trial, but not by treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>). Data regarding patient days in hospital and patient days on antibiotics were provided for the previous update by the Canadian investigators (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>). In the CF-WISE withdrawal trial, the primary outcome reported was the time to first respiratory exacerbation. Secondary outcomes reported were the number of participants who had unplanned courses of oral or intravenous antibiotics and the median number of courses required per participant. The number of individuals requiring rescue bronchodilator and the median number of doses per participant were also reported (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). The de Boeck trial reported the mean number of respiratory exacerbations between groups and reported Brasfield chest X-ray scores (median and quartiles) at baseline, six and twelve months (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>).</P>

In the CF-WISE withdrawal trial, height was measured at the start and end of the trial in the paediatric participants (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). The review authors were provided with these data.

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For the 2008 update, in order to establish a risk of bias for the included trials, two authors (KW, IBL) independently assessed methodological quality using criteria suggested by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Concealment of allocation and method used to generate the random sequence were assigned to one of three categories: adequate, unclear or inadequate which related to a low, unclear or high risk of bias respectively. The reported intention-to-treat analysis was defined as complete, when less than 15% of participants were excluded, or incomplete when more than 15% were excluded from the final analysis, where the risk of bias increased as the number of participants excluded from the final analysis increased. Reporting of double blinding was recorded as either present or absent; the absence of blinding was considered to lead to a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>Minor differences between the two authors in determining adequacy of random sequence generation in one trial and concealment of allocation in two trials were resolved by discussion, as were differences in assessing the completeness of intention-to-treat analysis in two trials. Assessments were otherwise concordant. For a previous update, authors were contacted and asked to clarify methodological issues, including randomisation method and steps undertaken to ensure concealment of allocation. Account has been taken of relevant information received.</P>
<ALLOCATION MODIFIED="2014-10-06 09:32:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The method used to generate the random sequence was clearly mentioned in three trials, which we judged to have a low risk of bias: the German trial, which used a random number row to determine the intervention for the first participant, and then used alternation to determine the groups for the remaining participants (<LINK REF="STD-German-Trial-1999" TYPE="STUDY">German Trial 1999</LINK>); the CF WISE trial, which used randomisation by permuted blocks of four (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>); and the Belgian trial, which used random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>). The method of randomisation in the other trials is unclear and not stated in the trial reports. These other trials therefore have an unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>Concealment of allocation was deemed to be adequate in six trials, which therefore had a low risk of bias: in one trial it was stated that treatment codes were not broken before clean file was declared by the data manager (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>); in the Dutch trial treatment and placebo were given by blinded metered dose inhalers supplied by pharmaceutical company (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>); and in the CF WISE trial allocation was carried out independently over the telephone from the Clinical Trials &amp; Evaluation Unit of Royal Brompton Hospital to the trial centre (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). Trialists supplied information from three trials where sealed envelopes were used, therefore the risk of bias in these trials was low (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irish-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Irish Trial 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>). Concealment of allocation was deemed to be inadequate in the German trial which used a method of alternation allowing the trial investigators to foresee to which group the next participant would be assigned; this trial was judged to have a risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-German-Trial-1999" TYPE="STUDY">German Trial 1999</LINK>).

As stated above, data from the CF WISE trial are presented, but results from this trial were not pooled with other trials because the trial was a withdrawal trial (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). There were also differences between trials in the outcomes reported, so that for some variables, only a single trial result could be reported. The results are presented by outcome in the order in which they appear in the aims of the review. Within each outcome, data are discussed separately for parallel and cross-over trials but sequenced by short-, medium- and long-term outcomes as specified in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>)</HEADING>
<P>Four trials reported data for absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>). Analyses of absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> based on all participants randomised were reported for the 1997 Danish trial, but as no SDs were reported or have been provided subsequently, these data cannot be included in the <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK> section (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>). After the first three-month treatment period in this trial, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> fell by a mean of 32 ml in the budesonide group (n = 30) compared with 187 ml in the placebo group (n = 25). The between group difference in change from baseline was reported by the authors as not significant (P = 0.08). When both three-month treatment periods were examined together, representing six months of treatment, absolute change in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> after six months of treatment was 2 ml for the budesonide and -98 ml for the placebo group, reported by the authors as not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.1) (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Dutch cross-over trial, mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> was reported as similar at the end of both six-week treatment periods, being 2.3 L after budesonide and 2.2 L after placebo. These data were based on 12 of the original 16 participants randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>).

<P>In the 1996 UK trial, after six months of fluticasone or placebo, mean absolute FEV<SUB>1</SUB> tended to be higher in the treatment (n = 18) than in the placebo group (n = 15), but this was not statistically significant, mean difference (MD) 0.16 L (95% CI -0.27 to 0.59) (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>). Three participants in the placebo group were not included in this analysis (less than 15% exclusions). After 24 months of treatment, no significant differences between groups were observed but this analysis was based on less than half (n = 17) of the 36 participants originally randomised, MD 0.24 L (95% CI -0.34 to 0.82). The authors were contacted but were unable to provide further data for this trial (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 1997 UK cross-over trial, mean % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (SD) was similar at the end of both six-week treatment periods, being 66% (16.7) after fluticasone and 67% (23.0) after placebo, with 95% CI for the difference reported as -8% to 4% (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>).

<P>Changes in % predicted FEV<SUB> 1 </SUB>at different time points were recorded in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swiss-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss Trial 1996</LINK>). In the Belgian trial data were reported after six and 12 months pre- and post-salbutamol bronchodilator (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>). No significant difference was found in the percent predicted FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>between those in the treatment (n = 12) and placebo (n = 15) groups: pre salbutamol at six months, MD 4.00% (95% CI -7.08% to 15.08%); post salbutamol at six months, MD -2.00% (95% CI -11.79% to 7.79%); pre salbutamol at 12 months, MD 2.00% (95% CI -12.12% to 16.12%); post salbutamol at 12 months, MD -1.00% (95% CI -12.42% to 10.42%) (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>). In the CF WISE trial no significant difference was found after six months between those participants who continued treatment (n = 84) and those who were withdrawn (n = 87), MD 3.00% (95% CI -2.55% to 8.55%) (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). Additionally, in this trial, no change in lung function was found in the fluticasone group in those switching from a different ICS (budesonide or beclomethasone) to fluticasone (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). In the Swiss trial, where treatment was given for 30 days as an inpatient and assessed at 30 days, there was an improvement in % predicted FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in those given (n = 25) and not given (n = 24) beclomethasone and the between group difference in this improvement was reported by the authors as not statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Swiss-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss Trial 1996</LINK>). From the data reported, the MD at discharge was 3.60% (95% CI -5.13% to 12.33%) (<LINK REF="STD-Swiss-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swiss Trial 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following communication with the authors of the Canadian trial, data have been provided which showed no significant difference at baseline in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>(<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>).

In the 1983 Danish trial, median (range) % predicted FVC was 91% (51% to 112%) and 78% (46% to 116%) after 16 weeks of treatment in the beclomethasone and placebo groups respectively, using data from 13 of the originally randomised 24 matched pairs (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1983</LINK>). This trial was based on randomisation within matched pairs, but this was not reflected in the analyses which compared group means rather than within-pair differences (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1983</LINK>). In the 1997 Danish trial, FVC data were not reported but the authors noted that these followed the same pattern as FEV<SUB>1</SUB> after three months and six months of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>). In the Dutch cross-over trial, absolute mean FVC was similar after both six-week treatment periods (3.6 L on budesonide and 3.3 L on placebo) (<LINK REF="STD-Dutch-Trial-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch Trial 1995</LINK>). In the 1996 UK trial, FVC was recorded but not reported (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1996" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1996</LINK>). In the 1997 UK cross-over trial, mean (SD) FVC was 78.4% predicted (12.6) for the active treatment period and 77.4% (21.9) for the placebo treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>).

<P>In the 1997 Danish trial, overall there were 17 adverse events in the budesonide compared with 13 in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Danish-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Danish Trial 1997</LINK>). It is unclear whether the numbers reported relate to individuals or individual episodes, although from the data presented it would appear that these are episodes. The budesonide group attended more frequently for outpatient visits than the placebo group (174 and 146 respectively). Hoarseness of voice and monilia (oral thrush) were reported more often in the budesonide group (six and three occasions and four and two occasions respectively), as were haemoptysis, pharyngitis and chest pain (two, three, one respectively in budesonide group compared with no reports in placebo group). Before and at the end of the trial, 15 participants were subjected to an adrenal function test (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test). One participant in each group had an abnormal response, which was found before the trial but in both cases the response had normalized by the end of the trial. It was reported that the response to ACTH did not differ between groups before or after treatment.</P>
<P>In the 1997 UK trial, two potentially drug-related adverse episodes were reported. One child in the fluticasone group developed peeling of the fingers for three days (in reality it is unlikely this relates to ICS), and another coughed for five minutes on one occasion after inhaling fluticasone (given as dry powder) (<LINK REF="STD-UK-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">UK Trial 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Canadian trial was halted prematurely because it was noted that six out of the 17 participants enrolled had become colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> for the first time (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>). When the code was broken, five of the six participants enrolled were from the active treatment group (n = 9) and one from the placebo group (n = 8). In addition one participant from the active group, previously negative for both <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>and <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>, grew <I>Burkholderia cepacia </I>for the first time. Subsequently, the authors identified 56 out of 133 participants attending this clinic who were being treated with inhaled steroids, of whom nine had become culture-positive for <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>between three months and three years after starting this treatment.</P>
<P>In the CF WISE trial (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>) adverse effects were classified as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>CF pulmonary symptoms - 118 fluticasone, 132 placebo;</LI>

<P>In the paper it was reported that fewer participants in the fluticasone group withdrew from the trial due to lung-related adverse events (9% compared to 15%) with a relative risk (RR) of 0.59 (95% CI 0.12 to 1.48). There was one drug-related case of oral candidiasis in a participant taking fluticasone.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological issues</HEADING>
<P>The effectiveness of long-term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is of clinical relevance in view of its widespread use in clinical practice in Europe and North America. However, the findings of this review suggest that evidence to support this practice is still lacking. The review identified 13 trials reporting the use of inhaled steroids in 506 people with CF aged between six years and 55 years. The methodological quality of the earlier trials was difficult to assess from published information, specifically with respect to concealment of allocation and the method used to generate random sequence. Although further information on this has been provided from some investigators, concealment of allocation (a key feature of trial validity) remains inadequate or unclear for most of the earlier trials.</P>
<P>Trials were heterogeneous with respect to inclusion criteria, specifically age, severity of pulmonary involvement, clinical diagnosis of asthma and chronic lung infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. Trials also differed in duration of treatment. Treatment effects were assessed for short periods only in the cross-over trials (six weeks) but for longer periods in the parallel trials. Only one parallel trial reported treatment given over a two-year period, but follow up and reporting at this interval are incomplete. Spirometric indices of lung function were measured in most trials, but could not be combined in this review due to incompletely reported or unavailable data, as well as to differences in methods used to summarise data. Although five of the nine investigators contacted following the first issue of this review have supplied further information, a pooled estimate of treatment effects for lung function outcomes has not proved possible. This is either because data are no longer available or because data related to widely different stages of follow up.</P>
<P>Inflammatory markers have been reported as outcomes in a significant proportion of the trials identified, although these were not specified as prior outcomes for this review. The relevance of changes in inflammatory markers to long-term clinical status is uncertain, but it is likely that the reduction of inflammation would be of long-term benefit. In a small uncontrolled study (hence not eligible for inclusion in this systematic review) in children under 13 years, there was a decrease in neutrophil concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage after two months of therapy with beclomethasone dipropionate, although there was no change in IL-8 concentration (<LINK REF="REF-Wojtczak-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wojtczak 2001</LINK>). In contrast, other important outcomes, such as nutritional status and quality of life, were almost never reported. Long-term survival was not reported in any trial; but, given the increasing survival from this condition (especially in childhood), it is unlikely to be an appropriate outcome measure. Symptoms were measured in three trials and in one trial a small, but statistically significant, improvement of uncertain clinical relevance was noted in scores for dyspnoea at rest and cough. The Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) is a multicentre longitudinal observational study of people with CF in the USA and Canada which has enrolled over 18,000 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1999</LINK>). A follow-up study looked at therapies used in the centres that reported better lung function results for their clinics (<LINK REF="REF-Padman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padman 2007</LINK>). No differences were found for use of ICS between the 12 centres whose median clinic lung function was in the upper (n = 755 children) versus the 12 centres in the lower quartile (n = 743 children).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects were not consistently assessed, although in most trials total daily dose of ICS was at the threshold identified in a systematic review as being associated with adrenal suppression (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1999</LINK>). Hoarseness of voice and oral candida were reported to be increased in those taking ICS in one trial, but this observation requires confirmation. An important concern relates to the risk of acquisition of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection in those treated with corticosteroids. Although one trial was halted prematurely out of this concern, the data available are not conclusive (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-Trial-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian Trial 1997</LINK>). However, a retrospective study of 83 participants under 10 years of age, found no significant effect of the use of ICS on the risk of early <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> acquisition, including those on higher doses (<LINK REF="REF-Minicucci-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minicucci 2003</LINK>). Growth in childhood is always a concern with long-term corticosteroid use, and this includes inhaled corticosteroids. The Belgian trial has shown that one year of high-dose fluticasone adversely affected growth which did not catch up in the subsequent year (and in a subgroup followed for two years) (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>). However, the large difference in growth could have been due in part to the age difference between groups, 9.0 years for the placebo group and 8.2 years for the fluticasone group which might lead to a greater effect of pubertal growth over 24 months in the older (placebo) group. This was the first trial to look at growth over a reasonably long period and has provided important evidence that ICS can do harm in children with CF. Finally, there have been reports of children and adults with CF who developed adrenal insufficiency and sometimes Cushing&#8217;s syndrome whilst taking ICS (400 to 1200 mcg/day) together with itraconazole for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, due to cytochrome P450 inhibition (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skov-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skov 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">ICS withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The CF WISE trial is the largest trial of ICS in children and adults with CF (<LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). This trial showed that during the first six months after stopping ICS therapy, there was no apparent impact (adverse or beneficial), on the onset of acute chest exacerbations, decline in lung function, antibiotic prescribing and rescue bronchodilator use. Replacing the ICS with placebo was found to be safe as there was no significant increase in lung-related adverse effects leading to withdrawal from the trial, nor an increased need for oral corticosteroids. Many individuals with CF who are on ICS may no longer need them, but caution is advised due to the non-significant increase in lung-related adverse effects seen in the placebo group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why no benefit?</HEADING>
<P>The lack of proven benefit of ICS may be due to the failure of clinical trials to provide the evidence for a benefit that does exist. The published trials of ICS have a number of flaws, which include small participant numbers, short treatment periods, inadequate drug dosages, and in one case lack of a placebo group. The alternative view is that benefit has not been proven because there is no benefit. Delivering inhaled drugs in sufficient quantities to the airways which are blocked by viscous mucus may be a factor. Poor inhaler technique, especially in children, can also be a problem. More relevant may be the nature of the airway inflammation in CF. It is predominantly neutrophilic and in other airway conditions where neutrophils predominate, for example severe asthma and acute bronchiolitis, corticosteroids are also not particularly effective (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 2004</LINK>). Although there is proven benefit in certain aspects of COPD management (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>), a biopsy study showed that three months of fluticasone did not reduce the neutrophilic inflammation, despite improvement in symptoms and exacerbation rate (<LINK REF="REF-Hattotuwa-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hattotuwa 2002</LINK>). Budesonide and fluticasone, and to a lesser extent beclomethasone, have been shown to prolong neutrophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis, so it might be that ICS are even promoting inflammation in CF airways (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>Previous versions of this review have concluded that "evidence from these trials is insufficient to establish if inhaled corticosteroids have a beneficial or harmful effect in people with CF". The pendulum of risk/benefit has slowly swung towards risk with the publication of the Belgian Trial and away from benefit with the CF WISE 2006 (<LINK REF="STD-Belgian-Trial-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Belgian Trial 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CF-WISE-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CF WISE 2006</LINK>). What is still not proven though is whether ICS can significantly reduce lung inflammation when given long term. This is important since if ICS slowed progression of CF lung disease, treatment should lead to improved morbidity and mortality. However, the downstream effects, i.e. lung function and symptoms, have not been shown to improve with ICS. Given constraints over large RCTs in CF (relatively small population of potential participants, difficulties with meaningful outcome measures, financial limitations) and the fact that use of ICS is not high in research priorities, it is doubtful that such a trial will ever take place. For now, ICS should be used for symptomatic relief of recurrent wheezing that is not responsive to bronchodilators alone. Furthermore, the prescribing practice for an individual with CF should become more like that for an asthmatic. Justification is needed to start ICS, reassessment is necessary to see whether they are having an effect (particularly on any tight cough or wheeze), and consideration is always given to reducing the dose or stopping the drugs altogether. It is likely though that the majority of people with CF taking ICS no longer need to do so. This view has been reflected in the North American consensus document that states "...for patients with CF, 6 years and older, and without asthma or ABPA, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends against the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids to improve lung function and to reduce exacerbations" (<LINK REF="REF-Flume-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flume 2007</LINK>). A similar view has been expressed at a European CF Society consensus meeting held in April 2008, the resulting document of which is in preparation.</P>

<P>This review has found little evidence from existing trials to support the practice of routinely prescribing inhaled steroids in CF. Specifically, we cannot conclude that inhaled steroids are beneficial but there is some evidence that at a high dose, they adversely effect growth. There is also some evidence that withdrawal of ICS in the majority of those already being treated with them is safe. We recommend that the use of ICS should be restricted to those with symptomatic wheezing and in whom benefit has been proven. Individuals should be regularly reassessed to see whether ICS are having an effect and consideration should always be given to reducing the dose or stopping the drugs altogether.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-11 13:35:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The principle unanswered question is whether long-term ICS can reduce the exuberant lung inflammation so common in people with CF, and whether they can slow the rate of decline in lung function and improve survival. Unfortunately it is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial with sufficient power and length of follow-up will be conducted, given research priorities in CF and the difficulties of measuring lung inflammation. </P>
