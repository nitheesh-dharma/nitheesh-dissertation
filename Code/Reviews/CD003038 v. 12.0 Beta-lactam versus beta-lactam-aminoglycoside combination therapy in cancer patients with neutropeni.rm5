<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-04-24 08:51:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews">
<P>Cancer chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation disrupts the immune system, exposing patients to severe infection. The major sign of infection is fever, and the hallmark of damaged immune defences is a decreased white blood cell count. Patients have usually been treated with a combination of two different classes of antibiotics. Evidence shows that treatment with a new single drug (monotherapy), belonging to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, is associated with better outcomes. Survival is improved when single-drug therapy is used, and side effects, mainly damage to the kidneys, are more frequent with combination therapy.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-04-24 08:19:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data concerning all cause mortality, infection related mortality, treatment failure (including treatment modifications), super-infections, adverse effects and study quality measures were extracted independently by two review authors. Risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Outcomes were extracted by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis whenever possible. Individual domains of risk of bias were examined through sensitivity analyses. Published data were complemented by correspondence with authors.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-05-13 14:11:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventy-one trials published between 1983 and 2012 were included. All cause mortality was lower with monotherapy (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, without statistical significance). Results were similar for trials comparing the same beta-lactam in both trial arms (11 trials, 1718 episodes; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.06) and for trials comparing different beta-lactams&#65293;usually a broad-spectrum beta-lactam compared with a narrower-spectrum beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside (33 trials, 5468 episodes; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09). Infection related mortality was significantly lower with monotherapy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99). Treatment failure was significantly more frequent with monotherapy in trials comparing the same beta-lactam (16 trials, 2833 episodes; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20), and was significantly more frequent with combination therapy in trials comparing different beta-lactams (55 trials, 7736 episodes; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97). Bacterial super-infections occurred with equal frequency, and fungal super-infections were more common with combination therapy. Adverse events were more frequent with combination therapy (numbers needed to harm 4; 95% CI 4 to 5). Specifically, the difference with regard to nephrotoxicity was highly significant. Adequate trial methods were associated with a larger effect estimate for mortality and smaller effect estimates for failure. Nearly all trials were open-label. No correlation was noted between mortality and failure rates and these trials.</P>

<P>Beta-lactam monotherapy is advantageous compared with beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy with regard to survival, adverse events and fungal super-infections.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-13 14:01:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cancer patients are prone to infection. Low blood cell count (neutropenia) and disruption of normal barriers to infection, such as skin and mucous membranes, are caused by chemotherapy or underlying malignancy. Both disrupt the normal immune response and predispose patients to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1966</LINK>). Pathogens implicated in these infections are Gram-negative bacteria, including <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>). The considerable morbidity and mortality associated with these infections in neutropenic patients led to the routine use of empirical antibiotic treatment, which is given upon suspicion of infection (e.g. fever), before the causative pathogen/s or their susceptibilities are identified (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>Initial effective empirical treatment for patients with fever and neutropenia consisted of combinations of antibiotics, including double beta-lactam regimens and, more recently, aminoglycoside-beta-lactam combinations (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1971</LINK>). In the 1980s, third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems having bactericidal activity against Enterobacteriaceae, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>and many Gram-positive organisms became available, making monotherapy a reasonable alternative to combination therapy. Neither combination therapy nor monotherapy provides full coverage for the spectrum of infections encountered among neutropenic patients. Notably, resistant Gram-positive bacteria and fungi are left untreated. Nevertheless, current guidelines recommend beta-lactam monotherapy in clinically stable patients (<LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>An evident advantage of combination therapy over monotherapy is the higher probability that the infecting pathogen will be covered by at least one of the components of the regimen. Furthermore, the interaction between two antibiotics may be synergistic, resulting in enhanced bacterial kill activity compared with the additive activities of the antibiotics when assessed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Giamarellou-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giamarellou 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giamarellou-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giamarellou 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 1982</LINK>). Finally, use of combination therapy has been claimed to suppress the emergence of resistant subpopulations of bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Allan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milatovic-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milatovic 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wade-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wade 1989</LINK>). On the other hand, benefits of monotherapy may include a lower probability of adverse effects and narrower-spectrum treatment, possibly reducing the chance of developing a super-infection with resistant bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Weistein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weistein 1985</LINK>). Adverse effects may be related to administration of aminoglycosides per se (e.g. nephrotoxicity) or to interactions between antibiotic and underlying disease and/or other drugs. Neutropaenic participants not responding to the initial antibiotic regimen will be given modified treatment, which usually includes vancomycin to cover resistant Gram-positive bacteria and/or amphotericin-based preparations or azoles to treat fungal infection (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>), thus increasing the chance for adverse events and drug interactions.</P>
<P>Although neutropenia itself is the single most important risk factor for infection, other factors can alter the risk. The probability and severity of infection are inversely proportional to the absolute neutrophil count, and patients with neutrophil counts below 100/mm³ are at highest risk for severe infection (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1986</LINK>). Underlying malignancy may affect outcome. Patients with acute leukaemia and other haematological malignancies have a worse prognosis than solid tumour patients (<LINK REF="STD-Rolston-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rolston 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rossini-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Talcott-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talcott 1992</LINK>). The severity and nature of the infection (e.g. bacteraemia, Gram-positive and <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infections, resistant organisms) as well as the patient's age may underlie heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Elting-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elting 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rolston-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Rolston 1992</LINK>). More recent guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia have emphasized the importance of risk stratification, both for deciding on the setting of therapy (out-patient versus hospitalisation) and for choosing among empirical antibiotics (monotherapy versus combination therapy) (<LINK REF="REF-Freifeld-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freifeld 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Tam-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tam 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>We undertook this systematic review to assess the evidence for combination therapy versus monotherapy in patients with febrile neutropenia in clinical trials. In 2002, the first version of this review was published. Results showed no advantage of combination therapy with regard to all cause mortality, the primary outcome assessed and an increased rate of nephrotoxicity with the combined regimen. Most trials compared a broad-spectrum beta-lactam with an older beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside; however comparisons performed to directly assess our research question, that is, trials comparing the same beta-lactam with or without an aminoglycoside, were rare. We called for further studies assessing directly the clinical implications of synergism, and further trials comparing different beta-lactams were discouraged in our recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2003</LINK>). In 2008 we updated our systematic review with new evidence that had accumulated since publication of the first version of our review; no significant differences were presented in terms of outcomes or subsequent recommendations. At present we are undertaking to update the review to include new evidence that has accumulated since the previous version.</P>

<P>Trials fulfilling the review inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias by two review authors working independently. For the 2012 update, this was done using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We primarily assessed the effect of allocation concealment on results, based on the evidence of a strong association between poor allocation concealment and overestimation of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), as defined below:</P>

<P>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was initially graphically inspected and assessed by calculating a test of heterogeneity (Chi-square).

These were separated when heterogeneity was observed. Further heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analysis, assessing the above-defined patient subgroups (<LINK TAG="OBJECTIVES" TYPE="SECTION">Objectives</LINK>).</P>
<P>A funnel plot estimating the precision of trials (plots of the log of the risk ratio for efficacy against the sample size) was examined to estimate potential selection bias (such as publication bias) and to assess whether effect estimates are associated with study size.</P>
<P>Adjusted means were calculated and corrected by the inverse of the variance. We searched for the correlation between mortality and treatment failure, to assess the clinical relevance of treatment failure and infection related mortality outcomes in these studies. Correlations were tested for significance using a non-parametric test (Spearman) using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14.0. Numbers needed to treat or harm were calculated as 1/(CER-CER*RR), where CER is the control event rate and RR is the risk ratio.</P>

<P>The computerised search strategy identified a large number of randomised trials assessing the treatment of febrile neutropenia&#65293;not all of which were relevant for the present review. These were screened for trials assessing beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy versus beta-lactam monotherapy. Ninety-five publications of RCTs were considered eligible for this review.</P>
<P>Twenty-three publications of 22 trials were excluded (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Allocation to monotherapy versus combination therapy was non-random in five studies, randomisation to monotherapy versus combination therapy was semi-empirical in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bodey-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bodey 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-1987" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pegram-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pegram 1989</LINK>), the comparator regimens were incompatible with our inclusion criteria in nine trials, and non-neutropenic patients were included in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Antonio-1992" TYPE="STUDY">D'Antonio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fainstein-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fainstein 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoepelman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hoepelman 1988</LINK>), in which results for neutropenic patients only could not be extracted. One trial randomly assigned participants to treatment with ticarcillin-clavulanate versus ticarcillin-clavulanate+amikacin; however participants who had undergone bone marrow transplantation were allocated to combination therapy only, over-riding the random allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Bru-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Bru 1986</LINK>); another trial comparing imipenem versus ceftazidime versus amikacin was excluded, because it was presented as an ongoing study in a conference in 1986, no further publication of the study was found and we were not able to contact the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Moreno_x002d_Sanchez-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Moreno-Sanchez 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>We could not yet obtain the full text of one trial, which is awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Li-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1998</LINK>). Another trial was presented at a conference in 2005 and is listed as ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgir-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgir 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seventy-one trials described in 89 publications are included in the review (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies;</LINK> secondary publications are listed under their primary reference). The trials were published between 1983 and 2012. Three trials were added since the previous version of this review, all published between 2007 and 2012. Forty-three trials reported data on all cause mortality and 41 reported on infection related mortality. Data regarding treatment failure were available for all trials. Thirty-one trials contained usable information for super-infections, and 49 trials are included in the adverse event analysis.</P>
<P>Eight included trials, presented in conference proceedings between 1987 and 2002, were published in abstract form only. Supplementary data from the authors were available for two of these (<LINK REF="STD-Cornely-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cornely 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hense-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hense 2000</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Patient and infection characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Most trials included adult cancer patients. Fourteen trials included only children, and another 14 trials included both adults and children. Most trials included participants with haematological cancer: 35 trials included only patients with haematological malignancies, and in another 32 trials most patients had haematological cancer. Bone marrow transplant patients were excluded from three trials. Patients with septic shock were specifically excluded from four trials; most trials did not refer to patients with septic shock, and in the few trials that did report patients with septic shock, only a few patients were included (1% to 6% of patients in five trials reporting the number of patients with shock on admission).</P>
<P>The ratio between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria among all included studies was 0.69. The adjusted mean rate of infection caused by Gram-negative bacteria was 11.5% of participants. <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, a commonly implicated pathogen of febrile neutropenia in the past, was isolated in only 1.7% of included participants, constituting 15.3% of all documented Gram-negative isolates.</P>
<P>Surveillance cultures were performed in nine trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic regimens</HEADING>
<P>The same beta-lactam was compared in 16 of 71 included trials. In these trials the beta-lactam was ceftazidime (seven trials), piperacillin-tazobactam (four trials), cefepime (three trials), imipenem (two trials&#65293;one of which included four arms and assessed both ceftazidime and imipenem) and cefoperazone (one trial). All other trials compared one beta-lactam (usually a new drug) with a narrower-spectrum beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside. The most common mono-combi beta-lactam comparison was between a carbapenem and a cephalosporin (18 trials). Other comparisons included cephalosporin-cephalosporin (11 trials), cephalosporin-penicillin (nine trials), carbapenem-penicillin (nine trials), penicillin-cephalosporin (four trials) and penicillin-penicillin (three trials), respectively.</P>
<P>The most commonly tested aminoglycoside was amikacin (43 trials), followed by tobramycin (14 trials), gentamicin (11 trials) and netilmicin (three trials). Aminoglycosides were administered once daily in 16 trials. Aminoglycosides were administered for the duration of treatment in all trials, except <LINK REF="STD-Tamura-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tamura 2004</LINK>, where amikacin was administered only for the first 3 days of combination therapy.</P>
<P>Treatment duration was reported as means or medians. The mean treatment duration ranged from 7 to 15 days (most commonly 9 days); median treatment duration varied between 4 and 9 days (most commonly 9 days).</P>

The number of participating patients was given in 74% of trials analysing episodes, and the mean episode-to-patient ratio in these trials was 1.3 (range 1.02 to 2.07). Trials that allowed repeat randomisation of participants for separate episodes of febrile neutropenia did not adjust their analyses to the 'cluster' effect of episodes within single participants and did not provide an intra-patient correlation estimate to allow for adjusted analyses in the meta-analysis.

Among trials comparing different beta-lactams, the RR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.09, 33 trials, 5468 episodes). Results were similar for trials comparing same and different beta-lactams with regard to all cause mortality; therefore these trials were combined in all subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses for mortality.</P>
<P>No significant differences between monotherapy and combination therapy were observed for the planned subgroups. The trend observed was similar for all comparisons, with RRs favouring monotherapy, with no statistical significance.

<P>
<BR/>When the analysis was separated by the monotherapy beta-lactam (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>), only piperacillin-tazobactam was associated with significantly improved survival compared with combination therapy (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96, 5 trials, 1093 episodes). In studies including only children, the RR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.64), and in trials including only adults, the RR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, monotherapy was associated with a trend toward improved survival overall and in all subgroups assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Infection related mortality and treatment failure</HEADING>
<P>Infection related mortality was reported in 41 trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). No deaths related to infection were reported in nine trials (which did not contribute to the meta-analysis). Monotherapy was associated with a significantly lower rate of infection related mortality compared with combination therapy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99). Results were similar for trials comparing same and different beta-lactams. The number of participants needed to treat with monotherapy to prevent one death related to infection was 95 participants, but 95% CIs were large (49 to 1241 participants).</P>
<P>Studies performed in recent years based their definitions for treatment success and failure on recommendations of the Immuncompromised Host Society (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1990</LINK>). Treatment failure reported here is the inverse of "success without modification". It should be noted that we defined <I>treatment failure</I> more broadly in our protocol as death, lack of clinical improvement or any modification of the assigned empirical antibiotic treatment (see earlier, outcomes). Death judged as unrelated to infection was not included in the consensus definitions for failure. Thus other than infection related deaths, treatment failure reflected mainly treatment modifications in trials that were open-label in the vast majority.</P>
<P>In trials comparing the same beta-lactam, a significant advantage was seen with combination therapy (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20) with minor heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 12%).

Results diverged for trials comparing same and different beta-lactams with regard to treatment failure; therefore these data were not pooled for the main and all subsequent analyses of treatment failure.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses for trials comparing the same beta-lactams (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>) demonstrated significant differences in favour of combination therapy for patients with Gram-negative infection (RR 1.34) and severe neutropenia (RR 1.48). No significant differences were observed for the subgroups of participants with any microbiologically documented infection, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection, bacteraemia and haematological cancer. No specific beta-lactam monotherapy was associated with increased risk for failure (<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>). All subgroup analyses for trials comparing the same beta-lactam were limited by the paucity of trials and participants included.</P>
<P>Similar subgroup analyses for trials comparing different beta-lactams showed that the significant advantage associated with monotherapy persisted in all tested subgroups, except for cases of documented <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection, severe neutropenia and haematological cancer. Similar RRs in favour of monotherapy were observed with the different specific beta-lactams.</P>
<P>No correlation was noted between rates of treatment failure and all cause or infection related mortality in these studies (r = 0.27, P = 0.11, 38 trials, and r = 0.21, P = 0.27, 30 trials, respectively). As expected, infection related mortality was significantly correlated with all cause mortality (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001, 29 trials). No significant correlation was noted between publication year and the RRs for mortality or treatment failure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Super-infections</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-nine trials, including 4961 episodes, reported on the development of bacterial super infections during and after antibiotic treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), and 20 trials, including 3437 episodes, reported on fungal super infections (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Equivalence was demonstrated with regard to bacterial super infections (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19). Fungal super infections developed more frequently in the combination treatment group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.00). Data concerning resistant colonisation were scarce. Five trials supplied data regarding any colonisation (<LINK REF="STD-Alanis-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Alanis 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cornelissen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cornelissen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erjavec-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Erjavec 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kojima-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kojima 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrby-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Norrby 1987</LINK>), and comparison of colonisation with resistant Gram-negative bacteria was possible in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cornelissen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cornelissen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norrby-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Norrby 1987</LINK>). In these studies, resistant Gram-negative bacteria were detected in 5 of 152 participants in the monotherapy group versus 1 of 152 in the combination group. Notably, none of the newer trials included in the updated review performed surveillance cultures, nor did they report on colonisation with resistant bacteria.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were significantly more frequent in the combination treatment group. The difference was most remarkable when development of renal failure was compared (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.57) for any nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>) and (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.49) for severe nephrotoxicity (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>). Nephrotoxicity was more common in the combination therapy than in the monotherapy arm also in studies using a once-daily dosing regimen for the aminoglycoside (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.63, 8 trials, 1707 participants). In assessment of any adverse effect in all trials and in studies grouped by their monotherapy (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), an advantage of monotherapy was seen overall (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94), and with ceftazidime monotherapy (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.76). Likewise, discontinuation of study medication due to adverse events occurred more often in the combination group (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.93). The number needed to harm with combination therapy was 34 participants (95% CI, 20 to 104) with regard to any adverse event and 31 participants (95% CI, 24 to 42) with regard to nephrotoxicity.</P>

The funnel plots for trials comparing same and different beta-lactams for failure were separated. Among trials comparing the same beta-lactam, the funnel plot was approximately symmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>); among trials comparing different beta-lactams, an indication that small trials favouring combination therapy are missing may be present (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary outcomes&#65293;mortality and failure&#65293;to assess the impact of study quality on our results.</P>
<P>For mortality, results from studies with adequate allocation concealment (RR 0.88) were similar to results from studies with unclear allocation concealment (RR 0.87; <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>), as were results for trials reporting ITT (RR 0.87) versus efficacy analysis (RR 0.88; <LINK REF="CMP-012.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.2</LINK>). The effect size was smaller in trials assessing episodes (RR 0.90) compared with trials assessing participants (RR 0.84), although the 95% CI overlapped (<LINK REF="CMP-012.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.3</LINK>). Small and large trials provided similar results, with no study size effect for mortality (comparison 12.5). Unpublished trials and those published only in conference proceedings showed no advantage of monotherapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.07 to 0.72 to 1.59), and trials published in peer reviewed journals showed an advantage of monotherapy (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>For failure among trials comparing the same beta-lactams, no significant differences in the pooled effect estimate were observed for the different methodological measures assessed. In an ITT analysis counting all dropouts as failures, the advantage of combination therapy decreased (RR 1.07; <LINK REF="CMP-012.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.8</LINK>). Analysis by episodes was associated with a larger effect estimate in favour of combination therapy (RR 1.16; <LINK REF="CMP-012.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.10</LINK>). The only double-blinded trial showed similar results for combination therapy versus monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Del-Favero-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Del Favero 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-012.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among trials comparing different beta-lactams, adequate allocation concealment was associated with a smaller effect estimate in favour of monotherapy than was seen with unclear methods (RR 0.94 versus RR 0.87, respectively; <LINK REF="CMP-012.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.6</LINK>). ITT analysis in the publication was associated with a smaller effect estimate than was seen with efficacy analysis (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91 versus RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.01, respectively; <LINK REF="CMP-012.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.7</LINK>), and an ITT analysis assuming that all dropouts were failures did not alter results significantly (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.97; <LINK REF="CMP-012.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.8</LINK>). Analysis by episodes was associated with a smaller effect estimate than analysis by participants (RR 0.95 versus RR 0.89; <LINK REF="CMP-012.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.10</LINK>). Smaller trials were associated with a significantly larger effect estimate than was noted in the bigger trials (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.84 versus RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.03; <LINK REF="CMP-012.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.9</LINK>), pointing at the same small studies for effects observed in the corresponding funnel plot analysis (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). No advantage was seen with monotherapy in double-blind trials (<LINK REF="CMP-012.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>For trials comparing same and different beta-lactams, unpublished trials showed no difference between monotherapy and combination therapy, but published trials showed a significant difference favouring combination therapy for trials comparing the same beta-lactams, and favouring monotherapy for trials comparing different beta-lactams (<LINK REF="CMP-012.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.12</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-04-24 09:35:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventy one trials that included more than 10,000 participants were analysed to compare beta-lactam monotherapy with beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic cancer patients. The same beta-lactam was compared in 16 trials, but all other trials compared a broad-spectrum beta-lactam with a narrower-spectrum beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside. Most of the participants included in these trials were haematological cancer patients. We assessed all cause mortality as the primary outcome.</P>
<P>Monotherapy was associated with a statistically non-significant lower all cause mortality rate at end of follow-up (30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02). Results for trials comparing same and different beta-lactams were similar. Appropriate trial methods (adequate allocation concealment, ITT analysis and analysis by participants) were associated with similar effect estimates in favour of monotherapy, and no small studies effect was observed. Mortality attributed in the primary studies to infection was significantly lower with monotherapy (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99).</P>
<P>Treatment failure was assessed as the primary outcome in all included trials. By definition, its main addition on the rather subjective outcome of infection related mortality is treatment modifications (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1990</LINK>). Among trials comparing the same beta-lactams, treatment failure was significantly more frequent with monotherapy. This difference likely reflects mainly physicians' tendency for treatment modifications in open trials comparing one antibiotic regimen with a broader-spectrum regimen. Among trials comparing different beta-lactams, a significant advantage was seen with monotherapy. Adequate trial methods were associated with smaller effect estimates for both 'same' and 'different' comparisons. Notably, in the single double-blind trial comparing the same beta-lactams, failure was equal with combination treatment and with monotherapy, and in three double-blind trials assessing different beta-lactams, the RRs were in the opposite direction compared with those in the other trials. We detected a small studies effect for trials comparing different beta-lactams. This may reflect a publication bias related to trials that assessed a newer monotherapy without showing its advantage.</P>
<P>Bacterial super infections occurred with equal frequency with monotherapy and combination therapy. Fungal super-infections were more common with combination therapy. All adverse events were more common with combination therapy, with a highly significant difference for nephrotoxicity. The pooled effect estimate translated to a number needed to harm of 34 participants (95% CI 20 to 104 participants).</P>
<P>To explain the advantage of monotherapy with regard to all cause mortality, several of the secondary outcomes may be used. Infection related mortality was significantly lower with monotherapy, and fungal super infections occurred more frequently with combination treatment. Fungal infections developing during neutropenia are highly lethal (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>). Thus, the improvement in survival may indeed be infection related. On the other hand, nephrotoxicity associated with combination therapy is a risk factor for subsequent adverse outcomes. Given these results and those of the methodological quality assessment, it is likely that the both mechanisms contribute to an unbiased advantage in overall survival with monotherapy.</P>
<P>Several hypotheses underlie the use of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy for patients with neutropenia and suspected infection. Synergism is usually claimed as the major reason for combination therapy. Synergism was assessed most directly in trials comparing the same beta-lactam. We did not detect the beneficial effects of synergism. A wider spectrum of coverage may be the incentive for the addition of an aminoglycoside depending on local patterns of resistance. Studies included in the review did not supply enough data to allow determination of whether coverage is indeed improved with combination therapy. However, the efficacy of aminoglycosides alone for the treatment of neutropenic patients is doubtful (<LINK REF="REF-Bodey-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodey 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klastersky-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klastersky 1986</LINK>); therefore this potential advantage does not seem substantial. Finally, combination therapy is claimed to prevent emergence of resistant pathogens. Development of resistance after antibiotic treatment is difficult to quantify. We intended to extract data regarding colonisation with resistant pathogens following antibiotic treatment, but these data were rarely available. Resistance was therefore indirectly examined through super infections, under the assumption that infection that develops under antibiotic treatment involves resistant pathogens. No difference was noted in the rate of bacterial super infections between monotherapy and combination therapy, and this analysis resulting in an RR close to 1. Fungal super infections developed more frequently with combination therapy, perhaps as a reflection of increased antibiotic spectrum or burden with combination therapy. Thus we could not show an advantage of combination therapy from this aspect.</P>
<P>We chose all cause mortality as the primary outcome, rather than treatment failure or infection related mortality, and have drawn our conclusions from the analysis for all cause mortality. Only a small part of the variance in mortality is explained by infection and its treatment; however, appropriate randomisation should ensure similar distribution of non&#8211;infection related risk factors for death between the study groups. Infection related mortality may be prone to bias in that the cause of death is difficult to determine in severely ill cancer patients. Moreover, ignoring deaths due to treatment-related adverse effects and super infections is inappropriate. Early empirical antibiotic treatment is the standard of practice for febrile neutropenic patients because it has been proven to decrease mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schimpff-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schimpff 1986</LINK>). Survival is indeed the objective when an acute infection is treated in cancer patients. Treatment failure indicates mainly modifications of the initial antibiotic regimen, and possibly a longer time to defervescence. The implications of such an outcome are not clear from the clinical point of view. Finally, deaths are objective, but failures cannot be objective when the trials are open. It is important to note that we could demonstrate in this review that assessing treatment failure is probably inappropriate, because no correlation between failure and mortality could be shown.</P>
<P>Our results are congruent with those of several other analyses of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy versus beta-lactam monotherapy, showing no advantage associated with combination therapy. We conducted a similar analysis in non-neutropenic participants with sepsis, showing an advantage of monotherapy in trials comparing different beta-lactams, and no difference in trials comparison the same beta-lactam (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2006a</LINK>). In an analysis of all RCTs comparing the same beta-lactam in the combination and monotherapy arms, in both neutropenic and non-neutropenic participants, and including semi-empirical studies, we did not find a significant difference in all cause mortality, but we noted significantly more bacterial super infections and increased renal failure with the addition of aminoglycosides (<LINK REF="REF-Marcus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcus 2011</LINK>). An analysis focusing on the development of resistance did not find an advantage associated with combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Bliziotis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bliziotis 2005</LINK>). Finally, an analysis of observational studies focusing on<I> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection (mainly bacteraemia), a pathogen with special relevance to neutropenic cancer patients, did not find an advantage for combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Vardakas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vardakas 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The major limitations of this review include the lack of complete data concerning mortality (all cause mortality was available for 44 of 71 included trials, 62%) and the paucity of available data regarding specific patient subgroups, such as those with <I>Pseuomonas aeruginosa</I> infection. Other limitations stem from those of the primary studies. Allocation concealment was at low risk of bias in less than 35% of the trials, and nearly all were non-blinded. Many of the trials did not adhere to the principle of ITT analysis, resulting in incomplete data reporting. Most studies used febrile episodes as the unit of randomisation, although recurrent episodes are not independent for any for the outcomes assessed. Finally, follow-up did not seem pre-determined in many of the studies. Reported mortality may have been biased because the time of assessment was not defined in advance. We included trials regardless of their publication status. The differences detected in our review, namely, the advantage of monotherapy with regard to survival and the divergent advantages with regard to failure, existed with larger effect estimates in trials published in peer reviewed journals. The RRs were close to 1 for these outcomes in unpublished trials, mainly conference proceedings. Their inclusion in the meta-analysis tipped the overall RRs toward equivalence.</P>

<P>Monotherapy can be regarded as the standard of care for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. The addition of an aminoglycoside does not improve survival. On the contrary, it is associated with significant morbidity incurred mainly through aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity.</P>
<P>The monotherapies assessed in recent years have included imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. These beta-lactams have also been assessed in head-to-head trials comparing different monotherapies and have shown similar efficacies, but for cefepime this was associated with increased all cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2006</LINK>). Thus, individual centres should select the best matching monotherapy according to local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns.</P>
<P>RCTs do not support an advantage of combination therapy for <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection and other more severely ill patient subgroups. However the paucity of data precludes firm conclusions regarding these patient subgroups.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-04-24 09:36:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of new beta-lactams for febrile neutropenia should not be performed by comparison with a narrower-spectrum beta-lactam combined with an aminoglycoside. The results of these trials are uniformly unfavourable for patients. Assessment of new beta-lactam monotherapies should be performed by comparison with established monotherapies for febrile neutropenia. This design can and does show the advantages and disadvantages of specific beta-lactams (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The need for further trials assessing the addition of an aminoglycoside to the same beta-lactam is doubtful given the results of our review, spanning more than two decades of clinical trials in febrile neutropenia and without a change in RRs throughout the years. We can foresee such a need if a reduction in aminoglycoside-related adverse effects is expected, or if new data will point toward drug combinations with a marked synergistic effect&#65293;much greater than that observed in current studies. Trials targeting specific patient subgroups, such as those with severe sepsis and septic shock, documented <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection, etc. are warranted.</P>
<P>Future trials should report all cause mortality. The primary outcome used in these studies should be re-defined because with current definitions, no correlation can be noted between failure and the ultimate outcome: survival. This outcome should be defined in a consensus statement and applied universally to permit comparisons and compilation of different studies. The unit of randomisation should be the patient&#65293;not the episode. If recurrent episodes are allowed, results for the first randomisation of each patient should be reported separately, or the analysis should be adjusted to the clustering effect of patient episodes. Length of follow-up should be uniform and should be determined before the study is begun.</P>

Imipenem/cilastatin (I/C), has a broad spectrum of activity over -lactam antibiotics, and is an established monotherapy agent in febrile neutropenia. This has encouraged us to compare its use as control to the use of once daily C+A in high-risk febrile neutropenic pediatric cancer patients. We hypothesized that patients initially at high risk for sepsis can be candidates for outpatient therapy if at 48 hours are afebrile, had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 100/L, negative cultures, and no signs of infection among other selection criteria. We compared the efficacy, treatment modification, toxicity, duration of hospitalization and cost between both groups. In addition to assessing risks of early discharge, and the rate of readmissions.&lt;br&gt;Patients and methods: A prospective, randomized crossover clinical trial was designed to compare once daily C+A (study group), to I/C (control), in 120 pediatric cancer patients with high-risk neutropenia (ANC&amp;lt;500/mm3 for  7 days). Response was defined as defervescence,negative cultures,and resolution/improvement manifestations of infection. Febrile patients at 72 hours were crossed-over to the alternate arm together with adding vancomycin. Other modifications were made according to clinical and microbiological data. Patients receiving C+A were subsequently assessed for fulfillment of Early Discharge Criteria,and those eligible continued treatment as outpatients until counts recovered acceptably. Intention-to-Treat analysis was used.&lt;br&gt;Results: We found a statistically significant difference between duration of hospitalization between the C+A [median 9.5 days] and control group [median 4.5 days] (p&amp;lt;0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the response to treatment at either 72 hours, after crossover and vancomycin or at the end of episode [62%vs.51.7%,p= 0.3; 78.7% vs.74%,p= 0.5; 95% vs.96,p= 0.6]. Overall success rate was 95.8%. Gram-positive bacteria (59%) dominated isolated organisms. I/C was associated with significantly more nausea and vomiting. Analysis of per episode antibiotic cost using Actual Acquisition Price showed a statistically significant difference C+A median cost $234.2 vs.control $358, p&amp;lt; 0.001). This corresponded to North American Average Market Acquisition Price (AMAP) C+A median cost $794, vs. control $822,(p= 0.8),due to higher price and monitoring cost of amikacin. The total hospitalization and antibiotic expenses for the C+A group was significantly less than the control group [study median $873 vs.control $1655,p&amp;lt;0.001]. Similar results were obtained using average admission costs in a corresponding North American institution.&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: We conclude that pediatric febrile-neutropenic patients initially at high risk for sepsis can be risk categorized at some point in treatment and assessed for outpatient therapy. The convenience, less adverse effects and cost benefit of the once daily regimen of ceftriaxone plus amikacin will be particularly useful to reduce the overall treatment costs, and duration of hospitalization. Imipenem despite its broader antimicrobial spectrum does not decrease the overall need for antibiotic modifications and is more often complicated by GIT toxicity. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of risk categorization and outpatient therapy in the context of high-risk febrile neutropenia.&lt;br&gt;Abstract #887 appears in Blood, Volume 102, issue 11, November 16, 2003&lt;br&gt;Keywords: FEVER|NEUTROPENIA|OUTPATIENT&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:23:46 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="CONFERENCE_PROC">

We hypothesized that patients initially at high risk for sepsis can be candidates for outpatient therapy if at 48 hours satisfy strict &amp;quot;Selection Criteria&amp;quot;. Being a well established monotherapy agent, Imipenem was used as control. We compared the efficacy, treatment modification, toxicity, duration of hospitalization and cost between both groups. In addition we assessed risks of early discharge and rate of readmission. Design/Methods: A prospective, randomized crossover clinical trial involving 120 pediatric cancer patients with high-risk fever and neutropenia. Febrile patients at 72 hours were crossed-over together with adding vancomycin. Patients on C+A were assessed using Early Discharge Criteria, and if eligible continued treatment as outpatients. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results: We found a statistically significant difference between duration of hospitalization between the C+A [median 4.5 days] and control [9.5 days] (p&amp;lt;0.001), per episode antibiotic cost (p&amp;lt; 0.001) &amp;amp; total episode cost [study median $873 vs. control $1655, p&amp;lt;0.001]. Similar results were obtained using average admission costs in a corresponding North American institution. There was no statistically significant difference in the response to treatment at 72 hours, after crossover or at the end of episode. Cultures grew more Gram-positive bacteria (59%). Overall success rate was 95.8%. Conclusions: Pediatric febrile-neutropenic patients initially at high-risk for sepsis can be risk-assessed at some point in treatment for outpatient therapy.

The patients&amp;#8217; age range was 11 months to 15 years (mean age 7 years). &lt;br&gt;Results: Meropenem monotherapy was used in 38 febrile neutropenic episodes (56.7%), and ceftazidime plus amikacin combination treatment in 29 febrile neutropenic episodes (43.3%). Overall success rate without treatment modification was 35.3% with meropenem monotherapy and 26.4% in the ceftazidime plus amikacin group. These rates were increased to 84.8% and 80.2%, respectively, with modification. There was no statistical difference in the response rate between the two study groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. &lt;br&gt;Conclusions: These results indicate that initial empiric meropenem monotherapy appears to be as effective and well tolerated as ceftazidime plus amikacin combination therapy in childhood febrile neutropenia. There appears to be a slight trend with meropenem monotherapy for a better response without modification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:34:08 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="CONFERENCE_PROC">

The initial appraisal to neutropenic febrile patient is to obtain specimens for culture for bacteria and fungi, immediately. Empirical antibiotic therapy with single-drug therapy or two-drug therapy should be administered promptly to all neutropenic patients at the onset of fever. In the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen, must be considered the local epidemiologic pattern.&lt;br&gt;Objective&lt;br&gt;This study was undertaken in order to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment with cefepime compared with ceftazidime plus amikacin in febrile patients with severe neutropenia.&lt;br&gt;Material and method&lt;br&gt;An open, prospective, controlled, randomized study was carried out from March of 2001 through March 2002 in a third care facility of Mexico City. We included patients with chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or acute leukemia who became neutropenic (38.3 Celsius). Patients were randomized to receive a single-drug therapy with cefepime (2 g q12 IV) or two-drug therapy with ceftazidime (2 g q8 IV) plus amikacin (1 g qd IV). All patients gave written informed consent. For statistical analysis chi-square test and Student t test were applied.&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;117 episodes of febrile neutropenia were evaluated (63 in the cefepime group and 54 in the ceftazidime-amikacin group). Success rates in the cefepime (54 of 63 febrile episodes) and ceftazidime-amikacin group (47 of 54 episodes) were similar (86% vs. 87%, respectively. Treatment failure was similar en both groups (9 of 63 for the cefepime group and 7 of 54 for the ceftazidime-amikacin group). No significant differences in adverse events or toxicity were noted. &lt;br&gt;Conclusion&lt;br&gt;The empirical regimen of cefepime is as safe and effective as ceftazidime-amikacin in febrile adult patients with severe neutropenia due to chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.&lt;br&gt;Keywords: Febrile neutropenia\ Infection\ Antibiotic therapy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:37:31 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="CONFERENCE_PROC">

The obtained results were similar in both types of antibiotic therapy. However, granulocytopenia was higher and septicemia was more frequent in children treated with ceftazidime. Isolated bacteria were more sensitive to ceftazidime than to tobramycin with amoxycillin/ampicillin. Both regimens were tolerated well. Despite a low number of patients in both groups, one may conclude that ceftazidime is more efficient in patients with granulocytopenia. Less adverse reactions, lower number of infections, less frequent medical procedures, elimination of the potentially toxic aminoglycosides and lower cost of therapy advocate the use of ceftazidime monotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-04-24 04:46:18 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Forty patients with neutropenia &amp;lt; 1 x 109/1 after chemotherapy, with fever 38[degrees]C were entered into the study. Patients were randomized to the group treated with cefepime in monotherapy at the dose 3 x 2.0 g or cefepime 3 x 2.0 g with amikacine 2 x 0.5 g. The resolution of fever was observed in 20/40 pts, 9/19 pts in monotherapy group and 11/21 pts in the group tretaed with the combination of cefepime and amikacine. The empirical use of cefepime in monotherapy was comparatively as efficacious as the use of cefepime with amikacine as the first line treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. The potential costs and toxicity of cefepime in monotherapy may be lower, however this needs further prospective analysis.&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

Therapeutic failure was defined as clinical deterioration or grown of resitent bacteria duiring treatment.&lt;br&gt;Results: We have analised 51 patients who were admitted for 67 episodes of neutropenia and fever. Thirty seven episodes (50%) had negative urine and blood culture and 37 (50%) had a positive urine and/or blood culture, with a total of 49 positive cultures. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Klebsiella pneumoniae (29,4%), Acinetobacter sp. (17,6%) and Enterobacter sp. (11,7%); and from urine cultures were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and Proteus sp. (16,6%). We analyzed the antibiotic use in 67 episodes of febrile neutropenia. Ceftriaxone and aminoglicosyde were used in 29 episodes (43,2%) and cefepime was used in the remaining 38 episodes (56,7%). The groups were comparable in relation to age, duration of fever and neutrophil count. In the combined therapy group there were 18 therapeutic failures (62%) and in the monotherapy group, 12 failures (31,5%) (p=0,01).&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: In our series, cefepime monotherapy was superior to the combination therapy with ceftriaxone and aminoglicosyde in the treatment of febrile neutropenia. Most of our isolates were gram negative agents (77,5%). We observed a low rate of isolation of gram positive agents (12,2%) and fungi (10,2%), even though febrile neutropenia is a important risk factor for infections with these agents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:41:59 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="CONFERENCE_PROC">

Initial profound granulocytopenia (fewer than 100/mm3 mature granulocytes) was present in approximately 45% of the patients in trial of both treatment groups. Of 53 microbiologically and clinically documented infections treated with piperacillin plus amikacin, 36 (68%) showed improvement. Of 48 microbiologically and clinically documented infections treated with cefmenoxime plus amikacin, 23 (48%) showed improvement. The response rate for gram-negative infections treated with cefmenoxime plus amikacin was lower than that for infections treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Toxicity was minimal, with an equivalent incidence of skin rash, diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction. Although clinical efficacy of the combination of piperacillin plus amikacin may be superior to cefmenoxime plus amikacin therapy, this study demonstrated no statistically significant differences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-05-21 14:20:51 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Dolores Matthews" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
