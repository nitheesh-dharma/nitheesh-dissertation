<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Lumbar supports for the prevention and treatment of low-back pain</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Lumbar supports (also called braces or corsets) are used in the prevention and treatment of low-back pain. This review is important because low-back pain is very common. Prevention and treatment are important both to people with back pain and to society, which bears the expense of back pain treatment and sick leave due to back pain.</P>
<P>We included seven studies on prevention (14,437 people) and eight studies on treatment (1361 people) in this review. </P>
<P>
<B>Prevention: <BR/>
</B>There was little or no difference between individuals with low-back pain who used back supports and those who received no treatment (five studies, 13,995 people), or education on lifting techniques (two studies, 954 people) in back pain prevention or reduction of sick leave.</P>
<P>In one study (82 people), back supports added to back school (patient education about recovering from back pain) were helpful in reducing the number of days of sick leave but not in preventing back pain. Back supports plus usual medical care reduced the number of days of low-back pain and improved function, but did not reduce sick leave (one study, 360 people).</P>
<P>
<B>Treatment:<BR/>
</B>In four studies (1170 people), there was little or no difference between patients with acute or chronic back pain who used back supports and those who received no treatment in short-term pain reduction or overall improvement. </P>
<P>There is conflicting evidence (two studies, 550 people) about whether back supports are better than nothing in helping low-back pain patients return to work faster, however in three studies (410 patients), they were better than nothing in helping individuals with subacute and chronic low-back pain recover function in the short term.</P>
<P>In three studies (954 people), there was little or no difference in short-term pain reduction, overall improvement and return-to-work between those who used back supports and those who received manipulation, physiotherapy, or electrical stimulation. One study (164 people) reported mixed results on whether back supports improved function more than massage and in another study (19 people), use of a lumbar corset with back support was more effective in reducing pain in the short-term than a corset alone.</P>
<P>Conclusions from this review should be viewed with caution due to the low quality of many of the studies. In the future, researchers should report side effects from wearing back supports and measure how many hours per day the supports are actually worn.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-06-03 14:04:27 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lumbar supports are used in the treatment of low-back pain patients, to prevent the onset of low-back pain (primary prevention) or to prevent recurrences of a low-back pain episode (secondary prevention). </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of lumbar supports for prevention and treatment of non-specific low-back pain.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated the search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL to December 2006. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials, and contacted experts to identify additional RCTs. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized controlled trials that reported on any type of lumbar supports as preventive or therapeutic intervention for non-specific low-back pain. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>One review author generated the electronic search. Two review authors independently identified trials that met the inclusion criteria. One review author extracted data on the study population, interventions, and final results. The methodological quality and the clinical relevance were independently assessed by two review authors.</P>
<P>Because it was not possible to perform a quantitative analysis, we performed a qualitative analysis in which the strength of evidence on the effectiveness of lumbar supports was classified as strong, moderate, limited, conflicting, or no evidence. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) were included in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items. </P>
<P>There was moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether lumbar supports are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It is still unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for the treatment of low-back pain. </P>

<P>There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-back pain.</P>
<P>There is still a need for high quality randomised trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. One of the most essential issues to tackle in these future trials seems to be the realization of an adequate compliance. Special attention should be paid to different outcome measures, types of patients and types of lumbar support.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>Low-back pain (LBP) is a major health problem in western industrialized countries. Seventy to 85% of the population has low-back pain at some time in their life. The annual prevalence of low-back pain ranges from 15% to 45%, with an average point prevalence of 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Asche-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asche 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krismer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krismer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>). The prevalence increases with age up to 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1999</LINK>). Most patients recover quickly and without residual functional loss: 60% to 70% recover within six weeks and 80% to 90% recover within three months (<LINK REF="REF-Krismer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krismer 2007</LINK>). Unfortunately, for individuals who do not recover within three months, the recovery process is slow and makes a large and costly demand on the health-care system. This group of individuals is also a major contributor to disability and absence from work (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Krismer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krismer 2007</LINK>). In the USA, low-back pain is the most common cause of activity limitation among people younger than 45 years and the second most frequent reason for visits to a physician (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1999</LINK>). In 2002, low-back pain accounted for approximately 2.3% of all physician visits (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>The costs of back pain exceed the costs of many other conditions and diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>). A cost-of-illness study of low-back pain in the United Kingdom estimated that the 1998 direct medical costs were £1.6 billion and that the indirect costs (total cost of absenteeism and disability payments) varied between £5.0 billion and £10.6 billion, depending on the costing method used (<LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>). It has been estimated that in the United States, back pain has associated direct costs of US$20 billion and indirect costs of between US$75 and 100 billion. In the Netherlands in 1991, the total direct medicals costs were estimated at US$368 million and the total cost of absenteeism and disability payments (indirect costs) at US$3.1 and US$1.5 billion, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Maniadakis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maniadakis 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1995</LINK>). </P>
<P>Lumbar supports are used in the management of low-back pain and are also commonly used in the workplace to prevent low-back pain injuries in employees (<LINK REF="STD-Wassell-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wassell 2000</LINK>). Lumbar supports are provided as treatment to people suffering from LBP with the aim to decrease impairment and disability. They are also used as an intervention to prevent the onset of LBP (primary prevention) or to prevent recurrent LBP episodes (secondary prevention). There is a wide variety of lumbar supports, both flexible and rigid. They can be worn under or over clothing, with or without shoulder straps, during the whole day or part of the day, only at the workplace or during any activity. Nachemson reported different desired functions of lumbar supports: 1) to correct deformity; 2) to limit spinal motion; 3) to stabilize part of the spine; 4) to reduce mechanical uploading; 5) miscellaneous effects (massage, heat, placebo) (<LINK REF="REF-Nachemson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachemson 1987</LINK>). However, at present, the putative mechanisms of action of a lumbar support remain a matter of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Dillingham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillingham 1998</LINK>). The systematic review by Van Poppel and colleagues did not support the hypothesis that lumbar supports decrease back muscle force by decreasing the electromyogram of back muscles or by increasing intra-abdominal pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Poppel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Poppel 2000</LINK>). Neither did Van Poppel's review support the hypothesis that workers would be inclined to lift heavier weights when wearing a lumbar support. The only hypothesis that could be confirmed was that lumbar supports affect trunk motion. </P>
<P>Potential adverse effects of wearing a lumbar support that have been reported are skin lesions, gastro-intestinal disorders, muscle wasting, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates (<LINK REF="REF-Calmels-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmels 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGill-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGill 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The popularity of lumbar supports has led to several studies investigating their preventive and therapeutic effects. These studies have already been summarized in several reviews on the effectiveness of lumbar supports for prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Ammendolia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammendolia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dillingham-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dillingham 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK>) and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Koes-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koes 1994</LINK>) of non-specific low-back pain. Van Tulder and colleagues published the original Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Jellema-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jellema 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>). In the earlier Cochrane review, the authors were unable to draw definite conclusions on the effectiveness of lumbar supports due to low methodological quality, heterogeneity and inconsistent results of the included studies. In this update, the results of studies published between 1998 and 2006 are added to the evidence reported in the original Cochrane review.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-06-03 12:36:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of this systematic review were to determine whether lumbar supports are effective for prevention and treatment of non-specific LBP.<BR/>Comparisons that were investigated are:<BR/>1.1 Lumbar support as intervention for prevention of LBP versus no intervention.<BR/>1.2 Lumbar support as intervention for prevention of LBP versus other types of prevention.<BR/>1.3 Lumbar support as supplement to another type of prevention of LBP versus that other type of prevention alone.</P>
<P>2.1 Lumbar support as intervention for treatment of LBP versus no intervention.<BR/>2.2 Lumbar support as intervention for treatment of LBP versus other types of treatment.<BR/>2.3 Lumbar support as supplement to another type of treatment of LBP versus that other type of treatment alone.<BR/>2.4 Various types of lumbar support.</P>

For therapeutic trials, the study population had to consist of subjects aged 18 to 65 years with non-specific low-back pain. RCTs that included subjects with low-back pain caused by specific pathological entities such as infection, neoplasm, metastasis, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or fractures were excluded.</P>
<P>Patients with acute (less than six weeks), subacute (six to 12 weeks) or chronic (12 weeks or more) low-back pain were included.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Trials studying any type of lumbar support, flexible or rigid, used for the prevention or treatment of non-specific LBP were included. Special types of lumbar supports for severe scoliosis and kyphosis were excluded, as were special lumbar supports used after back surgery.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-06-03 12:37:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only preventive studies that used at least one of the following outcome measures were included: incidence of low-back pain, duration of low-back pain, absenteeism (% of the studied population, number of days) and back pain-specific functional status (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry scale). For therapeutic studies, only RCTs that used at least one of the following outcome measures were included: pain (Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)), overall improvement (% improvement, NRS), return to work (% of the population, number of days of absenteeism) and back-specific functional status (RMDQ, Oswestry scale).</P>
<P>Measurements of outcomes conducted less than three months after randomisation are described as short-term follow-up, between three and six months as intermediate follow-up, and six months or more as long-term follow-up.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following search strategies were used for this updated review:<BR/>1. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2006, issue 4;<BR/>2. PubMed up to December 2006;<BR/>3. EMBASE (Ovid) up to December 2006;<BR/>4. CINAHL (EBSCO host) up to December 2006;<BR/>5. Current Contents up to September 1999;<BR/>6. References in relevant reviews and identified trials;<BR/>7. Personal communication with experts in the fields.</P>
<P>The databases were searched using the algorithm recommended in the Updated Method Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). An experienced information expert helped with the literature search. We did not update the search for Current contents since it yielded no unique studies in the original search.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 14:01:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One of the authors of this review is also first author of one of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>). She was not involved in any decision regarding selection, quality assessment, data extraction or analysis of this trial. Two of the authors (van Poppel, van Tulder) are authors of another included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>). Neither was involved in any decision regarding selection, quality assessment, data extraction or analysis of this trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors selected the studies. Authors, title, subject-headings, publication type and abstract of the identified studies were downloaded into Reference Manager version 10. Two review authors independently reviewed the information to identify trials that met the inclusion criteria. A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements concerning the final inclusion of RCTs. A third review author was consulted if disagreements were not resolved.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. The articles were not blinded for author, institution or journal, because one of the quality assessors was familiar with the literature. A consensus method was used to resolve disagreements concerning the assessment of the methodological quality of the RCTs included in the review. A third review author was consulted if disagreement persisted. If the article did not contain sufficient information on one or more of the criteria, the authors were contacted for additional information. If the authors could not be contacted or if the information was no longer available, the criteria were scored as 'unclear'.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the criteria recommended in the Updated Method Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The item regarding the blinding of care providers was not included in our quality assessment, because blinding of care providers for lumbar support use seems impossible. Each criterion was scored as either 'positive', 'negative' or 'unclear' according to definitions of the criteria (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). A validity item was scored as 'positive' when the available information regarding that item did not reveal any bias, 'negative' when no information at all was provided regarding that item or when the available information did reveal bias. A validity item was scored as 'unclear' when the available information regarding that item was too scarce to make a conclusion regarding potential bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Relevance</HEADING>
<P>The two review authors who assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs also judged the clinical relevance of each trial using the five questions recommended by the Updated Method Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Each criterion was scored as either 'positive', 'negative' or 'unclear' according to definitions of the criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Using a standardized form, one review author extracted data on the characteristics of the study population (age, gender), type of work performed by the study population (in prevention trials), type of LBP (with or without radiation, in treatment trials), duration of LBP ((sub)acute or chronic, in treatment trials), type of study (RCT), duration of intervention period, timing of follow-up measurements (short term, intermediate or long term), characteristics of the studied intervention (type of lumbar support, the number of hours per day prescribed for the subjects to wear the lumbar support, duration of intervention period), characteristics of the control intervention (type, intensity, duration of intervention period), adverse effects due to the interventions, compliance, and the final results for each outcome measure on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. One review author (IvD) compared these findings to data extracted on the same characteristics of the same studies published in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK>). The articles were not blinded for author, institution or journal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analysis</HEADING>
<P>Many studies did not report results in a way that permitted statistical pooling (for example means with standard deviations for continuous data). Furthermore, studies were heterogeneous with regard to study populations, interventions and outcomes. Therefore, we decided not to perform a meta-analysis but to qualitatively summarize the results. A rating system was used, consisting of five levels of scientific evidence based on the design, the quality, and the outcome of the studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>):<BR/>1) <B>Strong evidence</B> - provided by generally consistent findings in multiple high quality RCTs.<BR/>2) <B>Moderate evidence</B> - provided by generally consistent findings in one high quality RCT and one or more low quality RCTs or by generally consistent findings in multiple low quality RCTs.<BR/>3) <B>Limited evidence</B> - only one RCT (either high or low quality).<BR/>4) <B>Conflicting evidence</B> - inconsistent findings in multiple RCTs.<BR/>5) <B>No evidence</B> - no RCTs.</P>
<P>High quality RCTs were defined as RCTs that fulfilled 50% or more of the validity criteria. Findings were considered to be 'generally consistent' when at least 75% of the studies showed similar results.</P>
<P>We had planned to conduct, if possible, subgroup analyses for prevention for: 1) primary versus secondary prevention, 2) short-term follow-up (less than three months after randomisation) versus long-term follow-up (more than six months after randomisation). We had also planned to conduct, if possible, subgroup analyses for treatment for: 1) acute versus chronic LBP, 2) short-term follow-up (less than three months after randomisation) versus long-term follow-up (more than six months after randomisation). Due to lack of data, planned subgroup analyses were not performed.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of different thresholds for high quality on the overall conclusions. Also, a sensitivity analysis was done in which all 'unclear' scores on internal validity items were considered 'positive'.</P>

<P>The search strategy in the five databases resulted in the identification of 926 articles; 189 articles from CENTRAL, 472 articles from PubMed, 188 articles from EMBASE, 66 articles from CINAHL, and 11 from Current Contents. Because 106 articles were found in two or more databases, a total of 820 articles were found to be potentially eligible. The papers of Hsieh and Pope, two papers of Dalichau and two of van Poppel appeared to be reports of the same study. Based on titles, subject headings, abstracts and journal types, eight articles were included (<LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Million-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valle_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Valle-Jones 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1990</LINK>).

<P>Seven studies were identified, six published in English and one in German (<LINK REF="STD-Gaber-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaber 1999</LINK>). None of the preventive studies included solely patients with no of history of LBP. Consequently, they all studied a combination of primary and secondary prevention of low-back pain.

<P>The type of lumbar support and control intervention used in the preventive studies varied considerably.

<P>The two quality assessors disagreed about 70 of the 170 validity items (42%). After one consensus meeting, all disagreements, due to reading and interpretation errors, were resolved.</P>

We asked the authors if they agreed with the scores and if they could provide more information on the items that were scored as 'unclear'. The authors of five studies responded to this request (<LINK REF="STD-Coxhead-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coxhead 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Million-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Relevance</HEADING>
<P>Assessment of clinical relevance found that many of the trial publications supplied inadequate information. The study population was described by 67% of the publications and 80% adequately described the type of lumbar support. Clinically relevant outcomes were described as 'positive' when at least pain and functional status were reported. Just 26% of the publications reported both pain and functional status.</P>
<P>The size of effect for pain was considered 'clinically relevant' when pain was decreased by more than 20% at the end of the intervention period. The size of effect for functional status was considered 'clinically relevant' when functioning was improved more than 10%. The size of effect for absence of work was not pre-defined. Only a small number of studies (13%) reported clinically relevant effects.</P>
<P>There was inadequate reporting of treatment benefits worth the potential harms in 80% of the studies. A small number of studies reported on the presence or absence of adverse events. Studies reported mild negative reactions to lumbar supports, such as restricted freedom of movement, too warm and uncomfortable.

There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are more effective at improving short-term functional status than no intervention for patients with a mix of (sub)acute and chronic LBP (three studies, 410 people).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.2 Lumbar support versus other types of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Three trials compared lumbar supports with some type of treatment for LBP and included a mix of patients with acute, subacute and chronic LBP (<LINK REF="STD-Coxhead-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coxhead 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>). One study compared corset with traction, manipulation and exercises (<LINK REF="STD-Coxhead-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coxhead 1981</LINK>,334 people), one study compared corset with physiotherapy and manipulation (<LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>, 456 people), and another study compared corsets with transcutaneous muscle stimulation (TMS) and manipulation (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>, 164 people). Only one trial was considered a high quality RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The three studies reported no significant differences in short-term pain between any of the groups. There is moderate evidence that for patients with a mix of (sub)acute and chronic LBP, lumbar supports are not more effective for short-term pain reduction than other types of treatment (three studies, 954 people).</P>
<P>Two low quality studies (<LINK REF="STD-Coxhead-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coxhead 1981</LINK>, 334 people; <LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>, 456 people) reported no significant differences in short-term and intermediate-term overall improvement. There is moderate evidence that for patients with a mix of (sub)acute and chronic LBP, lumbar supports are not more effective for short-term and intermediate-term overall improvement than other types of treatment (two studies, 790 people).</P>
<P>One low quality RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Coxhead-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Coxhead 1981</LINK>, 334 people) reported no significant differences in short-term return-to-work between the groups. There is limited evidence that for patients with a mix of (sub)acute and chronic LBP, lumbar supports are not more effective for short-term return-to-work than corsets and traction, manipulation, or exercises (one study, 334 people).</P>
<P>One high quality study (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>, 164 people) used two different instruments for measuring back pain-specific functional status. The Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire showed a significant difference between the lumbar support and the soft tissue massage group. However, the revised Oswestry Scale showed no significant difference between the groups. The study authors concluded that differences had shown up between the two measurement tools because the Roland-Morris is more sensitive to change than the Oswestry. Therefore, there is conflicting evidence about whether lumbar supports improve back pain-specific functional status more than soft tissue massage for patients with a mix of (sub)acute and chronic LBP (one study, 164 people).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.3 Lumbar support as supplement to another type of treatment versus that other type of treatment</HEADING>
<P>One low quality RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 2000</LINK>, 63 people) compared a muscle strengthening program and elastic lumbar support with an elastic lumbar support for patients with chronic LBP. The study reported no significant differences in short-term and long-term pain and back-specific functional status. There is limited evidence that lumbar supports as a supplement to a muscle strengthening program are not more effective for short- and long-term pain reduction and improved back pain-specific functional status than a muscle training program alone for patients with chronic LBP (one study, 63 people).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.4 Comparison of different types of lumbar supports</HEADING>
<P>One low quality RCT compared two different types of lumbar support, a flexible corset and a semi-rigid corset, for patients with chronic LBP (<LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2002</LINK>, 79 people). The study reported no significant differences in short-term pain and functional status. There is limited evidence that a flexible corset is not more effective than a semi-rigid corset for short-term pain reduction and improved functional status for patients with chronic LBP (one study, 79 people).</P>
<P>Another low quality RCT also compared two different types of lumbar support, with and without spinal support, for patients with chronic LBP (<LINK REF="STD-Million-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1981</LINK>, 19 people). The study reported significant differences in short-term pain and functional status in favour of the lumbar corset with back support. There is limited evidence that a lumbar corset with back support is more effective for short-term pain reduction and improved back-specific functional status than a lumbar support alone for patients with chronic LBP (one study, 19 people).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity Analyses</HEADING>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of different thresholds for high quality on the overall conclusions. A sensitivity analysis was also done in which all 'unclear' scores on internal validity items were considered 'positive'.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Different thresholds for high quality</HEADING>
<P>When using a threshold of 40% for studies on prevention, one more RCT was considered high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1995</LINK>), resulting in a total of four high quality RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1990</LINK>). Consequently, the conclusion on the comparison of lumbar supports versus 'no intervention' changed from 'moderate evidence to 'strong evidence that lumbar supports do not prevent the incidence of LBP or reduce the length of sick leave.</P>
<P>When using a threshold of 40% for studies on treatment, two more RCTs were also considered high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Penrose-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Penrose 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valle_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Valle-Jones 1992</LINK>). For the comparisons of lumbar supports to 'no intervention', the conclusions on pain reduction, overall improvement and return-to-work were still the same. The conclusion on improved functional status changed from 'moderate evidence' to 'strong evidence' that lumbar supports are effective for improving functional status in the short term.</P>
<P>When using a threshold of 60% for studies on prevention, one study (<LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1990</LINK>) changed from a high quality to a low quality RCT, but the results and conclusions did not change. Using a threshold of 60% for studies on treatment, results and conclusions did not change.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. All 'unclear' scores 'positive'</HEADING>
<P>When all 'unclear' scores were assumed to be 'positive', five studies on prevention (<LINK REF="STD-Alexander-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Alexander 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaber-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gaber 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walsh-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Walsh 1990</LINK>) and seven studies on treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Dalichau-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dalichau 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Doran-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Doran 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gibson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gibson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Million-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penrose-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Penrose 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Valle_x002d_Jones-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Valle-Jones 1992</LINK>) were considered high quality RCTs at the 50% cut-off.</P>
<P>The conclusion for the comparison 'lumbar support versus no intervention' changed from 'moderate evidence' to 'strong evidence' that lumbar supports do not prevent the incidence of LBP or the length of sick leave. The conclusions for the comparison 'lumbar support versus no intervention' on overall improvement and return-to-work did not change.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 12:49:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Selection bias</HEADING>
<P>Despite the extensive search strategy used to identify all relevant studies on the effectiveness of lumbar supports, some studies may have been missed. The keywords used in the missing studies may not have been in accordance with those used in the search strategy of the present review, or the journals may have been indexed in other databases. However, the risk of selection bias is probably low. It is unlikely that we missed any study, because we supplemented the search strategy with checking references and contacting experts.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>The two review authors who assessed the methodological quality were not blinded for authors, journal or institution. The potential bias caused by the non-blinded quality assessment was expected to be low. First, neither review authors had a conflict of interest. This means that the review authors did not have any (financial or other) interest in positive or negative results. Second, one review author was an expert in the field of LBP and very familiar with the literature. Blinding this review author did not seem feasible. The other review author was not familiar with the literature and blinding this review author did not seem necessary, because this review author was new to the field. Furthermore, we presented the methodological criteria list, the operationalization of criteria, and the final results of the assessment, so readers can determine whether they agree with the conclusions.</P>
<P>The methodological quality was defined by the internal validity criteria, which refer to characteristics of the study that might be related to bias. The methodological quality of the studies included in our review was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met our pre-set level for high quality of more than 50% positive scores. Compared to the previous review, the methodological quality improved very little. The quality changed somewhat because non-randomised trials that were included in the first review were deleted from this update, but there was no clear improvement in methodological quality. Prevalent methodological flaws were: no concealment of treatment allocation, no assessment of co-interventions, compliance, no blinding of patients or outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Although the authors of fifteen studies claimed that their study design was a randomised controlled trial, an appropriate method of randomisation and concealment of treatment allocation was described in only three papers. Most studies did not report data on co-interventions or compliance. Two studies reported low (<LINK REF="STD-Reddell-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Reddell 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Poppel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Poppel 1998</LINK>) and three reported high compliance (<LINK REF="STD-Hsieh-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hsieh 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>). Compliance is a confounding factor when studying the effectiveness of lumbar supports. Because compliance with wearing lumbar supports is generally low and a matter of self-selection, it is difficult to be certain of their real effectiveness.</P>
<P>Blinding of subjects is difficult in trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. Only one study succeeded in blinding the patients (<LINK REF="STD-Million-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1981</LINK>). Even more important should be blinding of the outcome assessor. However, only three of the thirteen studies reported the use of a blinded outcome assessor.</P>
<P>The validity, reliability and responsiveness of outcome measures were often not reported. Therefore, it is unclear whether the instruments actually measured what they were supposed to measure, whether they measured with consistency, and whether they were able to measure change over time.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Levels of evidence</HEADING>
<P>In this review, we refrained from statistical pooling because of the heterogeneity of study populations, control interventions and outcome measures. The conclusions on the effectiveness of lumbar supports were based on a qualitative analysis of the strength of scientific evidence (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>). We had pre-defined the levels of evidence; consistency was defined as 75% or more of the trials showing effects in the same direction. High quality was defined as meeting five or more of the 10 quality items. The classification of the comparisons to a level of evidence was sometimes arbitrary. When results of several studies regarding a comparison did not entirely agree with each other, it was difficult to decide whether these results should be entitled as 'generally consistent findings' or as 'inconsistent findings'. For example, if all trials were positive, it is obvious that the findings are consistent, but are findings also consistent if five out of seven trials are positive or if four out of seven are positive? We have presented extensive tables, so readers can determine for themselves if they agree with the classification of evidence in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of lumbar supports in prevention of low-back pain</HEADING>
<P>Seven preventive RCTs (14,435 people) were included in this systematic review. The results showed that there is moderate evidence that lumbar supports do not prevent short- or long-term LBP or sick leave more effectively than no intervention; and that there is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than training in lifting techniques in preventing long-term LBP and sick leave. Addition of two recent RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Kraus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kraus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roelofs-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Roelofs 2007</LINK>) and removal of CCTs did not change the results of the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Jellema-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jellema 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>) and this updated review still supports the original conclusions. The results of this systematic review are also in line with the European guidelines for prevention of low-back pain (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2005</LINK>). Based on various reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Ammendolia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammendolia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Poppel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Poppel 2004</LINK>), these guidelines recommend that the general population and workers do not wear lumbar supports to prevent LBP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effectiveness of lumbar supports in treatment of low-back pain</HEADING>
<P>Eight therapeutic RCTs (1361 people) were included in this systematic review. The results showed that there is limited evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention for short-term pain reduction and improved functional status for patients with chronic LBP. The results are still in line with the previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Jellema-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jellema 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Tulder-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Tulder 2000</LINK>). Addition of two recent RCTs and removal of CCTs did not change the conclusions. The results of this systematic review are also in line with the European guidelines for the management of chronic low-back pain that do not recommend using lumbar supports (<LINK REF="REF-Airaksinen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Airaksinen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trial specifically evaluated lumbar supports for acute LBP. There was conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of lumbar supports as treatment compared to no intervention or other interventions for a mixed population with acute, subacute and chronic LBP.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether lumbar supports are effective as supplement to another preventive intervention. It is still unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than no or other interventions for treatment of low-back pain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future trials should be of high quality and special attention should be paid to adequate compliance. Future trials should attempt to quantify effects in patient subgroups, particularly acute, subacute, and chronic. Also, they should focus on primary and secondary prevention separately. Outcomes are likely to be different for each of these groups. Outcomes may also be different for different types of supports and may be dose-related.</P>

<TH>
<P>Criteria for a judgment of yes for the sources of risk of bias</P>
</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<UL>
<LI>Was a method of randomization performed? In order to score 'positive', a random (unpredictable) assignment sequence has to be performed. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the treatment allocation concealed? In order to score 'positive', the assignment has to be generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the patient blinded? The reviewer determines when enough information about the blinding is given in order to give a 'positive' score.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the outcome assessor blinded? The reviewer determines (per outcome parameter) when enough information about blinding is given in order to give a 'positive' score.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the withdrawal/drop-out rate unlikely to cause bias? In order to score 'positive', a description is needed of the participants who were included in the study but 1) did not complete the observation period or 2) were not included in the analysis. But, when the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs during the intervention period exceeds 20%, 'negative' should be scored. (N.B. these percentages are arbitrary, not supported by literature).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was an intention-to-treat analysis used? In order to score 'positive' all randomized patients/subjects need to be reported/analyzed for the most important moments of effect measurement in the group they were allocated to by randomization, irrespective of non-compliance and co-interventions. N.B. This does not apply to the missing values.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators?</LI>
</UL>
<P>Prevention: In order to score a 'yes', groups have to be similar at baseline with regarding to at least three of the following important prognostic characteristics: 1) age, 2) incidence and/or duration of a previous episode of low back pain, 3) incidence and/or duration of a present episode of low back pain, 4) type of work, 5) value of main outcome measures.</P>
<P>Treatment: In order to score 'positive', groups have to be similar at baseline with regarding to at least three of the following important prognostic characteristics: 1) age, 2) duration of complaints, 3) percentage of patients with radiating pain and 4) value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
<P>Moreover, for each group the mean and SD values of these characteristics have to be presented (for example in a table). When they aren't presented, the score is 'unclear'.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Were co-interventions avoided or comparable between groups? In order to score 'positive', co-interventions should either be avoided in the trial design or should be comparable between the index and control groups.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the compliance rate (in each group) unlikely to cause bias? The reviewer determines when the compliance to the interventions is acceptable to score 'positive'. This determination is based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s). In case of a lumbar support the reported number of hours a day and the reported total number of days the subjects actually wore the belt should be acceptable enough to answer the research question without bias caused by compliance.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Was the timing of the outcome assessment in both groups comparable? In order to score 'positive', the timing of the outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments. Only when a statement is made about a different timing of the outcome measurements, 'negative' should be scored.</LI>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Each criterion was scored as 'positive', 'negative' or 'unclear'.<BR/>
<BR/>1) Are the patients described in detail so that you can decide whether they are comparable to those that you see in your practice? In order to score 'positive' there should be enough information about the subject (age, type of work) and low back pain (type, duration)<BR/>
<BR/>2) Are the interventions and treatment settings described well enough so that you can provide the same for your patients? In order to score 'positive' there should be enough information about the type of lumbar support<BR/>
<BR/>3) Were all clinically relevant outcomes measured and reported? In order to score 'positive' at least the outcomes of pain and functional status should be reported<BR/>
<BR/>4) Is the size of the effect clinically important? In order to score 'positive' the outcome of pain has improved for at least 20%, and the outcome of functional status for at least 10%. This is not defined for work.<BR/>
<BR/>5) Are the likely treatment benefits worth the potential harms? In order to score 'positive' there should be benefits.<BR/>
