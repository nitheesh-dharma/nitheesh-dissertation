<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Does diuretic treatment reduce the duration of oxygen therapy and respiratory symptoms and shorten hospital stay in term infants presenting with the clinical syndrome of transient tachypnoea of the newborn?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> It is common for full-term infants born by elective caesarean section to have laboured, rapid breathing (tachypnoea) and to require oxygen for about 48 hours. This transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) is responsible for about half of all cases of neonatal respiratory distress. Although it is transient and not usually serious, the condition requires admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, involves separation of mother and baby, and uses expensive resources. The underlying pathology of TTN is not well understood. The most commonly proposed mechanism is a delay in the resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth. Diuretic medication, including furosemide, may reduce fluid in the lungs.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Studies characteristics: </B>We identified two randomised controlled trials involving 100 babies that compared the effect of furosemide given orally or intravenously versus placebo or no treatment in babies of less than seven days of age, born at 37 or more weeks of gestation with TTN. No new trials were identified in the 2015 update.</P>
<P>
<B>Results: </B>Neither trial demonstrated a statistically significant impact of furosemide on transient tachypnoea of the newborn regarding duration of symptoms or length of hospitalisation.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion:</B> Diuretics cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-27 22:50:56 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) results from delayed clearance of lung liquid and is a common cause of admission of full-term infants to neonatal intensive care units. The condition is particularly common after elective caesarean section. Conventional treatment involves appropriate oxygen administration and continuous positive airway pressure in some cases. Most infants receive antibiotic therapy. Hastening the clearance of lung liquid may shorten the duration of the symptoms and reduce complications.</P>

<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the effect of diuretics administration versus placebo or no treatment in infants of less than seven days of age, born at 37 or more weeks of gestation with the clinical picture of transient tachypnoea of the newborn.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-04-22 17:13:05 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted and analysed data according to the methods outlined in the latest <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Two review authors assessed trial quality in each potentially eligible manuscript and two review authors extracted data.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-28 02:35:25 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our previous systematic review included two trials enrolling a total of 100 infants with transient tachypnoea of the newborn (Wiswell 1985; Karabayir 2006). The updated search revealed no new trials. Wiswell 1985 randomised 50 infants to receive either oral furosemide (2 mg/kg body weight at time of diagnosis followed by a 1 mg/kg dose 12 hours later if the tachypnoea persisted) or placebo. Karabayir 2006 randomised 50 infants to receive either intravenous furosemide (2 mg/kg body weight) or an equal volume of normal saline placebo. Neither trial reported on the need for respiratory support. Neither trial demonstrated a statistically significant impact of furosemide on transient tachypnoea of the newborn regarding duration of symptoms or length of hospitalisation.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-18 13:14:11 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diuretics cannot be recommended as treatment for transient tachypnoea of the newborn and it should not be used unless additional data become available. This finding suggests that either furosemide is not effective in promoting resorption of lung fluid, or factors other than delayed resorption of this fluid contribute to the pathogenesis of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. The question remains as to whether furosemide given to the infant (or even to the mother before caesarean section) might shorten the duration of the illness. As elective caesarean section continues at a high level, these two interventions might be worthy of trials.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-28 01:10:18 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-28 01:06:57 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) was first described by <LINK REF="REF-Avery-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1966</LINK>. It is generally considered a benign condition that occurs in about 1% of newborns (<LINK REF="STD-Karabayir-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Karabayir 2006</LINK>). In infants born at term, TTN leads to rapid respiration (&gt; 60 bpm), grunting and retraction at, or shortly after, birth. Investigations for infection will be negative and the oxygen requirement usually does not rise above 40%. Chest X-ray shows streaky interstitial or pleural fluid, prominent interlobar fissures, perihilar vascular markings and sometimes hyperinflation. The symptoms often resolve by 48 hours, occasionally lasting as long as five days. The condition is more common in term infants born by elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1995</LINK>). It may be difficult to distinguish between congenital pneumonia and TTN and many infants receive antibiotics until blood cultures are known to be negative. TTN is regarded as being synonymous with wet lung, benign unexplained respiratory distress in the newborn, neonatal tachypnoea and type 2 respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1999</LINK>). The underlying pathology of TTN is not well understood. The most commonly proposed mechanism is a delay in the resorption of foetal lung fluid after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Elias-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elias 2006</LINK>). Lung liquid that has been rendered high in protein by either mild asphyxia or amniotic fluid aspiration may contribute to the problem (<LINK REF="REF-Avery-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avery 1966</LINK>). In addition, elective caesarean section deprives the foetus of the effect of endogenous catecholamines on resorption of lung liquid.</P>
<P>The reported prevalence of TTN varies, with some studies attributing up to 40% of neonatal respiratory distress to TTN (<LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 1979</LINK>); and an overall incidence of around 11 per 1000 births. With a tendency to delivery by elective caesarean section for an increasing number of obstetric and foetal indications, the number of infants admitted to neonatal units with TTN is likely to rise.</P>
<P>There are no specific biochemical or haematological markers and the diagnosis is essentially clinical with typical radiological features on chest X-ray.<BR/>The natural history is of gradual improvement of respiratory signs as foetal lung fluid is reabsorbed. Treatment is supportive with oxygen to maintain acceptable saturations and occasionally continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and even endotracheal ventilation to obtain adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance. TTN usually settles within 24 hours but may persist for several days and in its more severe forms may be associated with secondary surfactant-deficient lung disease; and in extreme cases, persistent pulmonary hypertension.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-27 18:45:26 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diuretics have been shown to affect fluid dynamics in the lung by both diuretic and non-diuretic actions (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Belik-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belik 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasap-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasap 2008</LINK>). The diuretic response following intravenous furosemide is more rapid than oral furosemide and injection of furosemide is considered safer in infants with respiratory distress (<LINK REF="REF-Kasap-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasap 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-28 01:08:03 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In theory, diuresis should increase the plasma oncotic pressure and draw water from the lungs into the pulmonary vascular bed. This has been shown not to be the case in an adult canine model (<LINK REF="REF-Wickerts-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wickerts 1992</LINK>). It seems more likely that non-diuretic effects are predominant, with several authors showing improved pulmonary dynamics without demonstrable diuresis (<LINK REF="REF-Demling-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Demling 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prabhu-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prabhu 1997</LINK>). Given the effects of furosemide on the fluid-overloaded lung, it is reasonable to hypothesise that it might alter the clinical course of TTN.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-10-28 01:10:18 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although TTN is generally a benign self-limiting condition there is much to be gained from shortening its clinical course provided this can be achieved without side effects. Hastening the clearance of retained foetal lung fluid should improve oxygenation, shorten the clinical course and may reduce complication rates; separation of mothers from their newborn infants is generally undesirable; and furthermore there are significant economic implications of reducing the duration of hospital stay.</P>

We planned to analyse treatment effects on categorical outcomes using risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB), and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). We used mean difference (MD) for treatment effects measured on a continuous scale. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-10-28 02:08:21 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two trials were found to be eligible for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Wiswell-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Wiswell 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karabayir-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Karabayir 2006</LINK>). The results failed to show a statistically significant impact of oral and intravenous furosemide on the duration of oxygen requirement in transient tachypnoea of the newborn. The methodological quality of the two studies was satisfactory. Although no adverse effects were reported in either study, it should be noted that the studies were not powered to look for potential side effects. Both oral and intravenous furosemide have been shown not to be appropriate in infants with an acute respiratory disturbance and both have no effect on the clinical progression of TTN.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-28 02:08:21 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results demonstrate that 2 mg/kg of oral and intravenous furosemide had no effect on the clinical progression of TTN. This finding suggests that furosemide is not effective in the resorption of the fluid in the lungs; or factors other than delayed resorption of the fluid in the lungs, for example surfactant deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of TTN. However, there is a need to conduct more studies with larger sample sizes. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution. No significant difference was found between oral and intravenous furosemide in relation to improvement of any of the mentioned outcomes such as tachypnoea. We were unable to identify any possible side effects or any possible long-term effects. Therefore, further large randomised controlled trials are needed.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-11-05 19:28:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-10-27 21:39:01 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence of included studies in this review was reasonable. The two studies adequately reported sequence generation; however, concealment of allocation was insufficiently reported. Blinding of interventions was achieved; however, incomplete outcome data were not addressed. There was risk of 'other' bias in the studies, due to unclear reporting of whether a sample size calculation was undertaken or because of the small sample size in the included studies in this review.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-27 21:42:46 +0300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is plausible that with the increasing rates of elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Khor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khor 2000</LINK>), the incidence of transient tachypnoea of the newborn will also increase. Although not usually seriously ill, infants with transient tachypnoea of the newborn may develop secondary surfactant-deficient lung disease and require mechanical ventilation. No group has to date systematically investigated the role of intravenous furosemide or any other diuretic in transient tachypnoea of the newborn. If shown to reduce length of stay or requirement for oxygen or both, then diuretics could have a significant economic benefit. Such a study would almost certainly have to be multicentre in design. Furosemide has been shown to pass freely across the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Beermann-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beermann 1978</LINK>). Intravenous administration of furosemide to the mother before elective caesarean section might also be worthy of investigation as a way of assisting clearance of foetal lung liquid and reducing the duration of transient tachypnoea.</P>
