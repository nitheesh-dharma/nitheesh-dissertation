<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-15 10:29:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth. The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks. However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent. Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both. Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception. These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities. Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action.</P>
<P>There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non-surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as.</P>
<P>1. Surgical &#8211; a variety of procedures.<BR/>2. Laser treatment &#8211; low-level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation.<BR/>3. Medical &#8211; treatment with drugs including antiepileptics, antidepressants and painkillers.<BR/>4. Counselling &#8211; including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low-level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Low-level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments.</P>
<P>There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better<I> </I>in the lip and chin areas with low-level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-15 10:15:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>Iatrogenic injury of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve or both is a known complication of oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures. Injury to these two branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve may result in altered sensation associated with the ipsilateral lower lip or tongue or both and may include anaesthesia, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia, hypoaesthesia and hyperaesthesia. Injury to the lingual nerve may also affect taste perception on the affected side of the tongue. The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these injuries are temporary in nature and resolve within eight weeks. However, if the injury persists beyond six months it is deemed to be permanent. Surgical, medical and psychological techniques have been used as a treatment for such injuries, though at present there is no consensus on the preferred intervention, or the timing of the intervention.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-15 13:28:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>To evaluate the effects of different interventions and timings of interventions to treat iatrogenic injury of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerves.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-04-14 14:19:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trial Register (to 9 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 9 October 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 October 2013). No language restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-04-15 10:16:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions to treat patients with neurosensory defect of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve or both as a sequela of iatrogenic injury.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-01-15 13:29:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We contacted authors to clarify the inclusion criteria of the studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-04-15 10:19:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>Two studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review. The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years. Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment compared to placebo laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury.</P>
<P>Patient-reported altered sensation was partially reported in one study and fully reported in another. Following treatment with laser therapy, there was some evidence of an improvement in the subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit in the lip and chin areas compared to placebo, though the estimates were imprecise: a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the chin of 8.40 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 13.13) and a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the lip of 21.79 cm (95% CI 5.29 to 38.29). The overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low; the outcome data were fully reported in one small study of 13 patients, with differential drop-out in the control group, and patients suffered only partial loss of sensation. No studies reported on the effects of the intervention on the remaining primary outcomes of pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or adverse events.</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the studies, indirectness of the evidence and the imprecision of the results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-01-15 20:03:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>There is clearly a need for randomised controlled clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of surgical, medical and psychological interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries. Primary outcomes of this research should include: patient-focused morbidity measures including altered sensation and pain, pain, quantitative sensory testing and the effects of delayed treatment. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-15 14:10:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:44:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>The lingual and inferior alveolar nerves are branches of the third, or mandibular division, of the trigeminal nerve. The lingual nerve provides innervation to the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the lingual mandibular gingivae, while the inferior alveolar nerve supplies sensation to the ipsilateral lower lip, buccal mandibular gingivae and teeth. The anatomical position of these nerves places them at increased risk of injury during certain surgical procedures. Iatrogenic injury of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve is a relatively rare but serious sequelae of oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures. The aetiology of injuries to these nerves includes: dental local anaesthetic injection, third lower molar surgery, dental implant placement or removal, endodontic therapy, trauma, ablative surgery, orthognathic surgery, intubation, and submandibular gland surgery.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-15 10:31:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>Injury to the inferior alveolar nerve can result in impaired sensation to the area innervated by the damaged nerve, including altered sensation associated with the ipsilateral lower lip, chin, buccal mandibular gingivae and dentition. Damage to the lingual nerve may cause unilateral sensory deficit of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the lingual mandibular gingivae.</P>
<P>The impaired sensation can be classified as (<A HREF="http://www.iasp-pain.org">www.iasp-pain.org</A>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Paraesthesia - An abnormal sensation, whether spontaneous or evoked.</LI>
<LI>Anaesthesia - Complete absence of perception of stimuli including touch.</LI>
<LI>Dysaesthesia - An unpleasant abnormal sensation, whether spontaneous or evoked.</LI>
<LI>Hyperalgesia - Increased pain from a stimulus that normally provokes pain.</LI>
<LI>Allodynia - Pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain.</LI>
<LI>Hypoaesthesia - Decreased sensitivity to stimulation, excluding the special senses.</LI>
<LI>Hyperaesthesia - Increased sensitivity to stimulation, excluding the special senses.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The injury to the lingual nerve may also affect taste perception on the same side.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Ageusia - Loss of taste perception.</LI>
<LI>Dysgeusia - Altered taste perception.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these injuries are temporary in nature and resolve within eight weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Blackburn-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blackburn 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pogrel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pogrel 2001</LINK>). However, if the injury persists beyond six months it is deemed to be permanent (<LINK REF="REF-Rood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rood 1990</LINK>). Neurosensory disturbances arising from damage to the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve can cause significant distress; patients often complain of a lower quality of life, psychological discomfort, and social disability and handicap (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2001</LINK>). Iatrogenic injuries are also a prevalent medico-legal issue.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-04-15 12:44:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>This review is based on a Cochrane protocol 'Interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar nerve injury' (New Reference). There are a number of reported interventions for the treatment of iatrogenic nerve injury; they can be categorised as follows.</P>
<P>(1) Surgical intervention.</P>
<UL>
<LI>External neurolysis: This is a technique that involves releasing the nerve from its connective tissue bed and removing any restrictive fibrous/scar tissue or bone. Injury to the surrounding tissue may result in scar tissue formation which may cause compression/constriction of the nerve and block nerve transmission, or in some cases prevent nerve recovery (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joshi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Joshi 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Internal neurolysis: This is a technique that aims to examine and release the nerve fascicles from epineural fibrosis. It is indicated where there is evidence of nerve fibrosis and associated changes in the appearance of the nerve. This procedure is not recommended by some surgeons as it may lead to further scar tissue formation (<LINK REF="REF-Ziccardi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziccardi 2007</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Neurorrhaphy: This method is also called coaptation or direct anastomosis. It is indicated where the nerve is transected and its two ends can be sutured together without tension. Usually, defects of less than 1 cm can be repaired by direct suture. Immediate repair using this method is advocated when a nerve transection is witnessed (<LINK REF="STD-Tay-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Tay 2008</LINK>). The repair is by approximation of the two ends and application of epineural sutures.</LI>
<LI>Neuroma excision: The formation of a neuroma is the result of disorganised axonal regeneration or sprouting at the injury site in an attempt to reach the distal stump. The aetiology of this injury may include not only section of the nerve but also crushing, laceration, stretching, and the pathological effects of objects such as root tips, endodontic medicaments, implants etc (<LINK REF="REF-Chau-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chau 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregg-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregg 1990</LINK>). It may be in the form of an amputation neuroma, lateral neuroma or neuroma in continuity. The nerve fibres within a neuroma may show abnormal spontaneous activity or mechanical sensitivity resulting in the development of sensory disorders such as dysaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Devor-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devor 1994</LINK>). The surgical treatment of choice is excision of the neuroma, followed by direct apposition and suturing, or grafting depending on whether the nerve stumps can be approximated without tension.</LI>
<LI>Autologous nerve grafting: This method allows for bridging of a defect between nerve stumps in cases where the post-injury defect does not allow for direct approximation of the neural ends without tension. The donor tissue for such interpositional grafts is usually the sural nerve, greater auricular nerve or medial antebrachial nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Eppley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eppley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wessberg-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessberg 1982</LINK>). However, autologous nerve graft techniques involve unavoidable donor site morbidity. Alternatively, denatured skeletal muscle autografts can be used (<LINK REF="REF-Rath-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rath 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Tubulization: In cases where post-injury defects do not allow for direct apposition, a hollow conduit structure can also be used that allows nerve regeneration to occur. Autologous as well as alloplastic materials can be used. <LINK REF="STD-Pogrel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pogrel 2001</LINK> advocates the use of saphenous vein for repair of the lingual nerve and facial vein for inferior alveolar nerve repair. Alloplastic conduits for reconstruction of lingual and inferior alveolar nerve defects include: polyglycolic acid (PGA) bioabsorbable tubes (<LINK REF="STD-Crawley-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Crawley 1992</LINK>), PGA-collagen tubes (<LINK REF="STD-Seo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Seo 2008</LINK>), collagen tubes (NeuraGen) (<LINK REF="STD-Farole-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Farole 2008</LINK>), and Gore-Tex tubes (<LINK REF="STD-Pitta-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pitta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pogrel-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pogrel 1998</LINK>). However, there is general agreement that more studies in the field are necessary.</LI>

<P>(2) Laser treatment.</P>
<P>Low-level laser therapy has been used for the treatment of partial sensory loss in patients suffering from iatrogenic injuries to the inferior alveolar nerve (<LINK REF="STD-Khullar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khullar-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 1996b</LINK>). The application of the laser treatment before and after surgical procedures including sagittal split osteotomies has been shown to speed up the recovery process (<LINK REF="STD-Miloro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miloro 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>(3) Medical treatment.</P>
<P>Injury to a peripheral nerve may result in changes within the central nervous system. Dysfunction of the peripheral and central neurons may lead to the development of neuropathic pain. The pharmacological treatment of this condition is based on the following medications: antiepileptics, antidepressants and analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heir-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heir 2008</LINK>). These drugs can be administered via enteral and topical routes.</P>
<P>(4) Counselling.</P>
<P>This group of interventions includes psychological treatment and sensory re-education methods (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2001</LINK>). These may employ the following techniques: cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation therapy, behaviour modification, electromyographic biofeedback, and hypnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Feinmann-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feinmann 2004</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-15 11:58:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>The aim for any intervention for the treatment of peripheral sensory nerve injury is to improve the neurosensory perception and therefore the quality of life of the patient. However, although many attempts have been made to improve results, these have had limited success, outcomes to date have been variable, and full recovery is extremely difficult to achieve. Ultimately any intervention should aim to reduce morbidity and improve the patient's quality of life.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-10 10:36:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>At present, there appears to be no consensus on the type of intervention (surgical, medical, psychological), or the timing of intervention for the treatment of iatrogenic alveolar and lingual nerve injury. Given the morbidity and significant psychological distress arising from such injuries it is important to establish the effects of the available interventions.</P>

<P>The assessment of risk of bias of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by the review authors as part of the data extraction process. We used the recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed each study on six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias) and assigned a risk of bias of low, high or unclear for each domain. For the blinding domain we assessed separately the risk of bias from blinding of participants/personnel and outcome assessors.</P>

One study with 13 analysed patients reported patient's subjective assessment of the degree of sensory deficit on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) (<LINK REF="STD-Khullar-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 1996b</LINK>). There was some evidence of an effect, with the laser group reporting an improvement in subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit (i.e. a reduction in degree of sensory deficit), as measured by the VAS scale. This was observed for both sites of measurement: the chin (mean difference (MD) 8.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 13.13) and the lip (MD 21.79; 95% CI 5.29 to 38.29).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main result</HEADING>
<P>Despite the large number of studies detailing different interventions for the treatment of iatrogenic trigeminal nerve injury, we found only two, small, low quality randomised controlled trials of laser therapy which were eligible for inclusion in this review. Surgical and non-surgical methods have been reported as beneficial in some circumstances for the improvement of neurosensory deficit. However, such methods have yet to be fully evaluated in randomised controlled trials, and at present, no firm conclusions can be drawn as to whether any of these methods provide beneficial results. There is also a lack of trials directly comparing these methods or addressing the issue of optimal timing for carrying out the procedure. There are two ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chiung-Shing-Huang" TYPE="STUDY">Chiung Shing Huang</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yu_x002d_Fang-Liao" TYPE="STUDY">Yu-Fang Liao</LINK>). Despite the fact that they are both active randomised controlled trials, they are currently not recruiting participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</HEADING>
<P>It has not been possible to fully achieve the objectives of this review as there is a lack of trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The number of included studies was low (two), and these only compared one type of intervention (laser treatment) against a placebo; crucially, the total number of participants randomised (31) was too few to fully address the efficacy of the intervention.</P>
<P>There were no studies evaluating the effects of other surgical interventions, or medical or psychological interventions.</P>
<P>The included studies reported on only one (altered sensation) of the five patient-reported primary outcomes for evaluation in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>These trials (<LINK REF="STD-Khullar-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Khullar-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Khullar 1996b</LINK>) cannot be considered as a valuable source of information on how to manage iatrogenic trigeminal nerve injury. The overall quality of the evidence was very low, a judgement based on limitations in the implementation and reporting of the trials and the imprecision of the results for the outcomes where reported, directness of the evidence (a small group of patients with only partial sensory loss). There is insufficient evidence that low-level laser therapy leads to improved or quicker neurosensory recovery and thus contributes to improvement of patients' quality of life.</P>

<P>This review includes only laser treatment for iatrogenic inferior alveolar nerve injury due to a lack of randomised controlled trials for other interventions. Nevertheless <LINK REF="STD-Miloro-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miloro 2000</LINK> also reports positive results using low-level laser for sensation recovery after nerve damage.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:06:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>There is a lack of evidence to support or refute the effects of the surgical, medical and psychological interventions in the treatment of inferior alveolar or lingual nerve injury, and very low quality evidence to support the effects of laser therapy on patient-reported altered sensation. Despite the lack of evidence, we should not abandon the development of early referral criteria from general practitioners to specialist centres. All front-line healthcare staff should be educated and trained in this area to increase and improve awareness, and to recognise and provide support for people with these injuries. This training should emphasize the competence of the surgeon, methods to help avoid iatrogenic nerve injury, and the effect these injuries can have on a patient's quality of life.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:07:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>There is a need for randomised controlled clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of surgical, medical and psychological interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries. These trials should be conducted in specialist centres seeing large numbers of patients presenting with inferior alveolar or lingual nerve injury. Primary outcomes of such research should include: patient-focused morbidity measures, altered sensation, pain, quantitative sensory testing and the effects of delayed treatment. Improved partnership between local general practitioners in the primary care setting and secondary specialist healthcare organisations may be the first crucial step in the development of such trials in this area.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-04-15 11:42:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="kasia ">
<P>We wrote two separate protocols describing interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar nerve injury (0094) and interventions for iatrogenic lingual nerve injury (0093). These were almost identical and therefore the protocols were merged into a single protocol 'Interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injury' (0094) in 2009. The new search strategy has been developed for this review since the original protocols were written.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of 'altered sensation' in the protocol has been changed to 'patient-reported altered sensation' for the review.</P>

<P>The search strategy for the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register has been amended for the Cochrane Register of Studies:</P>
<P>#1 (("inferior dental nerve*" or "inferior alveolar nerve*" or "mandibular nerve*" or "trigeminal nerve*" or "lingual nerve*" or "lingual dental nerve*")) AND (INREGISTER)<BR/>#2 (("sensory disturbance*" or "taste disorder*" or "neurosensory deficit*" or "somatosensory disorder*" or hyperalgesia or hypoaesthesia or paraesthesia or hyposthesia or paraesthesia or injur* or damag* or contus* or section* or trauma* or lesion* or morbid*)) AND (INREGISTER)<BR/>#3 ((repair* or surg* or anastamos* or graft* or medical* or analgesi* or antidepressant* or anti-depressant* or antiepileptic* or anti-epileptic*)) AND (INREGISTER)<BR/>#4 (#1 and #2 and #3) AND (INREGISTER)</P>
<P>The original version of this review used the following search strategy for the ProCite software:</P>
<P>(("inferior dental nerve*" or "inferior alveolar nerve*" or "mandibular nerve*" or "trigeminal nerve*" or "lingual nerve*" or "lingual dental nerve*") AND ("sensory disturbance" or "taste disorder*" or "neurosensory deficit*" or "somatosensory disorder*" or hyperalgesia or hypaesthesia or paresthesia or hypesthesia or paraesthesia or inju* or damage* or contus* or section* or trauma* or lesion* or morbid*) AND (repair* or surg* or anastamos* or graft* or medical* or analgesi* or antidepressant* or anti-depressant* or antiepileptic* or anti-epileptic*))</P>
