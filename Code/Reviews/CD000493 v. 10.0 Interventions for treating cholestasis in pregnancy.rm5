<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-13 15:07:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Obstetric cholestasis is a liver disorder in pregnancy that appears most often in the third trimester of pregnancy. The main symptom of this condition is itching (pruritus), which can be quite distressful to the pregnant woman. Bile acids accumulate within the liver and the blood level of bile acids are raised. The signs and symptoms spontaneously clear within the first few days after birth, or within two to three weeks. This condition is associated with preterm birth and is thought to be associated with complications in the unborn babies, including stillbirth. Most clinicians deliver babies early to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Therapies such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) seek to detoxify bile acids, or to change how they dissolve. Some agents (activated charcoal, guar gum, cholestyramine) have been used to bind bile acids in the intestine and thus get rid of them. Some of these agents have potential adverse effects for mothers due to the depletion of vitamin K, required for blood clotting.</P>
<P>We included 21 randomised controlled trials involving 1197 participants in this review. The trials were mostly at moderate to high risk of bias. Compared with placebo, UDCA showed improvement in itching in five trials (228 women), no benefit was observed in one trial (16 women) and one trial reported improvement only in women with severe disease (94 women). Distress in the unborn baby or symptoms of asphyxia were reported in five trials (304 women) and although there were fewer instances of fetal distress in the UDCA groups compared with placebo, the difference was not significant. The results from the four trials comparing SAMe and placebo were conflicting. Two trials (48 women) reported better pruritus scores for SAMe compared with placebo and two trials (34 women) reported no significant differences between groups for the disappearance of their pruritus.</P>
<P>Comparisons of guar gum, activated charcoal, dexamethasone, cholestyramine, Salvia, Yinchenghao decoction, Danxioling or Yiganling (used in Chinese medicine for their liver-protective properties) with placebo or one with another was based on data from one trial. Further trials are required before any firm conclusions might be made about their effectiveness.</P>
<P>One trial (63 women) compared early delivery versus expectant management. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths in either group. No significant differences in caesarean section, passage of meconium-stained liquor or admission to neonatal intensive care unit were observed.</P>

<P>Obstetric cholestasis has been linked to adverse maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. As the pathophysiology is poorly understood, therapies have been empiric.

<P>We included 21 trials with a total of 1197 women. They were mostly at moderate to high risk of bias. They assessed 11 different interventions resulting in 15 different comparisons.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) showed improvement in pruritus in five (228 women) out of seven trials. There were no significant differences in instances of fetal distress in the UDCA groups compared with placebo (average risk ratio (RR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.02; five trials, 304 women; random-effects analysis: Tau² = 0.74; I² = 48%). There were significantly fewer total preterm births with UDCA (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73; two trials, 179 women). The difference for spontaneous preterm births was not significant (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.36, two trials, 109 women).</P>
<P>Two trials (48 women) reported lower (better) pruritus scores for S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) compared with placebo, while two other trials of 34 women reported no significant differences between groups.</P>
<P>UDCA was more effective in improving pruritus than either SAMe (four trials; 133 women) or cholestyramine (one trial; 84 women), as was combined UDCA+SAMe when compared with placebo (one trial; 16 women) and SAMe alone (two trials; 68 women). However, combined UDCA+SAMe was no more effective than UDCA alone in regard to pruritus improvement (one trial; 53 women) and two trials (80 women) reported data were insufficient to draw any conclusions from. In one trial comparing UDCA and dexamethasone (83 women), a significant improvement with UDCA was seen only in a subgroup of women with severe obstetric cholestasis (23 women).</P>
<P>Danxiaoling significantly improved pruritus in comparison to Yiganling. No significant differences were seen in pruritus improvement with other interventions.</P>
<P>Eight trials reported fetal or neonatal deaths, with two deaths reported overall (both in the placebo groups).</P>
<P>Women receiving UDCA and cholestyramine experienced nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Guar gum caused mild abdominal distress, diarrhoea and flatulence during the first days of treatment. Women found charcoal suspension unpleasant to swallow. Dexamethasone caused nausea, dizziness and stomach pain in one woman.</P>
<P>One trial (62 women) looked at the timing of delivery intervention. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths in 'early delivery' or the 'await spontaneous labour' group. There were no significant differences in the rates of caesarean section, meconium passage or admission to neonatal intensive care unit between the two groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-12 16:28:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Different approaches to assessing and reporting pruritus precluded pooling of trials comparing the effects of UDCA versus placebo on pruritus, but examination of individual trials suggests that UDCA significantly improves pruritus, albeit by a small amount. Fewer instances of fetal distress/asphyxial events were seen in the UDCA groups when compared with placebo but the difference was not statistically significant. Large trials of UDCA to determine fetal benefits or risks are needed.</P>
<P>A single trial was too small to rule in or out a clinically important effect of early term delivery on caesarean section.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to indicate that SAMe, guar gum, activated charcoal, dexamethasone, cholestyramine, Salvia, Yinchenghao decoction (YCHD), Danxioling and Yiganling, or Yiganling alone or in combination are effective in treating women with cholestasis of pregnancy.<I>

<P>Obstetric cholestasis (also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP)) is an obstetric liver condition appearing most often in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is a relatively benign but often significantly distressing condition maternally, and may adversely affect fetal outcome as seen by associations with preterm labour, fetal distress and stillbirths. Significant features needed for a diagnosis of obstetric cholestasis are pruritus (itching), which classically affects palms and soles but may become generalised but without a rash apart from excoriations, together with increased concentrations of serum bile acids (fasting values usually at least 10 &#956;mol/L) and/or increased concentrations of serum transaminases (e.g. alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 50 U/L). Clinical pruritus may precede the development of abnormal biochemistry (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2001</LINK>). Following birth, there is usually spontaneous relief of signs and symptoms within the first few days, although occasionally resolution may take two to three weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 2006</LINK>). Ongoing clinical symptoms and abnormal liver biochemical values within a month after birth is not consistent with a diagnosis of obstetric cholestasis. Histopathology of the liver of those affected by obstetric cholestasis shows non-specific mild intrahepatic cholestasis with accumulation of bile pigments in hepatocytes and bile duct swelling (<LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 1981</LINK>). Accumulation of bile acids within the liver increases bile acid levels which may cause pruritus, perhaps due to increased availability of brain opiate receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1990</LINK>), although the fact that pruritus may precede abnormal chemistry, including changes in bile acids, suggests that other mechanisms may be at work.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of obstetric cholestasis varies across ethnic groups. It is observed in less than 1% of pregnancies in areas of Central and Western Europe and North America, and 1% to 2% in Scandinavia and the Baltic states, but can be as high as 5% to 15% in Araucanian Indians in Chile and Bolivia (<LINK REF="REF-Lammert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lammert 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pathophysiology</HEADING>
<P>The exact pathophysiology of obstetric cholestasis is unknown but genetic, endocrine and environmental factors have been implicated. The role of genetics remains unsubstantiated but in high prevalence areas a strong family history is often present (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eloranta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eloranta 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qui-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qui 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1982</LINK>). It is thought that mutations of bile acid transporter genes may impair maternal excretion and affect transplacental passage of bile acids (<LINK REF="REF-Milkiewicz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milkiewicz 2002</LINK>). Familial disorders such as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis may be linked to obstetric cholestasis via alterations in the binding domains of liver receptors for DNA and oestrogens (<LINK REF="REF-Leevy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leevy 1997</LINK>). A higher than anticipated incidence of obstetric cholestasis has been found in mothers of patients with these two familial liver disorders (<LINK REF="REF-de-Swiet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Swiet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The precise role of oestrogens is unknown but their causal role is suggested by the appearance of obstetric cholestasis in the third trimester (when oestrogen concentrations are highest), the increased frequency of obstetric cholestasis in pregnancies with high oestrogen concentrations (e.g. multiple pregnancies) (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzalez-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzalez 1989</LINK>), and the resolution of symptoms following the cessation of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Germain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Germain 2002</LINK>). Women who develop obstetric cholestasis are at a higher risk of developing cholestasis with combined oral contraceptive pill use. This also suggests that oestrogen may be an aetiological factor (<LINK REF="REF-de-Swiet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Swiet 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, the role of progesterone in obstetric cholestasis is unclear. While the total serum progesterone levels and the amount excreted in urine are similar to normal pregnancies, large amounts of sulphated progesterone have been detected in the plasma and urine of women with obstetric cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Meng-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meng 1997</LINK>). In-vitro animal studies suggest that high levels of progesterone metabolites induce trans-inhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP), and consequently interfere with bile acid secretion into bile. This leads to intracellular accumulation of bile acids, which disrupts mitochondrial function and may explain the role of progesterone metabolites in the aetiopathogenesis of obstetric cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Vallejo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallejo 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seasonal variation in the prevalence of obstetric cholestasis indicates that environmental factors may have a role (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1997</LINK>). It was also observed that only 60% of Chilean women who develop obstetric cholestasis have it in a subsequent pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Ribalta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribalta 1995</LINK>). Pollutants in pesticides, erucic acid (a constituent of rape-seed oil) and dietary deficiency of selenium have been suggested as possible environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Ribalta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribalta 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>Women present with pruritus without rash characteristically after 30 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1992</LINK>). Pruritus often worsens as the pregnancy progresses. Steatorrhoea and dark urine may occur. Jaundice is a rare symptom (<LINK REF="REF-de-Swiet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Swiet 2002</LINK>). Increased rates of postpartum haemorrhage have been postulated to be due to vitamin K deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1992</LINK>). One study reported a higher rate of postpartum haemorrhage in women who had not taken vitamin K compared to those who had (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2002</LINK>). Gallstones may be present more often in these women (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkinen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkinen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ropponen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ropponen 2006</LINK>). Women with hepatitis C infection have a higher incidence of obstetric cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Locatelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Locatelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paternoster-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paternoster 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Investigations</HEADING>
<P>The most specific laboratory test for obstetric cholestasis is measurement of plasma or serum concentration of bile acids, such as cholic or chenodeoxycholic acid: values may be 10 to 100 times those found in healthy pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Bacq-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacq 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heikkinen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heikkinen 1981</LINK>). Increases of serum transaminases are also common (<LINK REF="REF-Reyes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reyes 1997</LINK>). Unlike in other cholestatic diseases, increases of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) are less common (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2002</LINK>). Upper abdominal ultrasound should be performed to exclude gallbladder disease, duct dilatation and other liver pathology. Serology for hepatitis A, B, C, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) will help to exclude viral pathology, while an autoimmune screen including anti-smooth muscle, liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) and antimitochondrial antibodies will help to identify women with chronic active hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bacq-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bacq 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinonen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinonen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Fetal effects</HEADING>
<P>The implications of excess maternal serum bile acids on the fetus is not completely understood. Increased rates of fetal complications, perinatal mortality rates, stillbirths, low birthweight, preterm labour and birth, and fetal distress in labour have been linked with the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Alsulyman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alsulyman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisk-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisk 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gaudet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jiang-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jiang 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnston-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnston 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laatikainen-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laatikainen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reid-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rioseco-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rioseco 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roszkowski-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roszkowski 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ylostalo-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ylostalo 1975</LINK>). There is evidence to suggest an increased incidence of meconium-stained liquor in women with obstetric cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>) and it is more common in those with serum bile acid levels over 40 µmol/L (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2008</LINK>). No specific fetal monitoring such as cardiotocography (CTG), ultrasound or amniocentesis for meconium presence has found to be beneficial or accurate in predicting an adverse outcome in obstetric cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>). Possible mechanisms that have been suggested include a toxic effect of bile acids on the fetal myocardium, leading to cardiac dysrhythmia and acute anoxia, as demonstrated in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (<LINK REF="REF-Williamson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 2001</LINK>). It has been hypothesised that high bile acid concentration in the mother may cause bile acid pneumonia in the newborn (<LINK REF="REF-Zecca-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zecca 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zecca-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zecca 2008</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-05-02 11:23:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early delivery (e.g. around 37 weeks of pregnancy as discussed by RCOG) is widely practiced across the world on the assumption that it might pre-empt stillbirths (<LINK REF="REF-Roncaglia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roncaglia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Topical emollients may provide temporary relief of pruritus for some women and antihistamines are also used to provide symptom relief. These are widely used (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>). Chlorpheniramine is sometimes prescribed in obstetric cholestasis, although its role in reducing itching in obstetric cholestasis has not been substantiated. Other treatments aimed to decrease bile production (dexamethasone and phenobarbitone) are rarely used in UK practice. In the United States, hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine are commonly used as first-line agents to treat pruritus in women with cholestasis.</P>
<P>Some agents have been used that bind bile acids in the intestine, facilitating their elimination and preventing enterohepatic recirculation (activated charcoal, guar gum, cholestyramine). Agents binding bile acids have potential adverse effects for mothers due to the depletion of vitamin K (<LINK REF="REF-Briggs-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briggs 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other therapies such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) may detoxify bile acids, or change their solubility, thereby allowing increased choleresis and potentially reducing their adverse cellular effects.</P>
<P>Yinchenghao decoction (YCHD), and Danxioling and Yiganling are used in Chinese medicine for their hepato-protective properties. There is little information available on these products.</P>
<P>Potential side effects for mother and fetus exist for dexamethasone, phenobarbitone, SAMe and UDCA since they all cross the placenta.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-05-02 11:23:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early delivery pre-empts stillbirth but can increase caesarean section rate and respiratory distress syndrome in neonates.</P>
<P>The efficacy of topical emollients has not been tested in clinical trials but they seem to provide temporary relief from pruritus in some women and are safe in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2011</LINK>). Calamine lotion contains zinc oxide (ZnO) and 0.5% iron oxide (Fe<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>) and has antipruritic and antiseptic properties. One to two per cent menthol in aqueous cream affects A delta sensory nerve fibres and suppresses histamine-induced itching (<LINK REF="REF-Bernhard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bromma-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromma 1995</LINK>). Diprobase contains liquid paraffin, white soft paraffin, cetomacrogol and cetostearyl alcohol. The principle behind its use is to provide symptomatic relief from itching due to its moisturising properties. Balneum Plus cream contains urea and lauromacrogols; the hydrophilic properties of urea hydrate the skin and the local anaesthetic properties of lauromacrogols cause a soothing effect.</P>
<P>Chlorpheniramine is a first-generation alkylamine antihistamine. Its use in obstetric cholestasis has not been tested in a clinical trial but it seems to provide symptomatic relief from itching in some women. It can cause sedation but is otherwise safe in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Dexamethasone decreases the synthesis of fetal and maternal adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH). It also reduces production and secretion of oestrogen precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulphate from both maternal and fetal adrenal glands (<LINK REF="REF-Kauppila-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kauppila 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simmer-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmer 1975</LINK>). More than 50% of oestrogen in the maternal circulation is derived from the fetor-placental unit. Reduction of maternal oestrogen levels may be the possible mechanism by which it may improve cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Diac-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diac 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The role of phenobarbitone in cholestasis was first demonstrated by Cunningham in 1968 (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1968</LINK>). Animal models suggest that phenobarbitone increases the excretion of bile salts into the biliary tree and enhances bile flow (<LINK REF="REF-Klaasen-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaasen 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1971</LINK>).</P>
<P>Activated charcoal is a highly porous carbon compound. It is widely used to treat acute poisoning following oral ingestion, where it binds to the toxin and prevents its absorption from the stomach and intestine. It can effectively adsorb bile salts in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Krasopoulos-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krasopoulos 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>Guar gum is a viscous polysaccharide obtained from guar beans. It helps to hold plant cells together. Its main use is in the food industry where it is used to thicken or add texture to foods and drinks (<LINK REF="REF-Insel-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insel 2010</LINK>). It is also used to add thickness in lotions and creams, to bind ingredients together in tablets and was widely used as an appetite suppresser in weight loss formulations in the past. Guar gums binds the bile acids to the intestinal contents, which are then expelled from the body (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cholestyramine is a resin that binds to bile acids in the intestine and prevents their reabsorption. Consequently, it may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K, which is essential for blood coagulation. This may increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage in the mother and intracranial haemorrhage in the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Sadler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadler 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>S-adenosylmethionine is produced from methionine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in all mammalian cells. Liver is the principal site where it is produced and metabolised (<LINK REF="REF-Cantoni-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantoni 1952</LINK>). It is an important methyl group donor and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, which are important for maintaining the fluidity of hepatic cell membranes and excretion of oestrogen metabolites (<LINK REF="REF-Boelsterli-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boelsterli 1983</LINK>). Interference with hepatic SAMe biosynthesis may cause and predispose hepatocytes to injury. Experiments on rat models indicate that SAMe can reverse cholestasis (<LINK REF="REF-Stramentinoli-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stramentinoli 1981</LINK>). The exact mechanism of action remains unclear.</P>
<P>Ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid. Studies suggest that UDCA displaces endogenous hydrophobic, detergent-like, toxic bile acids in cholestatic disorders without disrupting the bile acid pool (<LINK REF="REF-Stiehl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiehl 1999</LINK>). UDCA has been attributed with cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Mitsuyoshi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsuyoshi 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodrigues-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigues 1998</LINK>). Animal studies have shown that UDCA improves hepatocellular and cholangiocellular biliary secretion in cholestatic disorders by post-transcriptional regulation of the apical transporters, BSEP and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) (<LINK REF="REF-Beuers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beuers 2001</LINK>). Women with obstetric cholestasis treated with UDCA have reduced levels of cord blood bile acid levels. This may be due to up regulation of the expression of placental MRP2 (<LINK REF="REF-Azzaroli-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azzaroli 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Yinchenghao decoction (YCHD) is extracted from three different herbs:<I> Artemisia capillaries</I>, <I>Gardenia jasminoides</I> Ellis and <I>Rheum officinale</I> Baill. It was invented 2000 years ago and has been used in Chinese medicine to treat a wide range of liver disorders. Downregulation of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by inhibition of NF-kappaB activation (<LINK REF="REF-Cai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cai 2006</LINK>), an antifibrotic action, in part due to the inhibitory action on extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2009</LINK>), and decreased tumour growth factor 1 (TGF-1) mRNA expression and inhibition of lipid peroxidation with reduced hepatic collagen accumulation (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2007</LINK>) have all been postulated as possible mechanisms for its hepato-protective properties.</P>

<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 2001</LINK>), which concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any of the treatments for obstetric cholestasis so far evaluated in randomised controlled trials. None were found to be consistently effective in resolving maternal pruritus. It is therefore important to update this review to incorporate new evidence generated since 2001.</P>

<P>For included studies we noted levels of attrition. We explored the impact of included studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we analysed the data, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, i.e. we made an attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<P>All women had a diagnosis of obstetric cholestasis based on the presence of pruritus in pregnancy and abnormalities of liver function. The onset of pruritus varied among the studies, occurring before week 19 (<LINK REF="STD-Frezza-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Frezza 1984</LINK>), week 28 (<LINK REF="STD-Nicastri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicastri 1998</LINK>), week 29 (<LINK REF="STD-Diaferia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diaferia 1996</LINK>), week 32 (<LINK REF="STD-Ribalta-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ribalta 1991</LINK>), week 33 (<LINK REF="STD-Palma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1997</LINK>), week 35 (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2012</LINK>), in the second half of pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2004</LINK>), the last trimester (<LINK REF="STD-Floreani-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Floreani 1996</LINK>) or the second or third trimester (<LINK REF="STD-Binder-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Binder 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kondrackiene-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kondrackiene 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roncaglia-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Roncaglia 2004</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-PITCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PITCH 2012</LINK>), women were randomised after week 24, irrespective of the time of onset of gestational pruritus.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pruritus</HEADING>
<P>All seven trials (338 women) comparing UDCA and placebo reported this outcome. Two studies (205 women) used a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), four studies (105 women) evaluated itching on a 0-4 categorical scale and one study (18 women) did not elaborate on the methods used to assess pruritus. Studies that used a 0-4 scale (0 = absence of pruritus, 1 = occasional pruritus, 2 = discontinuous pruritus every day, with prevailing asymptomatic lapses, 3 = discontinuous pruritus with prevailing symptomatic lapses and, 4 = constant pruritus) analysed the data as a continuous outcome, which is not ideal as the assumption of normality on a short scale will not be met. We therefore planned to dichotomise data by classifying a pruritus score of 0-2 as mild pruritus, and 3-4 as severe pruritus. We also planned to dichotomise pruritus outcome after the end of intervention as "improvers" and "non-improvers". Only <LINK REF="STD-Palma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1997</LINK> allowed dichotomisation of data. We could not pool results from any of these trials due to the differing methods of measuring and reporting pruritus.</P>
<P>Four studies (158 women) reported a significant improvement in the pruritus score with both UDCA and placebo. Of these, two studies (127 women) reported a statistically significant reduction in pruritus score with UDCA compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Diaferia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diaferia 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PITCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PITCH 2012</LINK>). One study (70 women) reported significant improvements in pruritus score with UDCA only and one study reported no difference in pruritus score on ITT analysis but significant improvement with UDCA was seen in a subgroup of women with bile acids &#8805; 40 µmol/L.</P>
<UL>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Diaferia-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Diaferia 1996</LINK>, pruritus was assessed before treatment (day 0) and at five-day intervals thereafter, on a 0-4 scale. Pruritus score was reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) at day 0 and day 20. The difference in pruritus score was statistically significant both in UDCA (reported P value &lt; 0.001) and placebo (reported P value &lt; 0.01), but favoured UDCA over placebo.</LI>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Glantz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Glantz 2005</LINK>, no significant difference in pruritus score (100 mm VAS) was seen between the UDCA and placebo groups after three weeks treatment (94 women; no P value reported). However, in the 23 women with severe cholestasis (at least 40 &#956;mol/L bile acids), the pruritus score fell to a mean of about 15 in the UDCA group compared with a mean of about 52 in the placebo group (reported P value 0.001). These data are not reported graphically in this review.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Leino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leino 1998</LINK> reported a significant improvement in pruritus scores within two weeks in the UDCA group. However, they did not report numerical or graphical data.</LI>

After 14 days treatment, a significant reduction in the pruritus scores was observed in the UDCA group (reported P value &lt; 0.05) compared with the placebo group (reported P value &gt; 0.05).</LI>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Nicastri-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Nicastri 1998</LINK>, pruritus was evaluated by the participant every three days up to 24 hours after delivery using the 0-4 scoring system. The change in pruritus score after 20 days treatment was analysed as a continuous outcome and reported as mean and SD. A significant reduction in pruritus score was observed with both UDCA (reported P value &lt; 0.01; 8 women) and placebo (reported P value &lt; 0.01; 8 women).</LI>
<LI>In <LINK REF="STD-Palma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Palma 1997</LINK>, a weekly assessment of pruritus was performed in all the study participants by the same clinician using the 0-4 scoring system. They reported a significant improvement in pruritus score after two weeks (P &lt; 0.01; 15 women) and three weeks (P = 0.02; 15 women) treatment with UDCA compared with placebo. Data for improvement in pruritus score were presented as a graph. Similar numbers of women (seven of the eight women in the UDCA group and five of the seven women in the placebo group) showed a reduction in pruritus score after three weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 2.10 (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>)); all seven 'improvers' in the UDCA group had low scores (under 1.5) compared with two of the five 'improvers' in the placebo group, which was also a non-significant difference.</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-PITCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PITCH 2012</LINK> prespecified in their trial protocol, published before data unblinding, that their primary outcome was to be the mean of all worst itching scores in the preceding 24 hours (100 mm VAS) measured between randomisation and delivery.

The results (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) showed a statistically significant reduction but the 95% CI around the effect was only 22 mm, i.e. smaller than the minimum worthwhile treatment effect for most women and doctors.</LI>

<P>Although we found 21 trials with a total of 1197 women, in general the quality of evidence is low.</P>
<P>Only one trial reported a quantified reduction in itching as a prespecified primary outcome across all women with obstetric cholestasis. The different approaches to measuring and reporting pruritus and the very high level of statistical heterogeneity precluded any aggregation of UDCA versus placebo trials on this outcome. Individual assessment of these trials for maternal pruritus, assessed either through a categorical 0-4 scale or on a 100 mm visual analogue (VAS) scale, demonstrated a greater support for UDCA compared with placebo and most other treatments in improving pruritus scores. One study reported no significant difference in pruritus reduction when comparing UDCA with placebo and dexamethasone, except in the subgroup of women with severe obstetric cholestasis (bile acids &#8805; 40 µmol/L), where a significant improvement in pruritus was observed with UDCA. UDCA was also more effective in improving pruritus than either SAMe or cholestyramine. A combination of UDCA and SAMe was more effective than SAMe and placebo in improving pruritus. Pruritus was significantly reduced with Danxiaoling when compared to Yiganling, but the use of these medicines are currently limited to East Asia. Information on safety and efficacy and further evidence from well designed randomised controlled trials are needed before they can be adopted globally. The results from trials comparing other interventions in regards to pruritus improvement were either inconsistent or not significant.</P>
<P>Eight trials reported fetal or neonatal deaths, with two deaths reported overall (both in the placebo groups). There were fewer instances of fetal distress in the UDCA groups compared with placebo (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.22 to 2.02; 304 women; I² = 48% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>)) but the difference was not significant. In the UDCA group, the rates of passage of meconium-stained liquor were lower and the mean gestational age at birth was higher but neither reached statistical significance. While the rate of total preterm births was significantly lower in the UDCA group when compared to placebo, there was no significant difference for the outcome of spontaneous preterm birth between the two groups. This could be interpreted as the rates of iatrogenic preterm births at less than 37 weeks of gestation being lower in women treated with UDCA, but evidence from larger trials is required before any robust interpretation can be attempted. The rates of fetal distress were similar when UDCA was compared with SAMe, cholestyramine and UDCA + Salvia. The group receiving combined UDCA + SAMe had fewer instances of fetal distress/asphyxial events when compared to the group randomised to UDCA or SAMe monotherapy. The rates of fetal distress were higher in the group receiving dexamethasone when compared to UDCA and placebo.</P>
<P>One trial compared early term delivery versus expectant management. There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the rates of caesarean section, meconium passage or admission to neonatal intensive care unit.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-05-02 11:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>The 21 studies included in this review are spread thinly over 15 comparisons. In only three comparisons was it possible to include more than two trials (with seven studies comparing UDCA versus placebo, four comparing SAMe versus placebo, and four trials comparing UDCA versus SAMe). In the remaining trials, it was not possible to answer with adequate levels of reliability how beneficial the relative merits of the interventions considered in this review are owing to the general paucity of data. </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-13 12:25:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the studies included in this review ranged from excellent to poor. Two large studies comparing UDCA with placebo were of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-Glantz-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Glantz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PITCH-2012" TYPE="STUDY">PITCH 2012</LINK>). Two (<LINK REF="STD-Fang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fang 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2002</LINK>) were quasi-randomised controlled trials and two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Leino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leino 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2012</LINK>) were available as conference abstracts only. The methods used for random sequence generation were described in eight trials (38%), allocation concealment was judged as adequate in four trials (19%) and there was no blinding in nine trials (43%). There were no dropouts reported in 10 studies (48%) and therefore all women were included in the analysis of those trials.</P>
<P>Due to the varying methods of measuring and reporting pruritus, pooling of data for this outcome was not possible. Only one trial reported a quantified reduction in itching as a prespecified primary outcome across all women with obstetric cholestasis. Eight trials (40%) used 0-4 scale for pruritus assessment and analysed them as a continuous outcome, which may not be an appropriate method of analysis for such a short scale. Dichotomisation of data and re-analysis was possible in one trial only. One trial did not specify the methods used for assessing pruritus.</P>
<P>The definition of fetal distress/asphyxial event was clearly predefined in one trial only. The definition of fetal distress/asphyxial events varied across the studies. Four trials did not report this outcome and it was unclear in three trials.</P>

<P>There is support for use of UDCA in improving maternal pruritus in obstetric cholestasis although the size of the benefit is small.</P>
<P>Women should be informed that there is insufficient evidence to recommend UDCA to improve fetal outcome. There is some apparent decrease in some measures of fetal/neonatal morbidity associated with UDCA, including lower rates of meconium passage and higher mean gestational age at birth, but we cannot conclude this reliably due to the high level of statistical heterogeneity. Definitive evidence for fetal benefit with any intervention is still lacking.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to indicate that SAMe, guar gum, activated charcoal, dexamethasone, cholestyramine, YCHD, DXLP, Yiganling alone or in combination are effective in treating women with cholestasis of pregnancy.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to recommend early term delivery in obstetric cholestasis. <I>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-14 09:12:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Stephen J Milan">
<P>UDCA and early term delivery are the most widely used treatments for obstetric cholestasis. Further trials of UDCA are justified. Such trials should be sufficiently large to test its effectiveness in reducing adverse fetal outcomes, and to confirm its fetal safety. Large trials of UDCA versus no treatment are feasible, but will probably have to rely on surrogate fetal outcomes such as admission to intensive care, and birth asphyxia, which are susceptible to bias. They should therefore be double blind.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that sufficiently large trials of near term early delivery are feasible, and there is increasing evidence from trials in other high risk pregnancies that this type of induction has few maternal side effects, so further near term induction trials are not a priority. However, if preterm induction prior to say 37 weeks is considered to pre-empt stillbirth this should be evaluated in a trial first, before implementation.</P>

<P>This is a clinical and experimental study looking at the effect of WLP in treating intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. In the clinical aspect of the study, women in the control group received a combination of 5% glucose (250 mL), dexamethasone (5 mg), vitamin C2, compound injection of red sage root, potassium magnesium aspartate (0.3 g) and Barbital (0.06 g). Women in the test group received WLP in addition to the above components. This made the study very complex as it contained components that may individually affect the outcomes in intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy.</P>

<P>Could you explain why you chose to exclude trials published in abstract form only. Due to publication bias, trials are more likely to be published if they report statistically significant results. Excluding abstracts may therefore lead to an overestimate of treatment effects.</P>

<P>This review has been recently updated by a new review team and we have now included a randomised controlled trial published in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Leino-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Leino 1998</LINK>). However, it was not reported in a way that enabled the results to be included in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK> and so is included in the text of the UCDA versus placebo results.</P>

<P>Three reviewers (R Burrows, O Clavisi, E Burrows) independently searched for, assessed and selected trials for inclusion in this review. The decision to include trials was made without knowledge of authors, institutional affiliations, journal of publication and results. Any disagreements about inclusion of studies were resolved through discussion.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (O Clavisi, E Burrows) independently appraised included trials for their methodological quality using the validity criteria for intervention studies developed by Sackett et al (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2000</LINK>). Individual appraisals were then compared and agreement reached. The validity criteria used are:<BR/>1. adequate method of randomisation (e.g. random number tables);<BR/>2. concealment of allocation (e.g. opaque envelopes);<BR/>3. blinding of study participants, caregivers and assessors;<BR/>4. inclusion of all randomised patients in the analysis of results;<BR/>5. adequate follow-up of study participants (&gt; 80%);<BR/>6. study patients have similar prognostic factors at the start of the trial;<BR/>7. study patients treated equally during the trial.</P>
