<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. Interpretation of the results was hindered by the small total sample size and by the low quality of reporting of the included trials. There was some evidence that haloperidol was more efficacious than placebo in terms of reduction of manic and psychotic symptom scores, when used both as monotherapy and as add-on treatment to lithium or valproate. There is no evidence of difference in efficacy between haloperidol and risperidone, olanzapine, valproate, carbamazepine, sultopride and zuclopentixol. There was a statistically significant difference with haloperidol being probably less effective than aripiprazole. No comparative efficacy data with quetiapine, lithium or chlorpromazine were reported. Haloperidol caused more extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than placebo and more movement disorders and EPS but less weight gain than olanzapine. Haloperidol caused more EPS than valproate but no difference was found between haloperidol and lithium, carbamazepine, sultopride and risperidone in terms of side effects profile. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The main objectives in treating mania are to control dangerous behaviour, reduce suicide, produce appropriate acute sedation and shorten the episode of mood disturbance. Among different drugs, haloperidol has for many years been used in treating psychotic patients, but it has a troublesome side effect profile.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of haloperidol for the treatment of mania in comparison with placebo or other active drugs, either as monotherapy or add-on treatment. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (11 October 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), PsycINFO (1872-2003) and reference lists. We also contacted experts, triallists and pharmaceutical companies in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing haloperidol with placebo or other active treatment in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Fifteen trials involving 2022 people were included. Compared to placebo, haloperidol was more effective at reducing manic symptoms, both as monotherapy (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) -5.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) -7.69 to -4.00) and as adjunctive treatment to lithium or valproate (WMD -5.20, 95% CI -9.26 to -1.14). There was a statistically significant difference, with haloperidol being less effective than aripiprazole (Relative Risk (RR) 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73). No significant differences between haloperidol and risperidone, olanzapine, carbamazepine or valproate were found. Compared with placebo, a statistically significant difference in favour of haloperidol in failure to complete treatment (RR 0.74, 95% Cl 0.57 to 0.96) was reported. Haloperidol was associated with less weight gain than olanzapine (RR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67), but with a higher incidence of tremor (RR: 3.01, 95% CI 1.55 to 5.84) and other movement disorders.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for acute mania. From the limited data available, there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone. Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole. Referring to tolerability, when considering the poor evidence comparing drugs, clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profiles as an important issue to inform their choice.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterised by episodes of elevated or irritable mood (manic or hypomanic episodes) and episodes of low mood, loss of energy and sadness (depressive episodes). Some people also experience mixed episodes in which manic and depressive symptoms are present at the same time (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). Psychotic symptoms may occur in mania and are called mood-congruent when they occur during a manic episode and are consistent with the mood disturbance. Manic episodes may also occur in patients who have symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorder (schizoaffective disorder). Bipolar affective disorder is commonly subdivided into Bipolar I Disorder (at least one lifetime manic episode) and Bipolar II Disorder (periods of hypomania and depression) and it is a severe and common psychiatric disorder with a life-time prevalence of 0.5% - 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 1997</LINK>). It occurs nearly equally in women and men and displays strong familial patterns of inheritability (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nurnberger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurnberger 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bipolar disorder is one of the top thirty causes of worldwide disability for its chronic and recurrent nature (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>) and most patients experience multiple episodes at an average of 0.4 to 0.7 episodes per year, each lasting three to six months (<LINK REF="REF-Angst-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angst 2000</LINK>). The costs of manic episodes are high both for patients and for health services (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 1999</LINK>). For patients, in addition to the period of acute illness, manic episodes often leave an aftermath of psychological, social and financial problems (<LINK REF="REF-Abood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abood 2002</LINK>). Direct medical costs are high because admission to a psychiatric intensive care unit is often necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Spie_x00df_l-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spieﬂl 2002</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Drugs are the first line treatment for acute mania (<LINK REF="REF-McElroy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McElroy 2000</LINK>). The main objectives in treating mania are to control dangerous behaviour, reduce suicide, produce appropriate acute sedation and shorten the episode of mood disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1997</LINK>). A number of different drugs are used in the treatment of mania - either as monotherapy or in combination. Lithium and antipsychotics (particularly when mania is accompanied by psychosis) have been used to treat mania for many years and have been shown to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 1990</LINK>). In North America, antipsychotics are usually considered as adjunctive to primary therapy with a mood stabiliser such as lithium or valproate. By contrast, in Europe, antipsychotics are usually themselves considered as a primary therapy for mania, either alone or in combination with mood stabilisers.<BR/> <BR/>All drug treatments for mania are potentially associated with adverse effects and with a risk of precipitating depression (<LINK REF="REF-McIntyre-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIntyre 2002</LINK>); the rapid control of agitation and overactivity may be offset by the risks of serious adverse events and poor tolerability, which are associated, in different degrees, with both traditional and newer atypical antipsychotics. Nevertheless, compared to lithium, antipsychotics are sometimes considered better because they possess a wider therapeutic index, and this is important in the treatment of patients with mania (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Conventional neuroleptic agents have been the mainstay in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, and since 1977 haloperidol has been studied for refractory chronic psychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Nicodeme-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicodeme 1977</LINK>). Haloperidol is a dopamine D2 receptor agent, which is more effective than placebo in suppressing positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hegarty-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegarty 1994</LINK>) and in reducing the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2001</LINK>). However, there are serious limitations in its efficacy for positive symptoms and it is associated with a high prevalence of side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Cassens-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cassens 1990</LINK>); poor compliance may complicate clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hoff-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoff 1992</LINK>). Haloperidol probably has a risk-benefit profile inferior to that of olanzapine in first-episode psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sanger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanger 1999</LINK>) and in schizoaffective disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Tran-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In considering the acceptability of long-term treatments, the adverse effects profile of a proposed drug is important. Haloperidol causes extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, dystonia, akathisia, anxiety and nervousness (psychiatric akathisia), elevation of plasma prolactin levels (gynaecomastia, amenhorrea, sexual dysfunction), lowered seizure threshold, cardiovascular effects and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Keck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 1994</LINK>). Haloperidol appears to exert antimanic effects but not antidepressant effects, and may even increase the risk of depressive episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Keck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keck 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review assesses the evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of haloperidol compared with placebo or other active treatments. We are aware that a number of randomised controlled trials comparing haloperidol with placebo or other drugs are currently being conducted. In order to be able to make the current evidence available as soon as possible, the first version of the review only includes trials identified by the search strategy up to the end of October 2005. Trials which are published after that date will be included in future updates of the review. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To determine the efficacy of haloperidol compared with placebo or other active treatment in alleviating the acute symptoms of manic or mixed episodes. </P>
<P>2. To review the effect of haloperidol on general health and social functioning. </P>
<P>3. To review acceptability of treatment with haloperidol. </P>
<P>4. To investigate the adverse effects of treatment with haloperidol. </P>

<P>
<B>Reference Checking:</B>
<BR/>The reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials, other relevant papers and major textbooks of affective disorder written in English were checked.</P>
<P>
<B>Hand searching:</B>
<BR/>Appropriate journals and conference proceedings relating to haloperidol treatment of mania were checked.</P>
<P>
<B>Personal Communication:</B>
<BR/>The authors of significant papers were identified from authorship lists over the last five years. They, and other experts in the field, were contacted and asked of their knowledge of other studies, published or unpublished, relevant to the review article. Pharmaceutical companies marketing haloperidol products were requested to provide relevant published and unpublished data (see CCDAN group policy). </P>
<P>
<B>Restrictions:</B>
<BR/>No restrictions (including language) were applied to the search strategies.<BR/> </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>a) Selection of trials and data extraction</B>
<BR/>Studies relating to haloperidol generated by the search strategies were checked to ensure they met the previously defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers (AC, JR) independently extracted data concerning participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures from the included studies. Subgroup analyses were recorded where the subgroups were defined a priori; if appropriate, the results were included in the meta-analysis. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the third review author (JG).</P>
<P>
<B>b) Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>Quality was assessed according to the Cochrane criteria for quality assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1997</LINK>). These criteria pay particular attention to the adequacy of the randomisation procedure. On this basis, studies were given a quality rating of A (adequate), B (unclear), and C (inadequate). If the raters disagreed the final rating was made by consensus with the involvement (if necessary) of another member of the review group. In addition, a general appraisal of study quality was made by assessing key methodological issues such as blinding, completeness of follow-up and reporting of study withdrawals. Where inadequate details of randomisation and other characteristics of trials were provided, the authors were contacted in order to obtain further information.</P>
<P>Non-concurrence in selection and quality assessment were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>c) Data analysis</B>
<BR/>Data were entered into Revman 4.2.8 software by one reviewer (AC).</P>
<P>
<B>Pooling of data</B>
<BR/>Intention to Treat data (ITT) were used when available. Where ITT was not available, end-point data for trial completers were used. <BR/>Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) or standardized mean differences (where different measurement scales were used). Where standard deviations were not recorded, authors were asked to supply the data. In the absence of data from the authors the mean standard deviation from other studies was used. When there were missing data and the method of "last observation carried forward " had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used, with due consideration of the potential bias and uncertainty introduced. <BR/>For dichotomous, or event-like, data, relative risks were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Where participants had withdrawn from the trial before the endpoint, it was assumed they would have experienced the negative outcome by the end of the trial (e.g. failure to respond to treatment). Where the proportion of participants withdrawing from treatment was substantial (more than 20%), sensitivity analyses were done to investigate the effect of the possible different outcomes of those participants who withdrew in each group (for example, all the patients in the experimental group experience the negative outcome and all those allocated to the comparison group experience the positive outcome).</P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the chi-square test with a p-value of less than or equal to 0.1 being taken to indicate heterogeneity. If significant heterogeneity was identified, potential sources were considered. Fixed and random effects analyses were done routinely to investigate the effect of the choice of method on the estimates. Material differences between the models were reported. <BR/>Skewed data and non-quantitative data were presented descriptively. <BR/>Monotherapy and adjunctive treatment trials were analyzed separately and, where appropriate, combined results were also reported. </P>
<P>
<B>Sub-group analyses</B>
<BR/>Where data were reported, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the possibility of differences in the efficacy of haloperidol in the treatment of psychotic and non-psychotic mania. If data was available, analysis by length of treatment was performed to ascertain whether any treatment differences detected varied with time.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Fifteen randomized controlled trials of haloperidol in acute mania were identified. Some of the trials were presented at a number of conferences, and some subgroup analyses have been published: in this review only the main publications have been included in the list of references. </P>
<P>There were six trials comparing haloperidol with two different comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Shopsin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Shopsin 1975</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>): we analyzed them according to each different drug category, as specified below.<BR/> <BR/>

<B>1. Numbers of participants</B>
<BR/>Ten trials included less than 80 randomized participants: 27 (<LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>), 17 (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1989</LINK>), 21 (<LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1980</LINK>), 77 (<LINK REF="STD-Kudo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 1987</LINK>), 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Lenox-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lenox 1992</LINK>), 36 (<LINK REF="STD-Mc-Elroy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mc Elroy 1996</LINK>), 20 (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-Soto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega Soto 1993</LINK>), 45 (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>), 30 (<LINK REF="STD-Shopsin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Shopsin 1975</LINK>) and 33 (<LINK REF="STD-Small-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1995</LINK>). Of the two trials which compared haloperidol with risperidone or placebo, one included 156 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>) and one 438 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>). Another trial comparing haloperidol with quetiapine and placebo included 302 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>); one two-arm trial included 347participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>) and another trial 453 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>2. Selection of participants</B>
<BR/>Seven trials were multi-centre recruiting patients from sites in the USA, Europe (Spain, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland), Japan, Asia and South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kudo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenox-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lenox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>).

<P>
<B>3. Diagnosis of mania</B>
<BR/>In nine trials mania was diagnosed according to different editions of DSM criteria for manic episode only in bipolar disorder: DSM II (<LINK REF="STD-Shopsin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Shopsin 1975</LINK>), DSM III (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kudo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 1987</LINK>), DSM III-R (<LINK REF="STD-Lenox-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lenox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ortega-Soto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega Soto 1993</LINK>) and DSM IV (<LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>). For four trials DSM criteria for bipolar disorder manic or mixed episode were used: DSM III-R (<LINK REF="STD-Mc-Elroy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mc Elroy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Small-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1995</LINK>) and DSM IV (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>). One trial used Feighner criteria for mania (<LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1980</LINK>) and another one did not report the basis for a diagnosis of mania (<LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>). One trial included one patient with schizoaffective disorder (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-Soto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega Soto 1993</LINK>). In five trials the inclusion criteria included a minimum score of 20 on the Young Mania Rating (YMRS) (<LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>). In one trial, the inclusion criteria included a minimum score of 7 or more on Severity of Depression and Mania Scale - Mania (SDMS-M) and of 60 or less on GAS (<LINK REF="STD-Small-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1995</LINK>). </P>

<P>
<B>1. Randomisation / concealment of allocation</B>
<BR/>All trials were described as randomized, but none gave details of the method used to achieve random allocation or allocation concealment. One trial reported stratification by treatment site and the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>). All trials were therefore rated "B" (unclear) for allocation concealment according to Cochrane criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>2. Intention to treat analysis</B>
<BR/>In one trial analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis (<LINK REF="STD-Tohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tohen 2003</LINK>): patients were retained in the analysis as randomised even if the patient did not strictly adhere to the protocol during the trial. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mc-Elroy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mc Elroy 1996</LINK>) all (36/36) patients completed the 6-day study period. Ten trials reported a modified intention-to-treat analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) to deal with missing continuous data and excluding participants for whom there were no post-baseline measurements from analyses of efficacy measures (<LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kudo-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lenox-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lenox 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Small-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Small 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Shopsin-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Shopsin 1975</LINK>) the kind of analysis is not specified; there was just one dropout amongst the whole sample, but we cannot say if authors had carried out an ITT or a LOCF analysis. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ortega-Soto-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ortega Soto 1993</LINK>), we used data reported in graphs and tables by authors to perform a LOCF analysis: when withdrawal from the trial is random and not associated with the trial intervention, the LOCF approach is usually assumed to give a conservative estimate of the effectiveness of a treatment in an acute illness. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garfinkel-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Garfinkel 1980</LINK>) did not give details of how data on patients who withdrew from the trial prematurely were handled. </P>
<P>
<B>3. Blinding</B>
<BR/>Thirteen trials were reported to have been double-blind, in which the treatment allocation was masked from both the clinicians and patients. One trial was single-blind, blinding only outcome rater (<LINK REF="STD-Mc-Elroy-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mc Elroy 1996</LINK>) and one was an open, controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Baastrup-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Baastrup 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Fixed effect analyses are reported in the text unless heterogeneity was observed in which case random effects models have been used.</P>
<P>Some statistically significant differences in effects and side effects were found between haloperidol and placebo, olanzapine and risperidone. The details are listed below. On the other hand, there was no evidence of statistically significant differences in results reported in RCTs comparing haloperidol with chlorpromazine, lorazepam, zuclopenthixol, zuclopenthixol acetate and lithium. </P>

</I>The primary measure of efficacy was change from baseline to endpoint score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>(i) Haloperidol monotherapy </I>
<BR/>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brecher-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Brecher 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>) reported data for mean change in YMRS. On this measure haloperidol was more effective than placebo (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) -5.85, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) -7.69 to -4.00, p &lt; 0.00001; 2 trials, 482 participants) (see figure 01.16). </P>
<P>From a subgroup analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>) there was no evidence that the effect size significantly varied according to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms at baseline (see figures 01.17 and 01.18).</P>
<P>When response was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in YMRS between baseline and endpoint, the proportion of participants treated with haloperidol monotherapy that failed to respond (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>) was less than in the placebo group (Relative Risk (RR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95, p = 0.01; 1 trial, 284 participants) (see figure 01.12). </P>
<P>
<I>(ii) Haloperidol as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers</I>
<BR/>Haloperidol was more effective than placebo as adjunctive treatment to mood stabilisers measured as mean change on the YMRS (WMD -5.20, 95% CI -9.26 to -1.14, p = 0.01; 1 trial, 97 participants) (see figure 01.16) (<LINK REF="STD-Sachs-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sachs 2002</LINK>). From a subgroup analysis there was some evidence that the effect size varied according to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms at baseline and it became not statistically significant when considering only participants without psychotic symptoms at baseline (see figures 01.17 and 01.18). However there was no heterogeneity between findings and the confidence intervals overlap. This could be an artefact due to the small sample size than a qualitative difference.</P>
<P>
<I>(iii) Combined results for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy<BR/>
</I>Haloperidol (alone or in combination with a mood stabiliser) was shown to be more effective than placebo in reduction in manic symptoms measured on the YMRS (WMD -5.74, 95% CI -7.41 to -4.06, p &lt; 0.00001; 3 trials, 579 participants) (see figure 0.16).</P>

<P>The reduction in Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity score at endpoint was greater for participants in the haloperidol group that for those in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>) (WMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.13, p = 0.004; 1 trial, 282 participants) (see figure 01.24).</P>
<P>Haloperidol was associated with greater improvement than placebo on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) when reported as endpoint score (WMD 6.40, 95% CI 2.73 to 10.07, p = 0.0006; 1 trial, 261 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Smulevich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smulevich 2005</LINK>) (see figure 01.29).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Fifteen trials were included in this review. A number of further randomised controlled trials comparing haloperidol with placebo or other drugs are currently being conducted and will be included in future updates of the review. Although the search was thorough it is still possible that there are unpublished studies which have not been identified but the small number of trials identified hinders the detection of any publication bias.</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported the design in sufficient detail in terms of allocation concealment, randomisation and maintenance of blinding, for an accurate assessment of quality to be made. The great majority of trials had a small sample size with less than 40 participants and we only found one trial for most comparisons: this limits the power of the trials to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. Haloperidol was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms and achieving remission. A substantial limitation of all the trials was the high rate of patients lost on follow-up. High withdrawal rates reduce the reliability of the assessment of other outcomes. Results reported for comparative efficacy have therefore to be viewed with caution. A further limitation of this analysis is that by making multiple comparisons we might have committed a type 1 error - that is reporting a spurious association. Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution</P>
<P>A number of the trials were carried out many years ago, using drugs that are not currently used to treat mania. </P>
<P>Nine trials enrolled only inpatients, two did not specify the clinical setting and one included both inpatients and outpatients but did not report the relative numbers by treatment allocation. Some trials required participants to be able to give informed consent, while in others, relatives could consent to enrollment. These variations in design could lead to systematic differences between trials in the terms of the severity of illness. This limits the extent to which results from different trials can be compared and the extent to which they can be applied to "real world" clinical practice. </P>
<P>Trials included in the present review used a wide number of rating scales, not all of which relate to mania, to assess the severity of a number of core symptoms of the manic phase of bipolar disorder and side effects caused by treatment. These measures provide a useful way to assess change in severity over time. They do not necessarily correlate precisely with more pragmatic measures of mental health such as duration of hospital admission, general health and time to return to normal functioning which are likely to be of more interest to both patients and clinicians. </P>
<P>No details were given of the criteria used to assess the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse effects so the clinical significance is unclear but the data reported indicate that haloperidol causes more movement disorders and extrapyramidal symptoms than placebo, olanzapine, quetiapine and valproate. However, since adverse effects will often be dose related, interpretation of the comparisons of haloperidol with valproate and olanzapine should take into account the relatively high doses of haloperidol used in these trials. In the comparison with valproate the mean dose of haloperidol was 15.4 mg/day and in the comparison with olanzapine, the haloperidol dose ranged from 10 to 15 mg/day. Many participants were therefore taking daily doses in excess of 10-12 mg of haloperidol per day which is considered to be a cut-off value for schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>). There is evidence that a better trade-off between efficacy and side-effects is achieved at lower doses of haloperidol (<LINK REF="REF-Geddes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geddes 2000</LINK>). Haloperidol produced significantly less weight gain than olanzapine and risperidone: this is of particular concern because of the possibility that weight gain interferes with glucose metabolism by causing decreased insulin sensitivity. None of the trials reported changes in blood glucose levels so no data were available on incidence of treatment-emergent hyperglycaemia. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for acute mania and it reduces psychotic symptoms when present and overall severity of psychiatric illness. Looking at the limited data available and the heterogeneity of different compounds, comparisons between individual drugs and not between drug classes were preferred. There was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment (as measured by failure to response and mean change in rating scale scores) between haloperidol and olanzapine, sultopride or risperidone. The relative efficacy of haloperidol compared to lithium and valproate is unclear, because of poor data. Trials comparing haloperidol with zuclopenthixol, zuclopenthixol acetate, carbamazepine, lorazepam and chlorpromazine are too small in sample size to assess any kind of evidence. The evidence we found in terms of efficacy in favour of aripiprazole versus haloperidol is based on only one trial, funded by manufacturer and with few data clearly available (as yet only reported in a poster - we are waiting for the full text article) (<LINK REF="STD-Sanchez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sanchez 2003</LINK>): as far as we are aware, even if interesting, results are not so strongly evidence-based to have implications for clinical practice.<BR/> <BR/>Haloperidol was associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal and movement disorders than placebo, olanzapine, quetiapine and valproate but lower incidence of weight gain than olanzapine and risperidone. Considering the poor evidence amongst active drugs about treatment efficacy in acute mania and the risk/benefit ratio of using these agents for long term treatment (i.e. bipolar disorder), clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profile as an important issue to inform their choice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Randomized trials of adequate sample size are required in comparing haloperidol with other compounds (lithium, valproate and antipsychotic drugs) in the treatment of mania which are designed to inform prescribing policy. Referring to efficacy and safety, the trials should be open to a broader and more heterogeneous patient population and should include outcome measures of more relevance to clinicians and patients: there is the need for routine use of not only reliable outcome measure of clinical impairment but also quality of life, general health and global social functioning. After remission of a manic episode, many patients will be prescribed treatment for relapse prevention: trials specifically carried out to evaluate this topic should be undertaken, independently from manufacturers.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised, open, controlled study.<BR/>Trial duration - 6 days.<BR/>Multi-centre trial.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>27 participants. All hospitalised patients. <BR/>Age range: 18-65.<BR/>Inclusion criteria: ICD 9 criteria for manic phase of manic-depressive psychosis and schizoaffective psychosis. Requirement for parenteral neuroleptic therapy. <BR/>Exclusion criteria: patients who had received a short-term oral or parental neuroleptic within the last 6 h or a depot neuroleptic within the last two weeks; patients with serious somatic disease or known organic brain disorder; pregnant patients.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Haloperidol versus zuclopenthixol and zuclopenthixol acetate. Haloperidol: 5 - 40 mg i.m. - mean dose: 33 mg/day oral. Zuclopenthixol: 10 - 80 mg i.m. - mean dose: 98 mg/day oral. (Both in the haloperidol group and the zuclopenthixol group, patients were switched to oral treatment as soon as possible). Zuclopenthixol acetate: starting dose of 50-200 mg depending on the severity of the patients' condition. It was expected that most patients would receive only two injections given with an interval of 72 h; however the second injection was not given until 24 h after the first one - mean dose: 30 mg i.m. Rescue medication: an antiparkinson drug could be given in case of troublesome extrepyramidal symptoms, and in case of sleep disturbances a benzodiazepine hypnotic could be prescribed. Possible prophylactic lithium treatment in manic patients could be continued unchanged. Additional neuroleptic medication was not allowed.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome - remission defined as reduction equal or more than 50% at the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale (BRMAS). Secondary outcome - Clinical Global Impression (CGI); unspecific sedation assessed by the nursing staff, according to Lingjaerde 1987; UKU Side Effect Rating Scale; laboratory investigations comprising liver and kidney function tests, haemoglobin, erytrocyte and leucocyte counts (before the first dose and 3 days after the last dose).
