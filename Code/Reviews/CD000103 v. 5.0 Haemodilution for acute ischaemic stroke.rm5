<P>
<B>Question</B>
</P>
<P>We wanted to compare the effectiveness of haemodilution (diluting the blood) treatment, started within 72 hours of stroke onset, versus control or no treatment in people with ischaemic stroke to assess the impact on death or dependence.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms of stroke include face drooping, arm weakness and difficulty with speech. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot that interrupts blood flow to a part of the brain. If blood flow is not restored quickly, the brain cells will die. Haemodilution improves the flow properties of the blood so that, theoretically, oxygen and nutrient supply to the brain is improved and brain cells threatened to die could survive. This treatment reduces brain infarct (the area of dead cells) size in animals with experimental stroke. Haemodilution can be achieved by blood-letting (removing blood), by giving fluids as an infusion or by a combination of both. The fluids used may be salt solutions but colloid solutions, which consist of large insoluble molecule meant to retain fluid intravascularly, are more effective as haemodilution agents. In many countries, haemodilution has been used in clinical treatment of people with acute stroke since the 1970s. Since then, a large number of clinical studies on haemodilution in acute stroke have been published. The goal of this review was to determine if blood dilution could prevent death in people with stroke due to blood clots.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 21 trials involving 4174 adult, male and female participants with presumed acute ischaemic stroke. The evidence is current to February 2014. Many trials followed participants for at least three to six months. Interventions included isovolaemic regimens (replacing a portion of blood volume with fluid) and hypervolaemic regimens (increasing the total volume of blood by adding fluid) using different types of solutions.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review showed that, when all the studies are taken together, there is no clear evidence of benefit from haemodilution. There is also no clear evidence that any particular mode of haemodilution, with or without blood-letting, using various types of haemodiluting agents, etc, is beneficial. There were no significant serious side effects of this treatment. It is concluded that there is no clear scientific support for the use of haemodilution in the routine treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was moderate as individual trials were of varying quality. There was little variation among trials.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:37:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2014), MEDLINE (January 2008 to October 2013) and EMBASE (January 2008 to October 2013). We also searched trials registers, scanned reference lists and contacted authors. For the previous version of the review, the authors contacted manufacturers and investigators in the field.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:37:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 21 trials involving 4174 participants. Nine trials used a combination of venesection and plasma volume expander. Twelve trials used plasma volume expander alone. The plasma volume expander was plasma alone in one trial, dextran 40 in 12 trials, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in five trials and albumin in three trials. Two trials tested haemodilution in combination with another therapy. Evaluation was blinded in 14 trials. Five trials probably included some participants with intracerebral haemorrhage. Haemodilution did not significantly reduce deaths within the first four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.34). Similarly, haemodilution did not influence deaths within three to six months (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.20), or death and dependency or institutionalisation (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07). The results were similar in confounded and unconfounded trials, and in trials of isovolaemic and hypervolaemic haemodilution. No statistically significant benefits were documented for any particular type of haemodiluting agents, but the statistical power to detect effects of HES was weak. Six trials reported venous thromboembolic events. There was a tendency towards reduction in deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or both at three to six months' follow-up (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.24). There was no statistically significant increased risk of serious cardiac events among haemodiluted participants.</P>

<P>The overall results of this review showed no clear evidence of benefit of haemodilution therapy for acute ischaemic stroke.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-08-26 10:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:38:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and third leading cause of disability worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Lozano-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozano 2012</LINK>). Globally, ischaemic stroke constitutes 68% of all strokes (<LINK REF="REF-Krishnamurthi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krishnamurthi 2013</LINK>). The median age of stroke is 70 years with an age-standardised incidence of 3.4 to 5.2 per 1000 (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2003</LINK>). As the one-month case-fatality rate is 13% to 27% (<LINK REF="REF-Feigin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feigin 2003</LINK>), and with limited treatment options, many treatments have been studied, including haemodilution.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-10 03:01:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Haemodilution is usually achieved by infusion of a plasma volume expander with or without concomitant venesection. It may be hyper-, iso- or hypovolaemic, depending on the balance between plasma expansion and venesection. The most commonly used plasma expander in clinical stroke trials has been dextran 40, but hydroxyethyl starch (HES, also called pentastarch) and albumin have also been used.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-26 10:28:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There are several clinical observations suggesting that haemorheological factors have a role to play in acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<OL>
<LI>People with polycythaemia vera, having very high haematocrit levels, are prone to various thromboembolic complications, including stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pearson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearson 1978</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>High haematocrit, even within the 'normal' range, may predict ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kiyohara-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiyohara 1986</LINK>), and haematocrit values are significantly higher in people with ischaemic stroke than in matched controls (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tohgi-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tohgi 1978</LINK>). Although this may be a causal relationship, it must be remembered that high haematocrit is related to other cardiovascular risk markers such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Kiyohara-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kiyohara 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lithner-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lithner 1988</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>People with stroke have a variety of haematological abnormalities that may increase whole-blood viscosity. This includes decreased red cell deformability, increased red cell aggregation, signs of leukocyte activation, elevated fibrinogen and, as a result, high plasma viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Perri-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Perri 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ott-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ott 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1985</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>When local blood flow to a region of the brain is suddenly interrupted, collateral blood supply may maintain some delivery of oxygen and nutrients, although at a low level, and structural integrity of the neurons is preserved. Intentional haemodilution has been introduced to improve blood flow to hypoperfused but still viable brain areas supplied by collaterals (penumbra). Haemodilution reduces haematocrit and has dual effects: on the one hand, it improves blood flow, on the other hand, it reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity. The net effect on tissue oxygen supply follows an inverse U-shaped curve. As haematocrit is reduced, oxygen delivery increases to a peak. When haematocrit is reduced further, oxygen delivery starts to fall (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1981</LINK>). This has been shown in many peripheral tissues in various species, and there is some support for a similar relationship between haematocrit and oxygen delivery in the human brain (<LINK REF="REF-Todd-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>When an ischaemic stroke occurs, cerebral autoregulatory mechanisms are impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Paulson-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paulson 1971</LINK>). In people with brain infarction, intentional haemodilution has been associated with increased flow in the infarcted as well as in the contralateral hemisphere (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vorstrup-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vorstrup 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1983</LINK>). This has also been amply shown in animal models of ischaemic stroke, in which beneficial results of haemodilution on infarct size have been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Belayev-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belayev 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>). Oxygen-carrying haemodilutants, such as per fluorocarbon emulsions or diaspirin cross-linked haemoglobin, have also been used successfully to reduce brain infarct size in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Aronowski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronowski 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kline-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kline 1991</LINK>). Other oxygen-carrying agents of potential use in people with ischaemic stroke include polymerised bovine haemoglobin (<LINK REF="REF-Standl-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Standl 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The optimal haematocrit level for oxygen delivery to the ischaemic brain tissue remains to be determined. Several of the clinical trials reviewed here have been based on experimental data suggesting that haematocrit in the 30% to 33% range provides maximal oxygen delivery to normal peripheral tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1981</LINK>). However, mathematical modelling based on published observations indicate that oxygen supply in the ischaemic brain penumbra decreases at haemoglobin concentrations below 10 g per 100 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Dexter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dexter 1997</LINK>). At the other end of the spectrum, there are several indications that haematocrit levels as high as 40% to 45% provide maximal oxygen delivery to brain tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Chien-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chien 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kusunoki-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kusunoki 1981</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:38:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Systematic investigations of haemodilution in the clinical setting started in the 1960s. Initial clinical experiences of haemodilution without randomisation were encouraging, and suggested clinical benefits from various haemodilution regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Gottstein-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottstein 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottstein-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Korosue-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Korosue 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1982</LINK>). Haemodilution gained wide acceptance and, in many countries, it became the therapy of choice for people with acute ischaemic stroke. Despite the discouraging results of the randomised trials, as shown in the present review, haemodilution is still occasionally recommended to treat people with acute ischaemic stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Popov-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popov 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Starting in the late 1960s, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of haemodilution treatment in people with acute stroke have been performed. The results have been conflicting. The present formal statistical overview includes the results from 21 independent RCTs of haemodilution in acute ischaemic stroke. Compared with the previous version in 2002, the present update includes three additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Balcarce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Balcarce 1991</LINK>).

<P>We sought published and unpublished RCTs that compared haemodilution with control. Treatment in control groups varied between trials. Usually, no specific treatment was used, although a protocol involving infusions of crystalloids or dextrose was used in the control group in some trials. Blinding of participants or evaluators has not been a selection criterion (see also below).</P>
<P>We have included only those studies that reported clinical endpoints of direct relevance for participants (death, neurological outcome, functional outcome, need for institutional care, vascular or other events, adverse reactions). Thus, we have not included studies reporting on the effects of haemodilution on cerebral blood flow or other intermediary variables but not providing any other clinical data. We also did not include studies that only included neurological examination scale outcomes because these outcomes could not be combined given the variety of neurological scores (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>). We have not included studies of haemodilution initiated in the late phase after stroke (i.e. later than one week after onset). We have also not included haemodilution to prevent stroke occurring after carotid surgery.</P>

<P>We only included acute trials with start of treatment within the first 72 hours of stroke onset. Although all trials involved only participants with a clinical diagnosis of presumed ischaemic stroke, some participants in five early trials conducted before computed tomography (CT) became available may actually have had a haemorrhagic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Gilroy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Gilroy 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaste-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kaste 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Popa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>). One study performed CT after treatment and included haemorrhagic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>). Some studies have reported results both on an intention-to-treat basis and a per-protocol ('target group') basis (when participants not treated according to the study protocol have been excluded). If so, the data entered into this review are according to the intention-to-treat principle.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:39:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included trials of hyper- and isovolaemic haemodilution. Thus, some trials combined administration of plasma expanders with venesection, but other trials did not. Plasma expanders were plasma alone, low-molecular-weight dextran (dextran 40), HES and albumin. No study used a hypovolaemic protocol (i.e. blood-letting alone). Two studies were confounded (i.e. haemodilution was used together with another treatment modality) (<LINK REF="STD-Frei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaste-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kaste 1976</LINK>) (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table).

</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:39:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Information on mortality at early (reported to occur within the first seven days in some studies up to 28 days in others) and at late (reported at three to six months) follow-up was extracted from articles and unpublished reports when available. Since the proportion of participants who become severely dependent on help from other people after stroke may be affected by early death, we used a combined measure (dead or dependent/institutionalised) as a crude measure of functional outcome at three to six months after stroke. Many studies reported on changes in neurological and functional scores. A plethora of scores and measures of distribution were used. Therefore, it has not been possible to report on changes of score sums in a uniform manner. Thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or both) and adverse effects of the haemodilution treatment were reported in a systematic manner only in a few of the trials; these observations are, nevertheless, reported here.</P>

<P>All studies randomised participants into a single arm without cross-over. Repeated individual measures were managed by defining short- and long-term follow-up outcomes. Since time points of follow-up varied greatly between trials, we extracted information for early and late follow-up. We defined 'early' as day seven to 28 days after onset; if several follow-ups during this period were reported, we used the one closest to day 21. We defined 'late' as three to six months after stroke; if several time points were reported, we used the one closest to three months.</P>

<P>The trials used various haemodilution regimens. In the analyses, they were divided into hyper- and isovolaemic. In 12 of the trials, the administration of a plasma volume expander was not combined with venesection and was, therefore, defined as hypervolaemic (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bornstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bornstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilroy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Gilroy 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haass-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Haass 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaste-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kaste 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAHST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MAHST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>). In one study, venesection was performed only if there were signs of volume overload; this trial was also considered as hypervolaemic (<LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>). In the remaining eight studies, the administration of a plasma volume expander was combined with venesection in most of the participants (<LINK REF="STD-Balcarce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Balcarce 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mast-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mast 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Popa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1984</LINK>).

<P>The definition of 'dependency' at follow-up was not uniform between the trials. In this overview, dependency on other people for primary ADL or need for institutional care has been used to indicate poor functional outcome. We used the combined outcome measure of 'dead or dependent/institutionalised' to eliminate the possibility that with more participants dying, the proportion of severely affected people with stroke at follow-up would be reduced (and vice versa).</P>
<P>The analyses were confined to unconfounded haemodilution trials, since none of the confounded trials reported dependency at late follow-up.</P>
<P>Sufficient data from eight of the trials were available for estimating the outcome variable 'dead or dependent/institutionalised' (<LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAHST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MAHST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1984</LINK>). In one trial, there was a statistically significant effect in favour of haemodilution therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Strand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1984</LINK>), whereas no significant effects were noted in the other trials. In the summary statistics, no beneficial effects of haemodilution emerged (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).

In one carefully monitored safety study, venous thromboembolism was not mentioned among the adverse events, and it is assumed that no such events occurred during the trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>). None of the studies used systematic laboratory screening for thromboembolism in all participants, but the diagnosis was based on clinical presentation, substantiated by laboratory investigations in suspected cases and findings at autopsy. A statistically significant reduction of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or both was reported in one of the studies, and there was a tendency towards reduction in the overview analysis (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.24) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).

In <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>, congestive heart failure was combined with pulmonary oedema and could not be added to this outcome. An excess risk of serious cardiac events was not observed in any of the other trials. The overview analysis of the cumulated number of cardiac events at latest follow-up (usually three to six months after stroke) indicated no detrimental effects of haemodilution on the risk for serious cardiac events (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.50).</P>

<P>In ischaemic stroke, the pathophysiological mechanisms may differ markedly from person to person. Is it then futile to try a standardised protocol to treat people with acute stroke unless a more precise mechanism is known in each individual person? Could the lack of beneficial effects of haemodilution be explained by detrimental effects in some people, counterbalancing beneficial effects in others?</P>
<P>An extensive subgroup analysis in <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK> showed similar clinical outcome when participants were subdivided into groups based on easily available clinical criteria, such as sex, age, a cardiac source of embolism, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes and severity of neurological deficits. A similar subgroup analysis was performed in <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>, showing no difference based on thrombolysis treatment, demographic characteristics, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, stroke onset or baseline imaging.</P>
<P>No beneficial effect of haemodilution was observed in the subgroup with highest haematocrit levels at entry in the Scandinavian (<LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>), the Italian (<LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>), the Romanian (<LINK REF="STD-Popa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Popa 1989</LINK>), or the Dutch (<LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>), trials.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK> trial, a significantly better early neurological recovery was noted in participants who were able to increase their cardiac output during haemodilution when compared with participants who failed to do so, whereas outcomes at three months were similar. In <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>, the outcome was no different in participants with and without a history of cardiac failure (a marker for reduced capacity to increase the cardiac output as a response to haemodilution). Participants with a marked reduction in blood pressure following haemodilution had a similar outcome as participants who maintained their blood pressure.</P>
<P>Only one study addressed the question of the site of the brain lesion (<LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:45:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>When we analysed all the trials together, there were no beneficial effects of haemodilution on mortality at early or late follow-up or on functional outcome. The largest three studies accounted for two-thirds of all participants (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>), and the Italian study accounted for over half of all deaths (<LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis when removing <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK> did not alter results. It is reasonable to conclude that haemodilution, as used in the trials conducted so far, has no major beneficial effects on survival or on functional outcome in acute ischaemic stroke.</P>
<P>There was a slight, statistically insignificant, tendency towards more early deaths among haemodiluted participants. The excess mortality observed in participants with deep brain infarctions in one study could be due to chance, but another tentative explanation is that deep brain structures are supplied by end-arteries and that an adequate collateral blood supply is needed for haemodilution not to be harmful (or beneficial) (<LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>). The significant increase in mortality for participants older than 83 years warranted the interim stopping of <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>. However, it must be emphasised that results of subgroup analyses in individual trials should be interpreted with caution even if they are testing predetermined hypotheses, especially when there is no overall effect of the intervention.</P>
<P>These trials used many different modes of haemodilution. The overview analyses showed no positive effects whether the administration of plasma volume expanders was combined with venesection or not (i.e. was iso- or hypervolaemic). However, the statistical power to detect differences in the hypervolaemic group was relatively weak.</P>
<P>Low-molecular-weight dextran was used as the haemodiluting agent in many of the randomised trials. It has been reported that repeated dextran 40 infusions result in an accumulation of large dextran molecules and an increase in plasma viscosity (<LINK REF="REF-Kroemer-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroemer 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tsuda-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuda 1987</LINK>). It has therefore been claimed that HES or albumin are better choices as plasma volume expanders. However, other studies have shown similar decreases in plasma viscosity with dextran and HES (<LINK REF="REF-Haass-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haass 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staedt-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staedt 1986</LINK>). In people with ischaemic stroke, HES counteracts the increased intracranial pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Schwarz-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schwarz 1998</LINK>). The half-life of albumin in the circulation is much longer than that of dextran 40 or HES, and the risk for short-term variations in whole-blood viscosity is possibly lower.</P>
<P>The total number of participants in the HES trials was small (<LINK REF="STD-Haass-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Haass 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mast-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mast 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>). In the overview analyses, there was no trend towards improved survival among people treated with HES. However, there was a tendency towards better functional outcome in HES-treated people, but this was not statistically significant. If this is a true beneficial effect, there may be an interaction with early onset of treatment, since the two HES trials (<LINK REF="STD-MAHST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MAHST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>) reporting on functional outcome were two of the four haemodilution trials (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MAHST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MAHST 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>) in which all participants were included within the first six hours after stroke onset.</P>
<P>In animal models of stroke, treatment with human albumin markedly increases cortical perfusion, reduces brain swelling and infarct volume, and improves neurological outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Belayev-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belayev 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2001</LINK>). Albumin was used as the haemodiluting agent in three clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>). There was no statistically significant harm or benefit to albumin although there was a tendency towards harm given the increase in cardiovascular-related deaths and death in participants older than 83 years (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whereas no beneficial effects on mortality or functional dependency were documented in the formal overview analyses, there was a tendency towards significant reduction of the risk for venous thromboembolic events in participants who had received haemodilution. This is in line with the prophylactic effects of dextran against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after major surgery. However, the results of the overview analysis must be interpreted with caution. The CIs were wide. The diagnosis of a deep vein thrombosis was based on clinical presentation and findings at autopsy. It seems that, in most instances, the clinicians making the diagnosis were not blinded as to which group the participant had been assigned. It is remarkable that the effect was most evident at late follow-up (three to six months), making it unlikely that dextran, HES or albumin had any specific effect on the risk of venous thromboembolism. It may be speculated that low haematocrit in people who have undergone venesection reduces the risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism to some extent even after the acute phase of stroke.</P>
<P>There has been concern that many haemodilution regimens may involve a risk of volume overload in people with stroke with incipient or manifest heart failure. Cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>) and cardiopulmonary events (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>) were more common in albumin-treated participants in the ALIAS trials. Haemodynamic monitoring with a Swan-Ganz catheter during the haemodilution procedure has been introduced to reduce the risk of left ventricular failure during hypervolaemic haemodilution (<LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>). The overview analysis of trials reporting cardiovascular events in a systematic manner, did not document any major increase in adverse circulatory events in participants who had received haemodilution (<LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>). The number of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions was small and was reported in less than 1% of all participants receiving plasma volume expanders. Pretreatment with hapten-dextran was used in three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>), and this may have reduced the risk of anaphylaxis to dextran.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:46:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of haemodilution therapy in people with acute ischaemic stroke. We have identified relevant randomised trials investigating a variety of haemodilution strategies including plasma, dextran, HES and albumin with or without venesection for acute ischaemic stroke. The results are applicable to people meeting trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. As the inclusion criteria included people with presumed ischaemic stroke, 164 participants from <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK> had haemorrhagic stroke identified after treatment and five additional studies were performed before CT was available to rule out haemorrhagic stroke (<LINK REF="STD-Gilroy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Gilroy 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaste-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Kaste 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Popa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have searched comprehensively the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register up to February 2014. This register contains all stroke trials from MEDLINE and EMBASE to December 2007. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2008 to October 2013, and CENTRAL up to Issue 1, 2014. It could have been possible to re-search all of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2002, but relevant stroke trials were included in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register before December 2007 and the current search results had already returned 2983 citations.</P>
<P>The 21 studies included in this analysis are sufficient to address the objective. There are improvements that could be made.</P>
<P>There are likely to be more methods used for haemodilution, such as venesection plus plasma replacement, which were only studied in one randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Balcarce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Balcarce 1991</LINK>). Additional subgroups based on treatments other than haemodilution, such as thrombolysis (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>), could have been included in more studies. ALIAS studies reported neurological death within seven days, which was included in the early mortality data (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>). Death from any cause was reported at 30 days, but was not included in the 28-day cut-off for early mortality. Additional outcomes, especially serious adverse events, could have been included in more studies.</P>
<P>We acknowledge there are excluded studies that meet eligibility criteria (based on types of studies, participants and interventions), but do not have relevant or appropriate outcomes. These outcomes included haematological values, laboratory values, imaging and neurological score. Haematological and laboratory values, considered as intermediary outcomes, may not correlate well with the clinical outcomes of interest. Only one excluded study reported imaging outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Shin-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shin 2007</LINK>). Clinical neurological scores were relevant outcomes but could not be combined in a meta-analysis given the wide variety of scores used. Ideally, neurological score changes would be combined for analysis to measure more fine-grained differences in outcomes. Unfortunately, this was not feasible given the variety of scoring methods and time points of evaluation. Although there may have been benefit or harm for neurological outcome after haemodilution therapy, this meta-analysis does show that haemodilution therapy has no benefit for the clinical outcome of mortality.</P>
<P>Current practice of haemodilution in acute ischaemic stroke is likely to vary within and across countries. While older studies occasionally recommend haemodilution (<LINK REF="REF-Popov-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Popov 2000</LINK>), the American Heart Association does not recommend haemodilution based on the 2002 version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Jauch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jauch 2013</LINK>). Other guidelines, do not comment on haemodilution (<LINK REF="REF-ESO-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESO 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:46:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There were 21 included studies consistently showing an inability to reject the null hypothesis of haemodilution treatment in acute ischaemic stroke having no harm or benefit. Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence was moderate for outcomes including all haemodilution therapies, except for cardiac events, which was considered low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was little heterogeneity with only three analyses showing moderate heterogeneity (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). All funnel plots were symmetrical.</P>
<P>Using the 'Risk of bias' tool, there were eight studies with more than three unclear categories as the information was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Bornstein-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bornstein 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haass-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Haass 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Popa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Popa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudolf-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Rudolf 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>). Nine other studies had a high risk of performance or detection bias because the participants or evaluators or both were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Balcarce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Balcarce 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilroy-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Gilroy 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goslinga-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Goslinga 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IASSG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IASSG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koller 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mast-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mast 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">SSSG 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1984</LINK>). These studies were unable to blind the interventions. Other study interventions were able to blind the intervention and control arm. Only six studies specifically reported on the number of participants who were withdrawn after randomisation making them at low risk of incomplete outcome bias (<LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-1-2011" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 1 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ALIAS_x002d_Part-2-2013" TYPE="STUDY">ALIAS-Part 2 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frei-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frei 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSSG-1989" TYPE="STUDY">HSSG 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spudis-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Spudis 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Strand-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Strand 1984</LINK>).

<P>This review and previous versions are the most recent systematic review of haemodilution in acute ischaemic stroke. In an early systematic review of haemodilution trials in acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Asplund-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asplund 1991</LINK>), it was shown that, despite large differences in treatment protocols and target haematocrit levels, the reduction in haematocrit was remarkably similar, ranging from 4% to 7% in absolute terms and from 9% to 16% in relative terms in all but one study (<LINK REF="STD-Koller-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Koller 1990</LINK>), in which the reduction in haematocrit was more pronounced. In the only trial reporting on the change of haematocrit, haemodilution by HES and without venesection reduced haematocrit by 2% in absolute and by 5% in relative terms (<LINK REF="STD-MAHST-1998" TYPE="STUDY">MAHST 1998</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:46:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>As shown in the International Stroke Trial, intentional haemodilution has until recently been widely used in some countries to treat people with acute ischaemic stroke (International Stroke Trial Collaborative Group, personal communication). The present systematic review shows that this clinical practice has no clear scientific support. No benefit of haemodilution on mortality or on functional outcome in survivors has been documented, and the overall results of this review showed no clear evidence of benefit of this therapy. This conclusion concerns both hyper- and isovolaemic haemodilution regimens and all types of haemodiluting agents used (dextran, hydroxyethyl starch and albumin). Haemodilution for acute ischaemic stroke should not be used outside of clinical trials with the possible exception of people with severe polycythaemia.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-08-25 10:46:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In most participants included in the trials reviewed here, haemodilution treatment has been initiated later than six hours after onset of stroke symptoms and there has been a considerable additional delay before a significant reduction of haematocrit levels have been achieved. However, the available data from participants treated by isovolaemic and hypervolaemic haemodilution within six hours do not provide support for another large-scale clinical trial of this treatment. There is growing support from animal experimental models of ischaemic stroke that haemodilution initiated within the first few hours may limit brain infarct size and improve neurological outcome. While there was promise for albumin therapy, the large ALIAS trials enrolled participants within five hours of stroke onset and did not show benefit, suggesting that future clinical trials using albumin would have less clinical equipoise. The development of new oxygen-carrying haemodilutants and neuroprotectant agents is interesting. New clinical trials are warranted only if the balance between beneficial effects and adverse reactions of new modes of haemodilution have been solidly documented in experimental stroke models.</P>

<P>The 2002 version stated in the methods that "Only studies which reported clinical end-points of direct relevance for the patients (death, neurological outcome, functional outcome, need for institutional care, vascular or other events, adverse reactions) have been included." and "Many studies reported on changes in neurological and functional scores. A plethora of scores and measures of distribution have been used. Therefore, it has not been possible to report on changes of score sums in a uniform manner." All studies containing neurological outcome also had other outcomes including mortality, need for institutional care, etc. Therefore, these studies could be included in the data and analyses.</P>
<P>We decided not to include studies that only had neurological score outcomes, which may have been implicit in the 2002 methods. These studies could not be added to the data and analyses given the varying scores. Therefore, we added the following in the current version's methods "...studies that only included neurological examination scale outcomes because these outcomes could not be combined given the variety of neurological scores (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>)."</P>
