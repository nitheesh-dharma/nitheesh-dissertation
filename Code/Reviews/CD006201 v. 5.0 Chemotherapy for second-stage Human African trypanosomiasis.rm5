<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-19 14:32:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a painful and protracted disease transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies and it is found in rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Sleeping sickness has two clinical phases but this review focuses only on treatment of the second-stage, which is characterized by neurological changes and almost invariably fatal without treatment. There are only a few drugs currently available for second-stage sleeping sickness, all with considerable adverse events and variable efficacy.</P>
<P>The review includes nine trials with 2577 participants. Each trial reported different comparisons of the drugs currently available to treat second stage HAT (melarsoprol, eflornithine, nifurtimox) so no meta-analysis was possible.</P>
<P>Melarsoprol administration is intravenous and very painful, with many adverse reactions including a severe dysfunction of the brain, that can result in death. For this reason, trials were designed to evaluate shorter melarsoprol regimens. Giving melarsoprol for 10 days was found to be as effective as giving it for 26 days. Recently, nifurtimox and eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) was assessed. Few patients relapsed after NECT, which was generally well tolerated. It also has practical advantages: eflornithine has to be administered as a slow intravenous infusion thus requiring specialized health facilities and personnel, but nifurtimox is given orally. NECT uses less eflornithine doses and reduces the burden on health personnel and patients.</P>
<P>Considering that none of the current therapeutic options for HAT is optimal in terms of adverse events and ease of administration, it is essential that new anti-trypanosomal compounds are developed and tested in experimental and clinical studies. In the meantime, local availability of the drugs and the status of health facilities and personnel will dictate choice of treatment. It is envisioned that melarsoprol, with its high level of adverse events, will be phased out in favour of eflornithine and NECT. The development of parasite resistance to the drugs needs to be carefully monitored. Future research should also focus on the reduction of the adverse effects of currently used drugs and better diagnostic tests.</P>

<P>Nine trials with 2577 participants, all with <I>Trypansoma brucei gambiense</I> HAT, were included. Seven trials tested currently available drugs: melarsoprol, eflornithine, nifurtimox, alone or in combination; one trial tested pentamidine, and one trial assessed the addition of prednisolone to melarsoprol. The frequency of death and number of adverse events were similar between patients treated with fixed 10-day regimens of melarsoprol or 26-days regimens. Melarsoprol monotherapy gave fewer relapses than pentamidine or nifurtimox, but resulted in more adverse events.</P>
<P>Later trials evaluate nifurtimox combined with eflornithine (NECT), showing this gives few relapses and is well tolerated. It also has practical advantages in reducing the frequency and number of eflornithine slow infusions to twice a day, thus easing the burden on health personnel and patients. </P>

<P>Choice of therapy for second stage Gambiense HAT will continue to be determined by what is locally available, but eflornithine and NECT are likely to replace melarsoprol, with careful parasite resistance monitoring.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-19 14:52:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite <I>Trypanosoma brucei </I>that is<I> </I>transmitted through the bite of infected tsetse flies. The disease occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, wherever tsetse flies are found. In 2006, it was estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 individuals were infected (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>); between 2004 and 2008, the reported number of new cases was approximately 10,000 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). The eco-distribution of tsetse flies is determined by the climate, presence of water, vegetation, and their requirement for blood meals (human or animals), but they are mostly found in rural and forested areas. Essential human activities such as farming, collecting water from natural sources, washing, and fishing, can increase contact between humans and tsetse flies and contribute to the spread of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Pepin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 2001</LINK>). The incidence of HAT was reduced to very low levels by the end of the 1950s following large-scale campaigns of active case detection and surveillance, and tsetse flies control campaigns (<LINK REF="REF-Cattand-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cattand 2001</LINK>). However, since the 1960s, the gradual breakdown of control programmes, aggravated by economic hardship, war, and civil strife in most endemic countries, resulted in an alarming resurgence of HAT, with epidemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sudan, Uganda, and the Central African Republic, that resulted in the disruption of whole communities and with huge socioeconomic costs (<LINK REF="REF-Seed-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seed 2001</LINK>). In the past few years the reported number of cases of sleeping sickness has again reduced due to increased control measures, although the exact number of cases is uncertain because of poor health services in most of the affected areas (<LINK REF="REF-Brun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sleeping sickness is a painful and protracted disease which is almost invariably fatal without adequate treatment; treatment of infected individuals is crucial for reducing the trypanosome reservoir in humans and consequently for controlling the disease. The mostly rural distribution of the disease, civic unrest occurring in many regions affected, the financial and social constraints experienced by endemic countries, and the difficulties in diagnosing and effectively treating HAT, all contribute to make it one of the hardest diseases to control in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
<P>Two subspecies of <I>Trypanosoma brucei</I> can infect humans. <I>T. b. gambiense </I>causes a generally chronic form of sleeping sickness in West and Central Africa. <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I>, found in Eastern and Southern Africa, generally causes a more acute form of the disease. In both forms the disease is characterized by two clinical stages related to the propagation of the parasite in the infected host. In the first stage, when trypanosomes multiply in the haemolymphatic system, infected individuals experience intermittent episodes of fever and develop lymphadenopathy, and other non-specific signs such as hepatosplenomegaly and skin rashes (<LINK REF="REF-Stich-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stich 2002</LINK>). In the second stage of the disease, trypanosomes reach the central nervous system resulting in a chronic meningoencephalitis with headaches and extensive neurological changes, which result in severe sleep disturbances resembling narcolepsy, convulsions, semi-coma, and death (<LINK REF="REF-Stich-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stich 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis and stage determination of HAT are problematic and cannot be based on clinical signs alone (<LINK REF="REF-Lejon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lejon 2005</LINK>). The presence of parasites has to be demonstrated in body fluids, and, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), diagnosis of second-stage HAT should be based on an examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for trypanosomes, white blood cell (WBC) count of &gt;5 WBC/&#956;L in CSF, and increased total protein concentration (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Patients with up to 5 WBC/&#956;L in CSF are diagnosed with first-stage HAT. There is some controversy about the correct staging of patients with 6 to 20 WBC/&#956;L in CSF, as many patients in this 'grey zone' do not display typical symptoms of second-stage HAT and can be cured with drugs that do not reach therapeutic levels in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Lejon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lejon 2005</LINK>). A WBC over 20/&#956;L in CSF has been recommended by an expert panel as a cut-off point for inclusion of patients in clinical trials for treatment of second-stage HAT (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment for both stages of the disease is also complex. Treatment for the first stage relies on an early diagnosis, often missed due to the lack of specificity of the initial symptoms, and employs two drugs (pentamidine for Gambiense HAT and suramin for Rhodesiense disease) that have been used for more than 60 years and which can produce severe side effects. However, these drugs are still effective and in use (<LINK REF="REF-Brun-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brun 2010</LINK>). In this review we will focus on the treatment of second-stage HAT, which is problematic as drugs available are difficult to administer, and can cause severe adverse events and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Chappuis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappuis 2007</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Choice of drugs</HEADING>
<P>Treatment of second-stage HAT relies on melarsoprol, eflornithine, or nifurtimox &#8722; at present the only anti-trypanosomal compounds that can reach therapeutic levels in the central nervous system. These drugs have been in use for many years, and their in vivo efficacy against HAT has been extrapolated after animal studies or, in the case of nifurtimox, after being used to treat American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Also, the use of any of these drugs is complicated by multiple factors including the increasing incidence of therapeutic failures, painful administration, severe adverse reactions, availability, and high production costs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Melarsoprol</HEADING>
<P>Melarsoprol, a trivalent organic arsenical compound, has been the drug of choice for second-stage HAT caused by either <I>T. b. gambiense</I> or <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I> since 1949. Melarsoprol is liposoluble and for this reason can cross the blood brain barrier (<LINK REF="REF-Nok-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nok 2003</LINK>); however, being insoluble in water, it must be administered strictly intravenously after being dissolved in propylene glycol, which is highly irritating to tissues. As a result, the administration of melarsoprol is very painful (<LINK REF="REF-Nok-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nok 2003</LINK>). The most appropriate regimen is not yet agreed upon and various regimens are currently in use. Melarsoprol causes a variety of adverse reactions, but the most serious is an encephalopathic syndrome. The incidence of this complication varies from 1.5% to 28% of all melarsoprol treatments, with a median associated fatality rate of 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Seixas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seixas 2005</LINK>); because of this risk, treatment with melarsoprol requires hospitalization of the patient (<LINK REF="REF-Stich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stich 2003</LINK>). High rates of therapeutic failure have been observed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and Sudan (<LINK REF="REF-Legros-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legros 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Eflornithine</HEADING>
<P>Eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine, DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, was developed as an anticancer drug in the 1970s, but it was found insufficiently active for this indication. Its activity against trypanosomes was demonstrated in laboratory animals in 1980. The first HAT patient was treated in 1981 (with oral eflornithine) and the intravenous formulation was registered in 1990. Eflornithine is effective against both stages of <I>T. b. gambiense</I> infection, but its effectiveness against <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I> is unreliable because of innate low sensitivity of this parasite. Eflornithine is difficult to administer as it requires four daily intravenous infusions for seven to 14 days (<LINK REF="REF-Burri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burri 2003</LINK>); recent trials have tested two daily eflornithine doses (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>). Eflornithine can induce several adverse reactions such as anaemia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, gastroenteric symptoms, headaches, and sometimes seizures, but it is in general better tolerated than melarsoprol (<LINK REF="REF-Burri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burri 2003</LINK>). Therapeutic failures with eflornithine in the second stage of <I>T. b. gambiense</I> disease are uncommon, but relapse rates of 8.1% were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Balasegaram-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Balasegaram 2006</LINK>) and need to be assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Nifurtimox</HEADING>
<P>Nifurtimox was originally developed and registered for use in American trypanosomiasis and only recently has been reserved for compassionate use in HAT when other treatments have failed. Nifurtimox has the advantage of being orally active. Both stages of infection with <I>T. b. gambiense</I> are susceptible to treatment with nifurtimox, but it has seldom been used as a first-stage drug. Its efficacy against <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I> has not been assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Pepin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepin 1994</LINK>). Nifurtimox monotherapy has been used for patients who are refractory to melarsoprol, with high (75% to 85%) cure rates (Moens 1984, <LINK REF="REF-Van-Nieuwenhove-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Nieuwenhove 1992</LINK>). Adverse effects include dysfunctions of the central nervous system and of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Bouteille-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouteille 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Combination therapies and adjunctive treatments</HEADING>
<P>Combining existing drugs may delay the onset of resistance and also help reduce dosages and adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Legros-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legros 2002</LINK>). Combination therapies have been used on a compassionate basis in patients unresponsive to other drugs. Pre-treatment with first-stage drugs during second-stage therapy with melarsoprol has frequently been used on an empirical basis to reduce melarsoprol toxicity. Combinations of nifurtimox with eflornithine, melarsoprol with nifurtimox, and nifurtimox and melarsoprol have been tested (<LINK REF="REF-Bouteille-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouteille 2003</LINK>); recent trials focusing on nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) are reported in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Steroids have been used as an adjunctive treatment to melarsoprol to reduce the frequency of a drug-induced encephalopathy. Some studies have shown a positive effect of prednisolone co-administered with melarsoprol (<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK>), but the role of corticosteroids of different types and at different dosages needs to be properly assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future perspectives</HEADING>
<P>No new drugs for treating late-stage sleeping sickness were specifically developed from 1949 until very recently - both nifurtimox and eflornithine were designed for other indications. The pharmaceutical industry has little economic incentive to research and develop new compounds for a disease with such a limited and unprofitable market. Around 2000, manufacturers even seriously considered abandoning the production of melarsoprol, eflornithine, suramin, and nifurtimox, and to considerably increase the price of pentamidine (<LINK REF="REF-Stich-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stich 2003</LINK>). Fortunately, in May 2001, the pharmaceutical company Aventis (now Sanofi-Aventis) agreed to guarantee the production of pentamidine, melarsoprol, and eflornithine for at least five years and to deliver these drugs free of charge to WHO. The agreement was renewed in 2006 and it is still ongoing.</P>
<P>However, recent research has resulted in the clinical development of two new compounds, fexinidazole and oxaborole. Fexinidazole (<LINK REF="REF-DNDi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DNDi 2008</LINK>) is a 5-nitroimidazole and in experimental studies was found to be active against both <I>T. b. gambiense</I> and <I>T. b. rhodesiense, </I>to have a favourable safety profile and to be orally active. Phase II/III clinical trials of fexinidazole are going to take place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic (<LINK REF="STD-DNDi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DNDi 2012</LINK>). Another oral drug candidate, an oxaborole-6-carboxamide (SCYX-7158) is undergoing a Phase I clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-DNDi-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">DNDi 2012b</LINK>).
<BR/>

</P>
<P>As progress on the development of new drugs and their clinical applications is going to take time, the urgent short-term advance to be made consists of preclinical investigations and of clinical trials to improve the effectiveness, safety, and ease of administration of monotherapy regimens using melarsoprol, eflornithine, or nifurtimox, and, most importantly, of regimens with combinations of these drugs. A multicentre NECT trial run by Medecines sans Frontieres, Epicentre, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DND<I>i</I>), and the Swiss Tropical institute, in collaboration with national Ministries of Health and HAT programs, has recently ended. On the basis of its results, a proposal for the inclusion of the combination of eflornithine and nifurtimox as treatment for second-stage sleeping sickness in the WHO model list of essential medicines (EML) was submitted in November 2008 and approved in May 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review aims to examine whether any of the current drugs, their combinations, or their combinations with adjunctive treatments at any particular dosage provides a definite advantage over other regimens for the treatment of second-stage HAT, measured in terms of clinical outcomes and in relation to the severity of adverse effects.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial location and participants</HEADING>
<P>All included trials were conducted in one of the following countries: Democratic republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Angola, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire. Two multicenter trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2000</LINK> and .<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> had sites in different countries. Eight trials were conducted in hospitals or specialized trypanosomiasis units, in one (<LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK>) the setting was unspecified. The oldest included trial is <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK>.</P>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>) did not include young children but only adolescents and adults. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 2004</LINK>) only included adults (over 18 years), the remaining four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK>) included both adults and young children.</P>

<P>The total number of participants randomized in the included trials was 2577. All included patients suffered from <I>T. b. gambiense</I> HAT as we did not identify any RCT describing treatment for <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I>. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>) did not include participants that had a history of treatment for sleeping sickness (at any time or during the last 36 months), but three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK>) did not mention this characteristic and <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2000</LINK> included both new and relapsing cases.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials tested the effectiveness of the currently available drugs to treat second stage HAT: melarsoprol, eflornithine, nifurtimox, used alone or in combination. <LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK> tested the effectiveness of pentamidine, which is indicated to treat first stage HAT, in patients showing a CSF WBC count between 6 and 20 WBC/&#956;L. <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK> tested melarsoprol with or without prednisolone as an adjunctive treatment to reduce the frequency of melarsoprol-induced encephalopathy.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>) compared different regimens of melarsoprol.

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>) included comparisons between three monotherapies (two different regimens of melarsoprol, or nifurtimox alone) and a melarsoprol-nifurtimox combination.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK> reports on comparisons between dual combinations of melarsoprol, eflornithine and nifurtimox; <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> compares eflornithine monotherapy given for 14 days, with an eflornithine-nifurtimox combination given for seven days.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional treatments</HEADING>
<P>It is common practice to pre-treat HAT patients against other diseases which are endemic in the same areas, such as malaria and helminthiasis. HAT patients are often treated with prednisolone to reduce the risk of melarsoprol-induced encephalopathy, and in some of the included trials they received multivitamins, paracetamol or food rations (also given to their accompanying carers as hospitals and health centres in the endemic areas don't usually have enough resources to provide food). We have listed the details of the additional treatments for each trials in a separate table (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dosing and regimens</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Melarsoprol monotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Melarsoprol was always used intravenously; dosages and schedules tested varied between studies. A "standard regimen" (three series of 3.6 mg/kg/day for three days, with a seven day break between series for a total duration of 26 days) was used in <LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>. A shorter schedule of melarsoprol at 2.2 mg/kg/day for 10 days was used by <LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK>, in comparison with a "standard Angolan schedule" over 26 days as follows: 1.2 mg/kg on day one, 2.4 mg/kg on day two, 3.6 mg/kg on day three and four, repeated on days 12-15 and 23-26. A 10 day schedule of melarsoprol at 2.16 mg/kg/day was used by <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>. Incremental melarsoprol was also used by <LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK> at doses from 0.6 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg for the first three days, followed by the same dose of 1.8 mg/kg/day until day 10, and by <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK> where the doses started at 1.8 mg/kg up to 3.6 mg/kg for three series of three injections separated by seven days. <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK> used a 3.6 mg/kg dose of melarsoprol but the number of series and injections varied according to the white blood cell count of the patient - this is known as a Neujean schedule.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Eflornithine monotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Oral eflornithine was tested in <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 2004</LINK> comparing doses of 400 mg/kg/day with 500 mg/kg/day. <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2000</LINK> compared intravenous eflornithine (which is given a slow infusion) at 400 mg/kg/day for seven compared with 14 days in a trial including new and relapsing patients. <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> tested eflornithine only given a slow infusion at 400 mg/kg/day for 14 days against the combination of nifurtimox-eflornithine described below.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Pentamidine monotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Pentamidine was used in <LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK> at a dose of 4 mg/kg for 10 days, given intramuscularly, for patients in the so-called intermediate stage (ie with a CSF cell count between 6 and 20 cells/&#956;L).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Combination therapies</HEADING>
<P>1) Melarsoprol-nifurtimox low-dose combination (<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>) for 10 days: melarsoprol alone at 0.6 mg/kg intravenously on day one and at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously on day two, followed by eight days of oral nifurtimox at 7.5 mg/kg every twelve hours, combined with melarsoprol at 1.2 mg/kg intravenously/day.</P>
<P>2) Melarsoprol-nifurtimox was used in <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK> at doses of 1.8 mg/kg/day intravenous melarsoprol for 10 days, and oral nifurtimox at 15 mg/kg/day every eight hours for 10 days.</P>
<P>3) Melarsoprol-eflornithine (intravenous melarsoprol , eflornithine as slow infusion) was used in <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK>: melarsoprol at 1.8 mg/kg/day for 10 days, eflornithine at 400 mg/kg/day, every six hours for seven days.</P>
<P>4) Melarsoprol + prednisolone (<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK>) added oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day, given at intervals, to a Neujean schedule of melarsoprol.</P>
<P>5) Nifurtimox-eflornithine was used in <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK> and in <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> as oral nifurtimox at 15 mg/kg/day every eight hours for 10 days, added to eflornithine as a slow infusion at 400 mg/kg/day, every six hours for 7 days (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK>) or every 12 hours for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The included trials measured different outcomes from our protocol: most trials did not differentiate between death due to the disease or due to treatment (encephalopathy caused by melarsoprol), and measured death related to treatment or within 30 days of ending it. Parasitological cure rates (trypanosomes in any body compartment) were measured usually within one day from the end of treatment.</P>
<P>Follow-up was done at several time points, up to 24 months for all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 2004</LINK> (12 months), <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK> (36 months), and <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> (18 months). Outcomes measured at any follow-up point included trypanosomes in any body compartment, an increase in WBC in CSF more than 50 cells/µL or a lower increase (20 to 49 cells/µL) together with symptoms typical of relapse. We grouped these outcomes as "relapse during follow-up".</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events represent one of the major measurable outcomes during sleeping sickness treatment, especially in trials which use melarsoprol which can cause severe encephalopathies.</P>
<P>All trials except <LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK> reported in detail on several adverse events, (although different trials did not report exactly the same adverse events): central nervous system (CNS) alterations, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain, cardiac arrhythmia, leukopenia, neutropenia, infections, and skin reactions.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-28 16:16:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review's objectives were to assess the effectiveness and safety of drugs used for treating second-stage human African trypanosomiasis. All the trials we identified refer to treatment for HAT caused by <I>T. b. gambiense</I>; we did not find any RCT reporting on treatment for HAT caused by <I>T.b. rhodesiense</I>. Trials on treatment of <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I> would have been analysed and discussed separately from the <I>T. b. gambiense</I> trials and will be included, if available, in future updates of the review.</P>
<P>Trials of treatment for sleeping sickness encounter logistic, organizational and clinical difficulties that have to be taken into consideration when assessing trial design and methodological quality. The number of drugs available is very limited, routes of administration are painful or difficult to secure under field conditions, and toxicity high. Also, the quantity of drugs available may be a limiting factor under field circumstances, and clinical trials may have to be interrupted because of local political instability. Drug regimens were mainly empirically developed and scarce pharmacokinetic data are available. Pharmaceutical companies have little commercial interest in developing new drugs for HAT. For all these reasons, efforts have been focused on optimizing and minimizing drug regimens and reducing adverse events. We grouped the treatments tested in the included randomized controlled trials as drug monotherapies (melarsoprol regimens, eflornithine regimens), comparisons between monotherapies and in more recent trials, comparisons of several drug combinations. No meta-analysis was possible as no two trials compared the same treatment.</P>
<P>Some aspects of the methodological quality of most trials were not optimal, but this was related to the characteristics of the treatment under investigations. The different routes of administration and regimes under comparison would not have allowed blinding of participants and medical personnel in any of the trials. Allocation concealment and randomization methods however were adequate and well described in most trials. Furthermore, the priority in the past was mainly to treat the enormous existing number of patients in order to be able to control the disease; we did not include studies which were not randomized, but many of these excluded publications reported on important medical observations. This applies in particular to <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I> second-stage disease in which no randomized controlled trials were found. Rhodesiense HAT tends to occur in self-limited epidemic outbreaks or as isolated cases, and the reported cases represent less than 10% of all HAT cases (<LINK REF="REF-Simarro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simarro 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>1) Monotherapies - melarsoprol and eflornithine</B>
</P>
<P>Melarsoprol can induce a life-threatening encephalopathy in a large percentage of treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Seixas-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seixas 2005</LINK>) and trials assessing melarsoprol have been aimed at minimizing doses of the drug and length of treatment while maintaining anti-trypanosome activity.</P>
<P>Fixed 10-day regimens were found to be as effective as those of 26 days and resulted in similar levels of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>). They offer however significant practical advantages (fewer painful injections, less drug used and shorter treatment duration). Slightly different graded 26-day melarsoprol regimens were used in <LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>, and an incremental 10-day regimen was tested in <LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>. Although <LINK REF="STD-Burri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Burri 2000</LINK> did not report differences in outcomes or adverse events between the graded schedule and the 10-day schedule, the other two trials showed that graded or incremental melarsoprol resulted in higher death rates, higher number of seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>) and more relapses (<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK>), suggesting that incremental melarsoprol schedules should be abandoned (<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A large multinational non-randomized clinical study (Schmid 2005) also confirmed the effectiveness (non-inferiority) of the shorter 10-day melarsoprol schedule, in comparison with the standard 26 days of treatment, with regard to cure rates and adverse events. The applicability of this abridged 10-day melarsoprol schedule to Rhodesiense HAT patients has recently been tested in a utilization study in two trial centres in Uganda an Tanzania (<LINK REF="REF-IMPAMEL-III" TYPE="REFERENCE">IMPAMEL III</LINK>I), showing similar levels of adverse events with historical controls. The potential implementation of this abridged melarsoprol schedule to second stage Rhodesiense HAT patients is currently being evaluated, but the trial was non-randomized and outside the inclusion criteria of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pepin-1989a" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 1989a</LINK> showed that the addition of prednisolone to melarsoprol reduced the number of encephalopathy cases and associated mortality. Prednisolone and other corticosteroids had been used as an adjunctive treatment to melarsoprol for many years but this was the first randomized trial to test it and indicate its effectiveness. This trial is however of insufficient methodological quality (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Prednisolone and prednisone are currently still in use in patients receiving melarsoprol as no suitable alternative encephalopathic syndrome preventive treatment has been identified, but their effectiveness remains unclear.</P>
<P>Eflornithine is effective against <I>T. b. gambiense </I>and induces less severe adverse events than melarsoprol, but it has to be administered as a slow intravenous infusion every six hours and this is difficult under field conditions. <LINK REF="STD-Pepin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pepin 2000</LINK> tested a 7-day against a 14-day regimen and showed that treating for seven days resulted in fewer deaths and fewer adverse events in patients relapsing from a previous episode of sleeping sickness, making it a suitable alternative in this kind of patient. The 7-day regimen was however less effective than the 14-day schedule especially for new cases. <LINK REF="STD-Na_x002d_Bangchang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Na-Bangchang 2004</LINK> tested oral eflornithine at two slightly different dosages (500 and 400 mg/kg/day). There were no deaths in this trial, and similar levels of adverse events between the two patient groups, but oral eflornithine seemed not to reach adequate levels in plasma and CSF, and further development of this administration route was abandoned.</P>
<P>
<B>3) Comparisons between single drugs </B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK> tested two melarsoprol regimens, a standard 26-day regimen and an incremental 10-day regimen, against nifurtimox. The two melarsoprol regimens were more effective at preventing relapses than nifurtimox alone, but induced more cases of encephalopathies, and overall mortality was highest with incremental melarsoprol.</P>
<P>Melarsoprol also gave fewer relapses than pentamidine (<LINK REF="STD-Lejon-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lejon 2003</LINK>) but no other outcomes or adverse events were reported in this trial. The results of this trial indicate that the use of pentamidine (commonly used for first stage HAT) in patients in the so-called intermediate stage is hazardous and that better markers of disease stage are needed to allow its safe use in this clinical situation.</P>
<P>
<B>4) Combination therapies</B>
</P>
<P>Since 2006, two-drugs combinations between any of the drugs used in second-stage HAT (melarsoprol, eflornithine and nifurtimox) have been tested in randomized controlled trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bisser-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Bisser 2007</LINK> tested a combination of melarsoprol and nifurtimox, given for 10 days, against standard or incremental melarsoprol regimens, and against nifurtimox alone, in an equivalence trial. Melasorprol-nifurtimox was more effective than monotherapies at reducing the number of relapses but adverse events were comparable between groups and encephalopathies were reported in all regimens which included melarsoprol.</P>
<P>A trial testing comparing melarsoprol-nifurtimox with melarsoprol-eflornithine and nifurtimox-eflornithine had to be interrupted because of the high number of deaths, due to reactive encephalopathy, reported in the melarsoprol-nifurtimox group (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2006</LINK>). The same trial showed that patients receiving nifurtimox-eflornithine had a lower risk of relapse and fewer deaths than those receiving drug combinations with melarsoprol. Following this initial observation a much larger multi-site trial to compare eflornithine with nifurtimox-eflornithine (thus completely removing melarsoprol) was planned, implemented in selected HAT treatment centres and recently completed (<LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK>). The combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) was shown to give fewer relapses and was generally well tolerated. A satisfactory safety profile of NECT was confirmed in a non-randomized study in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which included children and pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Schmid-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmid 2012</LINK>), and in a recent cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Alirol-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alirol 2013</LINK>) which also included children . A major advantage of NECT is the reduction in the frequency and number of eflornithine slow infusions to twice a day, thus reducing the burden on health personnel and patients alike. <LINK REF="STD-Priotto-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Priotto 2009</LINK> was designed as a non-inferiority trial and its clinical results confirmed the non-inferiority of NECT to eflornithine alone; other considerations are the practical advantages of using NECT in terms of drug quantities, personnel time and logistic costs. Furthermore, the combined use of two drugs should decrease the emergence of resistance.</P>
<P>
<B>Future perspectives</B>
</P>
<P>NECT was approved by the Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines at its 17th meeting on 30 April 2009 and was included in the WHO Essential List of Medicines for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Treating second-stage HAT patients without the need for melarsoprol has the clear advantage of removing the risk of encephalopathic syndromes and other severe adverse events. NECT has this and other significant advantages in comparison with other therapies, but it still requires two drugs, used for several days, involving specialized health personnel. Further refinements and reductions of this combination need to be tested, and additional field studies as well as the establishment of an appropriate dose regimen for NECT in children are planned (<LINK REF="REF-DNDi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DNDi 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The development of new (and easier to use) drugs would represent a big step forward for the management of second-stage HAT. A promising recent initiative is the announcement by DND<I>i </I>that fexinidazole is entering clinical development for HAT and that an agreement was signed with Sanofi-Aventis for its further development. Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole and in experimental studies was found to be active against both <I>T. b. gambiense</I> and <I>T. b. rhodesiense</I>. Phase II studies of oral fexinidazole in humans are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-DNDi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">DNDi 2012</LINK>). Another new product, Oxaborole SCYX-7158, also for oral administration, is undergoing Phase I studies (<LINK REF="STD-DNDi-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">DNDi 2012b</LINK>).</P>
<P>After several decades of scarce attention, the past few years have seen a new impetus in the fight against HAT, due in good part to an efficient co-ordination and collaboration between different agencies, researchers, and national trypanosomiasis programmes, the diminution of social upheavals, capacity building activities and the free provision of diagnostic and reagents and medicines. The situation has improved even in the few years since the protocol for this Cochrane review was first published (2006): the total number of HAT cases decreased 68% between 1995 and 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Simarro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simarro 2008</LINK>). Clinical trials of high methodological quality have been completed since then (despite no significant reduction in the logistic challenges to be faced by trialists). So the practical implications of these latest trials go beyond their clinical results to also include a framework for planning and executing trials in resource-poor settings.</P>
<P>There are signs that the use of melarsoprol will decline. An analysis of pooled data from 11,668 patients from different countries showed that its effectiveness was lower than eflornithine (<LINK REF="REF-Balasegaram-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasegaram 2009</LINK>). In the absence of a direct randomized comparison between melarsoprol, eflornithine and NECT, this is a relevant finding due to the number of patients treated from several different locations and a comprehensive analysis of the outcomes. Also, although the choice of HAT therapy is often dictated by local conditions of availability, active public-private partnerships have allowed Gambiense HAT endemic countries to increase the use of eflornithine and NECT, resulting in a decrease in the percentage of melarsoprol treated patients from 86% in 2004 to 51% in 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Parasite resistance is less likely to develop with a combination such as NECT, but a system of monitoring will be needed to monitor the effectiveness of drug regimens over time.</P>
<P>It is imperative that studies on the reduction of the adverse effects of currently used drugs, testing different regimens, and experimental and clinical studies on the development of new anti-trypanosomal compounds, effective for both stages of the disease, also continue taking place.</P>

<P>Choice of therapy for second stage Gambiense HAT in the next few years will continue to be dictated by local conditions of availability and logistic difficulties, but it is envisioned that melarsoprol, with its high level of adverse events, will be phased out in favour of eflornithine and NECT. Parasite resistance to the drugs as well as their effectiveness need to be carefully monitored in large cohort studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-03-28 16:16:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Vittoria Lutje">
<P>It is essential that future research focus on the reduction of the adverse effects of currently used drugs, tests on different regimens, and experimental and clinical studies on the development of new anti-trypanosomal compounds, effective for both stages of the disease. Development of new diagnostic tools, both to improve disease confirmation and to precisely determine the stage of the disease, and to avoid the need for lumbar punctures performed under unsafe conditions, is also necessary.</P>

<P>A. Kennedy joined the review team after the protocol was published.</P>
<P>We deviated from the protocol as follows: updated and modified the Background section; reduced the number and slightly modified the outcome measures; modified the list of adverse events to include skin reactions and infections.</P>
<P>As the trials included different treatments, we did not perform meta-analysis, subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity, or sensitivity analysis.</P>
