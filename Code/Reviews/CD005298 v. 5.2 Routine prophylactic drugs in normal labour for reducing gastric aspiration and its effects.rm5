<P>No good evidence for drugs, like antacids, in normal labour to reduce the small chance of inhaling some stomach contents if general anaesthesia is required.</P>
<P>Caregivers are often concerned that some woman in normal labour may go on to have a general anaesthetic, either for a caesarean section in labour, or to remove the placenta after birth should it be retained. The concern arises because there is a very small risk that the woman might regurgitate and possibly inhale some of the stomach contents into the lungs (gastric aspiration or Mendelsohn's syndrome) during the general anaesthetic. This can cause severe lung and breathing problems, especially if the stomach contents are acid (low pH), and extremely rarely (one in a million) a woman may die from an anaesthetic problem. Giving drugs to reduce the volume of the stomach contents, or to make them less acid may help to reduce the problem. The review of trials looked to see whether giving such drugs routinely to all women in normal labour was effective. The review identified three trials involving 2465 women but none assessed gastric aspiration, probably because it is a very rare event. Instead the trials all assessed the incidence of vomiting, although there is no proven link between vomiting in labour and gastric aspiration during general anaesthesia. The review found some limited evidence that 1) drugs like antacids may reduce the chance of vomiting in labour, 2) H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist drugs (like ranitidine) appeared to have a similar impact on outcomes as antacids and 3) dopamine antagonists (like metoclopramide) may reduce the chance on vomiting in labour when given alongside pethidine. Overall, there was no evidence that any of these drugs reduced the incidence of gastric aspiration or Mendelsohn's syndrome.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-10-27 15:45:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Women in normal labour may sometimes go on to have general anaesthesia if labour becomes abnormal, for example if a caesarean section is required. General anaesthesia carries a very small risk of regurgitation and inhalation of stomach contents into the lungs. This can cause inflammation, particularly if the fluid is acidic, and can lead to severe morbidity and very occasionally mortality. Labour hormones increase the risk of gastric aspiration or Mendelsohn's syndrome, though the exact incidence is unknown. The routine administration of acid prophylaxis drugs to all women in normal labour is commonly practiced worldwide, to reduce gastric aspiration by reducing the volume and acidity of stomach contents.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of routine prophylaxis drugs for women in normal labour to reduce gastric aspiration and its effects.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-10-27 15:45:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2005), EMBASE (1974 to April 2005) and CINAHL (1982 to April 2005). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 1 October 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of women in normal labour assessing the routine administration of drugs (antacids, H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists, dopamine antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors) compared with placebo/no treatment, and compared with other drugs for reducing gastric aspiration. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, quality, extracted data and performed double-data entry. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials were included, involving 2465 women, assessing the effects of antacids, H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists and dopamine antagonists. There were no trials on proton-pump inhibitors. None of the trials were of good quality, and none assessed the incidence of gastric aspiration, Mendelsohn's syndrome or their consequences. All the studies assessed vomiting, and there was limited evidence that vomiting may be reduced by antacids (relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.77, n = 578, one trial) or by dopamine antagonists given alongside pethidine (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68, n = 584, one trial). Comparisons between different drugs showed no significant differences, though the number of participants was small. There was no evidence that H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists improved outcomes compared with antacids, though only one trial addressed this issue.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Many women have the ability to give birth without the need for medical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Gaskin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaskin 2003</LINK>). However, currently almost all women in income-rich countries are given medical interventions during labour with the aim of improving outcomes. There is concern that some interventions may undermine women's confidence in giving birth, so it is important to assess interventions to see if they achieve their clinical goals, but also to determine their impact on women's feelings and attitudes.</P>
<P>It is usual in some hospitals for women in normal labour to be given prophylactic drugs with the aim of preventing the inhalation of stomach (gastric) contents in labour or shortly afterwards, although this is an extremely rare occurrence and happens more often during general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2004</LINK>). In other hospitals, these drugs are only given once the decision to administer anaesthesia has been made (either for caesarean section or manual removal of retained placenta) to minimise the risk of regurgitation of acidic stomach contents up the throat and back into the lungs. A Cochrane review is being undertaken to assess the effectiveness of giving drugs to prevent this problem (a practice known as acid prophylaxis) when caesarean section is undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2004</LINK>). This review will look at the benefits and harms of giving these drugs routinely to all women in normal labour.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Variations in practice</HEADING>
<P>There is considerable variation in practice around the use of these drugs in different hospitals and countries (<LINK REF="REF-Power-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Power 1987</LINK>). The most recent data from an audit in UK hospitals in 2000, showed that in 34.5% of hospitals, acid prophylaxis (type of drug not specified) was used routinely for all women in labour, and 61% of hospitals gave it to women in labour only after a decision to perform a caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). A German survey in 1999, reported 7% of hospitals gave routine acid aspiration prophylaxis in labour, and 68% gave it to women prior to emergency caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Schneck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneck 1999</LINK>). In 1989, 22% Australian hospitals used acid aspiration prophylaxis routinely for all women in labour, and the remaining 88% used it only for women requiring anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Gastric aspiration</HEADING>
<P>Regurgitation and inhalation of stomach contents can cause inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pneumonitis), particularly if the fluid is acidic, and can lead to severe morbidity and occasionally death. Other adverse effects include narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchospasm), irregular breathing (dyspnoea), raised heart rate (tachycardia), increased fluid in the lung tissues (pulmonary oedema), lack of oxygen in the tissues (cyanosis), low blood pressure (hypotension) and an inability to breathe (asphyxia) (<LINK REF="REF-Teabeaut-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teabeaut 1952</LINK>). This condition is referred to as 'gastric aspiration syndrome', 'acid aspiration syndrome', 'aspiration pneumonia', 'aspiration pneumonitis' or Mendelsohn's syndrome, after Curtis Mendelsohn, the doctor who described the symptoms and investigated the problem in women in labour in the 1940s (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelsohn-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelsohn 1946</LINK>). Mendelsohn reported the problem as an "asthmatic type syndrome" which had an acute duration of 24 to 36 hours following gastric aspiration.</P>
<P>Gastric aspiration can occur during general anaesthesia if the stomach is not empty because the anaesthetic drugs relax muscle tone, specifically the lower oesophageal sphincter. A 'cuffed oral endotracheal tube' is used during general anaesthesia, to fill the passage in the trachea (airway), thus preventing aspiration if regurgitation does occur. However, when the tube is inserted (intubation) and removed (extubation), there is a risk of aspiration and inhalation because the anaesthetic drugs suspend the protective laryngeal reflexes. Gastric aspiration has also been reported during regional anaesthesia (epidurals or spinals), although this is very rare (<LINK REF="REF-Stonell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stonell 2000</LINK>). It may also occur with vomiting, even when an anaesthetic has not been administered, but again this is rare. However, vomiting in labour is quite common but there is no evidence that reducing the incidence of vomiting in labour will reduce the incidence of gastric aspiration during general anaesthesia should it be required.</P>
<P>Women in labour are thought to be at increased risk of gastric aspiration because progesterone (a hormone released in greater amounts during pregnancy and labour) causes relaxation of smooth muscle which slows down of fluid passing out of the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Carp-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carp 1992</LINK>). Other hormones and metabolic changes may also contribute to added risk (<LINK REF="REF-Christofides-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christofides 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, the use of opioid drugs for pain relief in labour, such as pethidine, further reduces gastric emptying time (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chern_x002d_Hughes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chern-Hughes 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gastric acid is secreted in response to food and fluids entering the stomach, and withholding food and fluids are believed to reduce the volume and acidity of the stomach contents (<LINK REF="REF-Power-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Power 1987</LINK>), although prolonged starvation stimulates acid secretion in the stomach. Hence, women in labour have increased gastric acid secretion and delayed gastric emptying, so both the volume and pH conditions predispose to increased risk of gastric aspiration. Routinely withholding food and fluids from women in labour has been standard practice in many hospitals in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DH-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hester-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hester 1977</LINK>), the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1998</LINK>), and elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Schneck-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schneck 1999</LINK>), following the recommendation of Mendelsohn in 1946 (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelsohn-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelsohn 1946</LINK>). The debate over the effectiveness of these measures continues (<LINK REF="REF-Ludka-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludka 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pengelley-1998e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengelley 1998e</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleuthal-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleuthal 1999</LINK>) and the discussion centres around two areas. Firstly, do these interventions reduce the incidence of gastric aspiration? Secondly, what are the adverse effects for women and their babies during labour? A Cochrane review has been undertaken to assess the effectiveness of preoperative fasting before general surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>), and a review is being undertaken on restricting oral fluid and food intake in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Singata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singata 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Incidence</HEADING>
<P>The incidence of gastric aspiration during anaesthesia in labour is not known, but the death of a mother from anaesthesia may happen about once every million maternities in well-resourced services. Maternal mortality from gastric aspiration has reduced dramatically in recent years in high-income countries and is now extremely low (<LINK REF="REF-DH-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1998</LINK>). In the UK, the number of maternal deaths directly associated with anaesthesia has fallen from six in three years (1985 to 1987), to one in three years (1994 to 1996; <LINK REF="REF-DH-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1998</LINK>) and three in three years (1997 to 1999), which is around one per million maternities (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>). None of these latter deaths were due to gastric aspiration. The reduction in maternal deaths from Mendelsohn's syndrome (Mendelsohn reported 66 cases of gastric aspiration in 44,016 pregnant women between 1932 and 1945 with two deaths: <LINK REF="REF-Mendelsohn-1946" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelsohn 1946</LINK>) is most likely due to improved anaesthetic techniques, better drugs, and the greater availability of experienced obstetric anaesthetists. Identifying women at increased risk of aspiration, e.g. women who are obese, smoke, have past obstetric history, past medical history, diabetes or hypertension, may also have helped (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DH-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roopnarinesingh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roopnarinesingh 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>There are two basic interventions used to try to prevent gastric aspiration, or reduce its impact in normal labour. These interventions are based on those used in general surgery, namely:<BR/>(1) not permitting the person to take food or fluids ('nil by mouth') for six hours prior to anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Brady-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brady 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1997</LINK>) which means that food and fluids are withheld during labour (<LINK REF="REF-Singata-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singata 2002</LINK>).<BR/>(2) acid prophylaxis, the administration of drugs to reduce the volume and/or acidity of the stomach contents. The four types of drugs used, and their potential adverse effects, are:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(a) antacids (e.g. magnesium trisilicate, sodium citrate)</HEADING>
<P>Antacids are given orally. They are alkaline substances which reduce or neutralise the acidity of the stomach contents, thus reducing the adverse effects of acidity should aspiration occur. There are both particulate antacids (for example, magnesium trisilicate) and non-particulate or soluble antacids (for example, sodium citrate). Soluble drugs are thought likely to have fewer side-effects as particles in solution can cause added problems if aspiration occurs. The neutralising effect of antacids has been shown to last for about 15 to 20 minutes in women in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Brock_x002d_Utne-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brock-Utne 1989</LINK>) and so repeated doses are used. Adverse effects of the drugs may include belching and diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(b) H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine) </HEADING>
<P>H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists are generally given orally. They inhibit the secretion of acid into the stomach which reduces the volume and acidity of the stomach contents (<LINK REF="REF-Thwaites-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thwaites 1999</LINK>). This action is not immediate and so H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists are often used in combination with antacids. Adverse effects of the drugs may include dizziness, fatigue, rashes, headaches, digestive tract disturbances and also the drugs interact with warfarin (a drug given for blood clotting problems) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(c) dopamine antagonists as antiemetics (e.g. metoclopramide)</HEADING>
<P>Dopamine antagonists are given intramuscularly. They inhibit vomiting and accelerate gastric emptying, and seem to be active from 20 minutes to about two hours after injection (<LINK REF="REF-Rowe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowe 1997</LINK>). Adverse effects of these drugs may include drowsiness, restlessness, diarrhoea and heart beat irregularities (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">(d) proton-pump inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) </HEADING>
<P>Proton-pump inhibitors are given orally and block the production of stomach acid by interfering with the pump which secretes protons (acid) into the stomach (<LINK REF="REF-Browne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Browne 1993</LINK>). The most common adverse effects include rashes, diarrhoea, headaches, nausea, constipation, wind (flatulence), abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation and occasionally they can cause allergic reactions (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Measuring outcomes</HEADING>
<P>As maternal morbidity and mortality from gastric aspiration are rare, and individual trials are unlikely to have sufficient power to asses this outcome, studies in this area often use surrogate measures of effectiveness. Two measures generally used are 1) pH over 2.5 (i.e. less acidic), and 2) gastric volume less than 25 ml. These estimations are based on animals studies, e.g. in monkeys in the 1970s, and are extrapolated to humans (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1976</LINK>). Later studies in rats suggested that problems are more likely to relate to acidity, and that raising the pH above 2.5 and thus decreasing acidity, was thought to be the more important surrogate measure (<LINK REF="REF-James-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1986</LINK>). However, it has since been recognised that the effectiveness of these agents in raising the stomach pH does not necessarily mean they will affect the incidence and severity of gastric aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1989</LINK>). A literature search found no sound evidence that these measures are appropriate surrogates for morbidity from gastric aspiration in women, with the additional concern that both measurements require invasive tests. These data from trials will be reported in this review but with some qualification regarding interpretation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Apart from the potential of adverse effects from these drugs listed above, there are other possible effects that may arise from their use in normal labour. These potential adverse effects on women and babies may include stress, interfering with women's coping abilities, and some women may find taking these drugs unpleasant (<LINK REF="REF-Simkin-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simkin 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of routine prophylactic drugs given to all women during normal labour to reduce the adverse effects of gastric aspiration. Gastric aspiration is most likely to occur during general anaesthesia for caesarean section or for manual removal of retained placenta. Women being given these drugs specifically because they are to have an elective or emergency caesarean section will not be included in this current review, as this question is being addressed by another Cochrane review looking at drugs at caesarean section for preventing nausea, vomiting and aspiration pneumonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety, for women and babies, of routine prophylactic drugs given to women during normal labour to reduce the incidence of gastric aspiration and the effects of inhaling stomach contents (gastric aspiration/Mendelsohn's syndrome). The review considered those interventions given routinely to all women in labour compared with no interventions/placebo, compared with other drugs for this purpose, and compared with combinations of drugs for this purpose. Subanalysis on women considered at high risk of needing anaesthesia would have been undertaken, but there were insufficient data available.</P>

<P>Our search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register identified nine studies for possible inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardiff-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiff 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-London-1985" TYPE="STUDY">London 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Manchester-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Manchester 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston_x002d_Salem-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston-Salem 1980</LINK>). Of these, four met the inclusion criteria initially, but one study (<LINK REF="STD-London-1985" TYPE="STUDY">London 1985</LINK>) reported results in a form which could not be used and so this study was subsequently excluded, leaving three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardiff-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiff 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston_x002d_Salem-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston-Salem 1980</LINK>). For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Chesterfield-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Chesterfield 1978</LINK>), it was unclear if women having elective caesarean sections were included or not, so this study has been put in the <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> section whilst we contact the authors for clarification.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-10-29 14:20:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials were included, involving 2465 women. Each of the three trials assessed a different comparison and there were no trials involving proton-pump inhibitors. None of the trials assessed gastric aspiration as an outcome, nor any of the major consequences of gastric aspiration e.g. cyanosis, pneumonia, adult respiratory syndrome. All these outcomes are very rare and the included trials were really too small to consider them. The included trials mainly assessed vomiting, clearly trialists thinking that reducing the incidence of vomiting would reduce the incidence of gastric aspiration. The validity of this assumption is unclear. </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antacids versus placebo/no treatment or compared with other antacids</HEADING>
<P>Antacids appeared to reduce vomiting compared with no intervention (relative risk (RR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.77, n = 578, one trial: graph 01.01).</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the incidence of vomiting between three individual antacids tested in one study (Gelsuil, Maalox and Mylanta II), though the numbers in each group were small and the data came from just one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Winston_x002d_Salem-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston-Salem 1980</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists versus antacids</HEADING>
<P>There appeared to be no significant difference between H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists compared with antacids in terms of vomiting, caesarean section, emergency general anaesthetic, postpartum haemorrhage and stillbirth, identified in the one trial that addressed these issues, though the number of participants was insufficient to be able to comment with any degree of assurance (1287 women: graphs 11.01 to 11.07). The one study in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1984</LINK>) also assessed the pH and volume of the gastric contents but reported findings using mean values and ranges, and graphical representation. They reported that both drugs raised the gastric pH above 2.5 in most women, with the antacid showing a slightly better response, but also with a larger gastric volume compared with the H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonist.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dopamine antagonists versus placebo/no treatment and other dopamine antagonists</HEADING>
<P>Dopamine antagonists appeared to reduced vomiting compared with placebo when given as an antiemetic alongside 100 mg pethidine (RR 0.40 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68, n = 584, one trial: graph 20.01). The trial showed no significant difference in Apgar scores less than seven at one minute, nor in perinatal death (graphs: 20.06; 20.07), though the number of participants was insufficient to be able to comment with any degree of assurance.</P>
<P>When metoclopramide was compared with perphenazine in the same trial, there was no significant difference in vomiting, Apgar scores less than seven at one minute, nor perinatal death, though the number of participants was insufficient to be able to comment with any degree of assurance (n = 393, graphs: 21.01 to 21.06).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There is surprisingly little data on the use of drugs given to women in normal labour to try to prevent gastric aspiration and Mendelsohn's syndrome, considering the wide spread use of these drugs routinely in labour in many countries worldwide. Also surprisingly, there is the lack of evidence of any impact of these drugs on the usual surrogate measures for gastric aspiration, namely, the pH and volume of stomach contents, with only one trial assessing these outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1984</LINK>). The included studies in this review mostly assessed vomiting, but there is a lack of evidence linking this to gastric aspiration. Considering the rise in caesarean section rates worldwide over recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>), there seems to have been no reported corresponding rise in gastric aspiration or Mendelsohn's syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The studies identified were of questionable quality and only two trials were found which considered the placebo/no treatment comparisons that we wished to address (<LINK REF="STD-Cardiff-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiff 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Winston_x002d_Salem-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston-Salem 1980</LINK>). One trial compared antacids with placebo/no treatment and found that the antacids seemed to reduce the incidence of vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Winston_x002d_Salem-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Winston-Salem 1980</LINK>) though here are some concerns around the randomisation procedure used in this study; no trials compared H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists against placebo/no treatment; one trial compared dopamine antagonists given with pethidine compared with placebo given with pethidine and found the dopamine antagonist seemed to reduce the incidence of vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Cardiff-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiff 1971</LINK>); and there were no trials at all identified on proton-pump inhibitors. One trial compared H<SUB>2</SUB> receptor antagonists with antacids (<LINK REF="STD-Belfast-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Belfast 1984</LINK>) and one trial compared two different dopamine antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Cardiff-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Cardiff 1971</LINK>). As a result, there is insufficient evidence to be able to draw conclusions with any degree of assurance.</P>
<P>An alternative way of using these drugs to help to reduce gastric aspiration may be to give them to women once it has been agreed to give a general anaesthetic for either caesarean section or manual removal of placenta. Another Cochrane review is assessing the evidence on this alternative (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2004</LINK>). </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-27 15:45:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence to support the routine administration of drugs to women in normal labour to reduce the incidence of gastric aspiration or Mendelsohn's syndrome. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-10-27 15:45:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Jill V Hampson">
<P>In well-resourced settings, given that the incidence of gastric aspiration and Mendelsohn's syndrome is extremely low, together with the shift to regional anaesthesia in place of general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery, there seems little need to research this question further. The administration of these drugs to women once a decision to use general anaesthesia (for a caesarean or manual removal of placenta) is an alternative worth investigating, initially through a systematic review of trials already undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Paranjothy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paranjothy 2004</LINK>). It may be important to address these issues specifically in poorly-resourced settings.</P>
