<P>Rhinosinusitis is a common and well-recognised clinical syndrome affecting patients of all ages and gender. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is now a well-established strategy, which comprises several techniques, for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis which has not responded to medical treatment. FESS is a set of minimally invasive surgical techniques which allow direct visual examination and opening of the sinuses.</P>
<P>Three randomised controlled trials, involving 212 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review. The evidence available does not demonstrate that FESS, as practised in the included trials, is superior to medical treatment with or without sinus irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. There were no major complications in any of the included trials and FESS appears to be a safe procedure.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 13:12:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> in Issue 3, 2006.</P>
<P>The normal physiological functioning of the sinuses depends on patency of the osteomeatal unit, normal mucociliary transport and normal quantity and quality of secretions. A popular hypothesis for the development of chronic rhinosinusitis is that environmental factors, such as allergens, viruses or air pollutants, stimulate the epithelium to induce local inflammation of the sinus mucosa. The resulting mucosal oedema leads to ostial obstruction and retention of secretions followed by bacterial proliferation. In response to inflammation, the lining epithelium may become metaplastic and ciliary dysfunction ensues, perpetuating the condition. Various local factors such as nasal polyps, adenoid vegetations, dental infections and sinonasal tumours can predispose to sinusitis. A wide variety of systemic factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis including allergy, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia and immune deficiency<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Naclerio-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naclerio 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rhinosinusitis is a well-recognised clinical syndrome affecting patients of all ages and gender. Sinusitis is defined as a condition manifested by inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, fluids within these cavities and/or the underlying bone. Chronic rhinosinusitis is sinusitis lasting more than 12 weeks. Chronic rhinosinusitis is diagnosed by the presence of two or more of the following major factors: facial congestion/fullness, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge (purulent) or discoloured postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia (smell disorder), or one major and two of the following minor factors: headache, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough or ear pressure/fullness. The diagnosis is also made in the presence of purulent nasal drainage on clinical examination (<LINK REF="REF-Lanza-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanza 1997</LINK>). In 2005, the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) revised the definition to include two or more of 1) blockage/congestion; 2) discharge/postnasal drip; 3) facial pain/pressure; 4) reduction or loss of smell, and either endoscopic evidence of polyps, oedema or mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus and/or CT changes in the mucosa of sinuses or osteomeatal complexes (<LINK REF="REF-EAACI-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAACI 2005</LINK>). The definition was further revised in the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis (EPOS) to include the presence of nasal obstruction or nasal discharge as a prerequisite to the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis in addition to one or more other symptoms, as highlighted above (<LINK REF="REF-EPOS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOS 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Rhinosinusitis is a very common disorder. It is estimated that it affects more than 30 million Americans of all ages (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-Data-Book-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH Data Book 1990</LINK>). A survey of 1200 households in Nottingham, UK revealed that 13.7% had rhinosinusitis in the previous year (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bacteria can be recovered in most cases of chronic rhinosinusitis, most commonly consisting of <I>Staphylococcus</I> species, anaerobes and, in some cases, gram-negative bacteria. Increasing trends towards bacterial resistance have been identified in chronic rhinosinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharyya-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharyya 2002</LINK>). Fungal rhinosinusitis is thought to be a spectrum of pathologic conditions associated with sinonasal inflammation that is related to the presence of fungi. It is broadly classified into extramucosal (non-invasive) and invasive forms (<LINK REF="REF-Dhong-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhong 2001</LINK>). Naylor suggests a role for fungi in the pathogenesis of all cases of chronic rhinosinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Medical therapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The EPOS document (2007) suggested detailed treatment regimens for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-EPOS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOS 2007</LINK>). The recommended treatment(s) depend on the severity of symptoms measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the presence or absence of nasal polyposis. In moderate/severe cases with a VAS score greater than three, it is recommended that patients are given topical steroid sprays (drops in the presence of polyposis), nasal douching and long-term treatment with antibiotics (macrolides). A short course of oral steroids is to be given initially before this treatment in patients with nasal polyposis presenting with severe symptoms (VAS score between 7 and 10). It is also recommended that a CT scan of the sinuses is performed if symptoms persist for more than three months prior to surgery (<LINK REF="REF-EPOS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOS 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>A Cochrane Review of the use of saline irrigation for chronic rhinosinusitis concluded that there is evidence that this treatment relieves symptoms, helps as an adjunct to treatment and is well-tolerated by the majority of patients. While there is no evidence that saline is a replacement for standard therapies, the addition of topical nasal saline is likely to improve symptom control in patients with persistent sino-nasal disease. No recommendations can be made regarding specific solutions, dosage or delivery. There were no significant side effects reported in trials (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conventional sinus surgical techniques used to treat chronic sinusitis included antral lavage, external, intranasal and transantral ethmoidectomy, external frontal sinus surgery and the Caldwell-Luc procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 2001</LINK>). However, over the past two decades the surgical management of rhinosinusitis has completely changed. This is due to technical advances in endoscopic systems and the recognition of the importance of normal sinus function of mucociliary flow and ventilation through the anatomical ostia. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a set of minimally invasive techniques in which sinus air cells and ostia are opened under direct visualisation. The goal of this procedure is to restore sinus ventilation and normal function (<LINK REF="REF-Stammberger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stammberger 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relative risks of sinus surgery have been a subject of controversy for many years. In 1912, Mosher stated that intranasal ethmoidectomy is one of the most dangerous of all surgical operations (<LINK REF="REF-Mosher-1912" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosher 1912</LINK>). In the modern endoscopic era, major and devastating complications continue to occur from time to time. Complications related to FESS include bleeding, orbital haematoma, damage to intraorbital structures, epiphora (watery eyes), loss of vision, cerebrospinal fluid leak, damage to intracranial structures and death. However, several large series quote a very low complication rate suggesting that this procedure can be done safely (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1995</LINK>). Stankiewicz has shown the importance of surgical experience in reducing the risk of complications from endoscopic sinus surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Stankiewicz-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankiewicz 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stankiewicz-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankiewicz 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>FESS has now become well-established for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to medical treatment. Enthusiasm for FESS, engendered by an abundance of reports of short-term success, has been justified more recently by the publication of long-term postoperative results which show a continued trend towards subjective improvement of symptoms in most patients (<LINK REF="REF-Richards-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richards 1999</LINK>). There is, however, a conspicuous lack of good scientific evidence of the comparative efficacy of this intervention.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-08-07 11:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>In total, 2159 abstracts were examined when we originally conducted this review in 2006. We identified nine potential studies. These included seven randomised controlled trials and two controlled trials. One of the randomised controlled trials was an unpublished trial (<LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK>). Three randomised controlled trials, involving 212 participants, met the inclusion criteria for this review (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>' table). We conducted the searches again to update the review in November 2008. We retrieved 164 further references for assessment. No new studies suitable for inclusion in the review were identified. Two new studies were added to the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>' table (see below).</P>
<P>The three studies included within this review have important differences in their study populations, the interventions being compared and methods of outcome assessment. All studies met the definition of chronic rhinosinusitis.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK> was a randomised controlled trial comparing endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy with conventional inferior meatal antrostomy.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Hartog-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartog 1997</LINK> was a randomised controlled trial comparing FESS with sinus irrigation and medical treatment with sinus irrigation and medical treatment only. The medical treatment was in the form of loracarbef 400 mg twice daily for 10 days from day of enrolment in study.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> compared FESS with medical treatment and medical treatment alone. Only patients who had failed a six-week course of Dexarhinaspray® (dexamethasone isonicotinate, tramazoline hydrochloride) (DRS) twice a day and alkaline nasal douche twice a day were enrolled in the study. Patients randomised to the FESS group were prescribed a two-week course of erythromycin 500 mg twice a day, DRS and alkaline nasal douche. This was followed by a three-month course of twice daily use of 100 µg (two sprays) of fluticasone propionate intranasal spray into each nostril and alkaline nasal douche. Further medical treatment was tailored to the patient's manifestations, which comprised a topical corticosteroid spray in most circumstances. Patients randomised to the medical treatment group received a 12-week course of erythromycin, alkaline nasal douche and intranasal corticosteroid preparations. Erythromycin was prescribed as 500 mg twice a day for the first two weeks then 250 mg twice a day for ten weeks. Intranasal corticosteroid preparations, in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis but without polyposis, were given as DRS, two puffs into each nostril, twice daily, for two weeks, followed by a twice daily dose of 100 µg (two sprays) of fluticasone propionate spray into each nostril for ten weeks. On the other hand, patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis received a 12-week course of twice daily use of 400 µg of fluticasone propionate drops into each nostril. In addition, three patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and polyposis were prescribed a nine-day course of oral prednisolone tablets, 30 mg for three days, 20 mg for three days, and 10 mg for three days after failure of the above regimen to control their manifestations. After that, the medical treatment was tailored to the patient's manifestations.</P>
<P>A global improvement in symptoms was the primary outcome measure in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hartog-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartog 1997</LINK>). A symptom score was the primary outcome measure in the other two (<LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials and two controlled trials were excluded. The randomised controlled trial by <LINK REF="STD-Venkatachalam-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Venkatachalam 2002</LINK> comparing FESS and conventional sinus surgery for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis was excluded for a number of reasons. There were contradictory statements about the duration of follow up. The abstract stated the follow up was for a mean of 19.2 months (range 15 to 33 months). In the full text, the author states that the response to treatment was evaluated at three months after surgery. Moreover, the details of medical treatment for both groups were not mentioned. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Penttila-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Penttila 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Penttila-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Penttila 1997</LINK> were both excluded as there was a history of previous sinus surgery in some patients in both the treatment and control groups. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Blomqvist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Blomqvist 2001</LINK> was excluded as an inclusion criterion was the presence of nasal polyposis only and the presence of any of the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis was not stipulated. Two non-randomised studies were excluded. <LINK REF="STD-Arnes-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Arnes 1985</LINK> compared middle and inferior meatal antrostomy. However, a FESS technique was not used and the methodology was not clear. <LINK REF="STD-Ramadan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramadan 1999</LINK> enrolled children with chronic rhinosinusitis. All included children had failed a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with an appropriate oral antibiotic as well as topical or oral decongestants. Children were allocated to either endoscopic sinus surgery or adenoidectomy in a non-randomised fashion.</P>
<P>Following the update searches in November 2008, we excluded a further two studies. We contacted the authors of a randomised controlled trial registered in 2006 and discovered that this had been terminated due to failure to recruit enough patients (<LINK REF="STD-Fokkens-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Fokkens 2009</LINK>). A trial by Abd El-Fattah et al (<LINK REF="STD-Abd-El_x002d_Fattah-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Abd El-Fattah 2008</LINK>) compared endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy with endoscopic radical antrectomy (removal of mucosa of maxillary sinus). The authors of this trial concluded that endoscopic radical antrectomy with middle meatal antrostomy  was superior to middle meatal antrostomy alone in chronic hyperplastic maxillary sinusitis. However, this trial was excluded from the review as it did not compare FESS with an alternative treatment but adopted FESS techniques in both groups. Moreover, the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the trial were not clear and the authors used a non-validated questionnaire as one of their outcome measures.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cure rates</HEADING>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK> included 33 patients; 21 females and 12 males. The mean age (± SD) in the FESS group was 52 (±13.6) years and in the inferior meatal antrostomy group 45 (±13.0) years. All patients had surgery by the same surgeon. Follow-up data were available for 29 patients (12 in the FESS group and 17 in the inferior meatal antrostomy group). There was no difference in the symptom scores at follow up, which ranged from six weeks to 12 months, with a median follow up of 12 months (weighted mean difference (WMD) 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.77 to 6.51, P = 0.6).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hartog-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartog 1997</LINK> included a total of 89 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. Seventy-seven patients were available for evaluation (41 in the FESS, sinus irrigation and medical treatment group and 36 in the sinus irrigation only group). The mean age (± SD) in the FESS and sinus irrigation group was 35 (±13) years and 38 (±13.5) years in the sinus irrigation only group. The median follow up was 12 months. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant reduction in the symptoms of purulent nasal discharge and hyposmia in the FESS group. However, there was no significant difference between both groups in overall cure rates at the end of one year (odds ratio (OR) 1.63; 95% CI 0.58 to 4.53, P = 0.35).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> randomised 90 patients to treatment with FESS and medical treatment (n = 45) or medical treatment alone (n = 45). There were 45 males and 45 females. The mean age (± SD) was 43 (±13) years. At 12 months follow up 78 patients were available for analysis; 40 patients were available for follow up in the FESS and medical treatment group and 38 patients were available for follow up in the medical treatment only group. There was no difference in the total symptom scores at the end of 12 months (WMD 1.20; 95% CI -11.89 to 14.29, P = 0.86). A subgroup analysis found no difference in symptom scores in the groups in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis and those without polyposis. However, the small number of patients in the subgroups raises the possibility of a type II error.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>No major complications, such as orbital injury or cerebrospinal fluid leak, were reported in any of the included trials. There were no complications related to FESS reported in the <LINK REF="STD-Hartog-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hartog 1997</LINK> study. The minor complications rate in patients undergoing FESS in the <LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> studies combined was 15.4%. The minor complications included epistaxis, sinus infections, stenosis of middle meatal antrostomy and intranasal synechiae. The complications rate of inferior meatal antrostomy was 17.6% and included intranasal synechiae, stenosis of antrostomy and neuralgia. Adverse events reported in patients using topical corticosteroid preparations included mild epistaxis in 5.3%. Adverse events due to oral antibiotics occurred in 18.3% of patients and included allergic reactions, gastrointestinal complaints, headaches and dizziness. These complications did not lead to discontinuation of the antibiotic treatment.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 16:07:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>Chronic rhinosinusitis is a common health problem that leads to frequent visits to primary care physicians and to ear, nose and throat specialists. Chronic rhinosinusitis is estimated to affect 5% to 15% of the urban population (<LINK REF="REF-Melen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melen 1994</LINK>). It contributes to a significant amount of healthcare expenditure due to direct costs arising from physician visits and antibiotics, as well as indirect costs related to absence from work and a general loss of productivity due to a decrease in life-quality of those affected (<LINK REF="REF-Lanza-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanza 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osguthorpe-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osguthorpe 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>FESS has become an established surgical strategy, comprising a number of specific techniques, in the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to medical treatment. Despite its wide use, there is still a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of FESS when compared to medical treatment and more conventional sinus surgery techniques. There are a plethora of publications on the topic of FESS. A systematic review of the literature has demonstrated that the vast majority of these studies are cohort studies or case series (level III evidence). Only a handful of trials qualify as level I or II evidence. These, however, have methodological shortcomings. A comparison of the results of different trials of FESS for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis is difficult for a number of reasons. The studies lack a single disease staging system, the FESS procedures differ and the outcome measures are not uniform. The latter precludes the use of meta-analysis. FESS is not a standardised set of surgical steps as the extent and specific nature of the surgery is determined by those sinuses which are affected and how extensively they are involved (<LINK REF="REF-Stammberger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stammberger 1991</LINK>). Moreover, there has been an evolution of FESS techniques over the years including the use of powered instruments and a more aggressive approach to sinus dissections. The FESS technique currently practised in some centres is likely to be different from that introduced by Messerklinger more than three decades ago. Lund suggests that randomised controlled trials of FESS and other surgical techniques are not conceivable given the difficulties of performing randomised controlled trials for surgical procedures, and the ethical difficulty of 'sham' operations (<LINK REF="REF-Lund-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund 2001</LINK>). The authors of the current review believe there is room for well-designed, multicentre, randomised controlled trials comparing conservative FESS techniques with more radical approaches of endoscopic sinus surgery. Further trials comparing current FESS techniques with optimal medical treatment are also feasible.</P>
<P>The evidence available does not demonstrate that FESS, as practised in the included trials, is superior to sinus irrigation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis suffering from isolated maxillary sinusitis. A middle meatal antrostomy fashioned by FESS was also not shown to be superior to an inferior meatal antrostomy formed by traditional sinus surgery techniques, though the small sample size in Fairley's study (<LINK REF="STD-Fairley-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fairley 1993</LINK>) does not exclude a type II error. FESS was not found to be superior to medical treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with or without polyposis at the end of one year. However, patients in the Ragab study (<LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK>) with and without polyps received different medical management, a point which adds to the heterogeneity of the studied population. Chronic rhinosinusitis in children differs from that in adults. Children are more at risk because of smaller sinus volumes and natural ostia, more frequent upper respiratory tract infections and adenoidal hypertrophy (<LINK REF="REF-Lusk-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lusk 1997</LINK>). We were not able to include any studies of children. One excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ramadan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ramadan 1999</LINK>) studied children with chronic rhinosinusitis and compared FESS with adenoidectomy, however participants were allocated to groups in a non-randomised fashion. The main outcome measure, a symptom questionnaire completed by parents or carers, did show FESS to be superior. Adenoidectomy, while a traditional surgical procedure which may have a role to play in the management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, cannot be described as primarily a sinus surgical procedure. It therefore remains unproved whether FESS is superior to traditional sinus surgery or other treatment strategies in children.</P>
<P>These studies do show that FESS is a safe surgical technique. None of the included trials reported major complications such as orbital injury or cerebrospinal fluid leak. However, important but uncommon side effects may not be detected in randomised controlled trials involving relatively small numbers of participants.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-08 13:33:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jenny Bellorini">
<P>FESS as currently practised is a safe surgical procedure. The limited evidence available suggests that FESS as practised in the included trials has not been demonstrated to confer additional benefit to that obtained by medical treatment (+/- sinus irrigation) in chronic rhinosinusitis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ragab-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ragab 2004</LINK> is the first to suggest that optimal medical treatment is equally effective as FESS in chronic rhinosinusitis patients at the end of one year. More randomised controlled trials comparing FESS with medical and other treatments with long-term follow up are required. Trials in subpopulations of patients, for example children or patients with polyposis, are particularly required as the benefit of FESS may be more apparent in some of these groups. </P>

<P>For the recently published reasons noted below I suggest that the review be withdrawn. (Chester AC. Endoscopic sinus surgery and evidence-based medicine: The gold standard requires gold. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2008 Mar;138:409).</P>
<P>
<B>Endoscopic Sinus Surgery and Evidence-Based Medicine: The Gold Standard Requires Gold</B>
</P>
<P>The need to establish efficacy of chronic rhinosinusitis treatments using evidence-based medicine (EBM) was well described in a recent Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery symposium issue.<SUP>1</SUP> The power of these evaluations by the Cochrane Library, in particular, to influence patients, practitioners, and policy is hard to overstate. Despite substantial efforts to select and synthesize appropriate studies for EBM analysis, the conclusions are occasionally problematic.</P>
<P>For instance, the Cochrane Library&#8217;s systematic review of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) concludes that the procedure &#8220;does not confer additional benefit to that obtained by medical treatment&#8221; in relieving the symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis based on the studies selected.<SUP>2 (page 2)</SUP> This conclusion stands as the only EBM assessment of ESS efficacy that I am aware of and is based on limited evidence.</P>
<P>Although approximately 200 observational studies generally describe a success rate greater than 85%, findings of the 3 randomized controlled trials<SUP>3-5</SUP> selected for analysis by the Cochrane Library suggest, according to the reviewers, no advantage for ESS over medical treatment. However, the studies miss the mark.</P>
<P>The first study<SUP>3</SUP> reported no differences in medical and surgical outcomes among groups not receiving initial medical therapy that included antibiotics, a generally accepted prerequisite for ESS. The second study<SUP>4</SUP> compared symptom improvement in isolated maxillary sinusitis noted after ESS vs after saline rinses among patients randomized before antibiotics were administered. The third study<SUP>5</SUP> (a thesis) compared 12 patients receiving functional endoscopic middle meatal antrostomy vs 17 patients receiving conventional intranasal inferior meatal antrostomy, noting symptom improvement in both groups but no differences between groups; 1-year follow-up data were available for 11 patients vs 9 patients, a sample size the author acknowledges as being too small to exclude a type II error.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence for any comment about the worth of ESS compared with medical treatment based on these 3 studies. One study<SUP>5</SUP> does not compare ESS with medical treatment, and the other 2 studies<SUP>3 4 </SUP>do not analyze ESS results among patients who failed medical treatment, including antibiotic therapy.</P>
<P>The reluctance of practitioners to quickly integrate EBM into medical practice reflects, in part, a concern that some conclusions are not justified by the data. Furthermore, many believe in this case that the results of numerous carefully designed observational studies of ESS efficacy should have some relevance in the assessment of the procedure when the few randomized controlled trials do not clearly address the subject.<SUP>6</SUP>

<P>Authors of systematic reviews in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>adopt a rigorous and pre-specified approach to selecting trials for inclusion those reviews.</P>
<P>At the time of publication of the review (2006), the three included trials were the only ones that qualified for inclusion. This reflects the paucity of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FESS with other forms of treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We have qualified our statement about efficacy of FESS by "as practised in the included trials". Observational studies (level III evidence) are not currently included in the vast majority of Cochrane Reviews.  We have referred to the difficulties of conducting RCTs for surgical procedures like FESS. In our introduction, we have referred to the numerous short and long-term observational studies that confirm favourable outcomes after FESS.<SUP>1 </SUP>We are aware of the debate about the value of systematic reviews of well designed, non-randomised, cohort and case control studies in general, and whether there is a place for such reviews in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. This is particularly relevant in interventions where randomisation is not possible or ethical.</P>
<P>There is a consensus that FESS should only be offered to patients where optimal medical treatment has failed. The optimal medical treatment has changed over the years. The current recommendation for antibiotic treatment in the EPOS document is up to 12 weeks of antibiotics.<SUP>2</SUP> Historically, there has been no universal consensus on the duration of antibiotic treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitus (CRS). In the trial by Ragab et al (2004) the authors did not give antibiotics prior to randomisation. However, patients in the surgical arm of the trial received two weeks of antibiotics after the surgery. The medical arm received 12 weeks of antibiotics (again after randomisation). <SUP>3</SUP> What this trial has demonstrated is that a prolonged course of medical treatment (antibiotics and steroids) is as effective as surgery with a shorter course of medical treatment.</P>
<P>We will publish an update of our review in 2009. This will include reference to current recommendations for antibiotic treatments. It will be interesting to see if any RCTs have used a long course of antibiotics and steroid sprays prior to randomisation to the medical and surgical arms. We would not wish to prejudge the conclusions of the updated review. However, we will qualify any conclusions with reference to the current recommendations for optimal medical treatment.</P>

<P>I certainly agree with Dr Khalil that only well designed randomized controlled trials should be used to assess the worth of a procedure. My point was not that adequate evidence exists elsewhere demonstrating the efficacy of ESS but, rather, that the evidence he and his co-author marshaled did not demonstrate ESS to be ineffective.</P>
<P>The study noted in the author&#8217;s reply does not address the worth of surgery offered only when medical treatment fails. The surgical group in that study received two weeks of erythromycin following surgery while the medical group received three months of erythromycin. If a prolonged course of erythromycin was as successful as has previously been reported the medical group gains a significant advantage over the surgical group making surgery appear less worthwhile.</P>
<P>I do not think the conclusion offered by Drs. Khail &amp; Nunez that ESS &#8220;does not confer additional benefit to that obtained by medical treatment&#8221; should stand until the subject is updated. Modifying the conclusion to read that ESS &#8220;<I>has not been demonstrated</I> to confer additional benefit to that obtained by medical therapy&#8221; reflects their findings more accurately. The first conclusion states that ESS has been judged by worthy evidence and found wanting, the other states the evidence is insufficient to pass judgement. Perhaps Dr Khalil could address this subject more directly in his reply.</P>

<P>An updated search did not identify any new randomised controlled trials comparing FESS with medical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. There were no newly identified trials that administered a prolonged course of antibiotics prior to randomisation. We have updated the section on medical treatment of rhinosinusitis prior to considering surgery in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section, as recommended by the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps, 2007.</P>
