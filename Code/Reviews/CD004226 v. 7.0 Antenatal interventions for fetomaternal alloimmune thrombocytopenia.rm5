<P>The optimal management of pregnant women with a previous child affected by fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia remains unclear.</P>
<P>Differences between the platelets of an unborn baby and their mother, because of a fetal platelet alloantigen inherited from the father and not shared by the mother, can lead to the development of antibodies in the mother. These attack the baby's platelets and can lead to bleeding complications for the baby. This is termed fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, meaning a reduction in the number of platelets in the baby&#8217;s blood because of their destruction by the mother's antibodies. The baby is at risk of bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage) before or shortly after birth and the baby may die or have long-lasting problems. Fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia often occurs in the first pregnancy and is usually only diagnosed following the birth of a baby with a low platelet count. Active antenatal management to prevent severe thrombocytopenia is confined to those women who have had a previously affected infant.<BR/>
<BR/>Fetal blood sampling from the umbilical vein is used to monitor the fetal platelet count but carries a risk of fetal loss. Intrauterine platelet transfusions are also associated with a risk of fetal loss and are now only used as treatment for women who do not respond to medical treatment. Medication is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with or without immunosuppression with corticosteroids. The four small trials (n = 206) provide insufficient evidence to determine the best treatment for fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-04-12 11:37:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT) (thrombocytopenia meaning a reduction in the number of platelets in the blood which can lead to bleeding into the skin and brain), also commonly known as 'neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia' (NAIT), occurs when the mother produces antibodies against a platelet alloantigen that the fetus has inherited from the father (<LINK REF="REF-Moulinier-1953" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulinier 1953</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shulman-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulman 1964</LINK>). The mother's antibodies cross the placenta and destroy the baby's platelets, and this may result in internal bleeding: in severe cases this is in the brain. As a result, babies may die in utero or have long-lasting disability. Fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is usually only diagnosed following the birth of a thrombocytopenic baby, or, less commonly, it may be suspected following the detection of an antenatal intracranial haemorrhage (ICH).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FMAIT): nature and incidence</HEADING>
<P>Platelets are blood cells that play an important role in blood clotting. Platelet antigens are proteins found on the surface of these cells. Platelet-specific alloantigens or human platelet alloantigens (HPAs) are expressed predominantly on platelets, but can also be found on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (<LINK REF="REF-Rozman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rozman 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>HPAs have been numbered according to the order in which they were described, with the high frequency antigen designated 'a' and the low frequency antigen 'b'. Antibodies against HPAs have been implicated in immune mediated phenomena, such as when there is reduced response to transfused platelets, post-transfusion purpura (which presents with a rapid decline in the person's platelet count 5 to 12 days after transfusion) and FMAIT.</P>
<P>It has long been believed that, in cases of FMAIT, the source of antigen is fetal platelets, which have been shown to enter the mother's circulation as early as the 16th week of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gruel-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gruel 1986</LINK>). It is probable that the immunising antigen can enter the maternal circulation as early as 10 to 12 weeks. The ß3 Integrin, on which the HPA-1a antigen (the most common cause of FMAIT) is expressed, is known to be expressed on the villous trophoblast and it may be from this source that the mother is immunised (<LINK REF="REF-Kumpel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumpel 2003</LINK>). The IgG antibodies produced by the mother are transported across the placenta to the fetal blood system, presumably by the MHC-class 1-related FcRn (neonatal Fragment crystalline Receptor)<B> </B>(<LINK REF="REF-Simister-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simister 1997</LINK>), where IgGs bind to fetal platelets. The antibody-coated platelets are removed from the fetal circulation by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in fetal thrombocytopenia of varying severity. Whether these same anti-platelet antibodies binding have any effect on fetal platelet production via binding to megakaryocytes remains uncertain.</P>
<P>The first case of FMAIT within a family is usually detected at or shortly after birth. The newborn usually presents with skin bleeding or, in a small percentage of cases, is found to have a low platelet count by chance. However, in severe cases intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) may occur (a risk of 10% to 30%) either in the womb, or during or shortly after birth, which may lead to long lasting disability or even death.The fetus or neonate is usually otherwise well and there is no evidence of thrombocytopenia or an immune-mediated pathology in the mother, although the presentation of gestational thrombocytopenia may be confusing. More unusual presentations include unexplained hydrocephalus, fetal anaemia and intrauterine death in the second and third trimesters.</P>
<P>Postnatal treatment of severe fetal thrombocytopenia is with antigen-negative platelets until the platelet count recovers, usually seven to 10 days following birth, although platelet transfusion may sometimes be needed for up to four to six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Rayment-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayment 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of FMAIT in Caucasian populations, based on population surveys, is between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 1500 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-Eckhardt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller Eckhardt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blanchette-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blanchette 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williamson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williamson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjeldsen_x002d_Kragh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjeldsen-Kragh 2007</LINK>). The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (&lt; 50 x 10*9/l) is 1 in 1695 live births (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2005</LINK>). However, in the absence of neonatal screening, it is likely that the true incidence is higher. In one prospective study, only 37% of cases of severe fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia were detected (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 2005</LINK>). One source of confusion is that the severity of thrombocytopenia and especially the incidence of ICH are far different depending upon whether a case is accrued in the neonatal nursery (e.g. following investigation for bleeding) or is identified in an all-inclusive screening study. FMAIT is the most important cause of severe fetal and neonatal thrombocytopenia, both because of its frequency and the severity of the bleeding associated with it (<LINK REF="REF-Burrows-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrows 1993</LINK>). A fetal or neonatal platelet count of &lt; 20 x 10*9/l is usually caused by FMAIT due to anti-HPA-1a, as are approximately half of the cases in which the neonatal platelet count is &lt; 50 x 10*9/l (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the UK, The National Blood Service Oxford and Cambridge Platelet Immunology Laboratories have demonstrated maternal antibodies directed against HPA-1a in 85.1% of cases of FMAIT, HPA-5b in 10.4% and Gov antigens in 5%. Similar frequencies have been reported elsewhere for Caucasian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-Eckhardt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller Eckhardt 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berry 2000</LINK>). However, in other countries the gene frequency for the various platelet alloantigens differs (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 1998</LINK>). Thus, in Japan where the HPA 1a/1b polymorphism does not exist, HPA-5b incompatibility is the most common cause of FMAIT with HPA 4a and 6W on glycoprotein IIIa also being commonly implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Tanaka-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanaka 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unlike its red cell equivalent (haemolytic disease of the newborn), FMAIT often occurs in the first pregnancy. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the utility of screening previously unaffected women for anti-platelet antibodies and thus determining early in gestation whether a pregnancy is affected by FMAIT. Active antenatal management of this disease is therefore confined to those women who have had a previously affected fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following an affected pregnancy, the father can be tested for presence of the relevant HPA: the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is virtually 100% if the father is homozygous for the responsible HPA and 50% if he is heterozygous. In cases where the father is heterozygous or unavailable, the baby can be tested by amniocentesis for the relevant HPA.</P>
<P>The severity of FMAIT usually increases with each pregnancy. Attempts have been made to predict a fetus at-risk from severe thrombocytopenia by the use of serial antibody titres in order to determine which at-risk pregnancies need treatment. However, although an increasing titre largely correlates with increasing thrombocytopenia, occasionally the antibody may be undetectable or of low-titre in severely affected cases (<LINK REF="REF-Rayment-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rayment 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghevaert-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghevaert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Killie-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killie 2007</LINK>). As standard laboratory tests are currently unhelpful in predicting the degree of thrombocytopenia in an individual fetus, the clinical history of an affected sibling is currently the best indicator of risk to a current pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birchall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birchall 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2003</LINK>). A review of the literature found that the recurrence rate of ICH in the subsequent pregnancies of women with a history of FMAIT with ICH was 72% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46 to 98), without the inclusion of fetal deaths, and 79% (95% CI 61 to 97) with their inclusion (<LINK REF="REF-Radder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2003</LINK>). In contrast, the risk of ICH in those with a history of FMAIT but without ICH was estimated to be 7% (95% CI 0.5 to 13).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Antenatal management and outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The goal of antenatal management is to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and thus ICH which may result in death, either in utero or after birth, or long lasting disability. The antenatal treatment of FMAIT has evolved over the past 25 years, largely based on published case series, detailing outcomes with differing regimens, including serial intrauterine platelet transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1990</LINK>), weekly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunosuppression with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diagnostic fetal blood sampling and Intrauterine transfusions</HEADING>
<P>Fetal blood sampling involves the insertion of a needle into the umbilical or intrahepatic vein to sample fetal blood in order to ascertain the platelet count. The procedure is usually complemented by the transfusion of a specially selected very concentrated platelet suspension that is both HPA and blood group-compatible, to reduce the risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paidas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paidas 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>With reports of a fetal loss rate of around 6% per pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Overton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overton 2002</LINK>), serial (weekly) platelet transfusions now take second place for the management of affected fetuses to maternal administration of weekly IVIG, with or without the use of corticosteroids. An important unresolved issue in the management of at-risk pregnancies is how to safely minimise or eliminate fetal blood sampling (<LINK REF="REF-Radder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>). Some fetal medicine teams have completely abandoned fetal blood sampling with or without platelet transfusion, whilst some restrict repeated invasive testing to those pregnancies not responding to medical treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">IVIG</HEADING>
<P>IVIG is widely used in immune mediated diseases. Its mechanism of action is unclear and may be due to Fragment crystallizable Receptor (FcR) blockade on macrophages (leading to inhibition of uptake of the antibody-coated platelets by fetal macrophages), enhanced expression of FCy/RllB inhibitory receptors on splenic macrophages (<LINK REF="REF-Samuelsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuelsson 2001</LINK>), suppression of maternal antibody production or reduction of placental transfer of the pathological antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1998</LINK>). IVIG has been demonstrated to modulate the function of antigen presenting cells (<LINK REF="REF-Bayry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayry 2003</LINK>). There is conflicting evidence on its efficacy in preventing ICH; with some reports documenting good results (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1997</LINK>) and others reporting failure of IVIG to prevent haemorrhage, particularly in severely affected fetuses (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kroll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sainio-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sainio 1999</LINK>). However, in the latter cases only IVIG 1 g/kg/week was utilised.</P>
<P>IVIG is most often given to the mother on a weekly basis until delivery, but various treatment schedules have been used. The only way to monitor the efficacy of this treatment during pregnancy is by fetal blood sampling, which carries a risk of fetal loss with each procedure, as described above. After birth, the neonatal platelet count and the presence or absence of ICH provide measures of IVIG efficacy. The risks of IVIG include renal dysfunction, transmission of blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV (since IVIG is a pooled blood product) although such risks are low in most countries due to rigorous donor screening and viral inactivation procedure. Severe headaches and febrile reactions which may occur during administration of the infusion have also been described, but inability to tolerate infusions, even 2 g/kg/week is extremely infrequent (<LINK REF="REF-Cantu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantu 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>Corticosteroids are administered alongside IVIG as a means of supporting the action of IVIG and secondarily reducing headache. Dexamethasone is now avoided as it has been recognised that this drug may cross the fetal blood-brain barrier and has been associated with oligohydramnios at higher doses (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1988</LINK>) and a lack of efficacy at lower doses (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>). At present, prednisone seems to be the corticosteroid of choice for FMAIT (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>). Although the mothers experience the expected side effects of systemic corticosteroids, clinical experience suggests no abnormalities of children of mothers treated with usual doses of prednisone throughout pregnancy, although premature rupture of amniotic membranes and low birthweight babies have been reported in other settings (<LINK REF="REF-Lockshin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockshin 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term outcomes in children treated antenatally for fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia</HEADING>
<P>The goal of antenatal care is to reduce fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality but also to allow the child to develop normally in the long term. Follow up of children treated with IVIG or with serial blood transfusions suggests normal neurological and physical development. In particular, those who receive antenatal IVIG appear to have normal immunological development, but for a clinically insignificant elevation of the IgE (<LINK REF="REF-Radder-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2004</LINK>). Additionally, children who receive treatment antenatally, with either IVIG and/or corticosteroids, have better long-term developmental and behavioural outcomes when compared to their older siblings who had not been treated antenatally (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 2006</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (Rachel Rayment (RR) and Susan J Brunskill (SJB)) initially screened all the titles and abstracts of papers, identified by the review search strategy, for relevance. We excluded only studies which were clearly irrelevant at that stage. RR and SJB independently assessed the full-text versions of all other studies for inclusion/exclusion using the criteria indicated above. We did not mask the authors and institutions of the trials under consideration. We planned to resolve discrepancies by discussion with a third review author, but this proved unnecessary.<B>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Aside from details relating to included trial quality, we extracted the following two groups of data.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Trial characteristics: place of publication, date of publication, population characteristics, setting, detailed nature of intervention, detailed nature of comparator, detailed nature of outcomes.</LI>
<LI>Results of included studies in respect of each of the main outcomes indicated in the review question. We recorded as post hoc results encountered during the data extraction process on outcomes we had not defined as important <I>a priori</I>, but felt to be wholly relevant. For continuous outcomes, we recorded mean and standard deviations. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the numbers of outcomes in treatment and control groups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Two authors (RR and SJB) undertook data extraction independently. We extracted data onto trial specific data extraction forms. These forms were not piloted, given that the data extracted for the included studies was found to be identical between the two authors. We sought and received clarification with respect to the numbers included in the final analysis from the principal investigator of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>). We sought and received additional outcome data from the other three trials whereby means and standard deviations were calculated by the authors following receipt of individual patients data. This data has so far not been forthcoming. One review author (SJB) transcribed the extracted data into the systematic review computer software Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (RR and SJB) independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We resolved disagreements by discussion.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number) or</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study the method used to conceal the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail so as to determine whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>For each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis were described. We have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups. The methods were assessed as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate;</LI>
<LI>inadequate;</LI>

</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting bias</HEADING>
<P>For each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found was reported. The methods were assessed as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Explicit judgements have been made about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, we analysed the extracted data using the most recent version of RevMan (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We calculated mean differences (MD) for each of the continuous outcomes where data were presented for the outcome within the trial. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for the dichotomous outcomes. We assessed data using a fixed-effect model method and 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
<P>Two trials did not report standard deviations alongside mean values (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>). Following email contact, the trialists supplied individual patient data relating to the outcome fetal platelet count at birth and the not prespecified outcome fetal blood counts after initiation of treatment. We have included these data in this review following calculation by one author (SJB) of mean and standard deviation values.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>) reported outcome data by absolute numbers and mean values with corresponding range and 95% CI. For continuous outcomes, where the confidence interval has been reported, we have calculated the standard deviation following instructions in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). For continuous outcomes where only the range was given, we have not calculated the standard deviation (SD) for the purposes of this review as the range is a very unstable value and is not able to provide an accurate estimation of the extent of variation around the mean (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Additionally, the author of this trial provided individual patient data, which enabled calculation of means and standard deviations for the non-prespecified outcome 'fetal blood count after initiation of treatment'. <B>

In this trial, standard risk was defined as no ICH in a previous sibling and pre-treatment fetal platelet count &gt; 20 x 10*9/l. The primary aim of these trials was to "evaluate the safety and efficacy of risk-based stratified antenatal treatment for women who had previously delivered a fetus affected by alloimmune thrombocytopenia and were pregnant again with an affected fetus".

High risk was defined by the trial as either a history of peripartum ICH in an affected sibling or an initial fetal platelet count of less than 20 x 10*9/l. The second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>) compared IVIG 1 g/kg per week plus prednisone 0.5 mg/kg per day with IVIG 2 g/kg per week alone in standard risk pregnancies this time defined as women without an ICH in a previous pregnancy (but who could potentially have an initial fetal platelet count &lt; 10-20 x 10*9/l.

<P>In the one trial in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>), the method of randomisation and the concealment of allocation were 'adequate', being undertaken by "computer generated random number list balanced by computer blocks at the coordinating center and communicated to the participant institutions by telephone". Clinicians, participants and outcome assessors were not blinded to treatment allocation. The trial had no withdrawals.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">IVIG plus a corticosteroid versus IVIG alone</HEADING>
<P>In the three trials in this comparison, the method of randomisation and the concealment of allocation was 'adequate' being undertaken by a "random number list maintained at a separate site by the study statistician" in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>) and "computer generated random number list balanced by computer blocks at the coordinating center and communicated to the participant institutions by telephone" in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>). Clinicians, participants and outcome assessors were not blinded to treatment allocation. The trials had no withdrawals. An unreported number of fetuses were lost (due to exsanguination) at an early stage in the study in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>). It would appear from the trial report that these losses occurred prior to randomisation to treatment group. Subsequent data highlighted that the standard approach to these patients was changed near the end of the study to require platelet transfusions to be administered at the times of fetal blood sampling as a result of the increased rate of exsanguinations (<LINK REF="REF-Paidas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paidas 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>) all randomised participants were included in the analysis of outcome assessment. However, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>), when outcome assessment was stratified by type of IVIG, three participants were excluded from the analysis, for which an explanation is reported in the trial and detailed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table in this review. In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>) one woman was unable to complete therapy due to a severe rash developing at 30 weeks' gestation. IVIG was discontinued and she received prednisone (1 mg/kg/day alone) for four weeks until the infant was delivered at 34 weeks' gestation. The participant's data were included in the trial and hence in this review.</P>
<P>The treatment groups were comparable at baseline for all analysed variables (platelet count and gestational age at initial fetal blood sample, gestational age at birth, and number of previous siblings with ICH) with the exception of mean platelet count of previous sibling. In one trial the mean platelet count of previous sibling differed markedly between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>) documented a power calculation. The power calculation was determined from the sample size and dosage of dexamethasone used in an unreported pilot study by the same authors (in the pilot study 33 women were required to find an 80% chance of determining a statistically significant difference at the 0.05 level in platelet increase, with the addition of dexamethasone). The included trial calculated that to have 90% power with 0.05 level of significance to show a greater platelet increase with the addition of dexamethasone, 54 participants overall would be required. Although 54 participants were enrolled in the trial, this sample size would not be large enough to detect any meaningful difference in treatment effect at a 0.05 level of significance. In one other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>), it was reported that "group-specific sample sizes could not be adequately powered to identify small differences among the groups of each trial because of the rarity of the disorder". The overall quality of these trials was considered adequate.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-04-12 11:57:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The antenatal treatment of FMAIT has developed over the past 25 years, largely based on case series, and the optimal management remains unclear. The objective of this review was to determine the optimal antenatal management of FMAIT in the prevention of fetal and neonatal haemorrhage and death based on the evidence from randomised trials.</P>
<P>Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the eligibility criteria for this systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>). These studies have all assumed the efficacy of IVIG, based on historical observational data. They have also all assumed that the platelet count is a marker of disease/outcome. Unfortunately, no information is available on the clinical outcome of in-utero transfusion or even IVIG alone compared to no treatment in the context of a RCT.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">1) IVIG alone versus steroids alone</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK> trial, "standard" treatment with IVIG was compared with long-term administration of prednisone 0.5 mg per kg per day. No significant difference was demonstrated in efficacy between these treatments for women with a fetus at risk of FMAIT, where the previously affected sibling did not suffer ICH and the birth platelet count was &gt; 20 x 10*9/l. Thus, for standard risk pregnancies either IVIG or prednisone may be suitable, although there is a substantial failure rate with each (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>). At present the only available antenatal method by which to confirm response to treatment is by FBS, which has a significant complication rate. Two trials in this review reported complications of FBS jointly (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>); there were 11 serious complications out of a total of 175 (6%) FBS procedures. The risks of FBS at different stages of pregnancy must be balanced against the benefit of detecting severe thrombocytopenia which can be treated to avoid perinatal ICH. The most likely serious adverse outcome with FBS and platelet transfusion at 36 weeks' gestation is early onset of labour, whereas FBS before 28 weeks may be complicated by fetal death due to bleeding or cardiac dysrhythmias. Moreover, when exploring the instances of ICH associated with treatment failure, the grade of ICH (grade 1 versus &gt; grade 1) should be considered. Although this trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_stand_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (stand)</LINK>) did not report maternal complications associated with treatment, they are an increasingly important consideration when determining which treatment modality to use in &#8220;standard risk&#8221; women, and they should be reported in any new trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">2) IVIG alone versus IVIG plus steroids</HEADING>
<P>It was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>) that there was an improvement in the fetal platelet count following maternal treatment with both IVIG and IVIG and dexamethasone, and that the platelet count of these treated fetuses at birth was increased in comparison to the platelet count of their respective sibling at birth. However it should be noted that 'second-line' therapy was non-randomly administered only to non-responders, so birth platelet counts were not always valid indicators of the effect of the initial treatment in these cases.</P>
<P>The findings of this trial support findings from other studies suggesting an improved outcome for ICH with increased fetal platelet count (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birchall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birchall 2003</LINK>). Indeed, the sibling platelet count and clinical history remain the best surrogate predictive markers for disease at the present time (<LINK REF="REF-Radder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2003</LINK>). Such findings have been suggested in many observational studies, details of which are summarised in additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>However, the results from this trial and subsequent conclusions reached by the trials' authors should be read with caution. A number of important clinical outcomes were not reported by the trial authors: fetal death; incidence of ICH; fetal loss as a result of fetal blood sampling; financial cost of treatment; adverse events; and acceptability of the treatment options to the mother. The sample size was small and hence had limited power to detect small but important differences especially in outcomes of survival, fetal loss and occurrence of ICH. For this trial, power calculations to determine study sample size were based on platelet count increments. It may not be possible to design appropriately powered studies for this population that would measure clinically relevant outcomes such as bleeding risk, since ethical constraints would clearly make endpoints of severe bleeding or mortality more difficult to justify. Perhaps alternative outcome measures should be developed based on improved understanding of the underlying mechanism of disease, and/or relying on non-invasive techniques.</P>
<P>The more recent trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>) suggests a superior response with combined therapy where there was a history of peripartum ICH in an affected sibling or an initial fetal platelet count of less than 20 x 10*9/l, but their results should also be interpreted with caution due to the low numbers (a problem common to all "rare" disorders) and the differences in sibling platelet count in the two groups. In this trial, one ICH occurred due to failure of treatment in the group in which the intention to treat was with IVIG alone. However, treatment had been empirically intensified by the addition of prednisone from 28 weeks, suggesting that, in this case, neither treatment regimen was adequate. Thirteen out of 20 (65%) women receiving IVIG alone required intensification of treatment (by the addition of prednisone), compared with only two of the 18 (11%) women receiving combination treatment (by increasing the dose of IVIG) suggesting, in this high-risk group, the latter to be superior. This effect was most marked in cases where the pre-treatment platelet count was &lt; 10 x 10*9/l (82% for those receiving IVIG alone and 18% of those receiving IVIG plus prednisone required intensification of treatment). Information regarding the number of babies born with a platelet count of less than 50 x 10*9/l in each arm (with or without intensification) was not given.</P>
<P>The design of the third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK>) was based on the findings of the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK> trial where it was noted that the effect of 1g per kg per week of IVIG alone was inferior to combination therapy with prednisone in women with babies at high risk of severe thrombocytopenia and consequent haemorrhage. This trial recruited standard risk women and excluded those with a history of babies affected by an ICH. Complications of FBS were minimised by performing a single procedure at 32 weeks' gestation, and intensifying treatment for non-responders. Although, in terms of the primary outcome of ICH, both treatments were effective, it was interesting to note that 5/37 (13.5%) of babies in the group treated with the increased dose IVIG alone (group A) and 4/36 (11.1%) in the group treated with combination therapy (group B) had a birth platelet count &lt; 50 x 10*9/l. i.e. that each treatment had a significant failure rate. Equally, 10/37 (27%) of women in group A and 6/36 (17%) of those in group B needed second-line therapy. Even with this treatment, one baby in each group had a birth platelet count less than 30 x 10*9/l.</P>
<P>The difficulty highlighted in these studies is that of predicting which cases require intensive treatment and monitoring and those which require treatment with modest doses of IVIG and/or prednisone, the optimal dose of which has yet to be determined. Although sibling history is a valuable tool in assessing risk of ICH, it must be remembered that, in most cases, the sibling was the first affected case, and therefore untreated for the duration of the pregnancy. The sibling history is therefore not predictive of response to treatment. However, it does appear, from the <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK> trial that severe thrombocytopenia at 20 weeks (&lt; 20 x 10*9/l) may be predictive of poor response to therapy, and that these cases should be monitored more intensively with FBS and platelet transfusion, despite the inherent risks. This is in agreement with a European survey of antenatal management of FMAIT (<LINK REF="STD-Birchall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birchall 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is not clear from the report (<LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2006-_x0028_high_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2006 (high)</LINK>) how many women were delivered by elective caesarean section, but one of the author's recommendations was to only permit vaginal delivery if the platelet count was greater than 100 x 10*9/l at 32 weeks. Although there is no evidence from RCTs regarding the mode of delivery in affected pregnancies, an observational study in pregnancies with "standard risk" FMAIT has suggested, albeit in a small number of cases (23), that vaginal delivery is not associated with increased risk of ICH (platelet count range 12 -252 x 10*9/l) (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Akker-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van den Akker 2006</LINK>). An alternative approach in such cases would be a further FBS and platelet transfusion at 36 to 37 weeks, and a planned induction of labour within a few days of transfusion with a "minimally invasive" vaginal delivery (avoiding the use of high forceps or ventouse delivery, and the use of fetal scalp electrodes) and so avoid the increased maternal risks of a caesarean section.</P>
<P>There are some important issues concerning the 'standard' therapy in the four RCTs included in this review. In spite of the drawbacks of observational studies, much of current clinical practice is based on their findings. In the absence of RCTs, the efficacy of IVIG alone and IUT alone in the antenatal management of FMAIT cannot be fully assessed. However, the findings from observational data have provided important data which have influenced clinical practice in this clinical area: that the platelet count declines throughout the course of an affected pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1998</LINK>) and that there may be an association between ICH and a platelet count of less than 20 x 10*9/l (for the relationship of fetal platelet count with gestational age, see <LINK REF="STD-Birchall-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Birchall 2003</LINK>). Such findings have been suggested in many observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Daffos-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daffos 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daffos-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daffos 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mir-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mir 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolini-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolini 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marzusch-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marzusch 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wenstrom-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wenstrom 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mackenzie-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mackenzie 1999</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 2002</LINK>), as summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>IVIG is now commonplace as first-line treatment in the antenatal management of FMAIT, with intrauterine transfusions of platelets reserved for refractory cases, due to the risk of fetal haemorrhage and/or fetal loss (<LINK REF="REF-Daffos-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daffos 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paidas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paidas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Silver-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Silver 2000</LINK>). A trial comparing IVIG with serial intrauterine platelet transfusions of platelets is unlikely to be carried out, as it is believed that both interventions have found their rightful place. All interventions currently in use have recognised side effects and long-term implications. For IVIG they include transfusion transmitted disease, headaches and febrile reactions in the mother and bleeding and death for the fetus. Corticosteroids can cause osteoporosis and hypertension in the mother whilst intrauterine platelet transfusion can cause bleeding and fetal loss. It is, therefore, important to have robust data regarding both long- and short-term outcomes for both the mothers and their children. Also, due to the significant costs involved, it is imperative to optimise the cost benefit for interventions considered as management options for fetomaternal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>From the data published to date, the ideal antenatal treatment of FMAIT is still unclear. However, we have gained some knowledge upon which to base further studies and management strategies in the interim. From these trials it appears that stratification of patients according to the sibling history, and tailoring of treatment accordingly is safe, allowing a less intensive approach to treatment and monitoring where the sibling platelet count was &gt; 20 x 10*9/l and there was no ICH. Where the sibling platelet count was lower, or there was a history of ICH more intensive treatment is still associated with significant failure but the combination of IVIG and prednisone is superior to IVIG alone.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the incidence of ICH, the most important marker of treatment efficacy, can not be reduced to zero in any study where babies are delivered prematurely (which is an independent risk factor for ICH) or by emergency means. It was of interest that three of the four instances of ICH occurred in association with a normal platelet count. In all three cases the baby was premature and/or delivered by emergency caesarean section. Studies powered to demonstrate a reduction in ICH require multi-centre recruitment since it is estimated that the incidence of ICH in an at-risk pregnancy where the sibling suffered an ICH is 72% (<LINK REF="REF-Radder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radder 2003</LINK>) and where there was no ICH it is 7%.</P>

<OL>
<LI>There is no evidence that, when added to IVIG, antenatally administered dexamethasone improves platelet count at birth. Since dexamethasone (albeit at higher doses than that used in <LINK REF="STD-Bussel-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Bussel 1996a</LINK>) has been reported as causing fetal oligohydramnios and this trial also reported significant effects on the mother, dexamethasone is not recommended for the antenatal treatment of FMAIT, especially since alternative corticosteroids are available.</LI>
<LI>IVIG or prednisone can be used as first line treatment for standard-risk FMAIT, where there was no peripartum haemorrhage in an affected sibling and the pre-treatment fetal platelet count (if performed) is &gt; 20 x 10*9/l. However, the optimal dose of both prednisone and IVIG has not been established.</LI>
<LI>IVIG in combination with prednisone is more effective in raising the fetal platelet count than IVIG alone in high-risk pregnancies, where the pre-treatment fetal platelet count &lt; 20 x 10*9/l or the affected sibling sustained a peripartum ICH. The optimal timing of administration and the dose of prednisone and IVIG is unclear, but studies demonstrating efficacy initiated treatment at 20-26 weeks. </LI>
<LI>High-risk pregnancies were defined as those where an ICH occurred peripartum in the sibling. No data are currently available where the sibling ICH occurred in-utero or neonatally. It is possible that this very high risk group requires dual therapy and we await publication of the trial investigating the management of this group of women (<LINK REF="STD-MacGregor-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacGregor 2005</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-04-01 10:11:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the rarity of this condition, international collaborations are needed in order to accrue meaningful data and improve patient management. Future studies will need to include outcomes that can be appropriately assessed and compared across other similar studies. All outcome measures specified in 'Types of outcomes' and identified post-hoc in 'non-prespecified outcomes' are important measures for future trials.</P>
<P>Areas of interest for future research include:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Dose of IVIG</HEADING>
<P>The ideal study would be one of IVIG compared with placebo since this has not been performed. However, despite their limitations, observational data strongly support the role of IVIG in modulating the course of the disease in at-risk pregnancies and many would argue that such a trial would be unethical. It would certainly be difficult to recruit patients. Instead, the timing and dosage of treatment needs evaluation in order to avoid the possibility of excessive treatment. The standard of 1 g per kg per week has been derived empirically from anecdotal reports of failure of lower doses (<LINK REF="STD-Lynch-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lynch 1992</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Berkowitz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berkowitz 2007</LINK> trial compared IVIG 2 g per kg per week and IVIG 1 g per kg per week PLUS prednisone. Unfortunately, no trial has been performed to compare dose regimens or to determine optimal treatment for different risk groups based on sibling history. Increasing the dose of IVIG in standard risk women from 1 to 2 g per kg per week has substantial implications, both in terms of personal issues of childcare and work for the mother, as well as the high cost per individual treated. The No IntraCranial Haemorrhage (NOIICH) trial aimed to compare different doses of IVIG - low and standard but has been closed due to a lack of patient accrual (Oepkes 2005a).</P>
<P>It is not clear what aspect of IVIG's action is most important in inhibiting disease activity. If it is in the blockade of placental antibody transfer then levels similar to those required in rhesus haemolytic disease of the newborn (20 g/l) may be optimal (<LINK REF="REF-Urbaniak-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urbaniak 1999</LINK>). Perhaps this should be confirmed for FMAIT with treatment schedules adjusted for individual participants.</P>
<P>Laboratory-based studies should focus on the action of IVIG on dendritic cells, T-cell and maternal antibody production and transfer, to determine relative importance of each function, and the optimal concentrations required for each.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Timing of initial treatment</HEADING>
<P>It appears that duration and amount of treatment should be titrated according to risk. The issue of when IVIG should be commenced for different risk groups remains unsolved.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3. Monitoring response by fetal blood sampling</HEADING>
<P>The risks associated with FBS pose many questions.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Should there be FBS to monitor treatment and if so, how often?</LI>
<LI>Should there be a final FBS and platelet transfusion prior to birth?</LI>
<LI>Should all high-risk mothers have FBS at 20 weeks?</LI>
<LI>Should FBS be preceded by empirically administered IVIG? If so, what dose should be given and for how long?</LI>
<LI>Should low-risk mothers have sampling at all?</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Timing and mode of birth</HEADING>
<P>There is no evidence that early birth or caesarean section increases or reduces morbidity/mortality in FMAIT. Outside pregnancies affected by FMAIT, emergency caesarean section is known to be associated with an increased risk of ICH in neonates, compared with that of spontaneous vaginal delivery or elective caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Ljung-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ljung 2008</LINK>). Should the timing of delivery and outcomes of caesarean section efficacy and safety be incorporated into future trials? Should this be stratified by the last fetal platelet count?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">5. Laboratory measures to define pregnancies with a high risk of ICH and so identify pregnancies to be treated</HEADING>
<P>The mechanism of disease is poorly understood and limits our management approach in this field.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>What is the role of T-cells in the pathogenesis of disease? Can their numbers, phenotype or activation state predict clinical disease?</LI>
<LI>Could a functional antibody assay be developed which more accurately correlates with disease?</LI>
<LI>Are there parameters of the fetus or baby's platelets that might predict the risk of bleeding or the recovery of a normal platelet count?</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">6. Management of non-responders</HEADING>
<P>Can non-responders be predicted by non-invasive means? Clinical trials should be performed in parallel with laboratory scientific research, with the aim of improving understanding and monitoring of the antibody response in FMAIT.</P>
<P>What is the role of corticosteroids, elevated doses of IVIG and intrauterine platelet transfusion, or a combination of all three? Do alternative immunosuppressive agents have a role to play in these, or even in standard-risk cases?</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">7. Antenatal screening</HEADING>
<P>Advances in the laboratory diagnosis and antenatal management of FMAIT have drawn attention to the fact that the first affected fetus/neonate is usually only recognised after bleeding has occurred or severe thrombocytopenia detected by chance. This raises the question of whether routine screening for FMAIT should be considered. However, there are significant shortcomings in the knowledge about FMAIT necessary for the introduction of an antenatal screening programme. These include:</P>
<P>a) the clinical outcome of first affected pregnancies;</P>
<P>b) the identification of laboratory measures predictive of severe disease where antenatal intervention might be justified; and</P>
<P>c) the optimal approach for the antenatal management of pregnant women with HPA antibodies but with no previous history of affected pregnancies.</P>
