<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-23 10:57:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adhesions in the abdomen cause abnormal bonding between adjacent peritoneal surfaces and are common after operations in the abdomen. They are composed of fibrous tissue but also contain blood vessels, fat and nerves. They result in a spectrum of problems that affect the patient (intestinal blockage, infertility and possibly pain); the surgeon (difficulties in access and dissection, prolongation of operative time, increase in blood loss, predisposition to bowel injury); the health care provider (increased cost due to readmissions and litigation). Prevention is the key. This review focus on the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of two preventive agents applied in the abdomen during general surgical operations, Hyaluronic acid /carboxymethyl cellulose membrane and 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel.<BR/>There is evidence to suggest that use of Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane reduces the incidence, severity and extent of adhesions.However, it does not reduce the incidence of subsequent intestinal obstruction or need for surgery to treat the obstruction, when it occurs. It appears to be safe with no significant increase in adverse effects or deaths when compared to control. There is limited data on 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel with only one study available. This study did not report on the efficacy of the gel as it was prematurely terminated because of a significantly higher rate of adverse effects in the patients who were treated with this gel.</P>

<P>Seven randomised trials were eligible; six compared hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl membrane (HA/CMC) and one 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel against controls.</P>

<P>Implications for practice</P>
<P>There is evidence that the use of HA/CMC membrane reduces incidence, extent and severity of adhesions which may, theoretically, have implications in re-operative abdominal surgery. There is no evidence that the incidence of intestinal obstruction or need for operative intervention is reduced. HA/CMC appears to be safe but there may be a risk of leak when wrapped around an anastomoses. HA/CMC may be considered for intra-abdominal, adhesion prophylaxis at a surgeon&#8217;s discretion and clinical context.</P>
<P>Implications for research</P>
<P>Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of other agents in abdominal surgery in general. Synergism, using agents which target different aspects of adhesiogenesis, with exploration effectiveness in a wide range of emergency and elective surgery should be considered. Longer term outcomes of recurrent intestinal obstruction and chronic pain, identification of high risk groups of patients with evaluation of cost-effectiveness are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-23 13:55:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intra-abdominal adhesions are usually iatrogenic, affect both genders and all ages. They may occur in up to 95% of patients who had undergone a previous laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Ellis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellis 1997</LINK>). This contrasts with a 10% incidence in patients without a prior laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Menzies-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 1990</LINK>). Pelvic adhesions that follow trans-abdominal gynaecological surgery have long been implicated in causing pain and infertility. Similarly, patients presenting to the general surgeon display a spectrum of adhesion related problems or morbidity. The treating surgeon often faces difficulties with access and obscured normal anatomy which may lead either to an inability to apply minimal access surgery, prolongation of operative time (<LINK REF="REF-Coleman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coleman 2000</LINK>) or result in potentially serious organ injury such as inadvertent enterotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Krabben-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Krabben 2000</LINK>). Adhesions are estimated to account for about a third of all bowel obstructions and two-thirds of small bowel obstructions in the western world (<LINK REF="REF-Menzies-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menzies-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 1993</LINK>).<BR/>Certain surgical operations have been reported to carry a higher than usual risk of adhesion-related complications. A 25 % incidence of adhesive obstruction has been reported in a series of 1005 ileo-anal pouch procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Fazio-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fazio 1995</LINK>). Total or subtotal colectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lockhart_x002d_Mummery1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lockhart-Mummery1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nieuwenhuijzen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieuwenhuijzen 1998</LINK>) and appendicectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 1993</LINK>) are other high risk procedures in terms of their propensity to lead to adhesive intestinal obstruction. In neonates, surgery for gastroschisis and malrotation are reported to carry a 15% risk of post-operative adhesive intestinal obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkins-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkins 1986</LINK>). Managing adhesions and adhesion related complications is expensive in terms of time (<LINK REF="REF-Menzies-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2001</LINK>), effort and finances (<LINK REF="REF-Ray-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ray 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeekel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeekel 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Menzies-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Menzies 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>) and impacts not only on the patient and the treating physician but also the health care system at large. The prolongation in hospital stay, re-admissions, repeated surgical interventions and litigation impose an enormous burden on the health care systems globally, making adhesion prevention an important area of health care intervention research.<BR/>As once established, adhesions follow an unpredictable temporal course, which is attended by a lifetime risk of recurrent symptoms, complications, re-admissions and repeat surgery, prevention seems to be the most viable strategy yet. Peritoneal injury, the attendant inflammation, imbalance in plasmin system and proximity of injured surfaces are the crucial elements in adhesion formation. Hence, preventive strategies have been designed targeting these steps individually or in combination. Injury limitation, a vital aspect of prophylaxis is largely a surgical endeavour achieved by meticulous attention to operative technique and tissue handling. However, as injury can only be minimised and not completely abolished, adjuncts to injury limitation techniques are necessary to reduce the risk of adhesions. Systemic and intraperitoneal pharmacological strategies like anti-inflammatories, anticoagulants, agents targeting the plasmin cascade and hormones have not met with much success clinically (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Risberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Risberg 1997</LINK>).<BR/>A number of fluid and solid phase (membranes, sheets) agents that primarily act as barriers to contact between two adjacent peritoneal surfaces, have been evaluated clinically for their potential for adhesion prophylaxis. Examples of fluid agents include 4% Icodextrin (Adept®, ML laboratories plc.,UK) and Hyaluronic acid-phosphate buffered saline (Sepracoat®, Genzyme Corp., USA). Examples of solid phase agents include, Hyaluronic acid /Carboxymethyl cellulose membrane (Seprafilm®, Genzyme Corp., USA), Oxidised regenerated cellulose (Interceed®, Johnson&amp;Johnson medical Inc., USA), and expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-tex®, WL Gore&amp; Associates, USA ). These agents differ in their chemical composition, biodegradability, tissue interactions and hence the adverse effect profiles.<BR/>An intervention such as adhesion prophylaxis, that is likely to have a wide impact on day to day surgical practice and on the health care economics needs to be scrutinised for safety and efficacy with specific reference to the context in which it is used and in relation to relevant outcomes.Barrier and non-barrier agents in prophylaxis of adhesions have been evaluated for efficacy by systematic reviews, but only in the context of gynaecological surgery (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 2002</LINK>), usually with respect to their effect on fertility rates and pain ( <LINK REF="REF-Ahmad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmad 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Metwally-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metwally 2006</LINK>).<BR/>The purpose of the current review is to provide an evidence based appraisal of the safety and efficacy of intra-peritoneal agents in general surgical operations from randomised controlled trials that have assessed adhesion reformation (severity, distribution and frequency) and /or adhesion related intestinal obstruction as the main outcome measure.</P>

<B>STUDY SELECTION<BR/>
</B>Two reviewers (SK and PFW) conducted a methodical search of the electronic bibliographic medical databases and other sources as outlined in the search strategy. Trials were considered for inclusion in the review if they fulfilled the following criteria:<BR/>1. Prospective randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in humans.<BR/>2.The procedure performed was an intra-peritoneal non-gynaecological surgery, either open or laparoscopic.<BR/>3.The trial compared an agent against either no treatment or an appropriate placebo or against another prophylactic agent.<BR/>4.Trial addressed the safety and/or efficacy of the intra-peritoneal prophylactic agents.</P>
<P>After initial screening of the title and abstract, the full-text article of the studies were retrieved in the following situations:<BR/>1.Study fulfils criteria on initial screening of the abstract and title<BR/>2.Study may potentially fulfil criteria but there is not enough information in the abstract alone to justify inclusion.<BR/>3.No abstract is available but the title suggests a potential that the study may fulfil criteria.</P>
<P>The full text article was then scrutinised independently by two reviewers to confirm that the study justified inclusion. A specifically designed structured flow chart with a set of check lists incorporated was used in the selection procedure.</P>
<P>
<B>QUALITY ASSESSMENT:<BR/>
</B>Quality assessment was by a component based system incorporating aspects of internal validity outlined below. Composite scoring systems for quality assessment were not used.The domains considered towards quality assessment, were selected to detect any potential for selection bias, detection bias and attrition bias. The studies were scrutinised for details regarding the following components of quality:<BR/>
<B>1. Randomisation:<BR/>
</B>Good quality: True randomisation ( Computer generated random number sequences, sequences from validated random number tables, coin tossing, casting dice, shuffling cards or similar methods )<BR/>Poor quality: Quasi-randomisation (based on date of birth, hospital number, date of admission, alternating sequence or similar methods ).<BR/>
<B>2.Allocation concealment:<BR/>
</B>Good quality: sequentially labelled sealed, opaque envelopes; Centralised randomisation revealed by telephoning before assignment or similar methods.<BR/>Poor quality: unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, open allocation schedule, all procedures based on quasi-randomisation.<BR/>
<B>3.Blinding:<BR/>
</B>Good quality: Assessor or observer is blinded to the intervention that the patient has had.<BR/>Poor quality: Assessor not blinded; Only the patient and or the surgeon applying the intervention is blinded ; No blinding used.<BR/>
<B>4.Handling of attrition:<BR/>

<B>DATA ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS:</B>
<BR/>The statistical package Metaview of Revman 4.2.6, provided by the Cochrane collaboration was used to analyse and synthesise data. For dichotomous data such as presence or absence of adhesions, incidence of morbidity and mortality attributable to adhesions, incidence of intestinal obstruction and incidence of re-admissions , the impact of the intervention is expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data such as extent of adhesions measured as absolute area (square millimetres or square centimetres) or as a proportion or percentage of wound area, the effect size was estimated by computing the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals.<BR/>The tables of comparison are for the following outcomes:<BR/>1.Incidence of adhesions<BR/>2.Extent of adhesions<BR/>3.Incidence of morbidity (overall and specific)<BR/>4.Incidence of mortality<BR/>5.Incidence of intestinal obstruction (overall and those needing surgical intervention)<BR/>A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. There were too few studies (7) satisfying the inclusion criteria to explore the potential for publication bias by a funnel plot of sample size plotted against the odds ratio of primary outcome. Statistical heterogeneity was tested by inspection of the forest plot and computation of the chi square statistic for heterogeneity with the probability of a type I error set at 10% ( P value &lt;0.1 considered significant). Meta-analysis when appropriate, was performed assuming a random effects model (Dersimonian and Laird method).</P>

<B>NUMBER AND TYPES OF STUDIES</B>
<BR/>A total of 12 studies reporting on the use of intra-abdominal agents for adhesion prophylaxis in general surgical operations were identified, of which 5 were excluded. Four of the five excluded studies were excluded because they were non-randomised clinical studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kudo-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kudo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arnbjornsson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Arnbjornsson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang--1994" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salum-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Salum 2001</LINK>). One other study (<LINK REF="STD-Beck--1997" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1997</LINK>) was excluded because it was a dual publication of identical data previously published (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>). All 7 included studies were prospective randomised controlled trials. However, there were 2 publications (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>), from one clinical trial reporting on different outcomes which meant that there were a total of 8 publications from 7 clinical trials<BR/>
<B>TYPES OF INTERVENTION</B>
<BR/>Six of the seven studies involved Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethylcellulose membrane (Seprafilm) as the intervention agent against a control group which did not receive any specific anti-adhesion prophylaxis (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>). The only other study used 0.5% Ferric hyaluranate gel (Intergel) as adhesion prophylaxis in the intervention group while the control group received distilled water (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<B>NUMBER OF PATIENTS</B>
<BR/>There was a wide variation among the studies in the total numbers of patients recruited. This ranged from only 32 patients in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>) to 1791 patients in another (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>). Only two of the other five studies, recruited more than a hundred patients (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>TYPES OF PATIENTS</B>
<BR/>All studies involved adult patients of both genders and excluded pregnant patients. Three studies recruited patients who underwent a wide range of abdominopelvic resective surgery (involving small bowel, large bowel and rectum) (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>) while the others included only a more limited group of patients defined on the basis of the underlying pathology or type of surgery. Two studies limited their recruitment to patients undergoing colectomy and ileoanal pouch procedure for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). One study included only patients who had rectal cancer who underwent preoperative radiotherapy followed by staged surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>). Another study recruited only patients who underwent a rectal resection and needed an ileostomy (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>) while one restricted recruitment to patients undergoing Hartmann resection for sigmoid diverticulitis or obstructing recto-sigmoid lesions (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>TYPES OF OUTCOMES</B>
<BR/>Five out of the 8 included publications reported on outcomes which included aspects of both efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>) while two studies reported on efficacy alone (<LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>) and one publication on safety alone (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>). Efficacy of prophylactic agents was reported in 7 trials. The relevant outcome measures studied were their effect on the incidence of adhesions in 3 publications (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>), extent of adhesions in 3 publications (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>), the severity of adhesions in 5 publications (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>), incidence of bowel obstruction in 2 publications (<LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>) and their effect on the quality of life in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>).<BR/>The safety profile of the agents used were reported in 6 publications. The relevant outcome measures studied were mortality, overall morbidity and specific morbidity such as wound infection, anastomotic leak, fistula and intra-abdominal abscess.</P>

<P>Of the 7 prospective randomised controlled trials included, 5 were multi centre trials involving eight (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>), eleven (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>), twelve (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>), sixteen (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>) and twenty two (<LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>) centres. Three trials were based in single institutions (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). Sample size calculation was described in 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). Generation of the randomisation sequence was by using standard random number tables in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>) and by a computer generated sequence in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). In 4 studies the exact method of generation of the random sequence was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). Allocation concealment was by the use of sealed envelopes in 3 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>), and by resorting to telephoning a remote point of central randomisation at the time of intervention in 1 study (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Allocation concealment was not clearly evident in 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). Blinded outcome evaluation to minimise bias was described in 5 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). </P>
<P>Only five studies prospectively defined at least some of the key outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>). Analysis was on an intention to treat basis in 3 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The period of follow up varied depending on the outcome reported. For example, studies reporting on safety related outcomes such as morbidity had a shorter follow up than those reporting on efficacy related outcomes such as the incidence of adhesions or bowel obstruction. The period of follow up was clearly stated in 4 publications - <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK> (1 month follow up for adverse events); <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK> (median follow up of 22.8 months in phase I and 9.6 months in phase II for adverse events); <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK> (Mean follow up of 3.5 years for intestinal obstruction), and <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK> (1 year follow up for intestinal obstruction). The follow up period for safety related outcomes was not clearly evident in 3 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>). In studies reporting on the efficacy of agents in preventing the incidence and or severity of adhesions, there was a wide variation in the duration between the index surgery and the second surgery used for assessment of adhesions. In <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>, the duration was from 8-12 weeks; in <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK> it was 8-14 weeks; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK> states that the second surgery was performed at least 3 months after the index surgery, but does not provide further details; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK> reports a median duration of 5 months in the intervention group and 4 months in the control group between index surgery and assessment; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK> report two different phases in the trial. In phase I, the intervention group had ileostomy closure at three weeks from index surgery, while the control group had the closure performed at 6-12 weeks. In phase II both the intervention and control groups had ileostomy closure at 3 weeks.<BR/>Attrition of patients either due to exclusion after recruitment or loss to follow up had a wide variation depending on the outcome being studied and the duration of follow up. Three studies had no attrition and were able to report outcomes on all recruited patients (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>). Two studies had low attrition rates of 4.4% (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>) and 4.8% (<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>). The other three studies had a much higher degree of attrition, <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK> (38%), <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK> (41%) and <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK> (12.5% at 3 months and 62.5% at 1 year). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>), 90 patients were excluded post-randomisation, from the final analysis. The excluded patients were analysed as a different subgroup and results reported separately from the main cohort of patients in the study. The reason stated is that these 90 patients, had adhesive intestinal obstruction, at recruitment while the others did not. However exclusion after randomisation is likely to introduce bias and as shown in the analysis, including this subgroup of patients in the meta-analysis significantly affects the point estimate of the effect (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).<BR/>Overall 5 studies could be described as grade B studies (intermediate quality) (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>). Three other studies were assigned grade C (poor quality) mainly because of a high attrition rate (<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>).</P>

<U>
<BR/>
</U>
<B>[1]</B> I<B>NCIDENCE OF ADHESIONS<BR/>
</B>Data was available for the use of only one agent- Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane. The only study which used 0.5% Ferric hyaluronate gel did not report on its effect on the incidence of adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose membrane (seprafilm) versus control:<BR/>
</B>Three studies reported on the effect of use of Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane on the incidence of adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). There were a total of 97 events amongst 164 patients in the treatment group compared to 158 events amongst 171 patients in the control arm. The use of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane reduced the incidence of adhesions significantly [OR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.43); p=0.0005].<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>[2] EXTENT OF ADHESIONS<BR/>
</B>Three studies using Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose membrane as the interventional agent, reported on the extent of adhesions as a relative measure such as the proportion of either the main wound length or peristomal area involved by adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>). In two studies the extent of adhesions was measured on an interval scale as a percentage of the main laparotomy wound and data analysed comparing differences between means or median among the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). Becker and colleagues found the mean extent of adhesions in the intervention group (n=85) to be 23% (s.d. 34) compared to 63% (s.d. 34) in the control group (n=90) [ p&lt;0.01; student's t test]. Cohen and colleagues, reported a mean of 31% involvement of the main laparotomy wound with adhesions in the intervention group compared to 65% in the control group. The mean distribution and error bars representing standard deviation were provided in this publication. The measured differences between the two groups however, were analysed using a non-parametric method and are reported to be statistically significant [p&lt;0.001; Mann-Whitney test].<BR/>Data from these two studies were used in the meta-analysis. The use of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane significantly reduced the extent of adhesions to the midline wound [WMD -25.9%(95%CI: -40.56, -11.26); p=0.0005]<BR/>In one other study (<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>), the adhesions were measured on an ordinal scale with the extent of adhesions in individual patients given a grading of 0 (no adhesions), 1 (covering up to 25% of the length of the wound or peristomal area), 2 (covering 25-50% of the length of the wound or peristomal area), 3 (covering more than 50% of the length of the wound or peristomal area). The extent of midline and peristomal adhesions were measured in 30 patients in the intervention group and 29 patients in the control group. When midline adhesions were compared, 26 out of 30 patients in the intervention group had a grade of 0, while 15 out of 29 patients in control group had grade 2 adhesions. The differences between the groups were statistically significant (p&lt;0.01; Mann-Whitney test). Comparing peristomal adhesions, 18 of 30 patients in the interventional group had grade 1 adhesions while 23 out of 29 patients in the control group had grade 2 or 3 adhesions. The differences between the groups was statistically significant (p ,0.01; Mann-Whitney test).</P>
<P>
<B>[3] SEVERITY OF ADHESIONS<BR/>
</B>Five studies using Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose membrane as the interventional agent reported on the severity of adhesions (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). There was a wide variation in the methods and definitions used to assess severity which precluded meta-analysis.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK> used a three point grading system (grades 1-3) which assessed thickness and vascularity . There were 90 patients in the control group and 85 in the intervention group. The use of Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose membrane was associated with significantly less severe adhesions as assessed by their grading system (p&lt;0.01; Wilcoxon rank sum test).<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK> used the product of an estimate of severity (which was graded from 1-4) and the distribution of adhesions to give a composite score which was used as the comparative measure. The median composite severity score for the whole of the midline incision was significantly lower in the intervention group (18) when compared to the control group (50) [p=0.002 ; Mann-Whitney test].<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK> classified peristomal adhesions by severity into 3 groups (grades 1-3). Each of the 4 quadrants around the stoma was scored separately and a total score was calculated by summation. In Phase one of the trial, assessment was performed 3 weeks after index surgery in the intervention group (n=26) while the assessment in the control group was at 6 weeks or after (n=39). There were no differences in the mean adhesion severity scores between the two groups in this phase (p=0.84; student's t test). In the second phase of the study, a subsequently recruited cohort of patients were assessed at 3 weeks after index surgery in both groups (n= 21 in the intervention group and n= 22 in the control group). The mean adhesion severity score was significantly less in the intervention group (p=0.02; student's t test).<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK> graded the severity of adhesions based on thickness an vascularity into four groups (grades 0-3). There were 30 patients in the intervention group and 29 patients in the control group. Both midline adhesions and peristomal adhesions were significantly less severe in the intervention group (p&lt;0.01; Mann-Whitney test).<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK> used a four point grading system (grades 0-3). There were 58 patients in the intervention group and 60 patients in the control group. In the intervention group, 19 patients had grade 2 adhesions and 6 patients had grade 3 adhesions compared to 25 and 21 patients respectively in the control group. These differences in severity were reported to be statistically significant ( p&lt;0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test).</P>
<P>
<B>[4] INCIDENCE OF RE-ADMISSIONS<BR/>
</B>None of the included studies had provided specific data on the incidence of re-admissions in the patients studied.</P>
<P>
<B>[5] INCIDENCE OF BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AND OPERATIVE INTERVENTION FOR BOWEL OBSTRUCTION<BR/>
</B>Overall three out of the eight publications reported on the incidence of bowel obstruction as an outcome measure.<BR/>
<B>Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethylcellulose membrane (seprafilm) versus control: </B>Two studies reported on the incidence of intestinal obstruction (<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 2005</LINK> followed up their patients for 24-66 months (median 43.6 months) while <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK> reported a follow up of between 24-60 months (mean 42 months). Two types of incidences were reported. All causes bowel obstruction includes a diagnosis of bowel obstruction in patients in the follow up period, arrived on the basis of clinical, radiological and/ or operative criteria. Bowel obstruction attributable to adhesions includes only the subset of patients who either required a laparotomy or laparoscopy to diagnose or treat bowel obstruction and hence had objective operative evidence to support the adhesive aetiology of obstruction. <LINK REF="STD-Fazio-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fazio 2006</LINK> presented their results in two subgroups. Ninety patients who had adhesive intestinal obstruction at recruitment have been analysed as a separate subgroup - with a higher incidence of adhesive obstruction in the treatment group (8/42) compared to the control group (4/48). This essentially means a post-randomisation exclusion of 90 patients from the initial recruitment cohort of patients. The authors of this review, feel that such post randomisation exclusion is inappropriate and introduces a significant bias to the results (as borne out by the forest plot 1.10.1, which clearly illustrates the effect of excluding and including this subgroup of 90 patients in the meta-analysis). For the purposes of this review, the authors have included the data on the subgroup of 90 patients in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The total incidence of intestinal obstruction of all causes was 111 out of 912 patients in the intervention group compared to 111 out of 938 patients in the control group. The differences between the two groups was not statistically significant [OR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.34, 2.08)]. Similarly, in the subgroup of adhesive intestinal obstruction needing surgical intervention, the incidence of intestinal obstruction in the treatment group (24 out of 914) and the control group (36 out of 939) were not statistically significant [OR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.24, 2.7)].</P>
<P>
<B>
<BR/>0.5% Ferric Hyaluronate gel: </B>One study reported the incidence of intestinal obstruction during follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). The study was underpowered due to premature termination. Even amongst the recruited patients, the attrition rate in the study for evaluation of this particular outcome measure was unacceptably high. Of the total of 32 patients recruited in the study only 20 patients (10 patients in each arm of the study) completed 1 year follow up for evaluation of the incidence of intestinal obstruction. One patient in the treatment group was found to satisfy the criteria set out in the study, for intestinal obstruction during the one year of follow up reported. So no valid conclusions can be drawn from this study on the effect of adhesion prophylaxis on the incidence of adhesive obstruction.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>[6] INCIDENCE OF OPERATIVE INTERVENTION OF OTHER CAUSES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADHESIONS<BR/>
</B>None of the included studies had provided data specifically relating to adhesion related operative intervention apart from those presenting with intestinal obstruction discussed above. Though one study set out to evaluate the need for adhesiolysis during follow up, as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>), this did not materialise as the study was terminated prematurely. None of the 20 patients followed up for 1 year needed adhesiolysis. In summary, the recruitment was small (total of 32 patients), follow up short (1 year), attrition rate for follow up high (37.5%) and the event rate too low (zero) to draw any valid conclusions.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>[7] QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURES<BR/>
</B>Quality of life is an important patient reported outcome increasingly used to assess effectivenes of interventions. However, it would be a difficult one to measure in the context of adhesions due to a number of confounding factors. Only one trial attempted to study the effect of adhesion prophylaxis on the quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>) using the Gastrointestinal Quality Of Life Index tool. Though baseline measurements were available for 29 patients (n=15 for treatment group and n=14 for control group), the attrition rate was high with only a total of 11 patients ( n=5 for treatment group and n=6 for control group) completing the quality of life questionnaire at the end of 1 year. Moreover, only 3 patients completed all three sets of questionnaires (i.e. baseline, 6 months and 1 year). Because of the high attrition rate and the non-availability of individual patient data, no definite conclusions can be drawn on the effect of the intervention on the quality of life.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>
<U>B. SAFETY<BR/>
</U>
</B>Six studies reported on at least one aspect of safety. Five of these studies used Hyaluronic acid / carboxymethyl cellulose and the results were reported at the end of the study period as planned. One study evaluated the safety of 0.5% Hyaluranate gel against placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). Though the study was intended to recruit about 700 patients, the high incidence of morbidity in the intervention group resulted in a premature termination of the trial within 6 weeks of commencement after recruitment of only 32 patients.</P>
<P>
<B>[1] INCIDENCE OF OVERALL MORBIDITY<BR/>
</B>A total of 4 studies reported on overall adverse events seen in the intervention and the control groups. The specific list of complications for which the patients were evaluated for, varied between different studies, but was applied equally between the two arms within a study. The overall morbidity included both abdominal (such as abdominal abscess, anastomotic leak) as well as extra-abdominal (such as fever, pulmonary embolism) adverse events. <B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>Hyaluranate/CMC membrane: </B>Three studies recruiting a total of 2094 patients, were available for evaluation of safety of HA/CMC membrane. The total event rate in all three studies together was relatively high at 759 (36.2%). There was no significant clinical or statistical heterogeneity amongst the studies. There was a total of 390 events amongst 1032 patients in the intervention group and a total of 369 events in 1062 patients in the control group. The incidence of overall morbidity was comparable between the intervention and control groups [OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.46; p=0.10].<BR/>
<B>0.5% Ferric Hyaluranate gel: </B>one study evaluated the safety of 0.5% hyaluranate gel against placebo (Tang 2006). There were a total of 32 patients of which 17 were in the intervention group. At 30 day follow up, complications were 5 times more common in the intervention group when compared to the control group [OR 5.04; 95%CI:1.1; 22.9]. This resulted in the premature termination of the study, within 6 weeks of initiation.<BR/>
<B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>[2] INCIDENCE OF ABDOMINAL OR PELVIC INFECTION<BR/>Hyaluranate/CMC membrane: </B>Three studies reported on the incidence of post-operative intra-abdominal or pelvic infection after the use of Hyaluranate/CMC membrane (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). A total of 53 patients out of 1032 experienced pelvic or abdominal infection in the intervention group compared to 34 out of 1062 patients in the control group. These differences did not reach statistical significance [OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 0.95, 3.92; p=0.07].<BR/>
<B>0.5% Ferric Hyaluranate gel: </B>One study which used 0.5% ferric hyaluranate gel reported occurrence of peritonitis in one patient (of 17) in the intervention group while none were recorded in the control group. However, there were no instances of intra-abdominal or pelvic abscesses in the study.<BR/>
<B>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>[3] INCIDENCE OF ANASTOMOTIC LEAKS<BR/>
</B>The incidence of anastomotic leaks was reported in a total of 5 studies.</P>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>Hyaluranate/CMC membrane: </B>Four studies using hyaluranate/CMC membrane specifically reported on the incidence of anastomotic leak (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). The study by Tang reported two different phases in the trial. In Phase I the intervention group had the ileostomy closed at 3 weeks while the control group had the ileostomy closed at 6-12 weeks. As the radiologically evaluated anastomotic leak rate is bound to be higher at 3 weeks when compared to 6-12 weeks, potentially introducing a time bias between the two groups, patients from the phase I of the study were not included in the meta-analysis of anastomotic leaks. However, in Phase II in the trial, the intervention and control groups were treated similarly, with ileostomy closure being performed at 3 weeks in both groups. Data from Phase II of this trial was considered for meta-analysis. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>, which was by far the largest study in the group, there was a higher incidence of anastomotic leak and leak related events (fistula, peritonitis, abdominopelvic abscess, systemic sepsis) in the intervention group (76/882=8.6%) when compared to the control group (46/909= 5.1%). In the subgroup where HA/CMC membrane was wrapped around the anastomosis, the incidence of these events was particularly high (39/289= 13.5%) and the difference was statistically significant when compared to control in this particular study (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>).<BR/>When data from all three contributing studies was considered in the meta-analysis, there was a total of 43 anastomotic leaks in 1066 patients in the treatment arm compared to 26 anastomotic leaks in 1098 patients in the control arm. The observed higher incidence of anastomotic leak in the intervention group was not statistically significant [OR: 1.61; 95%CI: 0.69, 3.71; p=0.27].<BR/>
<B>0.5% Ferric Hyaluranate gel: </B>One study reported the incidence of anastomotic leak when 0.5% ferric hyaluranate gel was compared with control (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). There were 5 anastomotic leaks among 17 patients in the treatment group compared to 1 anastomotic leak in 15 patients in the control group. The observed fivefold increase in anastomotic leak in the treatment group was however not statistically significant [OR: 5.83; 95% CI: 0.6, 57.1; p=0.13].<BR/>

</U>[4] INCIDENCE OF ILEUS OR EARLY POSTOPERATIVE OBSTRUCTION<BR/>
</B>Data on the incidence of ileus or early postoperative obstruction not specifically attributed to adhesions was available in 5 studies. 
<BR/>

<B>Hyaluranate/CMC membrane: </B>Four studies reported on the effect of use of this membrane agent on the incidence of ileus (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). A total of 58 patients out of 1113 developed ileus in the treatment arm compared to 57 out of 1148 patients in the control arm. These differences were not statistically significant [OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.53; p=0.79].<BR/>
<B>0.5% Ferric hyaluranate gel: </B>The only study which reported on the use of 0.5% Ferric hyaluranate gel found a nine fold higher incidence of ileus in the intervention group (10 out of 17) compared to the control group (2 out of 15) (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>). The differences were statistically significant [OR: 9.29; 95% CI: 1.57, 54.77; p=0.01].</P>
<P>
<B>[5] INCIDENCE OF WOUND INFECTION<BR/>
</B>Incidence of wound infection was reported in a total of 5 studies.<BR/>
<B>Hyaluranate/CMC membrane: </B>Four studies used Hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane (<LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vrijiland-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vrijiland 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK>). A total of 49 wound infections occurred in 1053 patients in the intervention group compared to 43 wound infections in 1083 patients in the control group. The observed differences in wound infection between the intervention and control groups were not statistically significant [OR 1.18; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.80; p=0.46].<BR/>
<B>0.5% Ferric hyaluranate gel: </B>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Tang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2006</LINK>) reported wound infection rates when 0.5% Ferric hyaluronate gel was used as the agent. This was an underpowered study as it had to be prematurely terminated. There were 6 infections in 17 patients in the intervention group compared to 3 infections in 15 patients in the control group. There were no significant differences in the incidence of wound infection between the two groups [OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 0.44, 10.9; p=0.34].<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-23 11:22:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peritoneal injury which occurs during laparotomy almost invariably results in the formation of adhesions. It has been estimated that up to a third of the adult population in the western world, may be harbouring adhesions which carry a lifelong potential for complications. The resultant burden to the patient, the surgeon and the health care system on a global scale is high. From this perspective, research in peritoneal adhesions especially its prevention, should be given a high priority. Methods to prevent adhesions may be broadly grouped into surgical techniques and adjuncts. Surgical techniques include such poorly defined suggestions such as gentle peritoneal handling to more specific interventions such as avoiding peritoneal closure, use of starch free gloves and avoiding spillage of gall stones. However, these surgical techniques alone are not completely effective on their own and hence the search for adjuncts. Adjuncts may further be classified into physical (or mechanical) types and chemical categories. The physical group of agents are applied intraperitoneally and primarily act by forming a barrier between adjacent peritoneal surfaces. They may be membranes or sheets which have only a local effect where they are applied (such as Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethyl cellulose; expanded poly-tetrafluoro ethylene; Oxidised regenerated cellulose) or fluid agents which diffuse to coat a larger surface area of the peritoneum (such as 4% icodextrin solution and 0.5% ferric hyaluranate gel). The chemical group of agents are more heterogenous and have an effect by chemically interfering with adhesio genesis. Examples include ani-inflammatory agents, anti-coagulants, anti-fibrotic agents and proteolytic agents.</P>
<P>This review is limited to the evaluation of intra-peritoneally applied membrane and fluid agents. Over the last five decades, more than a hundred different natural and synthetic agents have been evaluated in animal experiments for their prophylactic potential. While a large proportion of these pre-clinical studies have reported beneficial effects, only a few of these agents have been evaluated in clinical studies in humans. Most of the earlier studies in humans were initially in the context of gynaecological operations and are extensively reviewed elsewhere. It is only in the last decade that clinical studies evaluating prophylactic agents in general surgical operations started to emerge. To date, data on only two intra-peritoneal agents namely hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane and 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel is available, in the context of randomised controlled studies in general surgical operations. We found only a total of eight published randomised clinical trials of prophylactic agents, seven of which used hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane and one which reported on 0.5% ferric hyaluranate gel. The probable reason for the scarcity of published randomised trials in this field is, because of the fact that, assessing the efficacy of adhesion prevention involves a second invasive procedure such as laparoscopy or laparotomy, while assessing some of the outcomes such as the effect on intestinal obstruction needs long term follow up of the order of many years. This also probably accounts for the generally small numbers of patients recruited in individual studies as observed in the current review, in which, despite the fact that five of the seven included studies were multicentre studies, involving up to 22 centres, barring one study which recruited more than a thousand patients, the total patients recruited in the individual studies was low resulting in a median of 96 patients among the included studies. Absence of blinding in a trial is known to be a source of bias and causes overestimation of effects. Only four out of seven studies described blinded outcome assessment. Though blinding may be difficult to achieve in surgical patients because of the logistics involved and is likely to be more expensive to implement, it would be a worthwhile means to achieve more accurate results. None of the studies satisfied all the criteria for good quality studies as stated in the protocol. Five out of the seven studies were of intermediate quality, while the other two were considered poor quality mainly due to the high attrition rates in these studies. Trials in future, should aim to clearly state the methods used to randomise, to conceal allocation and to achieve blinding in more detail. Similarly, they should provide details of sample size calculations, should be adequately powered to answer the key questions being addressed by the study. Calculation of sample size and power should take into account the attrition of patients during the course of the study, which was unacceptably high in three of the seven studies included in the review. The lack of explicit definitions in the outcome in some studies and wide variations in the methods used to measure some of the outcomes (such as severity of adhesions) made comparisons amongst the studies difficult.</P>
<P>In a randomised clinical study, it is important that the intervention and the control group are otherwise treated identically. Most studies achieved this at the point of intervention and assessment. However, <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK>, had an initial phase in the study (phase I), where the intervention group were assessed early at 3 weeks while the control group were assessed between 6-12 weeks. Such differential treatment may potentially introduce bias and hence this phase of the study has been discounted when analysing outcomes such as leak rates. Variable follow up is another element which may potentially affect reporting of outcomes. As discussed in the section on methodological quality, there was a wide variation in follow up and in some studies there was lack of clarity as to the duration of follow up. There is a need for consensus among the researchers as to the minimum acceptable follow up period for various outcomes and future studies should aim to achieve this for all patients available for analysis in the intervention and the control groups.</P>
<P>When comparing the effect of membrane agents on leak rates, it may be more relevant to compare the rates between patients in whom the membrane was in contact with the anastomosis with those in whom it was not (the control group). However, this was not achieved in the studies that reported on leak rates. <LINK REF="STD-Becker-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Becker 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2005</LINK> used the membrane only in contact with the midline wound, while <LINK REF="STD-Tang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Tang 2003</LINK> used the membrane around the stoma. In <LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>, there were patients in the intervention group who did not have the membrane wrapped around the anastomosis. The leak rate for this subgroup was similar to the control group. But the leak rate was significantly higher for the subgroup which had the membrane wrapped around the anastomosis. Because the randomisation was not stratified by placement of the membrane, the differences could not be explored further. The leak rates were only compared between the intervention group as a whole and the control group and these were not significantly different.</P>
<P>The results of this review should be interpreted in the light of the shortcomings discussed above. In summary, from the available evidence, the use of Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethyl cellulose membrane reduced the incidence of adhesions [OR 0.15 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.43); p=0.0005] and was associated with a reduced extent of adhesions [WMD -25.9%(95%CI: -40.56, -11.26); p=0.0005] and severity of adhesions. However, the use of Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethyl cellulose membrane did not reduce the incidence of intestinal obstruction [odds ratio: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.34, 2.08)]. With respect to the incidence of adhesive intestinal obstruction (needing surgical intervention), there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups [Odds ratio: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.24, 2.7)].</P>
<P>On the basis of currently available evidence, Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethyl cellulose membrane has an acceptable safety profile.The overall morbidity and mortality were comparable between the hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose membrane groups and the control groups as was the specific morbidity such as wound infection, intra-abdominal sepsis, anastomotic leak and prolonged ileus. There are concerns regarding the higher incidence of anastomotic leak in a subgroup of patients where the membrane is directly wrapped around the anastomosis (<LINK REF="STD-Beck-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 2003</LINK>). However, this has not been specifically studied in a randomised trial.</P>
<P>No valid conclusions could be drawn on the efficacy of 0.5% ferric hyaluranate gel, the only other agent on which data relevant to the subject of this review is available. While there were no differences in the mortality rates between the intervention and control groups, there was a high incidence of overall morbidity in the intervention group [OR 5.04; 95%CI:1.1; 22.9]. While the rates of wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess and anastomotic leak were comparable, there was a higher incidence of ileus in the intervention group [OR: 9.29; 95% CI: 1.57, 54.77; p=0.01] .</P>

<P>Based on the currently available data considered in this systematic review, there is evidence that the use of HA/CMC membrane, reduces the incidence, extent and severity of adhesions. This may have implications in re-operative abdominal surgery in terms of time, ease of access, blood loss, visceral injury and cost, but these outcomes were beyond the remit of this review. With respect to symptomatic long term outcomes, however, there is currently no evidence that use of HA/CMC membrane, reduces the incidence of intestinal obstruction or the need for operative intervention in adhesive intestinal obstruction in the first few years following the index abdominal surgery. HA/CMC membrane appears to be safe, though there are concerns that it may increase the risk of anastomotic leak when wrapped around the anastomosis. Hence, in the absence of an ideal or alternative agent of proven efficacy in general surgical patients, HA/CMC may be considered in the prophylaxis of intra-peritoneal adhesions, at the discretion of the surgeon, tailored to the individual clinical context.</P>
<P>0.5% Ferric hyaluranate gel, has an unacceptably high morbidity, based on the limited data available, and hence cannot be recommended. </P>

<P>
<B>a. Evidence on effectiveness of other agents in general surgery<BR/>
</B>Currently Hyaluronic acid/Carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC) membrane remains the only agent on which evidence of effectiveness as an anti-adhesio genesic agent is available in general surgical patients. However, HA/CMC has certain shortcomings. It is suitable only for open surgery and it needs to be applied with some degree of precision on to the raw surfaces to be effective. It does not prevent adhesions in regions of the peritoneum which may harbour areas of injury not be macroscopically visible, areas which therefore, are not protected. Fluid agents such as 4% icodextrin circumvent many of these problems and there is evidence from at least one study in gynaecological surgery of its efficacy in preventing adhesions (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 2002</LINK>). Studies in general surgical operations are ongoing and would perhaps clarify its role in future. A plethora of other pharmacological and physical (membrane and fluid) agents have been shown to be effective in pre-clinical animal experiments, but only a selected few have been tested in human studies. Even fewer agents have been tried in randomised clinical trials, mostly in gynaecological surgery. Adequately powered, prospective, blinded, randomised controlled clinical trials in general surgical patients using agents which have proven efficacy in preclinical studies, may potentially uncover useful therapeutic options.<BR/>
<B>b. Evidence of synergism<BR/>
</B>The potential for synergistic effects of a combination of different types of adhesion prevention strategies, such as anti-inflammatory strategies, fibrinolytic strategies and barrier agents applied together has been demonstrated in animal experiments. The clinical value of using a combination of strategies in general surgical patients undergoing laparotomy may be worth investigating.<BR/>
<B>c. Evidence on other clinically important effects<BR/>
</B>Though it is evident that film barrier agents reduce the incidence and severity of adhesions, currently there is lack of evidence that this translates to a reduction in symptomatic long term outcomes such as incidence of intestinal obstruction and the proportion needing surgical intervention for adhesive obstruction. If there was indeed a small benefit from the barrier agents, which was missed in the available studies (type II error), then this will need a large, adequately powered study to uncover the effect. As adhesive disease is common, even small risk reductions have the potential to translate to significant benefits when applied on a global scale.The other clinically significant long term outcome is chronic pain, on which there is no data available at present on the efficacy of prophylactic agents in general surgical patients.<BR/>
<B>d. Evidence of effectiveness in a range of operations<BR/>
</B>Generalised peritonitis results in a higher incidence of adhesion related re-admission and re-operation. Data on safety and efficacy of anti-adhesio genetic agents used in the context of pathologies leading to generalised peritonitis is worth pursuing. Similarly use of prophylactic agents in other types of surgery such as small bowel resections for Crohns disease and a range of laparoscopic surgical procedures would be valuable. If noninvasive tools for evaluation of adhesions such as magnetic resonance imaging are validated in assessing adhesions then a broader range of surgical interventions and consequently a larger subgroup of patients could be studied.<BR/>
<B>e. Identification of high risk groups<BR/>
</B>It is known that adhesions and adhesion related complications are more frequent after certain types of surgery such as pelvic surgery. However, at present there is no validated system to identify individual patients with an increased risk of adhesions and related complications during the perioperative period. Future studies should focus on collecting good quality, prospective data (epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, cellular and biomolecular) which may then be used to predict the risk in individual patients. Risk prediction may help in prognostication, planning service needs and targeting anti-adhesive therapy.<BR/>
<B>f. Cost effectiveness<BR/>
</B>Economic analysis in the field of peritoneal adhesion prevention is understandably difficult for many reasons including controlling for the number of potential confounding factors in the perioperative period, the difficulty in measuring the economic impact accurately and the length of follow up required. Nevertheless as economic analysis may be useful in resource planning it is perhaps worthwhile exploring the cost effectiveness in a carefully chosen index procedure which is amenable to standardisation.</P>

<P>In the protocol it was stated that, for inclusion in the review, the length of follow up for studies reporting on long term outcomes should be at least 5 years. This was ideal. But among the available studies which satisfied all other criteria for inclusion, there were no studies with follow up of 5 years of more. Hence, in the review, it was decided to include studies even with a follow up shorter than the ideal of 5 years, as stated in the protocol. </P>
<P>Similarly, for studies reporting on short term outcomes, pertaining to safety, studies with a shorter follow up less than the ideal of 1 year, were also included in the review. </P>
