<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Laser photocoagulation for treating choroidal new vessels near the centre of the retina in people with high myopia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In people with high myopia (refractive error -6 diopters or worse) new blood vessels can grow under the retina of the eye (choroidal neovascularisation). For decades laser coagulation has been used to destroy lesions that are not central. This review found one small study, including 70 participants, which compared laser photocoagulation with no treatment for people with this disease. This study was inadequately reported and analysed, although it suggested a benefit with photocoagulation during the first two years of follow up. Another small study compared three laser wavelengths to achieve photocoagulation of the lesion, but actually had very little power to demonstrate a difference between them as only 27 participants were included. Therefore, despite its widespread use for many years, the amount of benefit achieved with photocoagulation and the possibility that it is maintained over the years remains unknown. Furthermore, these and other studies suggest that the enlargement of the laser scar could be a potentially vision-threatening long-term complication after two years, since it may cause the gradual occurrence of a blind spot in the centre of the visual field due to progressive atrophy of the retina.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Pathologic myopia is usually defined as the need for a spectacle correction of -6 diopters or higher. Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is the most commonly occurring cause of visual loss in people with pathologic myopia. In myopic macular degeneration the occurrence of newly formed vessels in the macula often leads to a fibrotic pigmented scar causing a blind spot in the centre of the visual field. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to examine the effects of laser photocoagulation for CNV associated with pathologic myopia. A secondary objective was to compare the effects of different photocoagulation techniques. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-21 18:24:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2007), EMBASE (1980 to March 2007), LILACS (March 2007) and reference lists of identified trial reports.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing photocoagulation with observation or comparing different photocoagulation techniques in people with CNV associated with myopia of -6 diopters or higher.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the search results for eligibility. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies were included that enrolled people with CNV located at 100 microns or more from the foveal centre. One study compared photocoagulation with observation. At the final examination, 16/35 participants randomised to photocoagulation versus 31/35 randomised to observation had visual acuity of 20/100 or worse after six to 48 months. The second study randomised 27 eyes (26 participants) to photocoagulation with three laser wavelengths (nine eyes per group). The number of eyes losing two or more lines was two (577 nm), three (590 nm) and three (620 nm) after three to 17 months. In both studies comparisons were made using outcomes assessed at the final examination. As the final examination took place at different follow-up times it was difficult to interpret the findings and it was impossible to extract data for further analyses. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Despite its use over several years the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for myopic CNV has not been established. Although there was a suggestion of short-term effectiveness in one small study on non-subfoveal CNV the results were potentially biased. Observational studies suggest that the enlargement of the atrophic laser scar after laser treatment of non-subfoveal CNV could be a potentially vision-threatening long-term complication, even in eyes free of CNV recurrence.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Introduction</HEADING>
<P>Myopia, commonly called short-sightedness, is characterised by the need for optical correction with lenses of negative power to achieve maximum distance visual acuity. Several ocular diseases such as retinal detachment, glaucoma and, in particular, choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), are more common in people with higher levels of myopic refractive error (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrick 2002</LINK>). Choroidal neovascularisation is the occurrence of newly formed vessels in the macula that often leads to a fibrotic pigmented scar causing a blind spot in the centre of the visual field.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The prevalence of any level of myopia varies among different ethnic groups. Its prevalence in the US was about 25% in one study (<LINK REF="REF-Sperduto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sperduto 1983</LINK>) whereas a recent review reported values as high as 70% to 90% in Asian populations (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrick 2002</LINK>). In a multicentre study in the US myopia was four times more prevalent in children of Asian descent than in white children (<LINK REF="REF-Kleinstein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinstein 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The degenerative form of myopia, called high or pathologic myopia (PM), is associated with potentially blinding conditions such as retinal detachment, macular degeneration and glaucoma. Pathologic myopia has been defined in recent reviews as a refractive error of at least -6 diopters (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrick 2002</LINK>) or -8 diopters (<LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>). Complications of pathologic myopia may occur at lower levels but they are more common when refractive error is -8 diopters or worse (<LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of PM has been reported to be up to 2% in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Sperduto-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sperduto 1983</LINK>) but it is much more common in Asian countries. In Eastern Europe 1% of the population is affected by myopia of at least -6 diopters and up to 8% of the Japanese population is affected (<LINK REF="REF-Fredrick-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fredrick 2002</LINK>). In a survey of 11,000 students aged 18 in Taiwan myopia of at least -6 diopters was found in 24% of girls and 18% of boys (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2001</LINK>). The prevalence of a defect of -8 diopters or more is 0.2% to 0.4% in the US and 1% of the general population in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Pathologic myopia is associated with excessive and progressive elongation of the eyeball. This results in a variety of fundus changes such as hypopigmentation, tilted optic nerve and lacquer cracks (breaks in Bruch's membrane), with or without posterior staphyloma (deformity of the eyeball profile at the posterior pole) (<LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>). As elongation of the globe is a key feature of PM an axial length of 26 mm or 27 mm has been adopted as a biometric definition (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>). A value of 26.5 mm or more has been adopted as an inclusion criterion in a recent therapeutic randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-VIP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pathologic myopia is an important cause of blindness and visual impairment, especially in the 50 to 75 years age range (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klaver-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klaver 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicolosi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicolosi 1994</LINK>). Choroidal neovascularisation is the most common vision-threatening macular complication observed clinically in PM; for example, PM was found to be the cause of CNV in 60% of people under the age of 50 who were seen at a referral clinic (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>As for age-related macular degeneration, CNV associated with PM may become bilateral. In a study of 325 highly myopic eyes of 218 participants, approximately one in 10 developed myopic CNV in 130 months average follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Ohno_x002d_Matsui-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohno-Matsui 2003</LINK>). The incidence of CNV in the fellow eyes of participants with pre-existing myopic CNV was significantly higher than that in eyes of participants without pre-existing CNV (35% compared to 6%). Lacquer cracks at the macula were a risk factor for this event. Combining the overall 10% cumulative incidence estimate from this study with the prevalent number of people with myopia -8 diopters of more reported in <LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>, an approximate 11-year cumulative incidence rate of two to four per 10,000 would be obtained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Early symptoms of CNV include blurred central vision and metamorphopsia (objects appear distorted) (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1986</LINK>). Although CNV due to PM is usually associated with less retinal destruction than in age-related macular degeneration the disease carries a substantial risk of severe visual loss. Visual acuity will become 6/60 (20/200) or worse in 40% to 75% of affected eyes within a few years from the first diagnosis of CNV (<LINK REF="REF-Fleury-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fleury 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hampton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hotchkiss-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hotchkiss 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Secr_x00e9_tan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Secrétan 1997</LINK>). The visual prognosis is worse among patients aged 50 or more (<LINK REF="REF-Tabandeh-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabandeh 1999</LINK>). People with bilateral CNV usually have a level of central visual loss that causes impairment of activities such as reading, driving, recognising faces and finding small objects. Orientation is usually mildly or not impaired except in the most severe cases. The disease may have a substantial economic impact on individuals and families because most people affected are of working age.</P>
<P>Choroidal neovascularisation in PM is usually readily diagnosed with fundus examination. The CNV is often seen as a subretinal elevation with a varying degree of hyperpigmentation that may be associated with subretinal fluid and haemorrhage. After several months the CNV often evolves to a macular fibrotic scar. In the long-term a large area of chorioretinal atrophy centred in the macula may occur around the central hyperpigmented CNV, a picture called Foster Fuchs' spot (<LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>). Fluorescein angiography is necessary for diagnosis when CNV is suspected on the basis of symptoms and fundus examination. It usually shows a hyperfluorescent spot corresponding to the CNV that leaks dye during the exam. Fluorescein leakage is usually mild with respect to lesions seen in age-related macular degeneration and it is more evident in recent and active than in scarred lesions (<LINK REF="REF-Avila-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avila 1984</LINK>). Moreover, fluorescein angiography provides more accurate information about the location of the CNV with respect to the centre of the macula, called foveola and commonly identified as the centre of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). The proximity of the CNV border to the centre of the FAZ is the main criterion used for anatomical classification of myopic CNV. Only lesions that are not subfoveal are usually considered for photocoagulation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment options</HEADING>
<P>During the last three decades laser photocoagulation has been the only effective means of treating CNV associated with PM and age-related macular degeneration. Its effectiveness in the latter disease was demonstrated by the studies of the Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) Group (<LINK REF="REF-MPS-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MPS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1993</LINK>). Its use in subfoveal lesions has been limited to a few select cases and only in patients with age-related macular degeneration (<LINK REF="REF-MPS-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1991b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MPS-1991c" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1991c</LINK>) because normal retinal tissue is also destroyed at the treatment site causing an absolute scotoma. Since myopic CNV has been reported to be subfoveal in ½ to ¾ of eyes at presentation (<LINK REF="REF-Hampton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hampton 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soubrane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soubrane 1986</LINK>) photocoagulation can rarely be applied.</P>
<P>Recently, photodynamic therapy has greatly expanded the possibility of safely treating myopic CNV. However, the randomised controlled trial that evaluated photodynamic therapy for myopic CNV had limited power to truly assess its effectiveness due to its limited sample size (<LINK REF="REF-VIP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-VIP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">VIP 2003</LINK>). Other treatment modalities, such as submacular surgery or macular translocation (<LINK REF="REF-Adelberg-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adelberg 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tano-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tano 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1994</LINK>), have not gained popularity because their effectiveness has never been demonstrated in large randomised controlled studies and because of safety concerns. Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), which aims at closing choroidal vessels by creating a mild hyperthermia, has been used for treating myopic CNV in a case series study (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Rationale for a systematic review</HEADING>
<P>Photodynamic therapy has become the main technique for treating CNV associated with PM, due to the fact that most lesions are subfoveal at presentation. The role of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of juxtafoveal and extrafoveal CNV needs to be assessed because no standard approach exists despite widespread clinical use of the technique.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review was to examine the effects of laser photocoagulation for choroidal neovascularisation associated with pathologic myopia. A secondary objective was to compare the effects of different photocoagulation techniques. </P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants in the trials were people affected by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to pathologic myopia. There was no age restriction. Pathologic myopia was defined as refractive error of at least -6 diopters; pseudophakic eyes and eyes with spherical equivalent -4 to -6 diopters were included only if it was stated that typical myopic fundus changes were present, defined as follows: tilted disc, fundus hypopigmentation, lacquer cracks, areas of chorioretinal atrophy at the posterior pole, posterior staphyloma. As an alternative inclusion criterion a statement was required that an axial length of at least 26 mm was measured. </P>
<P>As the location with respect to the fovea has been demonstrated to be critical in the treatment of CNV associated with other diseases (<LINK REF="REF-MPS-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MPS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MPS 1993</LINK>), wherever possible we have reported separately on lesions at different distances from the fovea. The location was classified as extrafoveal, juxtafoveal and subfoveal, as defined in the 'Methods' section.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included trials in which laser photocoagulation was compared with no treatment or sham treatment. We also included trials that compared the different photocoagulation techniques, for example, different laser wavelengths. Any type of laser photocoagulation was considered whether directed to the entire CNV or to part of it, such as is done with grid photocoagulation or feeder vessel photocoagulation. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-10-21 18:19:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Preservation of vision-related quality of life (QOL) is the main goal of any treatment. However, most studies on photocoagulation for neovascular maculopathies were conducted before QOL instruments were developed. For this reason, visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were considered as primary outcome measures and QOL has been considered as a secondary outcome. Standard instruments to measure visual acuity and contrast sensitivity have been available since the early 1980s (<LINK REF="REF-Ferris-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferris 1982</LINK>). Both measures have been shown to be highly correlated with vision-related QOL as assessed by questionnaires in later studies (<LINK REF="REF-Mangione-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClure-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2000</LINK>). The lack of standard instruments also makes it difficult to report on reading ability, which represents one of the principal tasks allowed by central vision. Reading difficulty has been the first complaint reported by participants with visual loss in a QOL study (<LINK REF="REF-Mangione-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangione 1998</LINK>) and it was strongly associated with QOL in another (<LINK REF="REF-McClure-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2000</LINK>).<BR/>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2008-10-21 18:19:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The primary outcomes for this review were as follows.</P>
<P>(1) Visual acuity. This is usually measured with a standard chart, the ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart, and scored in letters. There are five letters per line in this chart. Both dichotomous outcomes, such as moderate (3 lines or 15 ETDRS letters) and severe (6 lines or 30 ETDRS letters) visual loss and continuous measures (mean visual acuity) were extracted when possible. For studies that did not use ETDRS charts, visual acuity was converted to logMAR (logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) for pooling data. This was necessary because one logMAR unit, but not one unit of the Snellen or decimal scales, corresponds to an identical percentage change of the psychophysical phenomenon of interest, the Minimum Angle of Resolution (MAR). In particular, a 0.1 logMAR increase corresponds to a 26% increase of the MAR.</P>
<P>(2) Contrast sensitivity. This is usually measured with the Pelli-Robson chart. Scores are collected in letters or as the logarithm of contrast sensitivity. The latter was used for pooling data when feasible.</P>

<I>Anatomic outcomes</I>
</HEADING>
<P>Two outcomes that are expected to be associated with visual loss were evaluated:<BR/>(1) rate of CNV recurrence or persistence after photocoagulation;<BR/>(2) rate of CNV invasion of the FAZ centre in eyes with non-subfoveal CNV which had recurrence or persistence of the lesion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects (severe, minor)</HEADING>
<P>Inadvertent photocoagulation of the foveola is a rare but known complication of CNV photocoagulation that can cause immediate visual loss. Early visual loss with respect to the control group is the major complication of photocoagulation in these cases. Another event leading to immediate visual loss soon after photocoagulation is subretinal haemorrhage. Laser scar expansion is a recognised late complication of CNV photocoagulation in PM (<LINK REF="REF-Brancato-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brancato 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because the main adverse effect of photocoagulation, independently of the mechanism, is visual loss the comparison of treated and control eyes, especially during the first months and for subfoveal lesions, is useful to evaluate safety.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Economic data</HEADING>
<P>Data on costs sustained during the studies were described where available. Since no or minimal data were expected from clinical studies those modelling cost-effectiveness of laser photocoagulation were incorporated in the 'Discussion' section of the review.</P>

<B>
<I>Follow up</I>
</B>
</P>
<P>A follow up of two years was considered sufficient for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment. Data up to five years were collected if available. Outcomes were assessed at three and six months to evaluate effectiveness but also to detect early adverse effects due to treatment, especially in cases with subfoveal lesions. Thereafter, treatment outcomes were summarised yearly from one year after the first treatment.</P>

We considered four parameters of quality: allocation concealment; masking of participants and researchers to the assigned intervention; masking of people assessing outcome; and similarity of rates of follow up and compliance in the treatment and control group and the analysis of participants as randomised (intention-to-treat-analysis). These parameters refer respectively to the following types of possible bias: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and attrition bias. Each parameter of trial quality was graded: A (adequate); B (unclear); or C (inadequate). We contacted study authors for clarification on any item graded B. Authors were not masked to the report authors and trial results during the assessment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Extraction of study characteristics</HEADING>
<P>The following details of the studies were extracted and described in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Methods</I>
</B>
<BR/>We reported on methods of allocation and on those used to ensure masking (including masking of participants, providers and of those who assessed the outcome). The number of participants excluded after randomisation as well as losses to follow up and compliance were summarised when available.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Participants</I>
</B>
<BR/>We described the country where participants enrolled; their ethnicity; number randomised; age; sex; main inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>
<P>Myopic CNV is classic and thus its borders are well defined in most cases. We have not taken into account lesion type but only its location with respect to the FAZ centre. Nonetheless, subretinal blood, commonly associated with CNV, was considered a lesion component when extracting data on the location of the neovascular lesion with respect to the foveal centre. The following definitions were adopted:</P>
<P>(1) extrafoveal lesion: posterior edge of the lesion 200 microns or more from the centre of the FAZ;<BR/>(2) juxtafoveal lesion: posterior edge of the lesion between 1 and 199 microns from the centre of the FAZ;<BR/>(3) subfoveal lesion: lesion involving the centre of the FAZ.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Interventions</I>
</B>
<BR/>We aimed to provide a description of the photocoagulation technique adopted in the study, particularly with respect to laser wavelength and laser settings allowed in the study (laser power, spot size and duration). We expected that direct treatment of the entire lesion was administered but we also considered any studies that used other types of photocoagulation that had been employed in age-related macular degeneration, such as perifoveolar, grid or feeder vessel treatment.</P>
<P>We reported on the modalities with which the sham (control) treatment was performed, when applicable. If a different photocoagulation technique was used as a control both techniques were described. Criteria used to decide whether and when to apply further photocoagulation, such as follow-up schedule and criteria for evaluation of treatment success (usually absence of dye leakage with fluorescein angiography), were summarised if possible.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Outcomes</I>
</B>
<BR/>We collected data relating to the following outcomes: visual acuity; contrast sensitivity; reading ability; and performance in real-world or laboratory vision-related tasks. As vision-related QOL questionnaires were developed only recently we did not expect this type of outcome measure to be found.</P>
<P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data extraction and entry</HEADING>
<P>Both authors extracted data. Mean and standard deviations were obtained for continuous variables such as logMAR visual acuity, the logarithm of contrast sensitivity, reading acuity in logMAR, and reading speed as the logarithm of words read in a minute. The proportion of participants suffering from each adverse event was recorded for dichotomous outcomes, specifically the proportion of participants suffering from a loss of at least three lines or at least six lines of visual acuity. Means were computed from frequency distributions when only the latter were available. Individuals rather than eyes were the unit of analysis. If data were missing or difficult to determine from a paper we approached the study authors for more information.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The data reported in the two studies could not be used for further analyses in this review such as calculating relative risk of visual loss and its confidence intervals. If adequate trials are identified in the future to allow data synthesis we will use the following methods.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data we will present the relative risk. The risk difference or the number needed to treat will also be given. For continuous data we will calculate the mean difference or the difference between treated and control arms weighted by the inverse of the variance. If the outcome was measured using different instruments but they are similar enough to be combined we will present the standardised mean difference. We will only analyse the means if the data are approximately normally distributed. Confidence intervals at 95% level will be reported for all summary measures.</P>
<P>We anticipate that there might be heterogeneity between studies and that this heterogeneity might be due to differences in study design and quality and differences in the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation in the different study populations. We will estimate the level of heterogeneity using the I<SUP>2</SUP> value (calculated in RevMan). If substantial heterogeneity is detected (a high I<SUP>2</SUP> value) we will pool the results of the studies if examination of the forest plot indicates that the individual trial results are all consistent in the direction of the effect (that is, the odds ratios and confidence intervals largely fall on one side of the null line).</P>
<P>If further studies are identified in future and there are sufficient trials, we will explore sources of heterogeneity using the following five parameters:<BR/>(1) study quality;<BR/>(2) distance of the lesion from the foveola (subfoveal, juxtafoveal, extrafoveal);<BR/>(3) age;<BR/>(4) ethnic composition of the study population. Geographic area where the trial is conducted (Asia versus Europe and Northern America) will be used as a proxy of racial setting when this is not reported;<BR/>(5) baseline visual acuity.</P>
<P>We will use the following models for calculating summary measures:<BR/>(1) fixed-effect model when three or fewer trials are identified. We will compare the fixed-effect and random-effects models in this case;<BR/>(2) random-effects model when more than three trials are identified. We will check that the funnel plot is symmetric.</P>
<P>We will conduct sensitivity analyses with the following adjustments:<BR/>(1) excluding studies of lower methodological quality (graded C on any parameter);<BR/>(2) excluding unpublished studies;<BR/>(3) excluding industry-funded studies;<BR/>(4) excluding studies that have assumed that eyes within an individual are independent.</P>

<P>The initial electronic searches identified 458 reports of studies. Both authors screened the titles and abstracts and identified two studies involving participants with myopic CNV (<LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soubrane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soubrane 1986</LINK>). We obtained the full copies of both study reports. The authors knew of a further study that met their inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK>) which was not found in the electronic searches. This was later identified as a subsequent publication of the <LINK REF="REF-Soubrane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soubrane 1986</LINK> study. Thus two studies were included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK>) (<I>see</I> '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>').</P>

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>We contacted study authors to obtain further information concerning assignment and concealment of allocation from participants, physicians and outcome assessors.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK> reported that randomisation was based on a list of random numbers and that the treating physician was informed of the allocation only after enrolment by other study personnel. Masking of participants and visual outcome assessors was achieved because they were not aware of the wavelength used. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK> reported that allocation concealment was adequately obtained using a list of random numbers and sealed envelopes. No sham procedure was adopted. Thus, participants were not masked to allocation but visual outcome assessors were unaware of assignment.</P>
<P>Due to the potential bias introduced by comparing individuals with outcomes assessed at different follow up times, the data reported in the two studies could not be used for further analyses in this review such as calculating relative risk of visual loss and its confidence intervals. Specifically, both <LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK> compared initial and final visual acuity, thus not taking into account the fact that length of follow up varied markedly at the last examination. Although the mean follow-up was similar for treated and control eyes the potential for differential bias due to this approximation cannot be ascertained. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Since we could not compute risk ratios or differences in means of visual outcome variables no comparison tables were constructed. A summary of the results is presented below and in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK> there were nine participants per group that were assigned to treatment with 577 nm, 590 nm or 620 nm laser wavelengths. The authors reported a worsening of two or more Snellen lines in two, three and three participants in the groups respectively at the last examination. There was an improvement of two or more lines in one, two and two eyes in the three groups respectively. Thirteen out of 27 eyes suffered from CNV recurrence overall, of which five became subfoveal. Recurrences were four, four and five for the three wavelengths respectively. Subfoveal invasion was detected in one, one and three eyes in the groups. Follow up varied from three to 17 months. Therefore, follow up may have been insufficient to study a clinically relevant part of the course of CNV associated with PM. For the three wavelength groups, in the same order as cited above, median (minimum-maximum) follow up in months was six (three to 12), five (four to 17) and eight (three to 10) respectively.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK> reported that 18/35 treated eyes versus 16/35 observed eyes had an initial visual acuity of 20/100 (12/60 or 0.7 logMAR) or worse. Baseline visual acuity was reported to be similar in the two groups. The correspondent final values were 16/35 treated eyes and 31/35 control eyes after 6 to 48 months, when all eyes were still followed. Final visual acuity was reported to differ between treated and control eyes (P = 0.01 in favour of photocoagulation). A favourable effect was also reported for reading acuity because 16/35 treated eyes and only 2/35 control eyes could read a Parinaud 2 character at the last examination. Final reading acuity was reported to be better for treated eyes (P &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The difference in visual acuity was not significant at the second time point (36 to 72 months), but almost half of the participants assigned to observation were lost to follow up. This study did not report on anatomic outcomes such as rate of recurrence or subfoveal invasion.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Given the insufficient data reporting and the small size of the two randomised controlled studies in this review the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation for treating myopic non-subfoveal CNV remains unestablished.</P>
<P>Individual patient data were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Brancato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Brancato 1988</LINK>. However, only initial and final visual acuity were reported. Therefore, it was impossible to extract sufficient data for comparisons at fixed time intervals as per protocol. Furthermore, the small number of eyes assigned to the three wavelengths (nine per group) allowed for little power to detect even clinically meaningful differences in visual and anatomic outcomes. The follow up was also too short to allow for a sufficient part of the disease course to be observed. Follow up was always less than two years, the limit considered appropriate in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK> conducted analyses of their sample in 1985 and then in 1990. Follow up at the first time-point varied markedly. Survival analysis can take account of loss to follow up, provided that patients enrolled during a certain period are carried on to the date representing the end of the study. Under such a design it is unlikely that other factors potentially associated with treatment are responsible for loss to follow up. However, such analysis was not available in this publication. Furthermore, in 1990 a differential loss of control participants was reported. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Secr_x00e9_tan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Secrétan 1997</LINK> is the largest retrospective, observational controlled study published on this treatment modality of myopic CNV. It included lesions that were 100 to 400 microns from the FAZ centre. Fifty eyes treated with photocoagulation were compared with 50 controls. Observational studies are prone to several sources of bias, especially if retrospective. In <LINK REF="REF-Secr_x00e9_tan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Secrétan 1997</LINK> there was an imbalance of baseline visual acuity, which was significantly worse in untreated eyes. The authors tried to reduce bias with stratified analyses by baseline visual acuity group. They found a significant difference in favour of photocoagulation at two years. No difference was found at five years, a pattern that is similar to that in one randomised study included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Fardeau-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Fardeau 1992</LINK>). While comparisons between groups can be biased in an observational study it may be useful to provide other types of data, such as on safety. In <LINK REF="REF-Secr_x00e9_tan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Secrétan 1997</LINK>, CNV recurrence was 72% at five years among treated eyes, with 64% of eyes having a dry scar at the last examination. The mean largest linear diameter of laser scar in disc diameters increased from 0.38 mm at baseline to 0.83 mm at one year, up to 1.56 mm at five years for those who needed only one laser. For eyes with recurrence, these values were 0.47 mm, 1.27 mm and 1.72 mm respectively. Although visual prognosis was not correlated to laser scar enlargement, this complication of photocoagulation could be a cause of delayed visual loss. The risk of inadvertent photocoagulation of the foveola with immediate visual loss is also unknown.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Laser photocoagulation of CNV that does not involve the fovea has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further visual loss in age-related macular degeneration and in other types of CNV. However, its effectiveness for treatment of CNV associated with pathologic myopia is only presumptive, despite its widespread use during the last three decades. Observational studies suggest that the enlargement of the laser scar might lead to retinal pigment epithelial atrophy involving the foveal centre in the long-term, a picture similar to the natural course in some eyes affected by this disease. When ophthalmologists offer laser photocoagulation as a treatment option for myopic patients with non-subfoveal CNV they should state that it is able to anatomically stop the lesion growth in some cases, but that the balance between the possible resulting visual benefit and harm is unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Any future randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of photocoagulation for non-subfoveal myopic CNV should include photodynamic therapy rather than observation as the comparison group. This allows for some visual benefit in patients with subfoveal lesions, a more frequent type of myopic CNV. However, it is unlikely that such studies will be conducted given the availability of new pharmacological therapies for treatment of choroidal neovascularization and the resulting tendency to consider laser photocoagulation obsolete.</P>
