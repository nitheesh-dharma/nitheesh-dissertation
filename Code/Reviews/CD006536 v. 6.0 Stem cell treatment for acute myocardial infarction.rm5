<DESCRIPTION>
<P>The searches from 2011 were re-run in March 2015.</P>
<P>This is a major update, which includes 41 independent trials. Two trials that were included in the previous version of the review are now excluded since the co-intervention of G-CSF was only administered to the intervention arm (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>). One trial that was previously included is now defined as awaiting classification as this trial did not publish any data that could be incorporated into the analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Pereira-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Pereira 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In this update we have revised the primary and secondary outcomes, which now focus on clinical outcomes as well as the surrogate endpoint of left ventricular ejection fraction. Multiple intervention arm trials are now pooled throughout the review, avoiding double counting of controls. In light of the potential sources of heterogeneity, meta-analyses using random-effects models are now performed throughout.</P>

<P>This update includes 11 new trials and the conclusions of the review have changed. We no longer find evidence of an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction associated with stem cell therapy. Meta-analyses of the increased number of trials in this update have failed to find any evidence of differences in clinical outcomes between treatment groups. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect of stem cell therapy for acute myocardial infarction patients.</P>

<P>
<B>Review question: </B>Are bone marrow cells safe and effective as a treatment following a heart attack?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Currently the standard treatment for people suffering a heart attack (due to a blockage in the artery supplying blood to the heart) is direct opening of the artery with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty and introduction of a small tube (called a stent) into the artery to keep it open. The use of primary angioplasty and stents to reopen the blocked artery can lead to a 35% reduction in the mortality (death rate) associated with this condition. In recent years, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a potential treatment. They may prevent the damage to the heart muscle caused by a heart attack, when used in addition to the treatment offered by primary angioplasty and standard medical therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> Randomised trials comparing bone marrow-derived cells with no cells in patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were eligible for this review. We searched databases to March 2015. This review was supported by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) through its Cochrane Incentive Award programme.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> In this updated systematic review we analysed data from a total of 41 trials with over 2700 patients. Evaluation of the currently available evidence indicates that this treatment may not lead to improvement when compared to standard treatment, as measured by the frequency of deaths, heart attacks and/or heart failure requiring re-hospitalisation following treatment, as well as tests of heart function, in the short and long term.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence for primary outcomes:</B> The evidence in this review is of moderate quality due to the small number of events.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently screened all references, assessed the risk of bias of the included trials and extracted data. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models throughout. We analysed outcomes at short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term (12 months or more) follow-up. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes are reported as mean difference (MD) or standardised MD (SMD). We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the results in the context of the risk of selection, performance and attrition bias. Exploratory subgroup analysis investigated the effects of baseline cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF) and cell dose, type and timing of administration, as well as the use of heparin in the final cell solution.<BR/>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:25:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty-one RCTs with a total of 2732 participants (1564 cell therapy, 1168 controls) were eligible for inclusion. Cell treatment was not associated with any changes in the risk of all-cause mortality (34/538 versus 32/458; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.50; 996 participants; 14 studies; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), cardiovascular mortality (23/277 versus 18/250; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.99; 527 participants; nine studies; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>) or a composite measure of mortality, reinfarction and re-hospitalisation for heart failure (24/262 versus 33/235; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10; 497 participants; six studies; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>) at long-term follow-up. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I<I>
<SUP>2 </SUP>
</I>= 0% to 12%). Serious periprocedural adverse events were rare and were generally unlikely to be related to cell therapy. Additionally, cell therapy had no effect on morbidity, quality of life/performance or LVEF measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Meta-analyses of LVEF measured by echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography and left ventricular angiography showed evidence of differences in mean LVEF between treatment groups although the mean differences ranged between 2% and 5%, which are accepted not to be clinically relevant. Results were robust to the risk of selection, performance and attrition bias from individual studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence for a beneficial effect of cell therapy for AMI patients. However, most of the evidence comes from small trials that showed no difference in clinically relevant outcomes. Further adequately powered trials are needed and until then the efficacy of this intervention remains unproven.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-18 16:40:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite major advances in treatment regimes, ischaemic heart disease remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-BHF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHF 2014</LINK>). In the UK alone there are more than 2.3 million people living with ischaemic heart disease, causing approximately 153 deaths for every 100,000 people and representing a substantial cost to our healthcare system (<LINK REF="REF-BHF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHF 2014</LINK>). For example, more than GBP 6.8 billion was spent on treating the disease within NHS England in 2012/2013 (<LINK REF="REF-BHF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHF 2014</LINK>). The main symptom of ischaemic heart disease is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) most often occurs when there is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque into a coronary artery, which may cause thrombosis and occlusion of the artery, stopping the blood supply in that region of the heart and causing necrosis of the affected area (<LINK REF="REF-Falk-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falk 1995</LINK>). Subsequently, both infarcted and unaffected myocardium undergo adverse remodelling that can sometimes extend to the entire ventricular wall. The first changes occur almost immediately after coronary occlusion and lead to loss of contractility, followed by the growth of the necrotic areas in the following days. The infarcted region would have healed after two to three months, leaving a scar (fibrotic, non-contracting region) in the ventricular wall (<LINK REF="REF-ESC_x002f_ACC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESC/ACC 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Current medical treatment can ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. First thrombolytic therapy and, most recently, primary angioplasty have become the standard treatment choice for those suffering from AMI. However, although optimal medical therapy reduces mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hartwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartwell 2005</LINK>), patients continue to face risks of heart failure following heart attacks (<LINK REF="REF-Velagaleti-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Velagaleti 2008</LINK>). Therefore, the search for treatment options that prevent this adverse ventricular remodelling following AMI has been at the forefront of clinical research in cardiology.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:29:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For more than a decade cell therapies have been developed as new treatments for patients suffering from AMI (<LINK REF="REF-Strauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauer 2002</LINK>). The first non-randomised trials demonstrated the feasibility of infusing bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNC) into the infarcted area of the myocardium via the infarct-related artery (IRA) using a procedure similar to percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI (<LINK REF="REF-Assmus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Assmus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_Aviles-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez-Aviles 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tse-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tse 2003</LINK>). This was later expanded to the direct injection of cells into the ischaemic cardiac muscle during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 2003</LINK>). The study by Stamm in 2003 administered bone marrow-derived CD133<SUP>+</SUP> haematopoietic progenitor cells and showed that these cells could improve revascularisation of the infarcted myocardium (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 2003</LINK>). The success of these first trials resulted in a number of larger randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) world-wide (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grajek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Grajek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Janssens 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lunde-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lunde 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roncalli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Roncalli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachinger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schachinger 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00fc_rder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sürder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Traverse-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Traverse 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Traverse-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Traverse 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Traverse-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Traverse 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wohrle-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wohrle 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wollert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2009</LINK>). To date, the majority of RCTs infuse a pool of BMMNC, but recently the first placebo-controlled study comparing enriched CD34<SUP>+</SUP> haematopoietic progenitor cells with non-selected BMMNC has been published (<LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>). In addition, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) have been also tested in the clinic as a treatment for AMI (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bone marrow harvest, containing the mononuclear cells and a small proportion of stem/progenitor cells (e.g. CD34<SUP>+</SUP> or CD133<SUP>+</SUP> enriched progenitor cells), is undertaken by a haematologist, whilst a specialised technician or scientist undertakes the isolation of the mononuclear cells or the selection of stem/progenitor cells. Finally, the cardiologist undertakes the infusion or injection of the cells.</P>
<P>Bone marrow harvest and isolation of BMMNC is a standard procedure in bone marrow transplantation for haematological malignancies. Cell transplantation in the context of heart disease is not currently available as standard clinical practice. The treatment is only available in research-associated facilities, whilst its safety and efficacy is tested, but it is conceivable that this procedure may be available to all myocardial infarction patients, if long-term effectiveness, prevention of heart failure and reduced morbidity are demonstrated.</P>
<P>The procedure at the current time is as follows: the bone marrow is harvested under general anaesthesia from the pelvic bone of the recipient using large suction needles. Thereafter, the BMMNC, CD34<SUP>+</SUP> or CD133<SUP>+</SUP> haematopoietic progenitor cells (BM-HPCs) are enriched away from other bone marrow cells in sterile conditions by a specialised technician or scientist. The bone marrow harvest and separation of stem cells may take several hours. Unlike BMMNC, BM-MSC have to be cultured in the laboratory for two to four weeks to obtain a large enough number of cells prior to their administration. The enriched or cultured cell populations are infused directly into the recipient's heart by a cardiologist during angioplasty (e.g. PCI) with a catheter allowing the administration of cells in a stop-flow technique via a special balloon catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Strauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauer 2002</LINK>). The time interval between the removal of the cells from the participant and their reinfusion varies.</P>
<P>The costs of the intervention may be high depending on the procedures used, and currently relate to the costs of the cell procedure (cell harvest) and the costs of the isolation of the stem/progenitor cells (approximately a 10th of the cost of the trial) or the cost of culturing cells in a dish.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Regardless of intensive preclinical and clinical research in the field in the past decade, the mode of action of cell therapies has remained unclear or at least controversial. Although transplanted cells are thought to benefit heart function through direct mechanisms, such as homing to the site of injury and differentiating into neighbouring cardiac tissues (<LINK REF="REF-Leri-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leri 2009</LINK>), there is growing evidence that their benefit might be indirect. There is presently a shift in the regenerative concept of cell therapies in heart disease towards the hypothesis that cell-based therapies primarily have a paracrine effect (for review see <LINK REF="REF-Bartunek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartunek 2010</LINK>;

<P>In 2004, the first RCTs administering cell therapies as a treatment for AMI were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wollert 2004</LINK>). Two years later, the number of RCTs published had increased significantly (<LINK REF="STD-Ge-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ge 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssens-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Janssens 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karpov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karpov 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lunde-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lunde 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachinger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schachinger 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wollert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wollert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2006</LINK>). The first version of this review evaluated the clinical evidence from 13 RCTs, the majority of which had short-term follow-up (e.g. less than six months follow-up) (<LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008b</LINK>). Those first-generation clinical trials were not powered to assess the effect of cell therapies on clinical outcomes such as mortality. The main aim of those trials was to assess the safety of the intervention and the benefit of the treatment, measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as surrogate outcome. We defined safety as the absence of adverse events (e.g. increased mortality and morbidity, increased risk of secondary infarction, restenosis and arrhythmias, development of heart failure) and efficacy as improvement in cardiac function associated with cell therapy.</P>
<P>The second version of this review, <LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>, evaluated 33 RCTs and long-term follow-up data had started to emerge (<LINK REF="STD-Cao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grajek-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Grajek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meluzin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meluzin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Penicka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Penicka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Piepoli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Piepoli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhukova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhukova 2009</LINK>). In that update of the review we included 20 new studies. Unlike other systematic reviews where a total of 50 trials were assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Jeevanantham-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeevanantham 2012</LINK>), our systematic review was the first to determine that there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of mortality between treated participants and controls (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is currently a high degree of uncertainty about the beneficial effect of cell therapies as treatment for AMI. Both RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lunde-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lunde 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roncalli-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Roncalli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schachinger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schachinger 2006</LINK>), and previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delewi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delewi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeevanantham-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeevanantham 2012</LINK>), have shown divergent results. Additionally, in light of recent studies suggesting that there are inconsistencies in the reporting of clinical trials and that the effect size of the treatment is correlated with the number of discrepancies (<LINK REF="REF-Nowbar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nowbar 2014</LINK>), it is even more important to review the clinical evidence thoroughly.</P>
<P>We have extracted and analysed data collected from the newly identified and included studies using the same methodology as described in the previous versions of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008b</LINK>). We have also carried out 'Risk of bias' assessment of the new included studies following the same methods as previously. We have performed a new meta-analysis that includes all 41 studies. In this version of the systematic review, we have reduced the number or surrogate outcomes analysed to focus on clinical outcomes, LVEF and quality of life outcomes. As it has become clear that cell therapies for AMI are safe and have no major adverse effects, the main questions to address in this systematic review are whether the intervention is efficacious and has a clinical benefit, and whether the findings from this systematic review can inform ongoing or future trials.</P>

<P>The information specialist (CD) conducted the electronic search for potentially relevant papers and removed references that were duplicates, clearly irrelevant and/or included in previous search results. Two review authors (SF, EMR for this update) independently screened all titles and abstracts of references identified by the review search strategy for relevancy to the review question. We exclude studies that clearly did not meet the eligibility criteria at this stage.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SF, HZ for this update) extracted data onto customised data extraction forms, which we created and piloted specifically for this review, and undertook data extraction for all eligible studies independently. Aside from details relating to the quality of included studies, we extracted the following two groups of data:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Trial characteristics: place of publication, date of publication, population characteristics, setting, detailed nature of intervention, detailed nature of comparator, detailed nature of outcomes. A key purpose of these data was to explain clinical heterogeneity between included studies independently from analysis of the results.</LI>
<LI>Results of included studies for each of the main outcomes indicated in the review question. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the numbers of outcomes in the treatment and control groups. For continuous outcomes, we recorded the mean and standard deviation. Where standard deviations of mean change from baseline values were not explicitly reported, where possible we calculated the standard deviation based on reported confidence intervals or P values as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and we used these values in the analysis. In the writing of this version of the review we identified a systematic error in the previous versions of the review in the calculation of standard deviations for mean change from baseline values. This issue has now been corrected; the discrepancies between the correct and previously reported values were small in all cases. In some studies it was not possible to calculate the value of the standard deviation and imputation techniques were deemed unsuitable due to the relatively high proportion of studies with missing standard deviations in some analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). These studies, previously analysed as mean change from baseline values, are now incorporated in combined analyses using the mean endpoint value.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We resolved data extraction disagreements by consensus between the review authors. When disagreements regarding any of the above could not be resolved through discussion, we attempted to contact authors of the original trials to provide further details (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK> below). We then transcribed the data into the systematic review computer software Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In light of the number of studies included in the previous version of this review that have had additional publications since, we checked all previous data included in the review. This resulted in a number of minor data errors being identified; these are corrected in the current version of the review. These errors made a negligible difference to the previous results and did not affect the conclusions.<BR/>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SF, HZ for this update), undertaking the data extraction independently, assessed the risk of bias for each trial using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the design, conduct and analysis of the trial using a three-point scale: low, high or unclear risk of bias. To assess risks of bias, the authors included the following questions in the 'Risk of bias' table for each included trial:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</LI>
<LI>Was allocation adequately concealed?</LI>
<LI>Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented (i.e. blinded) throughout the trial?</LI>
<LI>Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed for every outcome?</LI>
<LI>Were reports of the trial free of selective outcome reporting?</LI>
<LI>Was the trial apparently free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For trials included in the previous version of this review, we re-evaluated the risk of bias in the context of the revised outcomes and updated this accordingly. We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review author.</P>
<P>A study of trials published in Chinese medical journals that were described as randomised found that a high proportion of these trials did not adhere to accepted methodology for randomisation and hence could not be deemed authentic RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2009</LINK>). It is now widely accepted that trials carried out in China may lack appropriate randomisation, therefore we deemed any Chinese studies for which methods of randomisation were not described and could not be clarified with trial authors to have a high risk of selection bias; we evaluated sensitivity to these trials through sensitivity analyses (see <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK> section below).</P>

<P>Although we believe that we made every effort to identify unpublished studies, we assessed publication bias for the primary outcome of mortality using a funnel plot and with a formal test for publication bias using Egger's test for asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>), implemented with the statistical software programme R v2.14.1 (<LINK REF="REF-R-Core-Team-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">R Core Team 2013</LINK>).</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:41:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2014</LINK>), using random-effects models throughout due to the anticipated heterogeneity arising from differences in participant characteristics, interventions and duration of follow-up. This differs from the previous version of the review in which fixed-effect models were used for meta-analyses in the first instance. Although quantitative synthesis was the main method of analysis, we incorporated insights from a qualitative evaluation of studies for an overall interpretation of the data. We based conclusions on patterns of results identified across clearly tabulated results of included studies as well as summary measures, taking both direction and magnitude of any mean effect sizes from random-effects models into account. We included all studies in the main analyses irrespective of risk of bias; we performed sensitivity analyses for risk of selection, performance and attrition bias as described in the <LINK TAG="SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Sensitivity analysis</LINK> subsection below. We summarised periprocedural adverse events for each trial in tabular form and evaluated them descriptively.</P>
<P>Within each included trial, all participants were analysed in the treatment groups to which they had been randomised. We have undertaken an available case analysis, including all participants who were randomised to treatment and were included in the analysis, irrespective of whether or not they received their randomised treatment.</P>
<P>We carried out separate analyses according to the duration of follow-up after treatment: short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term (12 months or more). We expressed dichotomous data for each arm in a particular trial as a proportion or risk and the treatment effect as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We expressed continuous data for each arm in a particular trial as a mean and standard deviation, and the mean treatment effect as the mean difference (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way across trials. For outcomes measured using different scales (physical capacity and quality of life measures), we combined the treatment effect data and analysed them using the standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
<P>Although we intended to analyse continuous outcomes as mean change from baseline, several studies only reported baseline and endpoint data. Where possible, we calculated the standard deviation of the mean change from baseline based on reported confidence intervals or P values as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and we used these values in the analysis. However, for several studies, insufficient information was reported to calculate the standard deviation. The mean difference based on the change from baseline can be assumed to address the same underlying intervention effects as an analysis based on final measures (i.e. the differences in mean final values will on average be the same as the differences in mean change scores). Therefore we combined studies reporting mean change from baseline values with those reporting endpoint values (using preferentially mean change values where both were reported), but presented mean change and endpoint values separately as well as in combined analyses for clarity, as suggested in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We did not conduct this pooling of studies by method of reporting of continuous measures for analyses of quality of life or physical capacity, since the assumption of consistent underlying effects does not hold for standardised mean differences.</P>
<P>Six trials reported multiple intervention groups. In order to avoid double-counting of controls, in the main analyses we pooled data from active intervention arms across different doses (high dose/low dose (<LINK REF="STD-Meluzin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Meluzin 2008</LINK>) or high/medium/low dose (<LINK REF="STD-Quyyumi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quyyumi 2011</LINK>)), delivery routes (arterial or venous) (<LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>), timing of cell delivery (early or late) (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00fc_rder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sürder 2013</LINK>), type of cells (selected or unselected (<LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>)) or number of cell doses (<LINK REF="STD-Yao-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yao 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We produced a 'Summary of findings' table for the primary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and the composite measure of major adverse clinical cardiac events at both short-term and long-term follow-up, using the GRADEpro GDT software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2014</LINK>). We calculated risk ratios excluding trials with a high risk of randomisation sequence selection bias, assuming an underlying control risk from the observed data from included trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trial sequential analysis</HEADING>
<P>Cumulative meta-analyses may result in type I errors due to an increased risk of random error arising from repeated testing of accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-Borm-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lan 2003</LINK>). Trial sequential analysis provides a method of adjusting the thresholds for statistical significance while maintaining the overall desired type I error rate (<LINK REF="REF-Wettersley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wettersley 2008</LINK>). These adjusted thresholds are known as trial sequential monitoring boundaries (TSMBs). If the cumulative Z-curve crosses the TSMB, then statistical significance has been reached whilst maintaining the overall type I error rate. Futility boundaries may also be produced such that if the cumulative Z-curve crosses the futility threshold, there is evidence that the two treatments do not differ more than the anticipated effect size. Trial sequential analysis also provides a required information size, the meta-analysis information size needed to detect a statistically significant effect given a defined underlying model. We applied trial sequential analysis to the primary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and composite MACE, assuming a long-term mortality incidence rate of 6.1% in the control group (as observed in our control data); we estimated control group incidence rates for cardiovascular mortality and composite MACE from the observed control data similarly. For each outcome we calculated the information size required for a relative risk reduction of 35% (equivalent to the reduce risk of mortality associated with PCI (<LINK REF="REF-Hartwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartwell 2005</LINK>). Using the TSA program (<LINK REF="REF-TSA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSA 2011</LINK>), we calculated two-sided TSMBs using the O'Brien-Fleming &#946;-spending function for an overall 5% type I error rate and 80% power. We made a model variance based heterogeneity correction to incorporate the minimal heterogeneity observed for the outcomes of cardiovascular mortality and composite major adverse clinical events. We made no adjustment for heterogeneity for the outcome of mortality, consistent with the lack of heterogeneity observed in the meta-analysis. We produced no futility boundaries as the information fraction was too small to produce an inner wedge futility area from the trial sequential analysis program. We included studies that had reported outcomes at more than one long-term follow-up time point in the trial sequential analysis according to the time at which they first reported long-term follow-up (and hence were included in meta-analyses).<BR/>

<P>A range of different methods were used to measure LVEF across studies (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), left ventricular angiography (LVA), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography (RNV)), with several studies reporting LVEF as an outcome using more than one method of measurement. The limitations of some of these methods are well known (<LINK REF="STD-Arnesen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Arnesen 2007</LINK>). Consistent with the previous version of this review, we subgrouped analyses of LVEF according to the measurement method used.</P>

<P>We assessed the robustness of results for the primary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and composite measures of MACE for sensitivity to risk of selection bias (excluding studies with a high risk of bias from random sequence generation) and attrition bias (excluding studies with a high or unclear risk of attrition bias). We also assessed the primary clinical outcomes for sensitivity to risk of performance bias (excluding those studies with a known lack of blinding of participants and clinicians).</P>
<P>We also assessed the primary outcome of mortality and any additional outcomes that showed evidence of a difference between trial arms for sensitivity to differences in the route of cell delivery, by excluding one trial that administered cells into the coronary artery (<LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>).

<P>We identified a total of 6434 records (6293 references and 141 ongoing trial records) from electronic searches of the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SRI Transfusion Evidence Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, CDSR, DARE, CINAHL and Current Controlled Trials databases to March 2015. Additionally, handsearching of the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, European Society of Cardiology Congress and World Congress of Cardiology annual conference proceedings from 2005 to January 2011 identified an additional 96 references, and we identified four further references from reference lists of reviews identified in the database search to give a total of 6534 citations. De-duplication and removal of all previously screened references by the SRI Information Specialist (CD) excluded 1753 references. Screening of the remaining 4781 records (4640 references and 141 ongoing trial records) by two review authors independently resulted in exclusion of 4465 records (4370 references and 95 ongoing trials), which were clearly irrelevant. Detailed assessment of the remaining 270 references and 46 ongoing trial records identified a total of 170 references (93 full papers and 77 abstracts) and 18 ongoing trial records, which described a total of 41 trials included in this review (see PRISMA study flow diagram in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Trials excluded from the review</HEADING>
<P>We excluded 53 trials (described in 77 references and seven ongoing trial records) from the review following full-text eligibility assessment. In summary, the reasons for exclusion were as follows: six studies were not classified as AMI, 12 studies did not include a control arm, seven studies were non-randomised controlled trials, five studies infused G-CSF mobilised cells but did not administer G-CSF to the control arm, three studies mobilised cells by G-CSF but did not administer cells, five studies did not use autologous bone marrow stem cells, two studies were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, seven studies were commentaries or summaries, two studies were experimental, in two studies the outcomes were not relevant, one trial treated patients with acute myocardial infarction and 'old' myocardial infarction and the data were combined, and one trial had no relevant outcomes (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

An English version of a seventh Chinese paper was identified (<LINK REF="STD-Ruan-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ruan 2005</LINK>). Following careful cross-checking between the Chinese and English versions of the paper, which confirmed that both papers reported the same data from one trial, we used the English version of the paper within this review.</P>

This study is now referred to as <LINK REF="STD-Wollert-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wollert 2004</LINK> in accordance with the first publication that reported results from this trial. Three trials included in the previous version of the review are now not included: two trials that used G-CSF to mobilise stem cells in the cell therapy arm did not give G-CSF to the control group and in view of the lack of this co-intervention in the control arm, these studies are now excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2006</LINK>), and one trial published in abstract form only has been reclassified as awaiting classification as there were insufficient data provided for inclusion in any analyses (<LINK REF="STD-Fernandez_x002d_Pereira-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Fernandez-Pereira 2006</LINK>).</P>

In one trial it was unclear how many participants were randomised to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Jazi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jazi 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the analysis of LVEF, all trials that reported LVEF measured by echocardiography, SPECT, left ventricular angiography or radionuclide ventriculography included over 80% of randomised participants in the analysis of this outcome, with the exception of two trials, which analysed 72.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2014</LINK>) and 60% (<LINK REF="STD-Plewka-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Plewka 2009</LINK>) of randomised participants. A higher rate of withdrawals was observed in the analysis of LVEF measured by MRI in which five trials analysed less than 80% of randomised participants: 79.2% (<LINK REF="STD-Traverse-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Traverse 2012</LINK>), 67.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Quyyumi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quyyumi 2011</LINK>), 763.6% (<LINK REF="STD-Zhukova-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zhukova 2009</LINK>), 58.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>) and 28.9% (<LINK REF="STD-Schachinger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schachinger 2006</LINK>), although it should be noted that not all participants are willing or able to undergo MRI leading to an expected reduction in the number of patients analysed.</P>
<P>One trial was terminated prematurely after enrolment of the first 27 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Penicka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Penicka 2007</LINK>). The trial was reported as being terminated early "<I>due to the unexpected occurrence of serious complications in the BMSC group and no incremental functional effects of BMSC as compared with control patients</I>". Fourteen of the 17 participants randomised to the BMSC arm provided scientific outcome data at four and 12-month follow-up assessments.

<P>Out of 41 trials (with 2732 participants) only 18 trials (1567 participants) reported a published protocol (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) and in this sub-sample there was no evidence of selective reporting. However, given that the majority of trials did not report details of their protocol it is difficult to ascertain whether these trials are at low risk of selective reporting. We considered one trial to have a high risk of reporting bias as the authors failed to report quality of life and cost-effectiveness despite these outcomes being described in their trial protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified no obvious asymmetry from a funnel plot for mortality (using the maximum duration of follow-up for all trials that reported mortality) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). In a regression test for asymmetry (Egger's test) at short-term follow-up the model intercept was 0.15 (P value = 0.01), suggesting that larger rather than smaller trials may be associated with a larger treatment effect. At long-term follow-up, the test for asymmetry was not significant (P value = 0.06) and there was no evidence of publication bias.</P>

<P>The mortality incidence rate was low in all trials. Overall, there was no evidence for a difference in the risk of mortality between patients who received cell therapy and those who received no cells at short-term (21/836 versus 15/529; risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 to 1.49; 1365 participants; 17 studies) or long-term follow-up (34/538 versus 32/458; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.50; 996 participants; 14 studies) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0% in both analyses) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses did not affect the results for mortality. Exclusion of the trial that administered cells via the coronary artery, <LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>, did not affect short-term mortality results (20/812 versus 15/523; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.51; 1335 participants; 16 studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Only one trial included in the analysis of short-term follow-up had a high risk of selection bias due to lack of appropriate randomisation sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>); the difference in risk of mortality between groups when we excluded this trial was negligible (20/808 versus 13/499; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.57; 1307 participants; 16 studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). No trials reporting long-term follow-up had a high risk of selection bias due to randomisation methods. When we excluded trials with a high or unclear risk of attrition bias, there remained no evidence for a difference in all-cause mortality at either short-term (14/505 versus 12/394; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.61; 899 participants; 13 studies) or long-term follow-up (21/456 versus 26/391; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.17; 847 participants; 11 studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). Similarly, exclusion of trials with a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding revealed no evidence for differences in the risk of mortality at either short-term (6/376 versus 8/293; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.56; 669 participants; eight studies) or long-term follow-up (8/220 versus 16/186; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.10; 406 participants; three studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of mortality measured at short-term follow-up revealed no differences between trials grouped according to baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>), cell type (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>), cell dose (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>), timing of cell infusion (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>), or use of heparinised cell solution (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>). However, stratification of trials by cell dose revealed a significant difference in the effect of cells on long-term mortality (test for subgroup differences, P value = 0.02) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>), with a reduced risk of mortality in patients who received &gt; 10<SUP>8</SUP> and &#8804; 10<SUP>9</SUP> cells (14/371 versus 24/297; RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97; 668 participants; seven studies), whereas there was no evidence for a difference in the risk of long-term mortality associated with a lower dose (&#8804; 10<SUP>8</SUP> cells) (15/120 versus 6/121; RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.95; 241 participants; five studies) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>). Only two trials administered &gt; 10<SUP>9</SUP> cells; there was no difference in the risk of mortality between treatment groups from meta-analysis of these two trials (5/47 versus 2/40; RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 7.55; 87 participants; two studies). There was no difference in the risk of long-term mortality associated with cell therapy associated with either baseline LVEF (<LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>), cell type (<LINK REF="CMP-007.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.2</LINK>), timing of cell administration (<LINK REF="CMP-009.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.2</LINK>), or use of heparinised cell solution (<LINK REF="CMP-010.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>In trial sequential analysis of all-cause mortality at long-term follow-up, the cumulative Z-curve did not cross the conventional thresholds or trial sequential monitoring boundaries for significance (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The required information size, based on a random-effects model and a relative risk reduction of 35%, a mean effect size equivalent to that associated with revascularisation by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (<LINK REF="REF-Hartwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartwell 2005</LINK>), was 3275, suggesting that the current meta-analysis is considerably underpowered to detect a reduction in relative risk of 35% or lower.

<P>There was no evidence for a reduction in the risk of composite death, reinfarction or re-hospitalisation for heart failure associated with cell therapy at either short-term (5/198 versus 12/181; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.14; 379 participants; three studies) or long-term follow-up (24/262 versus 33/235; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10; 497 participants; six studies) with low or negligible heterogeneity in both analyses (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 12% respectively) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The limited number of trials that reported other composite measures of MACE at short-term or long-term follow-up prevented formal analysis of these outcomes.</P>
<P>We did not perform sensitivity analysis as no trials that reported composite measures of MACE had a high risk of selection bias or a high or unclear risk of attrition bias, and the number of appropriately blinded trials precluded sensitivity analysis for performance bias.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis of cardiovascular mortality at long-term follow-up showed that based on a relative risk reduction of 35%, 1572 participants would be required, demonstrating that the current meta-analysis is considerably underpowered to detect such a difference in the risk of composite MACE between treatment groups.</P>

<P>Cell transplantation has been developed clinically for over 40 years in patients with haematological malignancies (e.g. haematopoietic stem cell transplantation), but its application as a treatment for other conditions, such as heart disease, has only been possible since 2002. Over the last 13 years clinical evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has become available, allowing the robust evaluation of the safety of this alternative treatment in patients who have suffered a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Meta-analyses in cell therapy can help to show the safety of the approach and generate hypotheses, but due to the extent of the heterogeneity of the biologically active product, analysis of efficacy has to be marked with a great caveat. The present study is an update of the Cochrane systematic review published by us previously (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Nature of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Forty-one RCTs, including 2732 participants, were eligible for inclusion in this updated Cochrane review. The characteristics of the interventions are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. All included studies compared cell treatment with no cells in addition to the standard primary intervention for revascularisation (primary angioplasty and/or thrombolytic therapy) and standard medical therapy. Participants recruited to these trials have had a recent AMI and received treatment (intervention) or control (or placebo) following successful revascularisation of the infarct-related coronary artery (IRCA). The cell-based treatment was administered by an interventional cardiologist as a single bolus, usually by infusion into the IRCA using a balloon catheter. One trial compared two intervention groups, comparing treatment delivered by intracoronary vein infusion with arterial infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Nogueira-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Nogueira 2009</LINK>). However, unlike traditional drugs used in cardiology, which possess much simpler chemical and pharmacological characteristics, autologous cell therapies are experimental interventions with much more complex and individualised properties. Therefore it is not surprising that there was substantial clinical heterogeneity and diversity within and between trials: the characteristics of the participants, the type and size of infarct and the baseline outcome values (e.g. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) at admission all differed. Cell type, dose and time of administration as well as the media where cells were re-suspended and whether the participants in the comparator arm received placebo or not also differed. There is no standard definition of an 'active' cell product at present. This is because the number of administered cells cannot be equated to active dose and the number of cells retained in the target region might be affected by disease and patient-related factors. Having said that, all trials included in this review delivered cells of bone marrow origin, with bone marrow mononuclear cells being the starting cell population. Thirty-eight trials isolated cells from bone marrow aspirates and enriched the mononuclear cell population by gradient centrifugation. One trial infused an enriched CD34 fraction (<LINK REF="STD-Quyyumi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Quyyumi 2011</LINK>), and one trial infused enriched CD133-positive cells (<LINK REF="STD-Colombo-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Colombo 2011</LINK>), whilst another trial compared the effect of unfractionated mononuclear cells with CD34+/CXCR4+ cells (<LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>). Five trials cultured and administered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (<LINK REF="STD-Gao-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Gao 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xiao-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Xiao 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-2008" TYPE="STUDY">You 2008</LINK>). The trials also differed in their design (e.g. blinded versus open-label), the length of follow-up (short and long-term) and the methodology used to measure surrogate outcome data (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiography, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), etc.).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Main findings</HEADING>
<P>There are 11 new trials included in this update of the Cochrane review, but the individual trials are still too small. Pooling the data together, we can conclude the following.</P>
<UL>
<LI>There was no evidence for a difference in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, incidence of re-hospitalisation for heart failure, re-infarction, arrhythmias, restenosis or target vessel revascularisation in cell-treated patients compared to controls.</LI>
<LI>Accordingly, we found no evidence for a difference in the composite measure of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined by death, re-infarction and re-hospitalisation for heart failure between treated patients and the control group.</LI>
<LI>There were no major differences in periprocedural adverse events associated with cell treatment.</LI>
<LI>The treatment was associated with no improvement in LVEF measured by MRI. We observed no differences between treatment groups in mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, quality of life measures and exercise/performance measures at short-term follow-up. There were too few trials with long-term follow-up that measured NYHA class, quality of life or exercise/performance to draw meaningful conclusions.</LI>
<LI>Taken together, the results of these meta-analyses suggest that bone marrow-derived cell therapy has no beneficial effect for patients who have suffered AMI. The quality of the evidence presented here is moderate due to imprecision: the information size criterion has not been met, meaning that this systematic review and meta-analysis is underpowered.</LI>
</UL>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study limitations</HEADING>
<P>There are a number of limitations to the strength of any conclusion that can be drawn from the evaluation of the included trials. These include sample sizes of the individual trials, statistical power, clinical heterogeneity and risk of bias of the included trials (please see below).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sample size and statistical power</HEADING>
<P>In general, the sample sizes were small in all trials included, perhaps with the exception of three trials that included at least 200 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Schachinger-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schachinger 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00fc_rder-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sürder 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>). At present, results from the first large phase III randomised trials to robustly determine the efficacy of this treatment are lacking. Therefore, systematic reviews and meta-analysis of pooled trial data can be used to generate hypotheses and to compensate for the lack of statistical power in individual trials.</P>
<P>Cumulative meta-analyses may result in type I errors due to an increased risk of random error arising from repeated testing of accumulating data (<LINK REF="REF-Borm-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borm 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lan 2003</LINK>). Trial sequential analysis provides a method of adjusting the thresholds for statistical significance while maintaining the overall desired type I error rate (<LINK REF="REF-Wettersley-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wettersley 2008</LINK>). We applied trial sequential analysis to the primary outcome of all-cause mortality, assuming a long-term mortality incidence rate of 6.1% in the control group (as observed in our control data) and a relative risk reduction of 35% (equivalent to the reduce risk of mortality associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (<LINK REF="REF-Hartwell-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartwell 2005</LINK>). In our analysis, the cumulative Z-curve for all-cause mortality did not cross the conventional thresholds or trial sequential monitoring boundaries (TSMB) for significance. The required information size was 3275 participants, suggesting that even the current meta-analysis is considerably underpowered to detect a relative risk reduction of this magnitude. The required information size to detect significant effects in cardiovascular mortality and composite MACE was 3064 and 1572 participants, respectively.</P>
<P>The effect of intracoronary reinfusion of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNC) is being assessed in a pan-European Phase III trial (the BAMI trial) (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01569178" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01569178</LINK>). This trial is well-powered and is planned to recruit 3000 participants who have suffered a recent myocardial infarction and have reduced LVEF (&#8804; 45%) following successful revascularisation. Primary and secondary outcomes include death, cardiac death, re-hospitalisation for myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation (TVR), heart failure, implantation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator/ cardiac resynchronisation therapy (ICD/CRT) device, stroke, syncope or arrhythmias and incidence and severity of adverse events, with an estimated completion date of May 2018.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk of bias and heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review is based on a comprehensive search strategy, but despite this the possibility of publication and reporting bias cannot be ruled out completely. Risk of bias is present in the included trials, as summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>. All trials stated that they randomised the participants, but only 49% (n = 20) and 34% (n = 14) of the included trials documented adequate methods for the generation of randomised sequences and concealment of treatment allocation, respectively. Blinding (performance and detection bias) was reported in 22% (n = 9) of the included trials, whilst the remaining 32 trials were described either as not blinded (n = 24) or blinding was unclear (n = 8). Attrition bias was low in 76% (n = 31) of the included trials, whilst it was unclear or high in the remaining trials. Finally, selective reporting bias was low in 41% (n = 17) of the included trials. Sensitivity analyses conducted for the major outcome of all-cause mortality showed that excluding those trials with high risk of selection, attrition or performance bias had a negligible effect on all-cause mortality.</P>
<P>In summary, this review finds that the results from the meta-analysis are of moderate quality for the primary outcomes (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) due to the information size criterion not being met (imprecision). Therefore, further research may change the estimate of the treatment effect. These results may be regarded as optimistic, however the evidence from this review, from our previous Cochrane reviews and from the recent individual patient data analysis, <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>, appears to support the conclusion that bone marrow cell therapies may not reduce the risk of clinical outcomes in patients with AMI.</P>
<P>Our previous versions of this Cochrane review have shown a considerable degree of heterogeneity among trials, which has been extensively explored (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin_x002d_Rendon-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin-Rendon 2008b</LINK>). Interestingly, heterogeneity is negligible for the primary outcomes of this review, suggesting little variation in treatment effect. However, clinical heterogeneity is still present, which justifies using a random-effects model in all meta-analyses conducted. We have attempted to address some of the issues of heterogeneity by conducting exploratory subgroup analyses. One example is the timing of cell delivery. It is important to make the distinction between early and late administration of cells as remodelling of the damaged tissue is very different at seven to 10 days to four weeks. We have considered carefully the option of restricting the inclusion criteria to trials which deliver cells within 10 days. However, as there are several key trials that would be excluded from this review as a subset of patients received cells after 10 days (between three and 12 days (<LINK REF="STD-Penicka-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Penicka 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Plewka-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Plewka 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tendera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Tendera 2009</LINK>)), we have opted to conduct subgroup analyses for timing of cell delivery. Similarly, we have stratified the length of follow-up at less than 12 months and 12 months or more. In this case, the latter category seems to be more diverse, with one trial reporting a mean follow-up of over eight years (<LINK REF="STD-Karpov-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Karpov 2005</LINK>). Interestingly, this trial provides the most negative results in a number of clinical outcomes. One possible explanation is that the risk of mortality over longer-term follow-up would be increased in both treated and control patients, and therefore any observed differences between the two groups would decrease as the length of follow-up increased.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of life and exercise/performance status</HEADING>
<P>Since our last update of this Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>), more trials have reported patient-centred outcomes, such as quality of life and exercise or performance status. However, quality of life and performance measures during long-term follow-up are still underreported. In some cases only one trial has reported these outcomes, thus precluding any further analysis. Where meta-analysis was feasible, no differences between treated patients and controls were observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)</HEADING>
<P>We subgrouped LVEF data according to the method of measurement. Although each method has its limitations, it is widely accepted that MRI is the gold standard method to measure surrogate outcomes such as LVEF. A limited number of studies presented LVEF data as mean change from baseline. Many studies presented both mean change from baseline and mean value at endpoint and results are broadly similar whichever measure is used (see, for example, <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). We present forest plots for both mean change from baseline and endpoint values for clarity and transparency. There was evidence for an improvement in LVEF measured by MRI from baseline at both short and long-term follow-up. There was no improvement in LVEF measured by MRI from baseline or at endpoint, both at short and long-term follow-up. Although there might be an indication of an improvement of LVEF when measured by echocardiography, SPECT or left ventricular angiography, the effect sizes are within the range of 2% to 5%, which is accepted not to be clinically relevant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Where appropriate, exploratory subgroup analysis investigated the effects of baseline cardiac function (LVEF), cell dose, type and timing of administration, as well as the use of heparin in the final cell solution. Most of the subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences between groups, with the exception of long-term mortality subgrouped by cell dose. The results suggest that there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality associated with a cell infusion of less than 10<SUP>8</SUP> cells, whilst there is a reduction in long-term mortality in favour of cell therapy with 10<SUP>8 </SUP>to 10<SUP>9</SUP> cells. There were very few trials that administered more than 10<SUP>9</SUP> cells to draw robust conclusions. However, in view of the low number of trials included, these results should be considered with caution.</P>
<P>Baseline LVEF has been previously reported to be an effect modifier (<LINK REF="REF-Beitnes-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beitnes 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schachinger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schachinger 2009</LINK>), although we found no evidence for subgroup differences according to baseline LVEF. Ideally, subgroup analyses of baseline cardiac function would include studies where all subgroup patients have a baseline LVEF of, say, &#8804; 45% or &gt; 45%, and such an analysis could be implemented with the use of individual patient data (<LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>). Unfortunately, few of the included studies used an LVEF threshold as part of their inclusion criteria. Furthermore, we used LVEF baseline measures obtained by MRI as the gold standard, which is usually done after revascularisation and so any baseline LVEF values used as eligibility criteria are unlikely to have been obtained by MRI. Subgroup analysis of studies stratified by mean LVEF using the median value as the subgroup threshold (as defined in the previous version of this review) provides a crude measure of whether baseline cardiac function is associated with efficacy, which will merely have reduced power to detect subgroup effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>In this update of the Cochrane review we have focused on clinical outcomes such as death, cardiovascular death, reinfarction (MI), arrhythmias, restenosis, target vessel revascularisation and re-hospitalisation for heart failure. We have included MACE, defined as death, reinfarction (MI) and re-hospitalisation for heart failure.</P>
<P>Our results suggest that cell therapy does not appear to have a beneficial effect in patients who have experienced a recent AMI. Although this is in agreement with the previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>), and with recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis on cell therapies for patients with AMI (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delewi-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delewi 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>), the present update of the Cochrane review presents long-term data that are lacking from previous meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2014</LINK> reported a meta-analysis of 22 cell-based therapy RCTs (2037 participants) and found that cell therapy had no effect on major adverse clinical cardiac events including all-cause mortality for a median follow-up of six months. In the first prospective individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis including 12 trials (1252 participants), <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK> confirmed no significant differences in all-cause mortality. Like the present Cochrane review, previous meta-analyses have shown low procedural adverse events and low incidence of clinical endpoints.</P>
<P>The picture is somewhat more confusing when measuring surrogate outcomes such as LVEF. Mean changes scores may be less efficient for outcomes that are difficult to measure with precision (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and it may be that one has to take this into consideration when describing continuous surrogate outcomes such as LVEF. The present Cochrane review and meta-analysis shows no improvement in LVEF in favour of cell therapy when measured by MRI during either short-term or long-term follow-up. Whilst <LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2014</LINK> observed a significant improvement in LVEF during short-term follow-up (in 1513 participants), <LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK> observed no significant improvement (in 734 participants) when analysing individual patient data. <LINK REF="REF-de-Jong-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Jong 2014</LINK> found that the improvement in LVEF in favour of cell therapies was not sustained long-term and explained this by a gradual increase in LV volumes during the first year after AMI in reperfused patients (<LINK REF="REF-Engblom-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engblom 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our data are in disagreement with results obtained in systematic reviews and meta-analysis where the cell therapies have been administered to patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease and heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Afzal-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afzal 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fisher-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wen-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wen 2012</LINK>), which may indicate that heart failure patients may benefit more from cell-based therapies than AMI patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The first-generation clinical trials were designed to prove safety of the procedure but were not statistically powered to assess efficacy of the treatment and longer-term effects on survival free of major associated cardiac events. This systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled trials suggests that cell-based therapies do not lead to a reduction in hard clinical outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalisation for heart failure, target vessel re-vascularisation or composite measures of MACE, or indeed an improvement in LVEF as a surrogate of heart function. Although the quality of this evidence is moderate due to imprecision (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), the findings of this review are consistent with the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Clifford-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifford 2012</LINK>), and with the recently published individual patient data analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gy_x00f6_ngy_x00f6_si-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyöngyösi 2015</LINK>). Although these results are robust to sensitivity analyses, this systematic review is most likely underpowered. There is ultimately no substitute for adequately powered phase III RCTs, such as the BAMI trial.</P>
<P>The findings from this systematic review provide further support to previous statements by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Task Force (<LINK REF="REF-Bartunek-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartunek 2006</LINK>) that stem cell therapy remains "an experimental therapy". Evidence reported to date, although almost entirely from small trials, does not support the incorporation of stem cell therapy in the management of patients with AMI. A re-evaluation of this systematic review is warranted on completion of the BAMI trial, expected in 2018.<BR/>

<P>Evidence from the included trials indicates that adult cell-based therapies seem to be safe. The incidence of mortality following successful revascularisation of the culprit artery is very low and the introduction of primary angioplasty as the standard primary intervention in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has already reduced short-term mortality by 33% and re-infarction by 50%. However, there seems currently to be insufficient evidence to suggest that cell therapy reduces mortality and morbidity beyond standard therapy in this group of patients. Most of the evidence comes from small trials and small numbers of events. Larger and adequately powered clinical trials, such as the BAMI trial, are required to robustly assess the efficacy of cell-based therapies post-AMI.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review shows that currently there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality and morbidity when bone marrow-derived stem cell treatment is administered to patients who had standard primary intervention following AMI. Further research may be justified to address current uncertainties, such as the mechanism of action and the need for patient selection. The first phase III trials to assess hard clinical outcomes are underway. Future clinical trials should be adequately powered, consider the best surrogate outcomes to measure and the best method to measure them, and should standardise composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE). They should also reduce the risk of selection, attrition, performance and reporting bias.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2015-09-18 11:16:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The original outcomes of this review have been revised in this update, focusing on clinical outcomes. However, the surrogate endpoint of LVEF is a standard, widely reported marker for cardiac function and has been retained as a reference point with other trials and systematic reviews in AMI. Surrogate outcomes other than LVEF reported in previous versions of this review, namely engraftment and survival of the infused stem cells, left ventricular end-systolic volume, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, wall motion score, stroke volume index and infarct size are no longer included. We now define revised primary outcomes as (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) cardiovascular mortality, (iii) composite measures of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and (iv) periprocedural adverse events. Secondary outcomes include morbidity, LVEF and quality of life and performance measures.</P>
<P>In the protocol and previous versions of the review we implemented fixed-effect models in the first instance. It is now clear that there are many potential sources of heterogeneity across trials, and in this version of the review we have performed meta-analyses using random-effects models throughout.</P>
<P>In the writing of this version of the review we identified a systematic error in the previous versions of the review in the calculation of standard deviations for mean change from baseline LVEF values. This issue has now been corrected. In some studies it was not possible to accurately calculate the value of the standard deviation. These studies, previously analysed as mean change from baseline values, are now reported as mean value at endpoint; results from combined analyses of mean change from baseline and endpoint values are reported.</P>

The bone marrow aspirate was shipped at room temperature to the central cell-processing laboratory. The mononuclear cell fraction was isolated using a density gradient with Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Biowhittaker) and then the low-density cells were washed and viable cells were counted. The BM-MCs were seeded into 75 cm² tissue culture flasks in MSCs medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5% glucose (DMEM-4.5, HyClone), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Lift Technologies). The cell suspension was removed after 72 hours and the adherent cells were cultured in at 37 °C with 5% CO<SUB>2</SUB>. The culture medium was changed every 3 to 4 days until colonies were formed. After 14.6 ± 0.7 days of culture, passage 2 (P2) cells were harvested by trypsin treatment. Cells were washed, and viability was tested by trypan blue exclusion. Cell counts were performed, and the cells at 4 °C were delivered to the catheterisation laboratory. Cell were re-suspended in heparinised saline<BR/>

<I>Summary of how stem cells were isolated and type and route of delivery</I>: 20 to 25 mL (mean ± SD: 23.1 ±1 1.5 mL) of BM aspirates were obtained under local anaesthesia from the posterior iliac crest in the treatment group on 3.8 ± 1.5 days after admission. All manufacturing and product testing procedures for the generation of clinical-grade autologous MSCs were carried out under good manufacturing practice (FCB-Pharmicell Company Limited, Seongnam, Korea). Mononuclear cells were separated from the BM by density gradient centrifugation (HISTOPAQUE-1077; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-low glucose (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin/100 &#956;g/mL and streptomycin (Gibco). They were plated at 2 to 3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> cells/cm<SUP>2</SUP> into 75 cm<SUP>2</SUP> flasks. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<SUB>2</SUB>. After 5 to 7 days, non-adherent cells were removed by replacing the medium; adherent cells were cultured for another 2 to 3 days. When the cultures were near confluence (70% to 80%), adherent cells were detached by using trypsin containing ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA; Gibco) and replated at 4 to 5 × 10<SUP>3 </SUP>cells/cm<SUP>2</SUP> in 175 cm<SUP>2</SUP> flasks. Cells were serially subcultured up to passage 4 or passage 5 for infusion (mean ± SD: 4.4 ± 0.5 passages). On the day of administration, MSCs were harvested using trypsin and EDTA, washed twice with PBS and once with saline solution, and re-suspended to a final concentration of 1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> cells/kg. The criteria for the release of MSCs for clinical use included viability &gt; 80%, absence of microbial contamination (bacteria, fungus, virus and mycoplasma) if undertaken 3 to 4 days before administration, and expression of CD73 and CD105 by &gt; 90% of cells and absence of CD14, CD34 and CD45 by &lt; 3% of cells as assessed by flow cytometry<BR/>

Then the aspirate and 20 mL of the patient's serum were sent at room temperature by courier to the cell-processing centre. The BM-MNC cell suspension was shipped back to the participating hospital within 24 hours. Briefly, with the use of density gradient centrifugation, the mononuclear cell fraction was re-suspended in 10 mL of serum-free medium with 20% of autologous serum added without any additional heparin. An aliquot of cell suspension was utilised for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis with the use of fluorochrome conjugated antibodies against anti-human CD34 and CD133; cell viability was assessed by 7-AAD cell uptake, and sterility was assessed by the Bact/Alert rapid method.
