I have added a cautionary note in the abstract about high dose FP in children as the review data is not adequate to address this.&lt;br&gt;Spellchecked.&lt;br&gt;I am happy for this to proceed to submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Editing April 4 2007 TJL RESPONSE 18052007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution&lt;br&gt;Does Paul wish to remain on the authors' list (if so he needs to be happy with the current update!) &lt;br&gt;###DON'T KNOW. SHOULD HE REMAIN INVOLVED IF HE HAS NOT CONTRIBUTED TO THE REVIEW VERSION? &lt;br&gt;What's new&lt;br&gt;It would help readers if this could be given headings to make clear when the updates took place and what happened on each occasion please&lt;br&gt;I HAVE DIVIDED THE SECTIONS OF WHAT'S NEW. &lt;br&gt;Objectives&lt;br&gt;I see HFA BDP has been split off but could not tell from the text which of the included studies used HFA FP (indeed is there thought to be a difference between CFC and HFA FP?)&lt;br&gt;I HAVE ADDED A REFERENCE ON THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT HFA AND CFC FP ARE SIMILAR (TRIAL REFERENCED IN FP-HFA BDP REVIEW. SHOULD I USE IT HERE?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References&lt;br&gt;Checked by Susan?&lt;br&gt;Table of included studies&lt;br&gt;Good, but I wonder about sensitivity analysis looking through the study designs. I think it would be useful to choose a couple of key outcomes and just use the blinded studies to see how this alters the results.&lt;br&gt;IN RED IN RESULTS SECTION&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels&lt;br&gt;1#9 needs to be changed to Litres not L/min and then imported for a new Figure 2 I think&lt;br&gt;CHANGED. &lt;br&gt;I am having difficulty reconciling 1#11 and 1#12; seems odd that LeBlanc data is identical for % and absolute value - could I see the data here please? THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS WRONG! HAVE NOW AMENDED THIS. SEE RED TEXT IN RESULTS UNDER PEF HEADING. &lt;br&gt;Also Ferguson in 1#18 looks very odd at present. &lt;br&gt;AGREED - IT WAS A PAED STUDY, ALTHOUGH THE DATA ARE TAKEN FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S PDF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1#24 makes Ige look even more suspicious (i agree with separating this in sensitivity analysis, especially as not double blind). &lt;br&gt;THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DOES SEEM TO SHOW A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPEN LABEL AND DOUBLE-BLIND STUDIES. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1#27 appears to have 2 identical subgroups - please check.&lt;br&gt;THIS WAS DUE TO TWO TREATMENT GROUPS (WITH DIFFERENT INHALER DEVICES IN LUNDBACK 1993. I HAVE RETAINED THE MDI COMPARISON DATA SINCE THIS IS CLOSER TO GIVING AN ESTIMATE THAT IS AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD THAN THE FP DPI VERSUS BDP MDI COMPARISON (THE STUDY WAS DOUBLE DUMMY). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis&lt;br&gt;Odd that QOL is suggested for future research (?remove this as synopsis too long already) and CFC free is suggested in the abstract.&lt;br&gt;QOL COMMENT REMOVED FROM SYNOPSIS. ALSO REMOVED CFC-FREE COMMENT FROM ABSTRACT. THIS IS A SIDE-ISSUE FOR THIS REVIEW, ALTHOUGH IT IS OF RELEVANCE TO THE FIELD OF ICS RESEACH MORE GENERALLY. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br&gt;Could you point out that HFA BDP is now in a separate review please (and cite it of course)? Search date Jan 2007 in abstract and 2005 in search strategy. Please amend.&lt;br&gt;MENTIONED AND CITED IN BODY OF MAIN REVIEW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;br&gt;Fine&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;Good but I would like to see some idea of what is a clinically important difference in FEV1 and PEF either here or in the discussion. For example it strikes me that for 1#2 the confidence interval is entirely between +/- 2% predicted and this feels like equivalence to me! Figure 2 is labelled Litres/min which would suggest PEF not FEV1? Please check.&lt;br&gt;I HAVE ADDED SOME TEXT IN RED IN DISCUSSION SECTION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion&lt;br&gt;I think increasing concern about high dose ICS in children causing serious adrenal suppression needs to be mentioned (see current edition of MEREC for example). The average may not help us here!&lt;br&gt;LINE ADDED TO THE DISCUSSION IN RED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues&lt;br&gt;If the dose response curve for FP is different from BDP and BUD this is important to highlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action&lt;br&gt;Would it be worth reordering the comparisons so that all the 2:1 results come first and the 1:1 afterwards? If you wish to split the review I will not stand in your way BUT it will mean a great deal of work and I am not sure if it is justified. In the longer term I think the 1:1 comparison could be archived off, so I suppose splitting would be a move towards this. Shall we discuss on Tuesday?&lt;br&gt;==============================================&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;101 references pertain to 64 included studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;CJC edit june 9 05&lt;br&gt;Well done Toby. This can go on now. I have changed WMD to MD throughout for consistency.&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;======================================================================&lt;br&gt;Sorry Chris - whilst working on a different review I discovered that Liz Juniper has done more than one QoL questionnaire. It transpires that this could well explain the heterogeneity for the qol outcome in the 1:2 dose ratio comparison! Attached is the improved version with hiccup ironed out. I don't think that you had looked at this one yet, so please delete the other verison.&lt;br&gt;======================================================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 3 Feb 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution : fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new : Very helpful. I have changed the heterogeneity line to explored rather than attempted to explain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: Please demote the cross-over results 1:2 from number 2 to the end. Labels need fixing on 1#4,14,27 and 3#26. Title of 3:31 does not make sense please amend to proportion of patient who.............&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: ***Please recheck the results section as it currently does not match metaview graphs. Left in RED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Data analysis altered slightly to reflect that GIV is merely a method used to calculated pooled WMD or SMD. It is not an outcome measure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ****Hoarseness Peto OR is wrong I think. Left in RED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion : Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: IGE looks out of line with all the other studies. Challenging!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: Done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: BAck to Toby to tidy up for submission please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Hi Chris, &lt;br&gt; Nick has approved the changes to the text in this update of the FP versus BDP/BUD review and it is now ready for you to look through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;N Adams wrote 160105:&lt;br&gt;Text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under 'Data Analysis' you refer to the use of the GIV method. I'm&lt;br&gt;unclear about what the paragraph you've added in red means. You state&lt;br&gt;that &amp;quot;we have incorporated data from WMD analyses so as to generate an&lt;br&gt;authoritative pooled summary estimate&amp;quot; - not really clear what you mean&lt;br&gt;here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the section Discussion/Efficacy/Airway calibre I thought the&lt;br&gt;replacement paragraph in purple might be a bit clearer than the original&lt;br&gt;in red - what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We noted that significant effects observed for absolute FEV1 (litres)&lt;br&gt;and peak flow (litres) were correlated with non-significant findings&lt;br&gt;when we analysed data as change from baseline at a dose ratio of 1:1.&lt;br&gt;The greater number of trials and the greater statistical power of the&lt;br&gt;pooled estimate of absolute score outcomes could explain the difference&lt;br&gt;between these findings. The change scores were also affected by the&lt;br&gt;inclusion of a potentially different beclomethasone preparation&lt;br&gt;(HFA-BDP) in the Aubier 2001 study. As the same non-CFC propellant was&lt;br&gt;used in both steroid inhalers we opted to pool this study with the&lt;br&gt;others. There may in fact be greater equivalence of HFA-BDP and FP than&lt;br&gt;there is between the older CFC preparations, which would pull the mean&lt;br&gt;difference towards the line of no difference&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW&lt;br&gt;These results suggest that clinically relevant differences in effect are&lt;br&gt;unlikely to be seen when FP and BDP/BUD are used at a 1:2 daily dose&lt;br&gt;ratio. A logical extension of this relationship would be for even&lt;br&gt;greater benefits favouring FP to be seen when given at equal nominal&lt;br&gt;daily dose to BDP or BUD. However, no significant difference between&lt;br&gt;the inhaled steroids were seen when data from trials comparing agents&lt;br&gt;at a 1:1 dose ratio reporting change from baseline values for the same&lt;br&gt;outcomes. The apparent paradox between the outcomes for the different&lt;br&gt;dose ratio comparisons may be due to a number of factors. The greater&lt;br&gt;number of trials and the greater statistical power of the pooled&lt;br&gt;estimate of absolute score outcomes could explain the difference between&lt;br&gt;these findings. The change scores were also affected by the inclusion of&lt;br&gt;a potentially different beclomethasone preparation (HFA-BDP) in the&lt;br&gt;Aubier 2001 study. As the same non-CFC propellant was used in both&lt;br&gt;steroid inhalers we opted to pool this study with the others. There may&lt;br&gt;in fact be greater equivalence of HFA-BDP and FP than there is between&lt;br&gt;the older CFC preparations, which may have had the effect of 'pulling'&lt;br&gt;the mean difference towards the line of no difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format of the old and newly included studies differ - do we want to&lt;br&gt;standardize these? For example, I originally used the following format&lt;br&gt;for the study characteristics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting:&lt;br&gt;Design:&lt;br&gt;Length of intervention period:&lt;br&gt;Masking :&lt;br&gt;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Relook by CJC 10 Feb 2004&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making these changes Toby.&lt;br&gt;I am happy with this but have not rechecked all the results since you added the Heinig data. If you are happy these are correct then this can go forward for submission.&lt;br&gt;There is an issue in relation to the absolute doses of ICS as well as relative doses as we cannot assume the dose response curves will be parallel for the different drugs but this has been mentioned in the discussion.&lt;br&gt;---------------------------- ------------------------------ ------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;TJL: New data inserted from GSK for Heinig 1999 020204&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 23/1/2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: Does the list of authors need to be amended?

You need to be a co-reviewer and acknowleged - I 've not put your details in yet. I&amp;#8217;ve attached my version of the draft Update to this message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of Review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby needs to be included as a co-reviewer. He contributed a great deal to the December 2003 update. I&amp;#8217;ve amended the &amp;#8216;Methods of review&amp;#8217; section with his contribution here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with the estimations of baseline asthma severity Toby - thanks for updating Table 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been the &amp;#8216;Comparisons and Data&amp;#8217; table and checked the comparisons in which the data from only a single study were available. There were a few comparisons in which Totals were still being displayed despite there only being one study. I have therefore changed this to &amp;#8216;No Totals&amp;#8217;in the statistical analysis preferences for these particular comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been through the new studies and agree with Toby for estimations of asthma severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the caveat you&amp;#8217;ve applied to interpreting the requirement for OCS in event of exacerbation is fine. The newly included Nielsen 2000 study does introduce significant heterogeneity which is difficult to account for. However, I think the significant difference between overall event rates in the groups in this study is as likely a reason as others. I think the readers will have to draw their own conclusions in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made only a couple of minor changes for typos in the main body of the text but have not added any significant comments of my own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of Included Studies&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve removed the comment &amp;#8216;study in abstract form only&amp;#8217; for Ringdal 1998 since this is now included in full published form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby: do you think the Ringdal 1998 study should be renamed &amp;#8216;Ringdal 2000&amp;#8217; to reflect the fact that the study appears in 2000 in full publication? I don&amp;#8217;t think it really matters personally but thought it worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of Excluded studies&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve added a note about why the Kannisto 1999 study was excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;TJL: 120104 (update with search results from Jan 2002)&lt;br&gt;This review has now been updated with data from 6 new studies. Very little has altered, and only a few estimates have been affected buy the new data. I have kept a log of the outcomes that were changed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheet. The tendencies was for dichotomous data to be available immediately for verification, extraction and entry. This means that the outcomes that had more data added to them pertained to safety/tolerability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one notable change is reported in the results section of this review for exacerbations requiring OCS treatment, dose ratio 1:1. I have also made a stab at the severity of the baseline patient populations in the new studies and I would greatly appreciate some help with verifying this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added only very little to the discussion so if you want to change anything please do so in red. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggest that at this stage we should keep all the changes to the review that have been made since the initial version of this review was published in red. We can change them back to black when we publish this. &lt;br&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Technical Editing by CJC 4/9/2001&lt;br&gt;Where are Bestall and Jones as co-reviewers on this one? No contributions stated.&lt;br&gt;Synopsis is missing.&lt;br&gt;References and Tables of studies are fine.&lt;br&gt;Metaview is all in order but the negative signs are particularly confusing and may need to be sorted out on this one. Peto OR is now the default for all dichotomous outcomes.&lt;br&gt;Change from baseline has the wrong direction in the text for a single outcome and this has been corrected. (outcome 1~1)&lt;br&gt;ALL NEGATIVE DATA ENTRY HAS BEEN REVERSED AND METAVIEW GRAPH LABELS CHANGED AROUND TO BE CORRECT.&lt;br&gt;I HAVE ALSO RE-ENTERED THE DATA WHICH WAS IN AS A PERCENTAGE: OUTCOMES ARE SORTED. 1~17, 2~12,13,16&lt;br&gt;I am happy for this to go for Peer Review &lt;br&gt;Paul, what are you going to declare as conflict of interest for this set of reviews????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revisions made by NPA 27/11/01&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Synopsis added&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers to Paul's Comments and Sugestions (Email dated 16 November 2001 20:55)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review FP vs BUD and BDP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Referee wanted a comment on the dose ranges studied. I think that it takes up too many words, so have added comments about the sub group analysis. Have I got it correct ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure where these comments were?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Ref wanted the side effects of the 1:2 data to be given since the other data were about that comparison. I think this is fair. I know that the results were a bit inconsistent, but this gives the reader a fair warning. Do you agree ? I have done what he suggested, I hope correctly. Can you check please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, not clear what you mean here - there is a detailed description of the side effects for the 1:2 dose ratio comparisons under 'Safety Measures' - could you clarify?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. The referee (and I) don't understand how many trials were included in the review. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There appear to have been 19 trials from the FP register, 13 from the BDP register and 6 from the BUD register. But in the next sentence it says: &amp;quot;Studies identified from the BDP and BUD Registers meeting the inclusion criteria for this review were an identical set to those identified in the FP Register.&amp;quot;That should make it 13, but there are more than 13 included studies. In the abstract you say that there are 42 studies, but the total from the three registers is 38. Can you clarify please ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers make sense if text read carefully. &lt;br&gt;There were 19 trials identified after searching the electronic FP register. There were 13 studies found on the electronic BDP register, and 6 on the BUD register. Those studies found on the FP register are an identical set to those found independently on the BDP and BUD registers, ie. 13 + 6 = 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the other studies included in the review were found as a result of searching the other non-electronic sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ie a further 13 from respiratory society meeting abstracts, &lt;br&gt;4 hand searching Britsh Journal Clincial Research &lt;br&gt;6 studies from Glaxo Wellcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The total comes to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19 - electronic registers&lt;br&gt;13 - resp soc abstracts&lt;br&gt;4 - hand searching journals&lt;br&gt;6 - Glaxo Wellcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;42 - total &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have rewritten the text a bit to try and make this clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. In para 7 of the Discussion (where you discuss FP dose-response effects) you need to include the reference FP at different doses review - since it will go onto the library this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Please check my revision to a sentence in the Summary of your Discussion. &amp;quot;There appears to be little if any difference between FP and BDP/BUD with regard to their effects on symptoms, rescue beta2 agonist requirement or the likelihood of exacerbations, when given at any nominal daily greater than FP 200 mcg/d and BDP/BUD 400 mcg/d.&amp;quot; Is this correct ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Do you agree with my revision to the conclusion of the Discussion: &amp;quot;A clear recommendation for FP over the older agents cannot be made from the findings of this review, but in the most severe patients FP may confer an advantage over its comparators. This would need to be judged on an individual patient basis, however.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REPLY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes I think this is an important point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have added in the trials from the search update April 1999 - August 2001 and listed them in studies waiting assessment along with an explanatory paragraph under 'Description of Studies'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We would like to draw the reader's attention to the additional eight citations listed under Studies awaiting assessment. Due to unforeseen delays in the publication of this review, a number of potentially relevant trials have been identified after an updated search of the electronic sources from April 1999 - August 2001. These studies will be fully evaluated and included as appropriate in a future update at the earliest possible opportunity. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: **Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma UPDATE&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma UPDATE (WITH CHRIS 190104 - THIS HAS GSK UNPUBLISHED DATA FOR HEINING 1999)&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma (WITH CHRIS 170105)&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma UPDATE (WITH TJL 080205)&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Inhaled fluticasone versus inhaled beclomethasone or inhaled budesonide for chronic asthma in adults and children UPDATE (WITH CHRIS)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2009-09-15 08:55:57 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="FBB-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.21" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="11.2">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>This review compares the effectiveness of three inhaled steroids. Fluticasone (FP) was compared with either beclomethasone (BDP) or budesonide (BUD) for treating people with chronic asthma. When FP was given to children or adults at approximately half the daily dose of either BDP or BUD, it appeared to be at least as effective as the other two drugs in improving airway opening. There was not enough information available to draw conclusions concerning the effect of these drugs on symptoms, or the risk of an acute asthma exacerbation. When given at the same dose as BDP or BUD, FP treated participants had slightly better lung function. However, at the same dose FP was also associated with increased hoarseness, although it did not lead to increased incidences of other side-effects associated with steroids such as oral thrush or sore throat. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) are commonly prescribed inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is newer agent with greater potency in in-vitro assays.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone to Beclomethasone or Budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trial register (January 2007) and reference lists of articles. We contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies for additional studies and searched abstracts of major respiratory society meetings (1997 to 2006).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials in children and adults comparing Fluticasone to either Beclomethasone or Budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and methodological quality. One reviewer extracted data. Quantitative analyses were undertaken using RevMan analyses 1.0.1.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seventy-one studies (14,602 participants) representing 74 randomised comparisons met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was fair. <B>
<U>Dose ratio 1:2:</U>
</B> FP produced a significantly greater end of treatment FEV1 (0.04 litres (95% CI 0 to 0.07 litres), end of treatment and change in morning PEF, but not change in FEV1 or evening PEF. This applied to all drug doses, age groups, and delivery devices. No difference between FP and BDP/BUD were seen for trial withdrawals. FP led to fewer symptoms and less rescue medication use. When given at half the dose of BDP/BUD, FP led to a greater likelihood of pharyngitis. There was no difference in the likelihood of oral candidiasis. Plasma cortisol and 24 hour urinary cortisol was measured frequently but data presentation was limited. <B>
<U>Dose ratio 1:1: </U>
</B>FP produced a statistically significant difference in morning PEF, evening PEF, and FEV1 over BDP or BUD. The effects on exacerbations were mixed. There were no significant differences incidence of hoarseness, pharyngitis, candidiasis, or cough.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Fluticasone given at half the daily dose of beclomethasone or budesonide leads to small improvements in measures of airway calibre, but it appears to have a higher risk of causing sore throat and when given at the same daily dose leads to increased hoarseness. There are concerns about adrenal suppression with Fluticasone given to children at doses greater than 400 mcg/day, but the randomised trials included in this review did not provide sufficient data to address this issue.<BR/>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have become the mainstay of therapy for chronic asthma, and are recommended for use in recent guidelines for all patients except those with mild, intermittent symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>). Fluticasone propionate (FP) is the most recently licensed ICS for the treatment of asthma in children and adults, and joins a stable of older agents including beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD).</P>
<P>With an expanding range of drugs to choose from it is important to establish their relative efficacy and safety. All ICS's share close chemical and structural similarities. However, pharmacodynamic differences could lead to differences in their clinical effects. Potency, a measure of the microgram dose of drug required to produce a standard response, is greater for FP than either BDP or BUD. When assessed in the in-vitro skin blanching test FP is twice as potent as BDP (<LINK REF="REF-Phillipps-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillipps 1990</LINK>), and 25% more potent than BUD (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>). Similar rank order potencies have been shown for other assays of anti-inflammatory activity including inhibition of basophil histamine release, eosinophil viability and expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in cultured bronchial epithelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Stellato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stellato 1999</LINK>). FP also exhibits considerably greater glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding affinity when compared to BDP and BUD (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>). These factors could lead to greater clinical potency of FP, i.e. a lower microgram dose required to produce equal or better asthma control compared to BDP or BUD due action at sites in the lung. However, potential advantages in this respect are only important if they are not achieved at the expense of increased systemic drug activity. Increased potency at active sites in the lung may be offset when FP becomes systemically available. Higher potency at the site of the pulmonary GR will be mirrored by higher potency at the site of systemic GR's. This factor, associated with the longer elimination half life (<LINK REF="REF-Thorsson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorsson 1997</LINK>) and higher lipophilicity (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1998</LINK>) of FP compared to the older inhaled steroids should lead to longer tissue retention times, and could lead to enhanced endogenous glucocorticoid suppression and increased exogenous steroid related side effects. Single dose and repeated dose short term studies (&lt;one week) have shown that FP leads to significantly greater reductions in morning plasma cortisol and overnight urinary cortisol excretion when compared to BUD at equal nominal daily dose (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lipworth 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>A previous systematic review has assessed the relative efficacy of FP versus BDP and BUD (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1998</LINK>). However, this review has a number of weaknesses including the lack of a well-documented search strategy, clearly defined inclusion criteria or an assessment of methodological quality. In addition, a number of trials have become available since this review was published.</P>
<P>Relative efficacy/side effect ratios need to be considered when the performance of ICS's is compared in clinical practice. The objectives of this review will be to compare efficacy and safety outcomes in studies that have compared FP to either BDP or BUD in the treatment of chronic asthma. This is the second substantive update of fluticasone in comparison with beclomethasone or budesonide (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005a</LINK>). </P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered only prospective, randomised controlled trials. Parallel group and crossover studies were eligible, in both children and adults. We excluded studies assessing infants (under the age of two years). A diagnosis of chronic asthma was necessary.

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We reviewed studies in children and/or adults. We excluded studies assessing infants (i.e. under the age of two years). Patients needed to have a diagnosis of chronic asthma, we did not consider studies concerning acute asthma. We considered studies conducted in primary care, hospital outpatient and institutional care.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>FP delivered by mouth inhalation versus either BDP or BUD. We considered any dose of FP compared to any dose of either BDP or BUD, but the nominal daily dose of each inhaled steroid had to be stated. We calculated the nominal daily dose as the actuator dose multiplied by the number of doses administered per day. Treatment periods had to be one week or longer. Delivery devices allowed including metered dose inhalers (MDI) with or without spacer/chamber and dry powder inhalers (DPI's). We specifically excluded trials using nebulisers. For the December 2003 update we only included studies that compared FP with BDP/BUD with identical propellants. Studies that randomised participants to a stable versus step-down treatment protocol were excluded. Studies assessing the effects of step-down therapy were included where down-titration was attempted in both treatment groups.</P>
<P>Comparisons between FP and HFA-BDP are considered in a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Lasserson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lasserson 2006</LINK>). </P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:03:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>One reviewer (NPA) extracted data for each outcome from the published results of included trials. In the case of continuous outcomes (such as FEV1), only data from the last time point can be evaluated. We extracted data from graphical plots when presented in this form; attempt was made to verify such data by contacting authors. It should be noted that we displayed continuous outcome data using negative figures, as the sign convention built into the software interprets smaller numbers as favourable (as is the case for dichotomous outcomes such as asthma exacerbation rates). This ensures that results favouring FP are consistently displayed to the left of the zero effect line in MetaView and results favouring BDP/BUD are consistently displayed to the right.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:57:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias for each included study according to recommendations described in the <LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-Handbook" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane Handbook</LINK>. We have assessed the risk of bias for the generation and concealment of allocation schedules for the eligible studies, and blinding of treatment preparations. We have judged the degree of bias for each domain to be of high risk (No), low risk (Yes) or unclear risk (Unclear). Our previous approach is described in <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=50B6E5AE82E26AA20079F0ECC7A2DD2E&amp;format=REVMAN#APP-01">Appendix 1</A>.</P>

<P>In order to minimise the influence of publication bias on the continuous variables in our analyses, we have imputed data where it is otherwise not available. Where means and a P value were published we have calculated the variance of the study based on the P value. Where data are reported without SDs, we have imputed an average SD for the FP and BDP/BUD groups based upon those reported for the other data sets in the analysis, provided that there are at least three other trials. We report the data from estimates where the greatest number of estimates were available (i.e. where values have been imputed or estimated). We have retained analyses of data where SDs were originally available. These data are reported separately but we have retained both sets of analyses.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:05:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using RevMan 4.2. For continuous outcomes, we calculated a mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD) using generic inverse variance (GIV) where appropriate. As the GIV function has become available prior to the publication of this review, we have converted data from previous MD analyses in order to combine in with data from new studies reported as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Where previous effect estimates were calculated with two means and two SDs for the treatment groups, we have taken the mean difference and 95% CIs for MDs and converted the estimate to a mean difference and SEM. Where data have been available as mean differences with a 95% CI, we have calculated a SEM (standard error of the mean) for the mean difference and entered this in RevMan. We have retained all data initially analysed as MDs.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated Peto Odds Ratio's (OR). Pooled treatments effects are expressed with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A fixed effect model was used throughout. A number of <I>a priori</I> conditions were established regarding the comparisons made:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Studies were distinguished as those in which participants were: (a) not treated with regular oral corticosteroid (OCS); (b) dependent upon regular OCS treatment prior to study. Trials involving OCS-dependent participants in which the efficacy of ICS was being assessed may have had an 'OCS down-titration' design using reduction in the use of oral steroid as an outcome measure, whilst maintaining a given level of asthma control. However, studies in which patients were not treated with regular OCS are more likely to have a design aimed at detecting improvements in asthma control. It is inappropriate to combine trials with these different designs and objectives.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Populations</HEADING>
<P>Thirty-seven trials were multi-centre studies. These were conducted largely in Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Norway, The Netherlands, UK and Poland). In nine of these studies, participants were also recruited from other areas of the world (Australia, Canada, Indonesia, South Africa and New Zealand). Two multi centre studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murray-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Raphael-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Raphael 1999a</LINK>) were conducted in the USA and one in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>). Three single centre studies were conducted in India (<LINK REF="STD-Parakh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Parakh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 2004</LINK>). One single centre study was conducted in Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Ige-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ige 2002</LINK>). The remaining single centre studies were conducted in either Australia, Canada or countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Four studies recruited participants exclusively from primary care in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Langdon-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Langdon 1994a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Langdon-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Langdon 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Basran-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Basran 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1999</LINK> recruited participants from both primary and secondary care. All other studies were conducted in a secondary care/hospital outpatient clinic setting. 14 studies were in children; all remaining studies were conducted in adolescents and adults.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Fifty-nine studies employed a parallel group design, 14 studies were of crossover design. Only four crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bootsma-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bootsma 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolthers-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wolthers 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringdal-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ringdal 2000</LINK>) employed an inhaled steroid-free washout period between treatment periods. In one study the design was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Majer_x002d_Teboul-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Majer-Teboul 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thirteen studies had treatment periods of a month or less, we extracted data from one study at a 5 week cut-off for stable steroid treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Kuna-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kuna 2003</LINK>). Forty-seven studies had treatment periods of between 6 weeks to 5 months. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heinig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heinig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>) had a treatment period of six months, whilst seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Egan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Egan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabbri-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fabbri 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lorentzen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Lorentzen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Benedictis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">de Benedictis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lundback-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lundback 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1999</LINK>) had treatment periods of 12 months or longer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In 33 studies, participants were randomised to receive FP or BDP. In 37 studies participants received FP or BUD. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 2004</LINK>) participants were randomised to one of two parallel treatment arms: either FP, or BDP/BUD.</P>
<P>In the majority of studies, participants received the ICS to which they had been randomised at a constant dose throughout the treatment period. In 38 studies participants were randomised to receive FP and either BDP or BUD in a nominal daily dose ratio of 1:2. In 22 studies, FP and BDP or BUD were administered at an equal nominal daily dose ratio i.e. 1:1. In two studies there were multiple dose ratio comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLIP01" TYPE="STUDY">FLIP01</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FLIP01a" TYPE="STUDY">FLIP01a</LINK>). In one study the dose ratio was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997a</LINK> used a dose down-titration design. Participants were randomised to either FP or BUD. Over the course of the treatment period, the ICS dose was down-titrated to the minimum required to maintain asthma control at a pre-defined level. The main outcome measures in this study were the number of dose reduction steps and the minimal daily dose of ICS required to maintain acceptable control.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Delivery device</HEADING>
<P>A tabulated summary of the devices used in each study is provided in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Aerosol metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and a variety of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) were used. In 29 studies, the same delivery device was used for both FP and BDP/BUD treatment groups. This was mainly the case in studies that compared FP to BDP (26 studies). In only three studies of those that compared FP to BUD was the same delivery device used for both treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Ayres-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ayres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Langdon-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Langdon 1994b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1999b</LINK>). In the remainder of studies where the delivery device was stated, different devices were used for each ICS treatment arm. In the majority of studies that compared FP to BUD, FP treated participants used either the Diskhaler or Accuhaler DPI whilst BUD was administered using the Turbohaler/Turbuhaler. Inhaler device was unclear in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-FLPB0145" TYPE="STUDY">FLPB0145</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vedanthan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Vedanthan 2004</LINK>). We have included data where available, and pooled with that of other studies. There may be differences in the relative efficacy of CFC and HFA driven FP, which may explain heterogeneity on certain outcomes. With the phasing out of CFC inhalers, it is likely that future studies will be conducted with CFC-free inhaler devices.</P>
<P>In five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Egan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Egan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fabbri-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fabbri 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leblanc-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Leblanc 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ayres-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ayres 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1998</LINK>) all participants received treatment using a metered dose inhaler, but were given the option of using a large volume spacer, provided use remained constant throughout the study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Prior treatment with corticosteroids</HEADING>
<P>A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Lundback-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lundback 1993</LINK>) recruited oral steroid dependent asthmatics with the objective of assessing the relative prednisolone sparing effect of FP and BUD. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ayres-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ayres 1995</LINK>) recruited severe asthmatics, a proportion of whom were receiving maintenance oral corticosteroids at the time of enrolment, but no attempt was made to taper prednisolone use during the trial. In all other studies, the participants were not receiving regular oral corticosteroids at the time of enrolment; indeed this was usually a specific exclusion criterion. In the majority of these studies (74%) however, some or all participants were using a regular inhaled corticosteroid at enrolment (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In all cases, this was stopped at the point of randomisation when study medications were started.</P>

<P>We have presented results expressing differences where FP is the treatment intervention, and BDP or BUD the control intervention.</P>
<P>Categorisation of studies based on these features resulted in the generation of five main comparison groups:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Group 1. Parallel group studies in non-OCS treated asthmatics, comparing FP to BDP/BUD at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio.</LI>

<LI>Group 3. Parallel group studies in oral steroid treated asthmatics comparing FP to BDP or BUD at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio.</LI>
<LI>Group 4. Crossover studies in non-OCS treated patients comparing FP to BDP/BUD at 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio.</LI>
<LI>Group 5. Crossover studies in non-OCS treated asthmatics, comparing FP to BDP/ BUD at a 1:1 nominal daily dose ratio.</LI>

<P>
<BR/>We did not find any crossover studies in OCS treated participants that met the inclusion criteria. Results of meta-analysis of studies with the characteristics defined by Groups 1 and 2 are shown in Comparisons 01 and 02. Few studies had the characteristics defined by Groups 4 and 5. These findings have been entered in the review, but there is no narrative discussion of the pooled results from these studies.</P>
<P>We considered the single dose reduction design study (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997a</LINK>) separately and its results are discussed below. We undertook sensitivity analyses based on methodological quality and the data were re-analysed using only studies of higher quality (Jadad score three to five). Subgroup analyses (as outlined under Methods) were planned. However, this could only be undertaken for some of the outcomes reported in the parallel group studies in non-OCS treated participants that compared FP to BDP/BUD at a nominal daily dose ratios of 1:1 and 1:2.</P>

<P>Absolute: Fixed effect: 0.04 litres (95% CI 0 to 0.07 litres); random effects: 0.06 (-0.01 to 0.13), 17 studies, N = 3640. See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>.<BR/>There was a high degree of heterogeneity (64.5 %), which disappeared when <LINK REF="STD-Ige-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ige 2002</LINK> was removed from the analysis. This resulted in a significant difference of 0.04 litres (95% CI 0 to 0.08). Although the <LINK REF="STD-Ige-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ige 2002</LINK> study reported an effect that seemed out of step with the other studies, we could not find a particularly convincing reason why this was so. Imbalances between treatment groups at baseline (duration of asthma symptoms: FP 5.2 years versus BDP 10.9 years) possibly influenced by the inappropriate method of randomisation (odd and even numbers) coupled with the small sample size (N = 20), could make the effect estimate more prone to error than those of other trials. Removing open label and single-blind studies gave a non-significant difference (0.02 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.06).</P>
<P>Change from baseline: MD 0.01 litres (95% CI -0.02 to 0.04 litres, 12 studies, N = 2635).

The Raphael data sets are drawn from the same study and so more likely show similar responses to treatment.

In this carefully conducted study, 219 children with moderately severe asthma first entered an evaluation period during which time their usual daily dose of BUD administered via MDI+Nebuhaler spacer was titrated to the point at which deterioration in control was considered to have occurred. Criteria for loss of control were specified a priori, and were based around daytime, night-time and exercise-related symptoms, rescue beta-2 agonist use or clinical deterioration as judged by investigators. Participants requiring BUD at a daily dose of 400 or 800 mcg/d were then randomised to receive half the nominal daily baseline dose of either FP or BUD i.e. 200 or 400 mcg/d. FP was administered using a Diskhaler DPI, BUD using a Turbohaler DPI. During the first five weeks of the study participants received treatment at the dose to which they were randomised. Following this, dose reduction was attempted. Using pre-defined criteria for acceptable control (based around symptoms, rescue beta-2 agonist use, morning PEF and post exercise fall in FEV1/FEF 25-75 compared to baseline) a 50% dose reduction was attempted at five weekly intervals. Doses were reduced until either control deteriorated, or a daily dose of 100 mcg was reached. The primary outcome measures were the mean number of dose reductions steps achievable, and the minimal effective dose of ICS. No significant difference was apparent between FP and BUD treatment groups either in terms of dose reduction steps (FP 1.65 versus BUD 1.59) or in terms of the minimal effective dose of ICS (FP 180 mcg/d versus BUD 188 mcg/d).</P>

This study has only been published in abstract form. 74 adult asthmatics requiring treatment with at least 5 mg/d of oral prednisolone and 800 mcg/d of inhaled steroid were randomised to treatment with either FP 1500 mcg/d via the Diskhaler DPI or BUD 1600 mcg/d via the Turbohaler DPI. Few methodological details were available, including whether or not a run-in period to establish the minimal effective dose of prednisolone was employed, or whether pre-defined criteria for oral steroid dose reduction were used. A significantly greater number of patients (37 out of 40) were able to discontinue oral prednisolone with FP compared to BUD treated participants (25 out of 34), although no difference between treatment groups was apparent in terms of the daily oral prednisolone dose.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Non-oral steroid sparing design</HEADING>
<P>A single parallel group study (<LINK REF="STD-Ayres-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ayres 1995</LINK>) of fair methodological quality (Jadad score three) was conducted in adult asthmatic participants with moderate to severe asthma. Eleven per cent of patients were also receiving oral prednisolone (&lt; 10 mg/d) at the time of enrolment. Participants were randomised to receive FP 1000 mcg/d, FP 2000 mcg/d or BUD 1600 mcg/d over a six week treatment period. They used a MDI delivery device, and were given the option of using a large volume spacer. No attempt was made to taper oral steroid use in participants treated with prednisolone.</P>
<P>A number of outcome measures were reported (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Both daily doses of FP led to significant improvements in a number of measures when compared to BUD. No significant differences between FP 1000 mcg/d and BUD 1600 mcg/d were apparent in terms of daytime and night-time symptoms although FP 2000 mcg/d led to a significantly greater reduction in daytime and night-time symptom scores and use of night-time rescue beta-2 agonist. No significant differences were seen between either daily dose of FP and BUD in terms of oropharyngeal side effects, although FP 2000 mcg/d led to a significantly greater reduction in morning plasma cortisol level compared to BUD 1600 mcg/d.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SENSITIVITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSES</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses based on study quality excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Connolly-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Connolly 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>). This did not lead to a significant difference in the size or direction of effect for any of the pooled estimates to which these studies contributed.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were undertaken for FEV1 outcomes reported in the parallel group studies in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics that compared FP to BDP/BUD at a nominal daily dose ratio of 1:2 and 1:1. These were done with the purpose of : (a) identifying potential groups who appeared to show differences in response to treatment and (b) exploring sources of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>FEV1 measures were significantly better in FP treated participants compared to BDP/BUD treated participants. These studies included children and adults (treated with both BDP and BUD), participants with asthma of mild to moderate/severe disease, delivery devices that were the same in the two treatment groups (e.g. FP and BDP/BUD via MDI) or different between groups (e.g. FP via Diskhaler or Accuhaler and BUD via Turbohaler). No heterogeneity was found in the pooled treatment effect and subgroup analyses did not identify any groups that showed a clear difference in response to treatment. However there did appear to be a trend for higher dose range comparisons (FP 500 versus BDP/BUD 1200 mcg/d, FP 800 versus BDP/BUD 1600 mcg/d) to show a greater difference in favour of FP, when<B> </B>

Although such factors may be important in determining response, this conclusion can only be speculative. No difference in the likelihood of withdrawal was seen when comparing FP to BDP/BUD. Subgroup analyses did not identify any potential groups of participants or studies defined by specific characteristics in which significant treatment differences were apparent.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-25 16:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>This review has assessed the relative efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate when compared to beclomethasone and budesonide in the treatment of chronic asthma in moderately severe, symptomatic patients from 64 studies (13,634 participants). At a nominal dose ratio of 1:2 we have demonstrated that FP is at least as effective as BDP on clinical outcomes such as FEV1 and exacerbations, but could be more effective than BDP/BUD on morning peak flow. At a dose ratio of 1:1, we now have evidence that FP is marginally superior to BDP on certain measures of lung function such as am/pm PEF, FVC and FEV1. However, we noted that change from baseline outcomes for lung function and the effect of FP on exacerbations gave more equivocal findings.<BR/>
</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Airway calibre </HEADING>
<P>The largest group of participants assessed were those in which FP was compared to either BDP or BUD at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio, in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics. In the studies of this type that used a parallel group design, FP resulted either in significantly higher measurements of airway calibre compared with BDP/BUD, or in results which strongly indicated that there was little in the way of clinically meaningful difference between dose ratios. Children and adults, with asthma ranging in severity from mild to severe, treated with both BDP and BUD were included. Generally, there was little heterogeneity present when the studies were pooled, suggesting that the observed treatment effects apply to all patients represented by the studies. Subgroup analyses suggested the possibility that effects in favour of FP may be greater in patients with more severe disease treated at higher dose comparisons. Some support for this hypothesis comes from the single, large parallel study that assessed the relative efficacy of FP versus BUD in adults with severe asthma, some of whom were oral steroid treated at the time of enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Ayres-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ayres 1995</LINK>). In this study, FP 1000 mcg/d resulted in significantly greater improvements in FEV1 and morning PEF compared to BUD 1600 mcg/d. These results suggest that clinically relevant differences in effect are unlikely to be seen when FP and BDP/BUD are used at a 1:2 daily dose ratio. A logical extension of this relationship would be for even greater benefits favouring FP to be seen when given at equal nominal daily dose to BDP or BUD. However, no significant difference between the inhaled steroids were seen when data from trials comparing agents at a 1:1 dose ratio reporting change from baseline values for the same outcomes. The apparent paradox between the outcomes for the different dose ratio comparisons may be due to a number of factors. The greater number of trials and the greater statistical power of the pooled estimate of absolute score outcomes could explain the difference between these findings.</P>
<P>Few crossover studies assessed airways function in a way that could be analysed. No difference between FP and BDP/BUD was apparent, but few studies could be pooled. Although all studies were of high methodological quality, washout periods between treatments were not always used and the possibility of carryover effects that masked true treatment differences could not be excluded. In summary, the results of the parallel group study analysis are more reliable.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Symptoms and beta-2 agonist use</HEADING>
<P>It is difficult to draw conclusions concerning the relative efficacy of FP and BDP/BUD in reducing symptoms and rescue beta-2 agonist use. Few numerical outcome data were available, different scales of measurement were used and the possibilities for pooling results across studies were limited. However, no individual studies (either of parallel group design or crossover design) demonstrated a significant difference between FP and BDP/BUD at a 1:2 dose ratio or at a 1:1 dose ratio. For the few instances in which data could be pooled where two studies reported symptoms measured using the same metric scale, no overall difference between treatment groups was seen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Asthma exacerbations</HEADING>
<P>A number of parallel group studies reported trial withdrawal due to an asthma exacerbation. Although varying criteria for withdrawal were used, the underlying nature of the outcome assessed (worsening asthma control) was the same. It was considered appropriate therefore to pool these studies. No difference between FP and BDP/BUD at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio was apparent and there was no heterogeneity, suggesting a consistent response across studies independent of the criteria used to define withdrawal. The likelihood of withdrawal due to asthma exacerbation cannot be considered equivalent to asthma exacerbations leading to emergency dept or GP attendance, but may be a reasonable surrogate for these.</P>
<P>In summary, data from trials that compared FP to BDP/BUD at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio suggest that FP and the older corticosteroids cannot be considered equivalent with respect to clinical efficacy. The greater improvements in FEV1 and PEF when administered at half the nominal daily dose of BDP/BUD suggest that the higher potency of FP demonstrated in laboratory studies is reflected in certain outcomes relevant to clinical practice. Against this, no studies found significant differences in terms of symptoms, rescue beta-2 agonist use or asthma exacerbations. Although this cannot be taken to mean that FP at half daily dose is equivalent to BDP/BUD at full dose, it does suggest that clinically relevant differences in effect are unlikely to be seen when FP and BDP/BUD are used at a 1:2 daily dose ratio. Previous reviews have examined the dose response relationships for BDP, BUD and FP (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). Although each ICS is effective in improving airway function compared to placebo, no dose response effect for daytime symptom scores, rescue beta-2 agonist use or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was apparent for any of these agents over wide dose ranges in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics. In the light of this fact it should not be surprising that differences between FP and BDP/BUD were not seen in the studies included in this review, irrespective of dose ratios compared.</P>
<P>In a previous review, we have shown that FP exhibits a dose response effect for FEV1 and morning PEF (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). Larger daily doses lead to greater improvements compared to lower doses. A logical expectation would be for even greater benefits favouring FP to be seen when given at equal nominal daily dose to BDP or BUD. This has not been clearly demonstrated in the current review. However, fewer studies made such a comparison and an overall pooled analysis across studies was not possible. Less weight should therefore be given to these findings, and they do not undermine the more powerful analysis that was possible for the studies that compared FP to BDP/BUD at a 1:2 dose ratio. The findings for the parallel group studies that compared FP to BDP/BUD at the 1:2 dose ratio also appear to be inconsistent with the single dose reduction study (<LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997a</LINK>). In that study, acceptable asthma control was maintained with mean daily doses of FP and BUD that were not significantly different. Given the results from the FP versus BDP/BUD 1:2 ratio analysis, one would expect to see lower doses of FP necessary to maintain control. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is that in <LINK REF="STD-Agertoft-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Agertoft 1997a</LINK> a minimum daily dose threshold of 100 mcg was set at which no further dose reductions were attempted. Although the investigators speculate that deterioration in control was likely if doses had been reduced below this threshold, this was not directly tested, so it is not possible to exclude the possibility that further dose reduction steps could have been achieved. This could have masked a difference in the dose of FP and BUD required to achieve equivalent asthma control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Health Status </HEADING>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molimard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Molimard 2005</LINK>) reported health status measured using an asthma-specific instrument. In two of these studies of different designs, significantly better scores were seen for patients receiving FP compared to BDP. Further studies are required to confirm the effects observed in these studies, and would also help to establish the consistency of these effects in milder asthma, where the impact of disease on daily living may not be as profound.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oral steroid-sparing effect</HEADING>
<P>Little trial evidence exists regarding the relative oral steroid-sparing efficacy of FP and BDP or BUD. Only one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Lundback-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lundback 1997</LINK>) addressed this question. This study remains unpublished and data have been made available regarding this trial by GSK. Important design characteristics of such trials should include (a) a prolonged run-in period to allow patients to have their prednisolone dose weaned to the minimum required to maintain asthma control prior to randomisation;(b) prednisolone dose reduction should be undertaken according to pre-defined criteria based around acceptable asthma control. Only in this manner can unbiased estimations be made of the relative efficacy of different interventions. Unpublished information revealed that oral steroid dose was in fact increased to achieve maximum control and stability at baseline. Therefore, although<B> </B>

<B> </B>found that FP 1500 mcg/d allowed significantly more patients to discontinue oral prednisolone when compared to BUD 1600 mcg/d. Interpretation of these results therefore requires caution, as they could reflect the fact that participants received a higher than necessary dose of oral steroids.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Adrenal Function</HEADING>
<P>Accurate assessment of the relative effects of FP versus BDP/BUD on markers of adrenal function were difficult to make using the data available for this review. When comparisons of FP to BDP/BUD at a nominal daily dose ratio of 1:2 were made, a meta-analysis of the few parallel group studies (<LINK REF="STD-Berend-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Berend 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rao 1999</LINK>) and crossover studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bootsma-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bootsma 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pauwels-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pauwels 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malo 1999</LINK>) did not find a significant differences between treatment groups. The few individual studies that assessed this outcome when FP and BDP/BUD were compared at equal nominal doses did not find any difference. It was not possible to calculate a pooled treatment effect across studies because numerical data were reported incompletely. This also meant that assessment of the relative influence of FP versus BDP/BUD across the a range inhaled corticosteroid doses (e.g. 100 FP versus 200 BDP/BUD, 500 FP versus 1000 BDP/BUD, 1000 FP versus 2000 BDP/BUD) could not be done. Single dose and short term (&lt; one week) studies have demonstrated that FP results in a significantly greater suppression of plasma cortisol than BUD when compared at equal nominal daily dose over a range of 400 to 2000 mcg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1996b</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1998</LINK>). A recent meta-regression analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1999</LINK>) that included these studies also concluded that FP is significantly more potent that BUD in suppressing morning plasma cortisol, in other words that FP leads to greater suppression of levels than BUD when given at equal daily dose. This effect was more pronounced at higher nominal daily doses. The findings of this review are consistent with that analysis. The absence of differences between FP and BDP/BUD when compared at a dose ratio of 1:2 are consistent with a higher potency of FP in terms of cortisol suppression. The absence of significant differences between FP and BDP/BUD in the individual studies that assessed the drugs at a 1:1 nominal daily dose ratio may be explained by issues related to the timing of cortisol measurements. In all of the longer term studies included in this review, cortisol measurements were made within a two hour time window between 8 am and 10.00 am. In the short term studies that were not eligible for inclusion, cortisol measurements were taken at a strictly standardised time of either 7.30 or 8.00 am. Estimations over a time frame of 2 hours have been shown to be substantially less sensitive in detecting change compared to those taken at closely controlled times, with up to three fold differences in levels occurring between 8.00 am and 10.00 am in healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Lonnebo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lonnebo 1996</LINK>). The greater variability introduced into estimations made over a two hour time frame may have masked any true differences between FP and BDP/BUD in terms of their effects on morning cortisol levels. Recent concern about the link between high dose FP and adrenal suppression in children has been raised, with data suggesting that adrenal suppression can occur in children prescribed more than 400 mcg/day of the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Paton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paton 2006</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol, a more sensitive assay of basal adrenocortical activity than morning plasma cortisol, was not reported frequently. This measurement should not be subject to the same difficulties in interpretation as plasma cortisol. The majority of studies (both parallel group and crossover), that assessed FP versus BDP/BUD at either a 1:1 or 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio did not find significant differences between FP and the other two drugs. A recent meta-regression analysis of a different group of short term studies (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1999</LINK>) suggested that FP is more potent than BDP/BUD in suppressing 24 hour urinary cortisol levels. The findings of the individual studies included here are not consistent with this. This difference may be a real phenomenon, however, these relatively small trials may not have had sufficient power to detect true differences. Since we were unable to calculate an overall pooled treatment effect due to limitations in the presentation of the primary trial results, this remains uncertain.</P>
<P>In summary, this review does not permit firm conclusions to be drawn with regard to the relative effect of FP versus BDP/BUD on morning plasma cortisol or 24 hour urinary cortisol levels in randomised trials with treatment periods of one week or longer.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Oropharyngeal side-effects</HEADING>
<P>When compared to BDP/BUD at a nominal daily dose ratio of 1:1, FP results in a significantly greater likelihood of hoarseness, although no difference was apparent when FP and BDP/BUD were compared at a dose ratio of 1:2. This suggests that the greater potency of FP, reflected in a number of measures of efficacy, also leads to greater likelihood of this pharmacologically predictable side effect when FP is given at an equal nominal dose compared to either BDP or BUD.</P>
<P>No difference between FP and BDP/BUD in terms of the likelihood of oral candidiasis was seen when given at either a 1:2 or a 1:1 nominal daily dose ratio, suggesting a greater margin of safety exists when considering this outcome.</P>
<P>FP was significantly more likely to result in sore throat when compared to BDP/BUD given in a nominal dose ratio of 1:2, but there was no difference between FP and BDP/BUD when given at a dose ratio of 1:1. This discrepancy is difficult to account for. A larger number of studies assessed the 1:2 dose ratio comparison and a more powerful meta-analysis was possible. Whilst differences in analytical power may account for this discrepancy, this suggestion can only be speculative, especially since there is significant heterogeneity between the 1:2 dose ratio studies. Overall the results provide a sufficient level of evidence to suggest that FP is more likely to lead to sore throat when used in clinical practice when compared to BDP/BUD.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Methodological considerations</HEADING>
<P>A number of included studies have been presented at respiratory society meetings, and published in abstract form only. At the time of writing, these had not been published as full journal papers, and include the following: Pickering 1996; <LINK REF="STD-Bisca-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bisca 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dal-Negro-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Dal Negro 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Joubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kemmerich-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kemmerich 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melaranci-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Melaranci 1999</LINK>. Limited details were available concerning the characteristics of the participants enrolled and trial methodology. Clinically relevant outcomes were reported, but numerical data were rarely presented. Grading of these studies using the Jadad scoring system has generally resulted in low scores (1 or 2). However, this is likely to be an underestimation of their true quality and is probably a reflection of the limited information presented in meeting abstracts. Previous versions of this review did not incorporate findings from certain studies which may have biased summary estimates. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> indicates that some data from studies missing from the original weighted mean differences in spite of requests. GIV has led to greater flexibility in the analysis of data from published and unpublished sources, and we have been able to incorporate some of the data previously missing from the analysis. Several of these calculations pertain to non-significant data which were under-reported in published papers. Whilst our analyses go some way to addressing publication bias, they do not replace analyses of raw data. The outcomes where data have been imputed or estimated do not suggest that there was a significant impact on the original summary estimates.</P>
<P>A comprehensive search for relevant studies was undertaken. It is possible that additional studies were missed, or were not retrieved because they have not been published in any of the sources examined. Extensive searching of the GSK trials register (www.ctr.gsk.co.uk), who market Flixotide and have sponsored many of the studies included, identified considerable amounts of unpublished data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The results of this review suggest that FP, when used at half the nominal daily dose of BDP or BUD leads to greater improvements in FEV1, morning PEF and evening PEF in non-oral steroid treated asthmatics. This appears to be the case for both children and adults, with disease ranging in severity from mild to severe, irrespective of the delivery devices used for each drug. These differences are likely to be a reflection of the higher potency exhibited by FP in laboratory assays of anti-inflammatory activity. There appears to be little if any difference between FP and BDP/BUD with regard to their effects on symptoms, rescue beta-2 agonist requirement or the likelihood of exacerbations, when given at any nominal daily dose greater than FP 200 mcg/d and BDP/BUD 400 mcg/d. This conclusion needs to be viewed with some caution, since a pooled treatment effect across studies was not easily calculated. However, it is consistent with the lack of dose response seen for these outcomes demonstrated in other reviews of inhaled corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Adams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 2005</LINK>). Too few studies have reported functional health status to draw clear conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of FP and BDP/BUD. However, two fair quality studies have reported the results of a validated, disease-specific instrument that did find improvements in favour of FP when compared to BDP at a 1:2 nominal daily dose ratio. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of a single study that FP at 1000 mcg/d is more effective than BUD in allowing a larger proportion of oral steroid dependent patients to stop treatment without deterioration in asthma control. The clinical significance of the small improvements that can be expected in FEV1 and morning PEF when patients are treated with FP is hard to assess. If this were accompanied by a lower risk of systemic side effects, in terms of interference with HPA function, there would be a case for recommending FP as a first line anti-inflammatory corticosteroid in non-oral steroid asthmatics. However, the trial evidence concerning the relative effects of FP versus BDP/BUD at any nominal daily dose comparison on morning plasma cortisol levels or 24 hour urinary cortisol excretion is difficult to interpret. An overall therapeutic ratio (i.e. advantageous efficacy effects versus systemic side effects) cannot be constructed for each ICS. A clear recommendation for FP over the older agents cannot be made on the basis of every outcome from this review, but in the most severe patients FP may confer an advantage over BDP or BUD. This, however, would need to be judged on an individual patient basis.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Current asthma management guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1997</LINK>) recommend inhaled corticosteroids for all asthmatics except those with mild, intermittent symptoms. Prior assumptions that FP given at equal nominal daily dose to BDP and BUD results in greater clinical efficacy now seem justified by the assembled evidence. The results of this review lend support to the recommendation that when initiating the use of an inhaled steroid, FP can be given at half the daily dose compared to either BDP or BUD without clinically significant differences in asthma control being encountered, and may even lead to small additional improvements in certain measures, including FEV1 and diary card PEF. However, it is not possible to assess whether this is associated with a reduced risk of HPA function disturbance. The additional recommendation that individual patients have dose titrated to the minimum required to maintain control and thereby minimise any potential (unknown) risk of long-term systemic side effects seems sensible.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The development of a standardised, validated scoring system for the assessment of symptoms is needed in order that better comparisons across studies can be made. </P>
<P>Assessment of health status, using disease-specific instruments, may be a more sensitive tool for detecting variations in efficacy, when comparing inhaled steroids. This has rarely been reported, and future studies need to include this measure.</P>
<P>Hospital and GP attendance rates, due to asthma exacerbation have not been reported. Future studies comparing inhaled steroids need to consider such outcomes, which will be important in health economic evaluations. </P>
<P>A complete picture of the relative value of different inhaled steroids can only be gained if efficacy/systemic side effect ratios can be constructed for each agent. Disturbance of HPA function is one aspect of systemic activity. Complete reporting of data for overnight and 24-hour urinary cortisol measures, and more precise measurements of morning cortisol levels in primary studies would improve the accuracy of future updates of this review, and allow a better understanding of these issues.</P>
<P>The advent of CFC-free propellants in inhaler devices may enhance the potency of the steroids they deliver, but this effect may be restricted to those preparations which were previously less potent than FP. Given the message of this review with regards to relative efficacy, establishing equivalence for the new generation propellants is a key research priority for future studies. We recommend that studies should be conducted which assess similar dose ratios to those examined in this review, in order to determine to what extent HFA-BDP and FP may be deemed equally effective.</P>

<P>': (1) INITIAL ELECTRONIC SEARCH: 6494 citations retrieved, 2162 unique citations (details in Table 04). The 19 trials identified from the FP Register were an identical set to the 13 studies from the BDP Register and the six studies from the BUD Register. In other words a total of 19 unique trials were included as a result of searching all three Registers.(2) OTHER SOURCES: Thirteen studies (Berend 2001; Bisca 1997; Dal Negro 1997; Steinmetz 1997; de Benedictis 2001; Johansson 1998; Joubert 1998; Lundback 1997; Murray 1998; Ringdal 2000; Hughes 1999a; Kemmerich 1999; Melaranci 1999) were identified as a result of searching respiratory society meeting proceedings. Four studies (Langdon 1994a; Langdon 1994b; Connolly 1995; Basran 1997) were identified as a result of hand-searching the British Journal of Clinical Research and the European Journal of Clinical Research. Six studies (Ferguson 1999, Hughes 1999b, Malo 1999, Pickering 1996, Raphael 1999a/Raphael 1999b, Rao 1999) were identified by GSK. A total of 43 studies were therefore included in the initial version of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>Agreement between the two independent assessments of study quality were as follows:<BR/>Randomised? kappa = 1<BR/>Double blind? kappa = 0.9<BR/>Description of withdrawals kappa = 0.7<BR/>Method of randomisation kappa = 0.4<BR/>Method of double blinding kappa = 0.9</P>

We excluded three (Fairfax 2001; Kannisto 2000; Karakoc 2001), and two are awaiting translation (Chlumsky 1998; Dong 1999). Two published versions of studies previously included as abstracts were also identified (Ringdal 2000; Raphael 1999a). We included a further two studies from recent electronic searches (Harrison 2001; Nielsen 2000). Six new studies are included in this update. One study identified from searches is awaiting full translation (Yang 1999). Additional data for Heinig 1999 were made available by GSK. In December 2003 a total of 49 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>

<P>This review now reflects published and unpublished evidence up to January 2004. In this update there are 7 new studies (Dose ratio 1:1: Currie 2002; Kuna 2003*; Dose ratio 1:2: Backman 2001*; Ige 2002; Kannisto 2002; Majer-Teboul 2001; Szefler 2002). This gives a total of 57 trials included in the review.<BR/>
<BR/>This review now incorporates data from fully published articles from two trials previously included as abstracts: Berend 1998 (now Berend 2001); de Benedictis 1998 (now de Benedictis 2001*). Both trials contribute data to the dose ratio 1:2. <BR/>
<BR/>Following correspondence with GSK there are data from an unpublished trial previously included as an abstract: Lundback 1997*; dose ratio: 1:1. <BR/>
<BR/>Impact upon findings<BR/>Dose ratio 1:2. The confidence intervals tightened around mean differences for lung function variables, exacerbations and side-effects with the addition of new data. In certain instances new data also led to significant heterogeneity which we have explored. <BR/>
<BR/>Dose ratio 1:1. There is now evidence that FP is more effective than BDP/BUD on certain measures of lung function most notably FEV1, FVC and PEF. However, the effects on exacerbations have become more equivocal with the addition of new data and the level of heterogeneity in this outcome may reflect the combination of data from studies with varying baseline risks. <BR/>
<BR/>*Denotes unpublished data made available for this review.<BR/>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>This review now reflects published and unpublished evidence up to January 2005. There are two new trials in this update (Ferguson 2002; Molimard 2005). Furthermore, the reviewers have attempted to incorporate estimates from studies previously unable to contribute data due to inadequate data analysis in prior versions of RevMan. <BR/>
<BR/>We have also excluded one study comparing HFA-BDP with FP (Aubier 2001) as this is now subject to a different systematic review. <BR/>
<BR/>The new data increased the statistical power of many of the analyses with regard to lung function and data which were measured on continuous scales (i.e. where average scores are achieved). <BR/>
<BR/>The new evidence does not alter the conclusions of the review.</P>

<P>We (NPA, JB and TJL) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We were blinded to names of trialists, institution and funding sources. We scored the studies using two measures. Firstly according to the Cochrane approach:</P>
<P>Grade A: adequate allocation concealment<BR/>Grade B: unclear allocation concealment<BR/>Grade C: clearly inadequate concealment</P>
<P>Secondly, using a five point scoring instrument developed by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>:</P>
<P>a) Was the study described as randomised? (yes = 1 no = 0)<BR/>b) Was the study described as double blind? (yes = 1 no = 0)<BR/>c) Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts? (yes = 1 no = 0)<BR/>d) Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (yes = 1 no = 0)<BR/>e) Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (yes = 1 no = 0)<BR/>Deduct 1 point if method of randomisation or blinding inappropriate</P>
<P>We measured inter-rater agreement using the kappa statistic and resolved disagreement by consensus.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-25 14:54:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The procedures for randomising GSK sponsored studies has been detailed in correspondence between Richard Follows and TL, the details of which are given below:</P>
<P>The randomisation software is a computer-generated, centralised programme (RandAll). After verification that the randomisation sequence is suitable for the study design (crossover, block or stratification), Clinical Supplies then package the treatments according to the randomisation list generated. Concealment of allocation is maintained by a third party, since the sites phone in and are allocated treatments on that basis. Alternatively a third party may dispense the drug at the sites. Unblinding of data for interim analyses can only be done through RandAll, and are restricted so that only those reviewing the data are unblinded to treatment group allocation.</P>
