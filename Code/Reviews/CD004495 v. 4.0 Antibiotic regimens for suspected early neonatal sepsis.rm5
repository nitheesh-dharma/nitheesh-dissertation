<P>Antibiotics for newborn infants that might have blood infections when aged less than 48 hours. Blood infection (sepsis) can make newborn infants seriously ill or even kill them. Sepsis in newborns less than 48 hours old is called early neonatal sepsis. It is usually caused by bacteria passed from the mother. Doctors often give antibiotics if they suspect this dangerous condition because it can be difficult to tell if a newborn has early neonatal sepsis. Certain antibiotics can have significant side effects and their use can also lead to antibiotic resistance, which results in worse infection and possible damage to the intestines, kidneys, liver, or hearing. The authors of this review studied the medical literature to find out which kinds of antibiotics are best for suspected early neonatal sepsis, and what side effects these antibiotics cause. They found 15 relevant studies, but only two of these studies focused on infants less than 48 hours old. The two studies included a total of 127 newborns and compared newborns who received one antibiotic (monotherapy) to infants who received more than one antibiotic (combination therapy). There were no differences between the two groups. Both of the studies were published in the 1980s and are probably out of date. The authors of this review concluded that there is no evidence for using a particular kind of antibiotic for early neonatal sepsis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 10:01:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infection remains a major cause of illness and death in the neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-La-Gamma-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Gamma 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 1990</LINK>). Newborn babies have an immature immune system and therefore may not elicit all signs of infection, and delay in treatment may lead to severe illness or death (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1981</LINK>). Early treatment with antibiotics has been shown to reduce mortality due to sepsis in the neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Freedman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freedman 1981</LINK>). Early treatment depends on knowledge of risk factors and picking up early signs of infection in this age group (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1981</LINK>). However the signs of infection tend to be non-specific (<LINK REF="REF-Philip-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Philip 1980</LINK>). Suspected sepsis is therefore defined as any clinical concern for infection to warrant the starting of intravenous antibiotic therapy before laboratory or microbiological evidence of infection.</P>
<P>Early neonatal sepsis is mainly acquired from the mother. Vertical transmission of infection from mother to infant may take place before birth, during labour, or at the time of delivery. Most infants with peripartum acquired sepsis will develop clinical symptoms of sepsis within two days of life. After this period, nosocomial and community acquired infections start to play a bigger role. The bacteria most commonly implicated in early neonatal sepsis are Group B streptococcus and Gram-negative bacilli, and usually exclude coagulase negative staphylococcus. Neonatal intensive care units or special care baby units tend to choose empirical first line antibiotic therapy that will cover both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. A combination of an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin and a beta-lactam such as penicillin has been the treatment of choice for early neonatal sepsis in many neonatal intensive care units (NICU).</P>
<P>Aminoglycosides may be associated with important adverse effects and they require frequent monitoring of blood levels. Preterm infants have immature organs and therefore may not tolerate some antibiotics as well as term infants. Further to these significant disadvantages, the majority of treated babies do not have proven sepsis. A recent systematic review looking at empirical treatment for febrile neutropaenia in cancer patients found no significant difference between using beta-lactam monotherapy or beta-lactam and aminoglycoside combination, although there was a slight advantage in using third generation cephalosporins (<LINK REF="REF-Paul-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2002</LINK>). On the other hand the use of broad spectrum antibiotics in neonates may alter gut flora and may also increase antibiotic resistance in the unit (<LINK REF="REF-Kalenic-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalenic 1993</LINK>). Alteration of intestinal flora or sterilisation of the gut with these antibiotics may increase the risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis after stopping treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2001</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives are to compare antibiotic monotherapies, monotherapy with combination therapy, and combination therapies for empirical treatment of suspected early neonatal sepsis (within 48 hours after birth), for both effectiveness and adverse effects. </P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following terms were used to search electronic databases: (antibiot* OR antimicrob* OR lactam*OR aminoglycoside* OR glycoprotein) AND (sepsis OR septic* OR Infect* OR bacter* OR (gram near negative)). The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) was searched using the above terms with restriction to neonates or infants. MEDLINE search (PubMed 1966 to August 2003) was restricted to Clinical Trials, All Infant, and Human, applying the same search terms. Further searches were performed in EMBASE (1980 to September 2003) for pharmaceutical publications and ZETOC (1993 to August 2003) for abstracts of scientific conferences/symposia. No language restriction was applied. References from identified studies were cross-checked for possible additional studies. The following pharmaceutical companies were contacted for any unpublished data: Aventis, Bristol-Myers, Britania, Glaxo Smith Kline and Roche. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The abstract of each reference generated by the search was examined by the reviewers for inclusion criteria and where relevant a full article was obtained. The relevant studies were reviewed for methodological quality. Criteria for assessing methodological quality were blinding of randomisation, blinding of intervention, complete follow up, and blinding of outcome measures (The Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Guidelines). The reviewers discussed areas of disagreement and reached a consensus before analysis of the results. </P>
<P>The reviewers extracted data from included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, treatment effect was expressed as relative risk, with 95% confidence interval as a measure of uncertainty within the trial. For outcomes measured on a continuous scale, treatment effect was expressed as mean difference and uncertainty measured by standard deviation. Where appropriate, meta-analyses of pooled data from all contributing trials was performed using a fixed effect model to obtain a typical relative risk or weighted mean difference respectively. Then, in a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of study quality, the meta-analyses were restricted to high quality studies, with lower quality studies being added on to see if they influenced any outcome effect. A test for heterogeneity was performed. The results from this test were used as a trigger to explore sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis by gestational age, term (&gt;37 weeks) and preterm, with a further subgroup analysis in the preterm group by birth weight (&gt;1500 grams and &lt;1500 grams) was considered. Data was analysed using MetaView 4.2 (Update Software). </P>

The data for early neonatal sepsis could not be separated from that of late onset sepsis in these studies. All studies except one (<LINK REF="STD-Gokalp-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gokalp 1990</LINK>) were randomised and controlled.

Both these studies enrolled neonates with suspected sepsis or with risk factors for sepsis. They are described in more detail in the table of included studies.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Miall_x002d_Allen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Miall-Allen 1988</LINK>) involved 72 neonates up to 48 hours of age and compared monotherapy (Timentin) with combination therapy (Piperacillin and Gentamicin). If there was only a weak suspicion of sepsis, one antibiotic alone, Piperacillin, was used in the combination therapy arm. Most of the neonates in the control group, however, received a combination therapy of piperacillin and gentamicin (32/40). This study also looked at late onset sepsis but these data were separable.</P>
<P>The other study included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Snelling-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Snelling 1983</LINK>) involved 55 neonates receiving either monotherapy (Ceftazidime) or combination therapy (Benzylpenicillin and Gentamicin). The population was neonates up to 48 hours old.</P>
<P>Both studies looked at mortality, treatment failure and bacteriological resistance. Neither study compared adverse effects.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review found only two studies that specifically compared antibiotic regimens for suspected early neonatal sepsis. Both studies took place more than 15 years ago and some of the antibiotics used may no longer be in use in neonatal settings at present. The studies were randomised. There was no blinding of interventions and outcome measurements, and the outcomes were short term. These studies did not meet all the criteria set for methodological quality in this review. </P>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials at present to suggest that any antibiotic regimen is superior than another in the treatment of suspected early neonatal sepsis. Despite their wide use in the neonatal setting, antibiotics have not been broadly compared for efficacy and adverse effects in the treatment of suspected early neonatal sepsis. This is evident in the lack of studies in this review which have addressed this issue. There was a lack of positive response from drug companies. </P>
<P>Early neonatal sepsis is mainly acquired from maternal organisms. Knowledge of these organisms may help people involved in the care of neonates to choose the right antibiotic for treating sepsis. However, most neonates with suspected infection are not actually infected. Targeting maternal organisms can result in a broad spectrum antibiotic usage and this may risk emergency of resistant organisms in the neonatal unit. While evidence is lacking, the choice of antibiotics for suspected early neonatal sepsis may be guided by the spectrum of organisms from microbiological surveillance cultures, for example the prevalence of Group B Streptococcus and Gram negative organisms. With this approach there are still unanswered questions of adverse effects. Some antibiotics may be more toxic than others in the early neonatal period or in the very premature neonates and others may selectively increase bacterial resistance or colonisation.</P>
<P>This review did not look at other issues which may influence the choice of antibiotics such as limitation of resources or monitoring drug levels.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is no evidence from randomised clinical trials in favour of any particular antibiotic regimen for the treatment of presumed early neonatal sepsis. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review has highlighted lack of studies that compared antibiotic regimens for treating suspected early neonatal sepsis. Studies are needed to compare antibiotic monotherapies and various combination therapies for treating suspected early neonatal sepsis. Early neonatal sepsis is different from late neonatal sepsis as organisms involved are more likely to be of maternal origin. Apart from efficacy, these studies should also compare significant short and long term adverse effects. Hearing loss in premature infants may be due to prematurity but equally it may be as a consequence of therapy. </P>
