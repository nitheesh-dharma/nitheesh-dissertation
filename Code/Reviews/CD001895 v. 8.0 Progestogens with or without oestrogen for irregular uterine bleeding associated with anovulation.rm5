<P>Irregular bleeding associated with infrequent or no ovulation occurs most commonly in adolescents and in women approaching the menopause. It may also occur in those with polycystic ovary syndrome. This irregular bleeding may also be heavy. Hormonal treatments are commonly given to these women, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend whether progestogens alone or progestogens in combination with oestrogen are most effective for irregular uterine bleeding associated with infrequent or no ovulation.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-14 17:10:40 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Irregular menstrual bleeding may arise due to exogenous sex steroids, lesions of the genital tract or be associated with anovulation. Irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding or DUB) is more common at the extremes of reproductive life, and in women with ovulatory disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In anovulatory cycles there may be prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium without progesterone withdrawal and so cycles are irregular and bleeding may be heavy. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination, are widely used in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:37:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:33:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Disturbances of menstrual bleeding manifest in a wide range of presentations. The term &#8220;abnormal uterine bleeding&#8221; or AUB is used to describe any departure from normal menstruation or from a normal menstrual cycle pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2011</LINK>). Abnormal bleeding is defined in terms of disturbances of regularity, of frequency and of heaviness and duration of flow. The term 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding' is no longer used.</P>
<P>Disturbances of bleeding regularity include irregular menstrual bleeding and absent bleeding (amenorrhoea). The definition of irregular menstrual bleeding has been controversial, but current consensus recommendations are &gt;20 days of variation in individual cycle length over a period of one year (<LINK REF="REF-Munro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munro 2011</LINK>). Irregular menstrual bleeding may be due to infrequent or absent ovulation (oligo/anovulation). The most common cause of oligo/anovulation is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affects around 6% of women of reproductive age (<LINK REF="REF-Azziz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azziz 2004</LINK>). In addition, women at the extremes of reproductive life &#8211; in the early years following menarche and in the menopause transition, are more likely to have disturbed ovulation and hence irregular menstrual bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Harlow-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlow 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>When regular ovulation does not occur, unopposed oestrogen exposure may result in a persistent proliferative or hyperplastic endometrium (<LINK REF="REF-Lacey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 2009</LINK>). Exactly why disturbances of ovulation cause irregular and/or heavy menstrual bleeding is not well understood, but is likely to be due to local endometrial changes. Irregular menstrual bleeding in the early years after menarche is thought to be due to immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. However, in some young women this irregular bleeding may be an early presentation of PCOS, particularly in girls with a high body mass index (<LINK REF="REF-van-Hooff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hooff 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was previously thought that irregular cycles in the menopause transition were largely due to oligo/anovulation, but recent data indicate that at least a third of irregular cycles in the mid-to-late menopause transition are ovulatory but with a disturbed ovulation pattern. These distinct endocrine disturbances have been termed &#8220;luteal out of phase&#8221; or &#8220;LOOP&#8221; cycles due to the development of a new preovulatory follicle during the preceding luteal phase (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2009</LINK>). This is often followed by a luteinising hormone (LH) peak and ovulation during subsequent menstruation. These LOOP cycles are usually found during phases of irregular menstrual bleeding and can also lead to heavy bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Hale-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hale 2011</LINK>). The truly anovulatory cycles were associated with the lightest bleeding in this study.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:35:18 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is often highly inconvenient for women. The medical management of irregular menstrual bleeding aims to regulate bleeding and to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. Progestogens and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or heavy bleeding due to disturbed ovulation, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used vary widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach. The unwanted effects of progestogens vary according to the type and dose of progestogen, whether the preparations are given cyclically (for up to three weeks in a month) or continuously, and also vary between individuals. Common non-menstrual unwanted effects of progestogens include headaches, weight gain and breast tenderness.  Irregular bleeding and spotting are common side effects of progestogens of all types and regimes, particularly continuous low-dose preparations (<LINK REF="REF-Hickey-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hickey 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:35:56 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women with irregular menstrual bleeding can be broadly considered in three main groups: adolescents who have not yet established regular menstrual cycles; those with anovulation due to PCOS; and women in the menopause transition, who may have disturbances of ovulation. Effective treatment approaches are likely to differ in these groups, with the emphasis on regulation of bleeding in adolescent girls, establishing regular bleeding or amenorrhoea during the menopause transition and greater consideration of fertility and induction of ovulation in those with PCOS. Treatments for anovulatory infertility such as clomiphene may induce regular bleeding, but this is not their primary aim and clomiphene is not a long-term treatment option.</P>
<P>Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (the hormonal interaction between the brain and the ovaries). In irregular menstrual bleeding due to oligo/anovulation there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen-primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Unopposed oestrogen (without progesterone) may cause the endometrium to thicken and potentially to develop endometrial hyperplasia or even endometrial cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Lacey-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lacey 2009</LINK>). Exogenous progestogens can induce secretory transformation of proliferative or hyperplastic endometrium associated with anovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Gellersen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gellersen 2007</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-08-10 15:37:27 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Abnormal uterine bleeding creates significant morbidity for women of reproductive age and imposes major medical, social and economic problems for women, their families, the workplace and health services. Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) affects up to 30% of women (<A HREF="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</A>). In the UK and USA, 5% of women of reproductive age consult their general practitioner annually with a menstrual complaint.</P>
<P>Hysterectomy is an effective treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding, but is not appropriate for many women, particularly those who wish to preserve their fertility. Sex steroid preparations may be effective, but more information is needed about the comparative efficacy of sex steroids, particularly for irregular menstrual bleeding.</P>

If similar outcomes were reported on different scales (e.g. change in weight) we would calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs). We planned to present 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes.</P>

<P>We found no randomised evidence relevant to our clinical question. Clinical studies of sex steroids in the management of irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation are not easy to perform, and bleeding patterns may be erratic and highly variable. In addition, management is likely to be affected by patient age, medical history and fertility wishes.</P>

<P>Objective evidence for the role of progestogens for irregular bleeding was found in two trials. Neither met the inclusion criteria for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saarikoski-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Saarikoski 1990</LINK> compared the effects of two progestogen regimes on endometrial histology in 80 women with a variety of menstrual disorders, seven of whom had irregular bleeding. This randomised study investigated the effects of cyclical norethisterone (NET, 5 mg three times daily) and natural micronised progesterone (NMP, 100 mg three times daily) on endometrial histology in 80 women with menstrual disorders including heavy, frequent and irregular bleeding; 18 women also had fibroids. They reported that only seven women had irregular bleeding but that 89% had anovulatory cycles. It was unclear how anovulation was confirmed. The authors stated that endometrial histology indicated the need for progestogens in all women because of cystic glandular hyperplasia in 41, proliferative endometrium in 30 (normal endometrial cellular pattern seen under the influence of oestrogen in the first half of the menstrual cycle) and "incomplete maturation" of the endometrium in nine; the term "incomplete maturation" was not defined. The outcome measures were endometrial histology, serum oestradiol, progesterone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH and sex hormone binding (SHB) levels. Endometrial biopsies at three and six months of treatment, and again three months after cessation of treatment, showed that cystic glandular hyperplasia had resolved in all except one woman (in the NET group) by three months of treatment. Proliferative endometrium was seen in seven of 30 women following treatment, all of whom were in the NET group. The quantity or regularity of bleeding following treatment was not reported but the authors noted that 19 women discontinued treatment (14 NMP users and five NET users), mainly (six women) because of amenorrhoea. A further three women using NMP complained of breakthrough bleeding.</P>

Women were allocated rather than randomised to these treatment groups. Using participants as their own controls, the study demonstrated a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss from a pretreatment mean of 131 ± 40 mL (mean ± SD) to 80 ± 31 mL during the first treatment cycle, and 64 ± 14 mL in the second cycle (paired t test, t = 4.638, P &lt; 0.005 in the first cycle and t = 4.025, P = &lt; 0.01 in the second). The duration of bleeding was also reduced following treatment, from a mean of 8.5 ± 2.4 days before treatment to 6.2 ± 1.7 days in the first treatment cycle, and 5.5 ± 1.1 days in the second (t = 3.105, P = 0.027). No obvious difference was observed between the two progestogens. This study suggests that cyclical oral progestogens are effective in regulating and reducing irregular bleeding due to oligo/anovulation. However larger, randomised studies are needed to confirm this role and to compare progestogen types, regimes, dosages and routes of administration.</P>
<P>There was little long-term effect of progestogens on endometrial histology. Three months after cessation of treatment, 34% of women showed a hyperplastic or proliferative endometrial appearance; and a secretory appearance (normal endometrial cellular pattern under the influence of oestrogen followed by progesterone seen in the second half of the menstrual cycle) was seen in only 25%.</P>

<P>It remains unclear how irregular menstrual bleeding associated with oligo/anovulation should best be treated. No randomised evidence is currently available about the most effective type, dose, regime and administration route of progestogen, or the relative efficacy of progestogens used alone or in combination with oestrogens.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials of progestogens alone or in combination with oestrogens are needed in order to define the relative efficacy and acceptability of these interventions in regulating menstrual bleeding. In particular, trials are needed to compare different cyclical progestogens with combined oral contraceptives in irregular bleeding associated with PCOS, and oral versus intrauterine progestogens in perimenopausal irregular bleeding.</P>

<P>Non-randomised trial of two progestogen regimes in objectively demonstrated anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Included six women with anovulation and menorrhagia who received norethisterone 5 mg 3 times daily from days 12 to 25 inclusive, or medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg 3 times daily for 2 cycles. Outcomes were reduction in number of bleeding days and in objectively measured menstrual blood loss.</P>

<P>Randomised open label trial of 40 women with acute uterine bleeding. This review focused on irregular bleeding. Twenty women were given medroxyprogesterone acetate (MA) 20 mg and twenty were given monophasic combination OC. Cessation of bleeding occurred in 88% of the OC group and 76% of the MA group. The results were limited by sample size.</P>

<P>Prospective randomised trial of 80 women with a variety of menstrual disorders; seven had irregular bleeding although 41 had endometrial cystic glandular hyperplasia. They received norethisterone 5 mg 3 times daily or natural micronised progesterone, 100 mg 3 times daily. Outcomes of interest were endometrial histology after 6 months of treatment. Attempts were made to contact the authors in January 1998 to request further details but no reply was received.</P>

<P>Prospective study of 108 perimenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. Women were randomised to levonorgestrel (5 or 10 mcg/24 hours) from an intrauterine system with either oestradiol valerate (2 mg) or transdermal oestradiol (50 mcg/24 hours). There was no mention of bleeding patterns before treatment, only that fewer than twelve months had elapsed since their last menstrual period. Bleeding patterns following treatment were reported, frequent bleeding was the most common reason for discontinuation. At the end of the study, 62% of subjects were amenorrhoeic. No significant differences between the groups were seen. The study did not clearly investigate the effects of these treatments on bleeding patterns associated with anovulation.</P>
