<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>How effective and safe is the use of fluoride mouthrinse for preventing tooth decay (dental caries) in children and adolescents compared with placebo (a mouthrinse without the active ingredient fluoride) or no treatment?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Tooth decay is a health problem worldwide, affecting the vast majority of adults and children. Levels of tooth decay vary between and within countries, but children in lower socioeconomic groups (measured by income, education and employment) tend to have more tooth decay. Untreated tooth decay can cause progressive destruction of the tops of teeth (crowns), often accompanied by severe pain. Repair and replacement of decayed teeth is costly in terms of time and money and is a major drain on the resources of healthcare systems.</P>
<P>Preventing tooth decay in children and adolescents is regarded as a priority for dental services and is considered more cost-effective than treatment. Use of fluoride, a mineral that prevents tooth decay, is widespread. As well as occurring naturally, fluoride is added to the water supply in some areas, and is used in most toothpastes and in other products that are available to varying degrees worldwide. As an extra preventive measure, fluoride can be applied directly to teeth as mouthrinses, lozenges, varnishes and gels.</P>
<P>Fluoride mouthrinse has frequently been used under supervision in school-based programmes to prevent tooth decay. Supervised (depending on the age of the child) or unsupervised fluoride mouthrinse needs to be used regularly to have an effect. Recommended procedure involves rinsing the mouth one to two minutes per day with a less concentrated solution containing fluoride, or once a week or once every two weeks with a more concentrated solution. Because of the risk of swallowing too much fluoride, fluoride mouthrinses are not recommended for children younger than six years of age.</P>
<P>This review updates the Cochrane review of fluoride mouthrinses for preventing tooth decay in children and adolescents that was first published in 2003. We assessed existing research for <A HREF="http://oralhealth.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Oral Health</A>, and evidence is current up to 22 April 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included 37 studies in which more than 15,000 children (aged six to 14 years) were treated with fluoride mouthrinse or placebo (a mouthrinse with no active ingredient) or received no treatment. All studies assessed supervised use of fluoride mouthrinse in school settings, with two studies also including home use. Most children received a sodium fluoride (NaF) solution, given at 230 parts per million of fluoride (ppm F) daily or a higher concentration of 900 ppm F weekly or fortnightly. Studies lasted from two to three years. Reports were published between 1965 and 2005, and studies took place in several countries.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This review update confirmed that supervised regular use of fluoride mouthrinse can reduce tooth decay in children and adolescents. Combined results of 35 trials showed that, on average, there is a 27% reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in permanent teeth with fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no mouthrinse. This benefit is likely to be present even if children use fluoride toothpaste or live in water-fluoridated areas. Combined results of 13 trials found an average 23% reduction in decayed, missing and filled teeth (rather than tooth surfaces) in permanent teeth with fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no mouthrinse. No trials have looked at the effect of fluoride rinse on baby teeth. We found little information about unwanted side effects or about how well children were able to cope with the use of mouthrinses.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
</P>
<P>Regular use of fluoride mouthrinse under supervision results in a large reduction in tooth decay in children's permanent teeth. We found little information about potential adverse effects and acceptability.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Available evidence for permanent teeth is of moderate quality. This means we are moderately confident in the size of the effect. Very little evidence is available to assess adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:33:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride mouthrinses in preventing dental caries in the child and adolescent population.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The secondary objective is to examine whether the effect of fluoride rinses is influenced by:</P>
<P>&#8226; initial level of caries severity;<BR/>&#8226; background exposure to fluoride in water (or salt), toothpastes or reported fluoride sources other than the study option(s); or<BR/>&#8226; fluoride concentration (ppm F) or frequency of use (times per year).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-07-29 09:06:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (whole database, to 22 April 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 22 April 2016), Embase Ovid (1980 to 22 April 2016), CINAHL EBSCO (the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1937 to 22 April 2016), LILACS BIREME (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information Database, 1982 to 22 April 2016), BBO BIREME (Bibliografia Brasileira de Odontologia; from 1986 to 22 April 2016), Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 22 April 2016) and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 22 April 2016). We undertook a search for ongoing trials on the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching electronic databases. We also searched reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-07-16 02:35:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials where blind outcome assessment was stated or indicated, comparing fluoride mouthrinse with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years of age. Study duration had to be at least one year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces in permanent teeth (D(M)FS).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-07-18 18:07:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>At least two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We contacted study authors for additional information when required. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF), that is, the difference in mean caries increments between treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses where data could be pooled. We examined potential sources of heterogeneity in random-effects metaregression analyses. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-07-28 15:41:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review, we included 37 trials involving 15,813 children and adolescents. All trials tested supervised use of fluoride mouthrinse in schools, with two studies also including home use. Almost all children received a fluoride rinse formulated with sodium fluoride (NaF), mostly on either a daily or weekly/fortnightly basis and at two main strengths, 230 or 900 ppm F, respectively. Most studies (28) were at high risk of bias, and nine were at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>From the 35 trials (15,305 participants) that contributed data on permanent tooth surface for meta-analysis, the D(M)FS pooled PF was 27% (95% confidence interval (CI), 23% to 30%; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 42%) (moderate quality evidence). We found no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and baseline caries severity, background exposure to fluorides, rinsing frequency or fluoride concentration in metaregression analyses. A funnel plot of the 35 studies in the D(M)FS PF meta-analysis indicated no relationship between prevented fraction and study precision (no evidence of reporting bias). The pooled estimate of D(M)FT PF was 23% (95% CI, 18% to 29%; I² = 54%), from the 13 trials that contributed data for the permanent teeth meta-analysis (moderate quality evidence). </P>
<P>We found limited information concerning possible adverse effects or acceptability of the treatment regimen in the included trials. Three trials incompletely reported data on tooth staining, and one trial incompletely reported information on mucosal irritation/allergic reaction. None of the trials reported on acute adverse symptoms during treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-07-29 12:16:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found that supervised regular use of fluoride mouthrinse by children and adolescents is associated with a large reduction in caries increment in permanent teeth. We are moderately certain of the size of the effect. Most of the evidence evaluated use of fluoride mouthrinse supervised in a school setting, but the findings may be applicable to children in other settings with supervised or unsupervised rinsing, although the size of the caries-preventive effect is less clear. Any future research on fluoride mouthrinses should focus on head-to-head comparisons between different fluoride rinse features or fluoride rinses against other preventive strategies, and should evaluate adverse effects and acceptability.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-07-19 11:25:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic disease, afflicting a significant proportion of the world population, including around 60% to 90% of school-aged children and the vast majority of adults (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2004</LINK>). Dental caries levels vary considerably between and within countries, but children in lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups have higher caries levels than those in upper SES groups, and in high-income countries the association between socioeconomic position and caries might be stronger (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reisine-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reisine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwendicke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwendicke 2015</LINK>). Untreated caries causes progressive destruction of the crowns of the teeth, often accompanied by severe pain and suffering, especially in children, where it can result in poorer quality of life and general health (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2005</LINK>). Untreated caries in permanent teeth was the most prevalent condition among all those evaluated in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study, affecting 35% of the global population, or 2.4 billion people; untreated caries in deciduous teeth was the 10th most prevalent condition, affecting 9% of the population, or 621 million children worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Kassebaum-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kassebaum 2015</LINK>). Repair and replacement of carious teeth is excessively time consuming and costly, representing a major drain of resources for healthcare systems. On a population basis, dental caries is the fourth most expensive chronic disease to treat according to the World Health Organization (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dental caries occurs because of demineralisation of tooth structure by organic acids formed by oral bacteria present in dental plaque through the anaerobic metabolism of dietary sugars. The causal role of sugars in caries is well established (<LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2001</LINK>). Most caries lesions in children&#8217;s permanent teeth progress relatively slowly, with an average lesion taking three years to progress through tooth enamel to dentine (<LINK REF="REF-Mejare-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mejare 1998</LINK>). The dental caries process is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth surface, the bacterial profile, the quantity and quality of saliva and the presence of fluoride, which promotes remineralisation and inhibits demineralisation of the tooth structure.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-20 11:36:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fluoride mouthrinses have been used extensively for the past 40 years to prevent dental caries in children. The use of rinses was especially widespread in school-based programmes in countries experiencing high caries prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s. Doubts about the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinse as a population strategy began in the mid-1980s, in view of the decline in dental caries, and their presumed cost-effectiveness was challenged (<LINK REF="REF-Disney-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Disney 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>). The current view is that fluoride mouthrinsing programmes are appropriate only for children at high risk of caries (<LINK REF="REF-FDI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDI 2002</LINK>). The fluoride compound most commonly used in mouthrinse is sodium fluoride. Supervised, school-based, weekly rinsing programmes using 900 ppm fluoride (F) solutions of 0.2% sodium fluoride have been popular in the United States in non-fluoridated communities (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1996</LINK>). In Scandinavian countries and in several other countries, such programmes have been discontinued on the basis of the above-noted caries decline and widespread use of fluoride toothpastes (<LINK REF="REF-Seppa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>). Mouthrinse solutions of 0.05% sodium fluoride, containing 230 ppm F, are available commercially for daily home use in some countries. Rinses containing 100 ppm F are also available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale and are recommended for twice-daily use. Fluoride mouthrinses have thus moved from being a tool mainly advocated in the public health setting; through the force of commercial marketing, they have gained greater prominence in the personal dental products market. By virtue of the widespread use of other oral mouthrinse products, from simple breath fresheners to products formulated to counter inflammatory periodontal (gum) diseases, it has been argued that the procedure could in fact be cost-effective if those already using non-fluoride mouthrinses convert to using fluoride rinses (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the procedure is not recommended for children younger than six years of age because of the risk of acute and chronic fluoride ingestion, data have implicated use of fluoride mouthrinse by preschool children as a risk factor for dental fluorosis (enamel defects caused by chronic ingestion of excessive amounts of fluoride during the period of tooth formation) because some young children might swallow substantial amounts (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stookey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stookey 1994</LINK>). Accidental swallowing of the usual 10 mL rinse volume of a 0.05% (230 ppm F) NaF solution daily by a child of five or six years of age will result in ingestion of 2.3 mg of fluoride (the average dosage ingested would be twice the optimum level in a fluoridated area). Although this dose is far below the probable toxic dose (PTD) of fluoride, estimated to be 5 mg/kg body weight (<LINK REF="REF-Whitford-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitford 1992</LINK>), or approximately 100 mg of fluoride for a child of five or six years (20 kg), this amount would be available in just 434 mL of the standard daily rinsing solution.</P>
<P>A large number of clinical trials have extensively investigated the effect of fluoride mouthrinses on the incidence of caries in children during the past five decades. Besides sodium fluoride solutions, mouthrinses containing other fluoride compounds in several concentrations and rinsing frequencies have been tested. Numerous articles and textbook chapters have reviewed evidence from these primary studies on the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinses (<LINK REF="REF-Birkeland-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birkeland 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bohannan-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohannan 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leverett-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leverett 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torell-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torell 1974</LINK>). In one review article from the mid-1980s, review authors used a meta-analytical approach to synthesise the results of US fluoride mouthrinse studies carried out in fluoride-deficient communities (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>). Two systematic reviews on the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride mouthrinses have been published more recently (<LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>). It is evident from these reviews and meta-analyses that fluoride mouthrinses are caries-inhibitory treatments. However, the authors of these reviews failed to conduct a comprehensive search for individual trials or to formally evaluate the risk of bias in included trials, despite obvious drawbacks in the design and methods of the included trials.</P>

<P>The most important anti-caries effect of fluoride present in dental plaque and saliva is considered to result from its local action on the tooth/plaque interface, through promotion of remineralisation of early caries lesions and reduction in tooth enamel solubility (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>). Enamel demineralisation is markedly inhibited if fluoride is present at the time of the acid challenge because, as cariogenic bacteria metabolise carbohydrates and produce acid, fluoride diffuses with the acid from dental plaque into the enamel in response to lowered pH, and acts at the enamel crystal surface to reduce mineral loss. When pH rises following enamel demineralisation, released fluoride and fluoride present in the saliva can combine with dissolved calcium and phosphate ions to precipitate or grow fluorapatite-like crystalline material within the tooth, thereby establishing an improved enamel crystal structure. Thus, fluoride enhances this mineral gain and provides a material that is more resistant to subsequent acid attack (<LINK REF="REF-Ten-Cate-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ten Cate 1999</LINK>). This occurs with all forms and concentrations of topical fluoride, although to a variable extent. With high-concentration topical fluoride vehicles (such as varnishes and gels), calcium fluoride is precipitated on the enamel surface and in the plaque. This calcium fluoride acts as a fluoride reservoir, which is released when the oral pH falls, and the amount of fluoride deposited in the subsurface lesion is greater after topical application with such high-concentration fluoride vehicles (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ogaard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogaard 2001</LINK>). Regular use of fluoride toothpaste or mouthrinse results in sustained elevated fluoride concentrations in oral fluids during the demineralisation-remineralisation cycle, as small amounts are maintained constantly in the mouth (<LINK REF="REF-Clarkson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarkson 1996</LINK>).</P>

The paediatric expert panel identified this review as a priority title (<A HREF="http://ohg.cochrane.org/priority-reviews">Cochrane OHG priority review portfolio</A>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents is generally regarded as a priority for dental services and is considered more cost-effective than treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1998</LINK>). Fluoride therapy has been the centrepiece of caries-preventive strategies since water fluoridation schemes were introduced over six decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>), when caries was highly prevalent and severe, and when even modest prevention activities led to considerable reduction in disease levels. Over the past 30 years, with the substantial decline in dental caries rates in many western countries, the increase in dental fluorosis levels in some countries and intensive research on the mechanism of action of fluoride highlighting the primary importance of its topical effect, greater attention has been paid to the appropriate use of other fluoride-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Use of topically applied fluoride products in particular, which are much more concentrated than the fluoride in drinking water, has increased over recent decades. By definition, the term 'topically applied fluoride' is used to describe those delivery systems that provide fluoride to exposed surfaces of the dentition, at elevated concentrations, for a local protective effect, and therefore are not intended for ingestion. Fluoride-containing toothpastes (dentifrices), mouthrinses, gels and varnishes are the modalities most commonly used at present, alone or in combination. Various products are marketed in different countries, and a variety of caries-preventive programmes based on these products have been implemented. Toothpastes are by far the most widespread form of fluoride usage (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>); although reasons for the decline in prevalence of dental caries in children from different countries have been the topic of much debate (<LINK REF="REF-De-Liefde-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Liefde 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krasse-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krasse 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nadanovsky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nadanovsky 1995</LINK>), this event has been attributed mainly to the gradual increase in, and regular home use of, fluoride in toothpaste (<LINK REF="REF-Bratthall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bratthall 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Mullane-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Mullane 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolla-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolla 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>At the same time, the lower caries prevalence in many countries now and the widespread availability of fluoride from multiple sources have raised the question of whether topically applied fluorides are still effective in reducing caries, and whether they are safe, mainly in terms of the potential risk of fluorosis (mottled enamel). This is particularly important, as nearly all child populations in high-income countries are exposed to some source of fluoride, notably in toothpaste, and adverse effects may be rare (such as acute fluoride toxicity) or more subtle (such as mild dental fluorosis) (<LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditional narrative reviews have extensively reviewed evidence on the effects of topically applied fluoride products on prevention of dental caries in children. Several systematic reviews focusing on evaluation of specific fluoride active agents within specific delivery systems have used a quantitative meta-analytical approach to synthesise trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Ammari-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ammari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartizek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartizek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaves-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaves 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfenstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfenstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petersson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strohmenger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohmenger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijkom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>). However, no systematic investigation has been conducted to evaluate and compare effects of the main modalities of topically applied fluoride treatments and to examine formally the main factors that may influence their effectiveness.</P>
<P>This review, which is one in a series of Cochrane systematic reviews of topical fluoride interventions, assesses the effectiveness of fluoride rinses for prevention of dental caries in children (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2015</LINK>). This is an update of the review first published in 2003, which showed clear evidence of a caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride mouthrinse in the permanent teeth of children (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>). It is generally recognised that blinding is particularly important when outcome measures require specific criteria to improve objectivity in measurement, as in assessment of dental caries. Of note in this series of topical fluoride reviews is that lack of blinding in the main outcome assessment (caries increment) or lack of any indication of blind outcome assessment remains an exclusion criterion &#8211; that is, we have excluded studies if open outcome assessment is reported, or if blind outcome assessment is not reported and is unlikely to have been used.</P>

<P>At least two review authors independently undertook assessment of risk of bias in all included trials. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by involvement of another review author.

We assessed eight domains according to the tool, namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants/personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, balance of baseline characteristics and freedom from contamination or co-intervention. Each domain included one or more specific entries in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each entry, we described information reported in the study and assigned a judgement related to risk of bias for that entry. When the study clearly reported the methods used, we made a judgement of 'low risk of bias' or ' high risk of bias' as appropriate. Where trial methods were unclear, we judged a domain as at 'unclear risk of bias' until further information becomes available.</P>

For an outcome such as caries increment, where discrete counts are considered to approximate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous data, we considered this measure more appropriate than the mean difference or the standardised mean difference because it allows the combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is also simple to interpret.</P>
<P>For outcomes other than caries increment, we planned that we would summarise continuous data as average mean differences (MDs) in treatment effects along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), or, if different scales were used to measure the same outcome in different trials, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and their 95% CIs. We analysed dichotomous outcome data by calculating risk ratios (RRs) or, for adverse effects of fluoride treatment, risk differences (RDs).</P>

<P>In trials with more than one relevant intervention group and a common control group, such as those comparing different active fluoride agents or concentrations of fluoride ions against a placebo group, we combined summary statistics (the number of children analysed, mean caries increments and standard deviations) from all relevant experimental groups (and from any relevant control groups, if this was the case) to obtain a measure of treatment effect (the PF).

<P>We decided that when missing standard deviations for caries increments could not be obtained by contacting the original researchers, we would impute these values through linear regression of log standard deviations on log mean caries increments. This is a suitable approach for caries prevention trials because, as they follow an approximate Poisson distribution, caries increments are closely related (similar) to their standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijkom 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes reporting bias (within-study reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>Within-study reporting bias (one of the eight 'risk of bias' domains listed above, as selective outcome reporting) would ideally be assessed by comparing outcomes reported in the published report against the study protocol. As this was not possible, we compared the outcomes listed in the Methods section with reported results. If results were mentioned but were not reported adequately in a way that allowed analysis (e.g. only mentioned whether or not the results were statistically significant), we sought information from the authors of study reports. Otherwise, this would be judged as "high risk" of bias. If information was insufficient to judge the risk of bias, we judged the risk as unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

We estimated variances using the formula presented in <LINK REF="REF-Dubey-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubey 1965</LINK>, which was more suitable for use in a weighted average, and for large sample sizes the approximation should be reasonable.

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-07-19 23:30:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We specified three potential sources of heterogeneity a priori, as these formed part of the primary objectives of this review. We hypothesised that the effect of fluoride mouthrinses on caries differs according to: (1) baseline levels of caries severity; (2) exposure to other fluoride sources (in water, in toothpastes, etc); and (3) frequency of application and fluoride concentration. We examined the association of these factors with estimated effects (D(M)FS PFs) by performing random-effects metaregression analyses in Stata version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) using the 'Metareg' command (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>To allow such investigation, we dealt with relevant data as follows. We calculated data on 'baseline levels of caries' from the study sample analysed (final sample) unless otherwise stated, and we averaged values among all relevant study groups. Data on 'background exposure to other fluoride sources' represented combined data on use of fluoride toothpaste and consumption of fluoridated water (or salt) and were grouped into two categories: one for studies that were based on samples provided with non-fluoride toothpaste and that were obtained from non-fluoridated areas (non-exposed), and another for studies based on samples using fluoride toothpaste or studies in fluoridated communities or both. We considered exposure to water fluoridation when fluoride levels in water were stated to be above 0.3 ppm F. Use of fluoride toothpaste reported for 30% or more of the study sample would indicate exposure to fluoridated toothpaste. When use or non-use of fluoride toothpaste was not clearly indicated in studies carried out in high-income countries, we assumed that fluoride toothpaste was widely used from the middle of the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1989</LINK>); we sought this information from study authors (or obtained it from other sources) when missing from studies carried out in other locations. When data on the year a study had begun were not provided, we calculated a 'probable date' by subtracting the duration of the study (in years) plus one extra year, from the publication date of the study. We have not categorised data on 'frequency of application' and 'concentration applied'. We averaged concentrations in multiple-arm studies over fluoride mouthrinse groups. We dealt with incomplete data for frequency of mouthrinsing as follows: In studies of supervised daily rinse at school where participants were provided with mouthrinse for home use, we assumed rinsing frequency of 365 times a year if not precisely reported. We assumed rinsing frequency of 320 times a year in studies of 'unsupervised' daily rinse at home (even if instructions to rinse more than once a day were given); we assumed frequency of 160 times (days) a year when it was not precisely reported in studies of supervised daily rinse at school where children were not provided with any rinse for home use; frequency of 30 times a year for weekly rinse at school and frequency of 17 times a year for fortnightly rinse at school.</P>
<P>We investigated further potential sources of heterogeneity by metaregression - for different types of control groups (placebo (PL) or no treatment (NT), length of follow-up (years) and dropout rate (%). These 'post hoc' analyses were reported as such and findings should be treated with caution.</P>

<P>For the main meta-analysis of D(M)FS prevented fraction, we planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis including trials with an overall assessment of low risk of bias, but we found no trials satisfying this criterion. We undertook a sensitivity analysis excluding trials where we imputed missing standard deviations. We performed a sensitivity analysis to take account of additional uncertainty related to the cluster-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>, and another excluding one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Spets_x002d_Happonen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Spets-Happonen 1991</LINK>) in which a non-fluoride active agent was present in both fluoride and control groups (the trial was different in this way from all others).

<P>We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach (<A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org">gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org</A>) to rate the overall 'quality of evidence' for our primary outcome and the most important secondary outcomes in the main comparison. <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> provides outcome-specific information concerning the overall quality of evidence from each included study in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on all outcomes that we rate as important to patient care and decision making.</P>
<P>The quality of evidence reflects the extent to which we are confident that an estimate of effect is correct and apply this in our interpretation of results. The four possible ratings are 'high', 'moderate', 'low' and 'very low'. A rating of 'high quality' of evidence implies that we are confident in our estimate of effect and believe that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. A rating of 'very low quality' quality implies that any estimates of effect obtained are very uncertain.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach considers evidence from RCTs that do not have serious limitations as 'high' quality. However, the quality of evidence can be decreased by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>study limitations (risk of bias);</LI>
<LI>inconsistency;</LI>
<LI>Indirectness of evidence;</LI>
<LI>imprecision; and</LI>
<LI>publication bias.</LI>

The total number of children participating in the 37 included trials (given by the sample analysed at the end of the trial periods) was 15,813, and ranged from 95 in the smallest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Spets_x002d_Happonen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Spets-Happonen 1991</LINK>) to 1238 in the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ringelberg-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ringelberg 1982</LINK>), on average 427 participants per trial.</P>
<P>Investigators recruited all participants from school settings.</P>
<P>All included trials reported that participants were aged 14 or younger at the start, with similar numbers of males and females (where these data were reported). The age of children at the start of trials ranged from five to 14 years (where these data were reported); at least 18 trials included children who were 12 years old at the start, and at least five trials included six-year-olds (but reported no primary teeth caries data). Caries prevalence at baseline (decayed, missing and filled surfaces (D(M)FS)), reported in all but two studies, ranged from 0.94 (<LINK REF="STD-Horowitz-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Horowitz 1971</LINK>) to 14.6 D(M)FS (<LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967</LINK>). With regard to 'background exposure to other fluoride sources', all but two studies reported whether or not participants were exposed to water fluoridation: Four studies were conducted in fluoridated communities (<LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laswell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Laswell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radike-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Radike 1973</LINK>), and 31 studies were not. Of the 31 studies conducted in non-fluoridated areas, researchers clearly reported no (or very low) background exposure to fluoride toothpaste or to other fluoride sources in eight studies, substantial exposure to fluoride toothpaste (over 95%) in seven studies and exposure to other fluoride sources - varnish (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>) and tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>) - in two studies; whether or not participants were exposed to fluoride toothpaste had to be assumed in 16 studies based on study location and year started, as described above.</P>

Rinsing with sodium fluoride (NaF) was tested in 33 trials, acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Finn-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laswell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Laswell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Packer-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Packer 1975</LINK>), stannous fluoride (SnF2) in two (<LINK REF="STD-McConchie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McConchie 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radike-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Radike 1973</LINK>) and sodium monofluorophosphate (SMFP), amine fluoride (AmF) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) each in a different study (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringelberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ringelberg 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1977</LINK>, respectively). The fluoride concentration used in tested mouthrinses ranged from 100 ppm F (0.02% NaF) to 3000 ppm F (0.66% NaF), and frequency of application ranged from three to 330 times a year, but these were unusually low and high concentrations and frequencies. Eighteen studies used the concentration of 230 ppm F (180 and 250 ppm F in a few studies), and 20 studies the concentration of 900 ppm F (1000 ppm F in a few studies). It can be seen that when rinsing was performed once a week or once every two weeks, investigators employing 900 ppm F was usually used (17 trials). Conversely, when rinsing was performed once (or twice) a day, the fluoride concentration used was 230 ppm F, or around this concentration (13 trials). The only study (<LINK REF="STD-Duany-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Duany 1981</LINK>) where information on rinsing frequency was not available is likely to have used daily rinses for all three low concentrations of fluoride tested (this was one of the four studies testing 100 ppm F rinsing solutions). The most usual amounts of mouthrinse used per application was 5 or 10 mL, and usual rinsing time was one or two minutes (these amounts and rinsing times were reported in 21 studies). Four studies reported performance of some form of prior tooth prophylaxis (brushing without paste or with a non-fluoride paste before rinsing, which was not considered a separate intervention on its own but as a possible part of the rinsing procedure) (<LINK REF="STD-Ashley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ashley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blinkhorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blinkhorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spets_x002d_Happonen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Spets-Happonen 1991</LINK>).</P>

With regard to components of the DMFS index used (and types of teeth/surfaces assessed), 20 trials reported DMFS data (one trial for premolars and molars only, and 19 trials for all tooth surface types), and 17 trials reported DFS data (two trials for approximal surfaces of premolars and molars only, and 15 trials for all tooth surface types). No choice had to be made between DMFS or DFS data in any one trial. Sixteen trials presented D(M)FS data at more than one follow-up time (which ranged from 1.6 to three years); 27 trials reported follow-up of 2 or 3 years.

Twenty trials used X-rays in addition to visual examination for caries detection. Clinical (35 trials) and radiographic (22 trials) examinations provided the definition of different levels or grades of caries lesions, which have been grouped into two basic grades for each method of examination: NCA = non-cavitated incipient enamel lesions clinically visible as white spots or discoloured fissures; CA = lesions showing loss of enamel continuity that can be recorded clinically (undermined enamel, softened floor/walls) or showing frank cavitation; ER = any radiolucency in enamel/enamel-dentine junction; DR = radiolucency into dentine. Eighteen trials presented results using the dentine cavitation level of diagnosis for caries (CA/DR), and two trials presented results using the enamel level (NCA/ER) (<LINK REF="STD-Ashley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ashley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1973</LINK>). The 17 trials remaining did not report the diagnostic level/grade used for caries (14 trials), in which case CA/DR was assumed, or reported both levels of diagnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Petersson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>), in which case CA/DR was chosen where viable. Nineteen trials specified data on the state of tooth eruption considered: seven trials reported data for teeth erupted at baseline (although data were recorded on erupting and erupted teeth in some), and 12 trials reported combined data for erupting and erupted teeth.</P>

<P>All included studies were published between one and four decades ago, and ratings considered the overall context of those papers and correspondence with study authors where available.

We considered nine studies to be at unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ashley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ashley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blinkhorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blinkhorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heidmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Petersson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poulsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radike-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Radike 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rugg_x002d_Gunn-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Rugg-Gunn 1973</LINK>) and the remaining 28 studies to be at high risk of bias.</P>

<P>None of the studies were at low risk of selection bias overall, that is, low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Most (23 studies) were at unclear risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. We rated three of the studies as having high risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment because researchers very likely used a quasi-randomisation method (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>At least 20 studies had described attempting to do some form of stratification by sex, age, dental age, caries status, number of examiners, etc. Five of these (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>) did not use participants as the unit of randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK> had stratified schools according to their socioeconomic status and used the schools as a unit of randomisation. <LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK> had divided children "randomly" between two examiners according to gender and age, and had arranged them in ascending order in terms of number of permanent teeth present and caries status (DMFS); investigators then formed these children into groups of four before assigning rinsing solutions "at random". <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK> had used a similar method, forming "homogeneous" groups of four and assigning interventions "randomly". It seems very likely that investigators used a quasi-randomised method, and allocation concealment would not have been effective. <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1974</LINK> divided the children in each class into two "teams" on the basis of caries status and dental age, then used a flip of a coin to decide which team received the intervention.</P>
<P>We considered eight studies to be at low risk of bias related to random sequence generation (<LINK REF="STD-Ashley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ashley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Craig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heidmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heifetz-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Heifetz 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molina-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Molina 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Radike-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Radike 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ringelberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ringelberg 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torell-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Torell 1965</LINK>), but the adequacy of allocation concealment was unclear. In addition to the three studies mentioned above (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>), another four studies were likely to have used a quasi-randomised method for sequence generation. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967a" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967b" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967b</LINK>) had separated girls and boys into classes, arranged their names in alphabetical order and then assigned them to treatment or control in alternation (quasi-randomisation). However, because all students were involved in the trial and the order of students appearing in the class register cannot be changed, the risk of bias arising from lack of concealment is low. <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK> had only described randomising participants and did not provide details, but overall descriptions in the report suggest that a quasi-randomised method very likely was used.</P>

We considered two studies to be at high risk of selective reporting bias (<LINK REF="STD-Brandt-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Brandt 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Liefde-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Liefde 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Brandt-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Brandt 1972</LINK> reported only matched-pair analyses data (94 pairs; data from more than a quarter of available participants not analysed).. In our correspondence, the trial author explained that this was an attempt to correct the baseline imbalance observed, but unfortunately, the method of analysis broke the randomisation, precluding inclusion of data in the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-De-Liefde-1989" TYPE="STUDY">De Liefde 1989</LINK> reported only results of combined non-randomised and randomised groups (separate results for placebo group not available, data could not be included for meta-analysis).</P>

In the original version of this review, we estimated unreported SDs from analysis of the 179 available treatment arms for the series of topical fluoride reviews with complete information (as of October 1999). This resulted in a regression equation of log (SD caries increment) = 0.64 + 0.55*log (mean caries increment) (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%). We used this equation to estimate missing SDs from mean D(M)FS increments for meta-analyses. Similarly, we used this same regression equation to estimate missing SD data for three of the 13 trials reporting D(M)FT data (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConchie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McConchie 1977</LINK>).</P>

As we had already incorporated this in the original review, accounting for clustering through the inflated variance approach, we decided that the same approach would be used and we would conduct sensitivity analysis again to take account of additional uncertainty related to the cluster-randomised trial. We inflated the variance of the prevented fraction estimate by an amount equal to (1 + (m-1) * ICC), where m is the average cluster size and ICC the intraclass correlation coefficient. A conservative value of 0.1 was used for the ICC because we could not find an ICC from this or a similar trial at the time.</P>

<P>For all 35 trials combined, the D(M)FS PF pooled estimate was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23 to 0.30; P value &lt; 0.0001), suggesting a large caries-preventive benefit from the use of fluoride mouthrinse. The CIs are relatively narrow, and although not substantial, heterogeneity in results could be observed statistically (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 58.43 on 34 degrees of freedom, P value = 0.006; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 42%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Metaregression and sensitivity analyses: D(M)FS PF</HEADING>
<P>Univariate metaregression suggested no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and prespecified factors: baseline caries severity, background exposure to fluoridated water, background exposure to fluoride toothpaste, background exposure to any fluoride source, fluoride concentration and rinsing frequency. We noted an association of 'total intensity of application per year' (frequency times concentration) with the prevented fraction, but this became non-significant when we excluded from the analysis the trial of <LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1977</LINK>, a study with high influence (an outlier).</P>
<P>Further univariate metaregression analyses on other characteristics not specified a priori showed no significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and type of control group (placebo/no treatment), dropout rate or length of follow-up (duration of study in years). We have not investigated other potential effect modifiers (e.g. mode of mouthrinse use) because virtually all trials were conducted in school settings under supervision.</P>
<P>We have presented the results of random-effects meta-analyses of D(M)FS PFs (all trials) in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. We have provided metaregression results for all potential effect modifiers investigated in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. It should be noted that we omitted the influential study by <LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1977</LINK> from the analysis intensity of application with prevented fraction. These metaregression results must be interpreted with caution given the observational nature of the comparisons and the large number of comparisons made.</P>
<P>To determine the potential influence of data imputation and approximation, we undertook a sensitivity analysis, restricting pooling of trials to those that were fully reported and suitable for analysis (23 trials). Results of this gave rise to a very similar D(M)FS PF value to the one obtained as a result of the full meta-analysis (PF = 0.28, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.31), although a large reduction in the indicator of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19%) was evident. We also performed a sensitivity analysis for the main meta-analysis of D(M)FS prevented fraction to take account of additional uncertainty related to the cluster-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK> after accounting for clustering using the inflated variance approach. The D(M)FS PF pooled estimate was 0.26 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.30; P value &lt; 0.0001). These results are nearly identical to results of the analysis ignoring the cluster-randomised design because the estimate for this trial is similar to the meta-analysis result, and altering its weight has minimal effect.</P>
<P>We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding the three trials at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>) and excluding the eight trials at high or unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Craig-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Craig 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laswell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Laswell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Packer-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Packer 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Torell-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Torell 1965</LINK>). For allocation concealment, results were equal to those of the full meta-analysis (PF = 0.27, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.30) with some increase in the indicator of heterogeneity (from 42% to 46%); for blind outcome assessment, results showed similar PF values (PF = 0.26, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.30) and a somewhat increased indicator of heterogeneity (from 42% to 48%).</P>
<P>We performed yet another sensitivity analysis by excluding one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Spets_x002d_Happonen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Spets-Happonen 1991</LINK>) in which a non-fluoride active agent was present in both fluoride and control groups, making the trial different in this way from all others that had been included. The D(M)FS PF pooled estimate resulting from exclusion of this trial was identical to the analysis that includes it (PF = 0.27, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.30). This is a small trial that carries little weight and had minimal effect in a meta-analysis that includes so many larger studies.</P>

Study authors reported a significant difference in stain score from control (n = 44; mean score = 1.05) in the group using an amine fluoride mouthrinse (n = 84; mean score = 3.57) and a non-significant difference from control (n = 52; mean score = 0.31) in the group using a sodium fluoride mouthrinse (n = 87; mean score = 0.97), concluding that use of amine fluoride mouthrinse resulted in the highest stain score.</P>

<P>We have presented the key findings in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>The main aim of this review was to estimate the effects on dental caries of using fluoride mouthrinse compared with placebo or no treatment in children. More than 15,800 children were included in the 37 trials comparing a fluoride mouthrinse against a placebo or no treatment. For almost all children, the fluoride rinse they received was a sodium fluoride (NaF) formulation, provided in supervised school-based mouthrinsing programmes, often on a daily or weekly/fortnightly basis. Fluoride mouthrinsing at these two rinse frequencies and two main different strengths (230 ppm F (fluoride concentration)/900 ppm F) has proved a versatile method of self applied topical fluoride use, and an effective method when used regularly over time under supervision.</P>
<P>An average caries reduction in terms of decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (DMFS) in permanent teeth of about 27% can be expected from use of this method. The meta-analysis of the 35 studies assessing the effect of fluoride mouthrinse on the permanent dentition suggests that this reduction falls within narrow confidence intervals (23% to 30%).</P>
<P>A secondary aim of this review was to determine whether we could find any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinse and a number of factors, including the initial level of caries severity, background exposure to fluoride and fluoride concentration and frequency of use. We were unable to detect a clear relationship between any of these factors and the magnitude of the treatment effect in the metaregression analysis performed in spite of substantial variation between trials in these factors. This result should, however, be interpreted with caution. Even a meta-analysis including 35 trials has limited power to detect such relationships and, like all analyses of observational data, is subject to the problem of potential confounding. In addition, some factors such as 'background exposure to fluoride' introduce the problem of potential misclassification due to the poor quality of reported data on exposure to fluoride other than in water. We were forced to make several assumptions, for instance, classifying 'use of fluoride toothpaste' for 16 of the studies on the basis of the year when the study was conducted and its location. We were also forced to treat this as a dichotomous variable (before/after mid 1970s), although it is likely that use of fluoridated toothpaste gradually increased during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Similarly, we grouped exposure to fluoride in toothpaste and fluoride in water into a single dichotomous variable, which is likely to group studies whose participants had quite different levels of baseline exposure to fluoride sources. These problems may bias any estimates of effect towards the null hypothesis. Nevertheless, these results suggest that fluoride mouthrinse may still be of benefit after the advent of fluoride toothpaste, and in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas.</P>
<P>We did observe a significantly greater treatment effect with increased total intensity (frequency times concentration) of mouthrinse application. Although plausible, this relationship was dependent on the inclusion of one study with particularly powerful effects (<LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1977</LINK>). After exclusion of this study from the analysis, we noted no significant association with this factor. It should be noted that in most studies where mouthrinse was performed once a week (or once every two weeks), a rinse employing higher fluoride concentrations (usually 900 ppm F) was used (16 trials). Conversely, in most studies where rinsing was performed once (or twice) a day, a lower fluoride concentration (usually 230 ppm F) was used (13 trials). Moreover, in six multi-arm studies investigating both combinations of concentrations-frequencies (and in seven studies testing the two main fluoride concentrations), we averaged this intensity score over fluoride treatment groups to combine study results, a decision that may have slightly affected this particular investigation of heterogeneity (and that of dose response). Nevertheless, looking specifically at the effectiveness of the two most commonly used fluoride mouthrinse regimens indicates that few choices may be available when the weaker (low concentration) is used as a daily rinse and the stronger (high concentration) as a weekly or fortnightly rinse. This does not necessarily imply that when both concentrations are used daily, or both are used as weekly/fortnightly rinses, they will have a similar effect. A weaker solution may well yield poorer results when used less frequently. More robust investigations of these aspects of the intervention require direct, head-to-head comparisons of different fluoride concentrations, frequencies and intensities, which were not within the scope of this review.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-26 07:23:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Valeria Marinho">
<P>The evidence included in the review pertains to caries in children and adolescents, where all studies that met the review's inclusion criteria examined the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride mouthrinse used in supervised school-based schemes on permanent teeth, with only two studies also looking at unsupervised home use of rinse, and none of the studies reporting data on the primary dentition. We found most of the evidence in the school setting where children were supervised when rinsing, although the evidence may be applicable to other settings where children use mouthrinsing under supervision or not.</P>
<P>Although there is clear evidence that fluoride mouthrinses have a caries-inhibiting effect, we found little information about the effects of fluoride mouthrinses on other outcomes such as the proportion of children developing new caries, or on the acceptability of a fluoride rinsing regimen. We found little useful information about possible adverse effects of the procedure, such as tooth staining or oral soft tissue irritation/allergic reactions, and none of the studies reported on signs of acute toxicity. This scarcity of direct evidence from clinical trials on relevant outcomes other than dental caries makes it more difficult for clinicians and policy makers to weigh the benefits of fluoride mouthrinse use in preventing caries against possible shortcomings of the procedure, whether provided in community dental health programmes or in the home environment.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review used a variety of fluoride rinsing frequencies, agents and concentrations. In studies with more than one relevant intervention group and a common control group, such as those comparing different active fluoride agents or concentrations of fluoride ions, or rinsing frequencies, against a placebo group, we combined summary statistics from the studies (number of children analysed, mean caries increments, standard deviations) from all relevant intervention groups to obtain a measure of treatment effect. This enabled the inclusion of all relevant data in the primary meta-analyses assessing the caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride mouthrinsing on children&#8217;s permanent tooth surfaces, but it has limited a secondary investigation of dose response.</P>
<P>The trials included in this review were conducted with participants who were at differing levels of caries risk, as evidenced by the variability of caries increments in the control groups, and who were based in different locations with variability in background exposure to other sources of fluoride.</P>
<P>The caries increment prevented fraction appeared to be consistent across different populations, levels of caries risk and exposure to other fluoride sources. The absolute benefit from fluoride mouthrinse will, of course, depend on the expected caries increment in the target population. When the expected caries increment is small, the absolute benefit of fluoride mouthrinse will be small. Moreover, the Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003b</LINK>) that evaluated the effects of all main topical fluoride interventions for preventing caries in children and adolescents found evidence that the relative effect of topical fluoride may be greater in those who have higher baseline levels of caries.</P>
<P>An important issue in this review is whether the body of evidence, which consists of older studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s mainly with participants who were probably not exposed to fluoride toothpaste, is applicable today, when fluoridated toothpastes are widely available and level of use is generally high. Among the 31 studies conducted in non-fluoridated areas, seven studies reported substantial exposure to fluoride toothpaste (over 95%). In this update, we included only one new study (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>), which was carried out in Sweden in the early 2000s. The prevented fractions (PFs) observed in this trial comparing various rinsing frequencies against a no-treatment control group where participants would have had lifetime use of fluoride toothpaste pointed out a large effect, greater than the overall pooled result. Again, the Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003b</LINK>) summarising all the evidence on the effects of the main topical fluoride interventions found no evidence that the effect of topical fluoride was dependent on background exposure to other fluoride sources.</P>
<P>We have found little information about the adverse effects of fluoride mouthrinse; only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) reported data on tooth staining, concluding that use of amine fluoride mouthrinse resulted in a high stain score. Substantial information on a particular type of adverse effect (fluorosis) of topically applied fluoride treatments (especially toothpaste) can be found in a Cochrane review on topical fluoride and risk of fluorosis (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2010</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-26 08:44:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) approach to assess the quality of evidence for fluoride mouth rinses versus placebo or no treatment.</P>
<P>In terms of methodological limitations of the studies, we assessed none of the trials included in this review as having low risk of bias; most (28) were at high risk of bias. The domain most commonly found to be at high risk of bias was incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), followed by random sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), and blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). Moreover, all but one of the included studies were published before the year 2000, most in the 1970s and 1980s, and most papers provided little information on topics considered important for assessment of bias. This meant that many of the trials included in the review were at 'unclear' risk of bias. Most studies conducted supervised mouthrinsing in the school setting - this was considered for indirectness, but downgrading was considered unnecessary because the evidence may be applicable to other settings where children use mouthrinsing under supervision or not.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome, we downgraded the quality of evidence on caries increment on permanent tooth surfaces (DMFS) to <I>moderate quality </I>because of limitations in study design across the 35 trials (15,813 participants) contributing data to this meta-analysis. The size of the treatment effect for the effectiveness outcomes (caries increment) was clinically important. For the same reason, the quality of evidence for the caries-preventive effect on permanent teeth (DMFT increment) based on 13 trials (5105 participants) was also moderate; we are moderately confident in the effect estimate - the true effect is likely to be close to the effect estimate, but there is a possibility that it could be different.</P>
<P>Only three studies reported on developing one or more new caries (1805 participants). It is unclear whether the other studies measured this outcome; therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of reporting bias. We also downgraded the quality of evidence owing to high risk of bias in two of the three studies and owing to highly inconsistent findings across studies. Therefore quality of evidence for this outcome is very low. Our confidence in the effect estimate is very limited, and further research is very likely to have an important impact and is likely to change this estimate.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for dropping out from the mouthrinse as opposed to dropping out from the control condition (as an indirect measure of treatment acceptability) was also very low. The four studies (1700 participants) that contributed data to the pooled results have serious limitations in their methods; all are at high risk of bias. We downgraded further for imprecision because of the small numbers of events and participants, which contributed to the wide confidence intervals. Serious, unresolved heterogeneity was also observed. Besides, it is unclear how this outcome is linked to participants' lack of acceptance of treatment.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence on another two outcomes - risk of tooth staining (three trials) and oral mucosal irritation (one trial) - is very low, owing to very incomplete reporting and concerns about risk of bias. Too little information was provided for assessment of whether risk was increased with fluoridated mouthrinses.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-07-26 08:46:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used a sensitive search strategy to identify trials for inclusion in this review and placed no restrictions on publication status nor language. We translated many references to determine whether or not they included trials eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>We made a thorough attempt to investigate sources of heterogeneity in this review, examining factors related to participants and interventions, as discussed above (<LINK TAG="SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Summary of main results</LINK>), and study methodological/design quality. None of the a priori specified factors discussed above (initial caries levels, background exposure to fluoride, frequency of use, fluoride concentration) was clearly related to heterogeneity. When we looked for any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of fluoride rinse and a few other factors posed post hoc (length of follow-up, prior prophylaxis, dropout rate, type of control group), we found no significant associations. Even though the type of control group (placebo/no treatment) might represent a strong indicator of study quality and source of heterogeneity in the topical fluoride reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2015</LINK>), we did not observe a relationship between type of control group and prevented fraction in this review, possibly because only five non-placebo-controlled trials were included. Moreover, it should be pointed out that we observed a generally high attrition rate across fluoride rinse trials (mean of 32%). Overall only 65% of all participants at the start remained at the end of the studies, and results were often based on compliant participants who actually completed the study. Thus, the issue of longer-term compliance should not be disregarded when such a procedure is administered.</P>
<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis for the main meta-analysis to take account of additional uncertainty we may have about the cluster-randomised trial by <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>. This produced results (pooled DMFS PF) virtually identical to those of the analysis ignoring the cluster-randomised design because the estimate for this trial is similar to that for the meta-analysis result, and altering its weight has minimal effect. We also performed sensitivity analyses for the main meta-analysis to take into account the uncertainty that we had about imputations for missing standard deviations and for inclusion of trials at high risk of bias for allocation concealment and for blinding of outcome assessment. These sensitivity analyses showed results that were very similar, albeit with some variation in levels of heterogeneity, to those of the full DMFS PF meta-analysis. The unchanged sensitivity analysis result obtained for the key domain of allocation concealment was possibly due to the fact that this process was generally poorly described in the included studies.</P>
<P>A degree of funnel plot asymmetry may be suggested by visual inspection (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), but the Egger test provided no evidence of a significant relationship between trial size and effect estimate.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-07-29 09:30:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The general direction of findings presented is in keeping with those of other reviews (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), which also found evidence for the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinse.</P>
<P>The estimate of caries reduction in this review remains similar to that reported in the meta-analysis on the caries-preventive effect of fluoride mouthrinses in <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>, which found a pooled D(M)FS PF estimate of 29% (95% confidence interval (CI) 14% to 53%) reduction in caries increment for children with no additional fluoride exposure, although trials including children with no background fluoride exposure (pooled results combining both subsets not reported) found a PF of 6% (95% CI 0% to 30%). It is also similar to that reported in the most recently published meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), where treatment effects for 900 ppm F mouthrinse solutions only were presented as pooled D(M)FS standardised mean differences (SMDs), and a pooled estimate of -0.26 (95% CI -0.40 to -0.13) was obtained (owing to the character of D(M)FS data, mean caries increments are closely related to their standard deviations).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there were substantial differences in selection criteria and methods between these reviews, and consequently in the numbers and types of studies included. Of the 21 studies included in D(M)FS PF meta-analyses in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>, we did not include five in this review. We identified and included 16 additional studies in this review, including one published after the <LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK> review (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>As for the other review (<LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>), of the eight studies included in its D(M)FS SMD meta-analysis of 900 ppm F mouthrinses, we included seven in this review; in the trial that did not meet the inclusion criteria for our review (<LINK REF="STD-Chikte-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Chikte 1996</LINK>), we found no indication of random or quasi-random allocation, and blind outcome assessment, also not stated or indicated, was unlikely. We identified 10 additional studies testing 900 ppm F mouthrinses for inclusion in this review - all published before the <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK> review.</P>
<P>This updated Cochrane review includes one additional RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Moberg-Sk_x00f6_ld-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Moberg Sköld 2005</LINK>) compared with the previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>). This included trial is not included in the reviews mentioned above (<LINK REF="REF-Twetman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Twetman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weyant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weyant 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The large body of evidence contained in this updated Cochrane review provides the best available evidence of the effectiveness of fluoride mouthrinses compared with placebo or no treatment (the comparative effectiveness of topical-fluoride interventions is addressed in another review in this series (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2004</LINK>)).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-11-24 13:21:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review found that supervised regular use of fluoride mouthrinse by children and adolescents is associated with a large reduction in caries increment in permanent teeth (the quality of evidence is moderate). Compared with control groups, daily and weekly/fortnightly supervised rinse programmes result on average in 27% (95% CI 23 % to 30% reduction) fewer decayed, missing or filled permanent tooth surfaces. Most of the evidence is from studies that evaluated use of fluoride mouthrinse supervised in a school setting, but the findings may be applicable to children in other settings with supervised/unsupervised rinsing, although the size of the caries preventive effect is less clear.</P>
<P>We found no evidence that this relative effect was dependent on baseline caries level nor exposure to other fluoride sources, fluoride concentration and mouthrinsing frequency, although this result should be interpreted with caution. A higher decayed (missing) and filled surface (D(M)FS) prevented fraction was shown with increased intensity of application (frequency times concentration). This relationship was dependent on the inclusion of one study with particularly powerful effects.</P>
<P>In line with the findings for permanent tooth surfaces, regular mouthrinsing with fluoride results on average in 23% (95% CI, 18% to 29%; I² = 54%) fewer decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth (moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the review does not provide useful information on the likelihood of significant side effects with the use of fluoride mouthrinse, and information on acceptability is inconclusive.</P>
<P>The evidence seems applicable to current clinical practice. Although the evidence base for fluoride mouthrinse is derived mainly from studies conducted when fluoridated toothpaste was not widely available in the 1960s and 1970s, the eight trials from the 1980s and 1990s show no evidence of smaller treatment effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-07-28 15:41:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have identified a large number of trials, but the reporting of the trials included in this review is relatively poor, with many lacking important methodological details. This is likely due in part to the fact that most are relatively old. Many characteristics considered crucial for excluding bias, such as clearly stated randomisation and allocation concealment, have been more emphasised only in recent years, after most of the mouthrinse trials were reported. However, given the clarity of study results, additional randomised comparisons of fluoride mouthrinse and placebo alone would be difficult to justify. Head-to-head comparisons of fluoride rinses and other preventive strategies, and of different fluoride rinse application features, may provide more useful information.</P>
<P>It is important that future trials include assessment of other relevant outcomes such as potential adverse effects and those related to acceptability of treatment. Planning and conducting an economic analysis alongside the clinical trial could be considered. In addition, evaluation of possible differences in effect associated with fluoride rinse application features, such as frequency/concentration of application, should be based on trials that directly compare such features. Future trials should be well-designed RCTs (adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment methods, blinding of participants and outcome assessors) reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>). Researchers should use core outcomes on assessment of caries and the impact of caries, which may be available through the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative (<A HREF="http://www.comet-initiative.org">www.comet-initiative.org</A>).</P>

<P>In the 2016 update, we further defined outcomes for clarity. We also trimmed the list of outcomes to those more relevant to patients. Information on use of healthcare service resources (such as visits to dental care units, length of dental treatment time) was not available from the studies and will no longer be collected. These data have limited applicability across settings.</P>
<P>Other changes implemented in this update are the addition of a full &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; assessment and the development of a &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table for the primary outcomes in the review.</P>
<P>Finally, we made changes to the measures of effect used for the meta-analysis of some secondary outcomes, as well as changes to some of the investigations of heterogeneity performed through metaregression and subgroup analyses and to investigations of sensitivity analyses, including changes to the way a few co-variates were analysed in each. We have reported these changes and the rationale for them in relevant sections of the review.</P>
