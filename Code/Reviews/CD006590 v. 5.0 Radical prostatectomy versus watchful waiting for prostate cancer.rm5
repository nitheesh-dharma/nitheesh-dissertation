<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-08-25 10:26:23 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this review the best available evidence comparing the effects of two treatment options for localised prostate cancer, namely radical prostatectomy (RP) which involves surgically removing the prostate gland versus a "watchful waiting" (WW) approach was examined. In this review, WW is defined as any conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer whereby a decision is made to provide no initial treatment and to monitor the patient. If the monitoring procedure provides evidence of disease progression, then palliative treatment<I> </I>is offered to the patient, which is intended to alleviate disease symptoms without attempting to cure the disease.</P>
<P>Two completed randomised controlled trials were identified. One trial was considered to be of good quality whilst the second trial was of poor quality. The two trials commenced prior to the widespread use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test as a screening test for prostate cancer, and hence did not involve many men with PSA-detected cancers. Ongoing trials (<A HREF="PIVOT">PIVOT</A>; <A HREF="ProtecT">ProtecT</A>; <A HREF="START">START</A>) will provide evidence of the comparative effects of RP and observation protocols for men with PSA-detected cancers.</P>
<P>The one good quality trial included in this review involved men with cancers detected by methods other than screening who were randomly allocated to either RP or WW and followed up for 12 years. This single trial does not provide sufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the magnitude of any beneficial and harmful effects of RP compared with WW for men with clinically detected prostate cancers. The trial results indicate that RP is likely to reduce the risks of overall mortality, prostate-cancer mortality and distant metastases (cancer spread) compared to WW, but the magnitude of the effect is unclear. Furthermore, the risk reductions appear to have been limited to men less than 65 years of age. This trial also provides evidence that RP increases the risks of erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage. However, because of the manner in which the data on adverse effects were collected in the trial, confident statements cannot be made about how frequently these adverse effects occur. In addition, nerve-sparing surgery, which has the potential to reduce these complications, was not routinely performed on participants in the trial.</P>
<P>A shared approach to decision-making is required whereby patients and their healthcare providers openly discuss the patient's personal values, preferences, and the limitations of the available evidence on potential benefits and potential harms of these treatment options.</P>

<P>The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer continues to impact on clinical decision-making.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-08 13:00:47 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.</P>
<P>One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).</P>
<P>The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively).        </P>
<P>Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP.</P>

<P>The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-23 05:13:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prostate cancer is the most common male non-dermatological cancer in Europe and the United States of America (USA), and is the second most common male cancer worldwide, occurring mostly in older men (<LINK REF="REF-Parkin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parkin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jemal-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemal 2010</LINK>). The increased use of screening techniques for prostate cancer using serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has meant that prostate cancer is more commonly diagnosed and can be detected at an earlier stage than was previously possible. However, screening for prostate cancer remains highly controversial and there is considerable uncertainty and debate over the value of screening programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Bunting-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bunting 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frankel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ilic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ilic 2006;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Andriole-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andriole 2009</LINK>). An important aspect of this debate is the uncertainty surrounding the relative beneficial and harmful effects of different treatment strategies for prostate cancer; in particular, the benefits and risks of "radical prostatectomy" (RP) versus a "watchful waiting" (WW) approach for patients with clinically localised prostate cancer.</P>
<P>Interventions for managing clinically localised prostate cancer can be grouped into three broad categories.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-09-08 13:05:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1) Interventions with curative intent</HEADING>
<P>These include RP, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, cryotherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound therapy.<BR/>Radical prostatectomy involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and some surrounding tissue. Reported benefits of this procedure include reduced disease specific mortality, overall mortality and reduced risk of local progression and metastasis (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wong-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 2006</LINK>). These benefits must be weighed against the risks of surgical morbidity, including altered urinary function, a deterioration in sexual function and the risks associated with general anaesthesia for a major surgical procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Wei-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wei 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hu-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hu 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Namiki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Namiki 2004</LINK>). In the past decade, new operative techniques which aim to preserve the surrounding neurovascular structures have been reported to reduce the complication rates (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alivizatos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alivizatos 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2) Interventions with palliative intent</HEADING>
<P>These include interventions that are not intended as curative when used in isolation, such as androgen suppression, other hormonal treatment, or chemotherapy. As the prostate is a hormone-responsive organ, interventions which either reduce serum testosterone or block the actions of the hormone can delay the need for treatment (neoadjuvant therapy) or be used after treatment of curative intent (adjuvant therapy) or for salvage (for progression of disease after local therapy) (<LINK REF="REF-Jani-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jani 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3) Deferral of treatment, monitoring the patient and providing treatment when there is evidence of disease progression</HEADING>
<P>The rationale for an observation approach and the deferral of treatment is provided by the relatively long natural history of prostate cancer (i.e., many prostate cancers are slow growing) and by the fact that many men diagnosed with prostate cancer are elderly, have co-morbidities and may ultimately die from other causes (<LINK REF="REF-Albertsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albertsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Donnell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Donnell 2008</LINK>). Although a number of observation and monitoring protocols have been described in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Chodak-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chodak 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilt-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choo-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>), much attention has focused on two distinctive approaches to patient management: 1) Active surveillance or active monitoring which involves close monitoring with initiation of curative therapy for biochemical or histological progression (<LINK REF="REF-Hardie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weissbach-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissbach 2009</LINK>); and 2) watchful waiting, which involves a policy of observation with the provision of palliative treatment where there is symptomatic disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klotz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 2005</LINK>). Active surveillance/active monitoring and watchful waiting have been described as differing in a number of key aspects, including: 1) the selection variables considered when making the decision to adopt an observation approach; 2) the procedures used to monitor the patient; 3) the criteria used to establish disease progression; and 4) the treatment choice once progression is established (<LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the terms active surveillance/active monitoring and watchful waiting are used inconsistently in the literature; some authors use the terms interchangeably, whereas others draw a clear distinction between them. For this Cochrane review, a clear distinction is made between active surveillance/active monitoring and watchful waiting. "Watchful waiting" is defined as a conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer whereby a decision is made to provide no initial treatment and to monitor the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment(s) if the monitoring procedures provide evidence of disease progression (the monitoring procedures and palliative treatments that will be considered in this review are described below under '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>'). However the review authors acknowledge the difficulties faced by patients and their physicians in making important clinical decisions regarding the type of treatment initiated once disease progression is observed and a predetermination of such treatment decisions (i.e., curative versus palliative) is very difficult in clinical practice. Another ongoing Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2008</LINK>) will include randomised controlled trials which compare active surveillance/active monitoring and radical prostatectomy.</P>
<P>There has been considerable debate regarding the relative benefits and risks of an observation approach with a palliative intent WW compared with RP for patients with clinically localised prostate cancer. Advocates of WW contrast the slow growing, indolent and clinically insignificant nature of many prostate cancers with the potential side effects of surgical intervention. Proponents of RP focus on the potential for cure and the reduced chance of progression and associated morbidity. This review will systematically locate, appraise and synthesise the best available evidence on the benefits and risks of WW versus RP for men with clinically localised prostate cancer.</P>

<LI>Watchful waiting was defined for the purposes of this review as any conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer whereby a decision was made to provide no initial treatment and to monitor the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment(s) if the monitoring procedure documented biochemical, clinical or histological disease progression that was deemed sufficient to warrant intervention. In this review palliative treatments were defined as treatments intended to alleviate disease symptoms without significantly altering the course of the disease or attempting to cure it. Palliative treatments considered in this review included palliative hormone treatment, palliative surgery (e.g. transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)), palliative radiation therapy and palliative chemotherapy. Procedures used to periodically monitor for the signs and symptoms of cancer growth/progression considered in this review included any clinical examination (e.g. digital rectal examination), any laboratory tests (e.g. prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing), or biopsy of the prostate gland (histology), or radiological procedures, or any combination of these procedures. Trials where patients had already undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) prior to randomisation were also included.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data analysis, presentation of data and data assumptions in the review</HEADING>
<P>Two trials were included in this review: the <LINK REF="STD-VACURG" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4 </LINK>trial (see '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-VACURG" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG</LINK> trial no hazard ratios (HR) were reported in the original papers. The review authors calculated an HR for all-cause mortality from the data presented in the paper reporting the 15-year follow up of this trial (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>) using the methods described by (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>), which can be employed in instances where a report presents Kaplan-Meier curves and the numbers at risk. The paper reporting the fifteen-year follow up was used to estimate the HR because the 'numbers at risk' were clearly stated in the paper and the Kaplan-Meier curve was of sufficient quality to allow direct reading of data from the curve. Data on the numbers in each arm of the trial, the numbers at risk at 5, 10 and 15 years and Kaplan-Meier survival values were extracted independently from the paper by two review authors (TF and PB). The data were entered by one review author (TF) into an Excel spread sheet created by (<LINK REF="REF-Tierney-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tierney 2007</LINK>), and values were obtained for the HR, the log of the HR and the standard error of the log HR. Of the 61 patients in the treatment arm of the trial only 49 were described by the trial authors as "traceable" after 15 years. No further information was provided in the paper by (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>) and the review authors presumed that this loss to follow up was non-informative.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial the HR for the main end-points (overall mortality, disease-specific mortality, rate of development of distant metastases) and for the rate of local progression were reported in the paper documenting the trial results after five years of follow up (median 6.2 years) of follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002</LINK>). However, in the paper documenting the trial results at 10 and 12 year follow ups (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>) cumulative incidence rather than cumulative hazard was used by the trial authors "in the acknowledgment that the end points constitute[d] competing events" (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>). Thus the results for the main trial endpoints were presented by the trial authors as RR (rather than HR) calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. The trial authors used Gray's test in the presence of competing risks to assess whether there were significant differences between study groups.</P>
<P>In our review, the results of the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial for the main endpoints at 5, 10 and 12-year follow up are presented as relative risks (RR) and risk differences (RD). The trial results were extracted from the papers by <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK> as the results were adjusted for competing risks. We calculated the risk differences for each outcome as follows: risk of an event in the experimental group (radical prostatectomy) <I>minus</I> the risk of an event in the control group (watchful waiting) (as recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> version 5.0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2008</LINK>)).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Presentation of quality of life data from included trials</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life outcomes were only reported in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial and were measured using a questionnaire administered to a sample of trial participants (326 of the 698 men enrolled in the trial). The results were reported in two papers by <LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2009</LINK>. Full details of the measurement of quality of life in the <LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK> paper are reported in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' (outcome measures) section of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK> dichotomised the quality of life outcome variables and calculated RR (and 95% CI) adjusted for age, time from randomisation to completion of the questionnaire, date of responding to the questionnaire, and educational level. These adjustments were reported as having "little if any effect on the relative risks" (<LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK>). In addition, the relative risks were reported as being similar when analyses were based on treatment received as opposed to intention to treat and unadjusted intention-to-treat values were presented in the paper by <LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK>. In our review, RevMan 5.0 was used to calculate crude (unadjusted) RR and 95% CI from the dichotomous data for quality of life outcomes presented in the paper by (<LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK>) (See Analyses 1.7 to 1.10 in the '<LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>' section of this review).</P>
<P>Additional analyses of the quality of life data were presented in the paper by (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2009</LINK>) who investigated whether quality of life varied according to follow-up time, number of physical symptoms and presence of androgen deprivation. Details of these results were included in our review even though they were judged to be 'post-hoc' exploratory analyses that carried an increased risk of yielding spurious findings due to multiple testing.</P>

<P>Only two trials were included in this review. The only outcome shared between the two trials was all-cause (overall) mortality. However, no meta-analysis was performed for this outcome primarily because one trial was judged to be of poor quality and did not produce reliable evidence. The review authors therefore deemed that it would be inappropriate and misleading to pool the results. Furthermore, the trials reported the outcome of all-cause mortality at different time-points. In future updates of this review a meta-analysis will only be performed in the absence of significant methodological, clinical and statistical heterogeneity in included studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of trial settings</HEADING>
<P>This trial was conducted by the Veterans Administration Co-operative Urological Research Group (VACURG) and was designed to compare treatments for localised prostate cancer (termed VACURG Stages I and II prostate cancer).</P>
<P>Patients were recruited from 19 Veterans Administration Hospitals across the United States of America between May 1967 and March 1975 (<LINK REF="REF-Byar-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byar 1981</LINK>).</P>

<P>One hundred and forty-two (142) patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate were enrolled in the trial and were randomly allocated to radical prostatectomy and oral placebo (n = 74) or oral placebo alone (n = 68). Thirty-one (31) patients (22% of the enrolled participants) were excluded by the trial authors from analysis because they refused treatment after randomisation or because of incorrect staging or protocol violations - 13 patients were excluded from the radical prostatectomy and oral placebo group and eighteen from the oral placebo alone group. The remaining 111 patients included in the final analysis were described by the trial authors as "evaluable patients".</P>

<P>The trial authors did not provide details regarding the nature of the oral placebo or a description of the nature of the surgery for the RP.

During the regular follow-up period the patients' urologists were free to alter treatment if they believed the welfare of the patient required it. The most common change in treatment was reported by the trial authors as "the initiation of hormonal manipulation". However, figures for the precise numbers receiving hormone treatment were not provided (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>).</P>

In 1986 and 1994 all participating VA hospitals, patients or their relatives or vital records offices were contacted in order to establish the survival status of patients and cause of death where applicable. However, the trial authors reported that "an attempt to establish cause of death from death certificates, patient charts and autopsy reports proved to be impossible" (<LINK REF="REF-Iversen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iversen 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (<LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK>) was a Multicentre trial which commenced enrolment in 1989. Recruitment from fourteen centres in Sweden, Finland and Iceland was completed by February 1999.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>The study, utilising purposive sampling, enrolled 698 men under the age of 75 years (mean age 64.7 years) with localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate graded as well or moderately well differentiated according to the World Health Organisation Classification. Men with poorly differentiated tumours were not eligible for the trial. Trial participants had to have a tumour in stage T0d, T1, or T2. After 1994, men with T1c tumours were also eligible. Participants had to have physical and mental status reports that were expected to permit a radical prostatectomy and follow up for at least 10 years.</P>
<P>Three potential participants were excluded from study: two from the RP group (one man had bladder cancer and 1 had another concurrent cancer) and one man in the WW group had no prostate cancer.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of the interventions</HEADING>
<P>Participants were randomly assigned to two parallel treatment groups.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The RP group. Surgery involved pelvic lymph node dissection followed by a retropubic Walsh-Lepor prostatectomy if no evidence of metastatic involvement was noted in the frozen sections. The trial authors state that "the radical nature of the surgery was given priority over preservation of potency" (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002</LINK>). Orchidectomy or treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues was recommended for men with symptomatic progression in this group.</LI>
<LI>The WW group (this group was also termed the "expectantly managed group" in the initial protocol description). Watchful waiting involved no initial treatment following diagnosis (apart from the transurethral resection some men had previously undergone). Transurethral resection was also recommended as a treatment for local progression.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Follow up of men occurred twice per annum for the first two years and then annually thereafter. Follow up consisted of a clinical examination, blood assays of haemoglobin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen. A chest X-ray and bone-scan were conducted annually up to 1997, thereafter a chest X-ray was conducted annually for the first two years after randomisation. From 2003, bone scans were conducted every second year if the patient had no signs of clinical or biochemical progression.</P>
<P>In January 2003, an amendment to the protocol allowed all men to have hormonal therapy (mainly orchiectomy or gonad-releasing hormone analogs as life-long therapy) if advised by their physician due to any sign of tumour progression, including elevated PSA levels in asymptomatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>After 12 years of follow up, hormonal treatment had been prescribed for 132 men in the RP group and 205 men in the WW group. Palliative radiation was administered to 33 men in the RP group and 47 men in the WW group. Cytotoxic drugs were administered to 6 men in the RP group and 8 men in the WW group, laminectomies were performed on 3 men in the RP group and 10 men in the WW group.</P>
<P>At the time the trial database was closed in 2006, approximately 86% of men randomised to radical prostatectomy (294/347) had undergone the procedure and approximately 85% of men randomised to watchful waiting (298/348) had not received any curative treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The primary study endpoints were described as follows in the paper by (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002)</LINK>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>mortality from prostate cancer (defined by the time to death from prostate cancer with deaths from other causes treated as censoring events);</LI>
<LI>overall (all-cause) mortality (defined by the time to death, regardless of cause);</LI>
<LI>rate of distant metastases (defined by the time to diagnosis of distant metastases, with deaths from causes other than prostate cancer treated as censoring events. Distant metastases were recorded as present when bone scintigrams, skeletal radiographs, chest radiographs or computed tomographic scans or pulmonary X-ray films showed evidence of metastases for patients.).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Other endpoints included local progression and quality of life. Local progression and local recurrence in the WW group were defined as a palpable trans capsular tumour growth or symptoms of urinary obstruction which required intervention. In the RP group local progression and local recurrence were defined as the presence of a local tumour confirmed by histology. The measurement of quality of life is described in a separate section below.</P>
<P>Data pertaining to cause of death was considered by an end-point committee who determined the cause of death based on standardised extracts from patients files.</P>
<P>The independent endpoint committee used six categories of cause of death.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Prostate cancer</LI>
<LI>Another main cause but with distant metastases, regardless of local status</LI>
<LI>Another main cause but with local progression, without distant metastases</LI>
<LI>Another main cause but with local progression and unknown status regarding distant metastases</LI>
<LI>Another main cause, with no evidence of tumour recurrence, tumour progression or metastases</LI>
<LI>Another main cause within the first month after randomisation</LI>
</OL>
<P>Deaths were ascertained via the continuous monitoring of the trial and official vital statistics in the participating countries. Follow up was complete for all participants through to 31 December 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
</P>
<P>To investigate whether patient and tumour factors modified outcomes, three subgroup analyses were carried out according to:</P>
<OL>
<LI>age at diagnosis (&lt; 65 years of age versus &#8805; 65 years). The cut-off value of 65 years was chosen because this was the mean age of the participants;</LI>
<LI>PSA level at diagnosis (&lt; 10 ng/mL versus &#8805; 10 ng/mL);</LI>
<LI>Gleason score of the pre-randomisation biopsy specimen (&lt; 7 versus &#8805; 7 on a scale of 2 to 10 (10 = most poorly differentiated tumours)).</LI>
</OL>
<P>According to the trial authors, these subgroup analyses "were not defined in the protocol but were specified before any of the data were seen" (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Quality of Life outcomes and measurement of quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Quality of life outcomes were measured in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial using a postal questionnaire and were reported in papers by <LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002 </LINK>and <LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2009</LINK>. This questionnaire was mailed to 376 of the 695 trial participants and was designed to gather data about symptoms and quality of life at least 12 months after surgery and 14 months after randomisation (further details of the sample of trial participants included in the quality of life study are provided below). The mean time from randomisation to questionnaire completion was 50.2 months for the RP group and 48.7 months for the WW group. The questionnaire was developed by the researchers using data gathered from patient interviews and following review of a number of previously used instruments and was tested for face-validity in a sample of 30 men. The questionnaire consisted of 77 questions and two psychometric scales:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Center for Epidemiological Studies Measure of Depression (<LINK REF="REF-Radloff-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radloff 1994</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>Spielberger's Trait Measure from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>Quality of life outcomes were reported under the following headings: sexual function, urinary function, bowel function, and psychological symptoms. The questionnaire focused on the quality, frequency and intensity of symptoms. Three summary questions focused on the distress associated with 1) urinary, 2) bowel symptoms, and 3) compromised sexual function. Lower urinary tract symptoms were presented using the American Urological Association Symptom Index which rated symptoms as moderate (8 to 19) or severe (20 to 35) on a 35 point scale.</P>
<P>Psychological symptoms, subjective quality of life and well-being for the two week period prior to completion of the questionnaire were measured on a seven-point visual digital scale.</P>
<P>Outcome variables were dichotomised using cutoff values adopted in previous quality of life studies (<LINK REF="REF-Henningsohn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henningsohn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergmark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergmark 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helgason-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgason 1996</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Characteristics of the sample of participants included in the quality of life study</HEADING>
<P>As noted above, the questionnaire was posted to a sample of 376 study participants (RP (n = 189); WW (n = 187)). The sample of participants were all aged under 75 years with a life expectancy of greater than 10 years and were enrolled in the Swedish part of the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial between January 1, 1989 and February 29, 1996.

<P>It is unclear if outcome assessors were blinded. Although the trial authors state in one publication that the cause of death was assigned without prior knowledge of the treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Byar-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byar 1980</LINK>) later publications do not mention the continuation of this practice (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iversen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iversen 1995</LINK>). However, the principal endpoint used in 15-year and 23-year follow ups was "death from any cause" (all-cause mortality), which mitigates concerns over lack of blinding.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Explanation for withdrawals and dropouts (completeness of follow up)</HEADING>
<P>There is a partial explanation but clarity was not achieved. There was no intention to treat analysis. An explanation is provided for excluding 31 patients from the data analysis (protocol violations (n = 15), treatment refusal (n = 8) and incorrect staging (n = 8)). Details regarding the nature of some protocol violations are not provided. The 15 year follow-up publication details the survival status of 95 patients (86%); data for the remaining patients was not traceable at that time (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>). The publication detailing 23 year follow up (<LINK REF="REF-Iversen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iversen 1995</LINK>) reported that 100 of the 111 men were "known to be dead".</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation process</HEADING>
<P>Sequence generation: The randomisation list was computer generated.</P>
<P>Details of any restriction (of randomisation):<B> </B>Men were stratified according to centre and degree of cancer differentiation. Randomisation was done in blocks for each centre with stratification for tumour grade and centre (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>). Details regarding block size were not included.</P>
<P>Allocation Concealment: This was deemed to be adequate as randomisation was centralised. Initially randomisation was performed at both the study's Swedish secretariat and randomisation for patients from Finland and Norway was carried out at their respective National Centres. From 1 August 1998, all randomisation was completed at one centre. Randomisation was completed by the study's secretariat in blocks for each centre, with investigators being unaware of the number of men in each block. Randomisation was performed through a telephone service at offices outside the clinical units. Urologists informed patients of their allocated treatment type.</P>
<P>NOTE: The researchers state that "in all but two centers, a modified version of Zelen's randomisation model was allowed from 1988 to 1990, which implied that only men in the experimental group received complete information about the study before randomisation, but that all patients were informed that they were taking part in a clinical study and gave their oral consent to participate. From 1990, when 68 men had been enrolled at these centers (with 33 assigned to WW), it became clear that Zelen's model was not necessary for randomisation, and thus all men were fully informed thereafter" (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>The nature of the trial interventions precluded blinding of patients and their physicians.</P>
<P>Blinding was deemed adequate for the assessment of cause of death. Two of the trial investigators and the principal study monitor collected information according to a specific protocol for all deceased participants and made standardised extracts of patients' histories without revealing their group allocation. Members of an independent end-point committee who were blinded to patients' group assignment and treatment received determined the cause of death. The committee used six categories of cause of death (described above under 'Characteristics of outcome measures'). It is unclear if persons assessing the outcome of distant metastases were blinded to group allocation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Explanation for withdrawals and dropouts (completeness of follow up)</HEADING>
<P>The trial authors provided a clear explanation of numbers of, and reasons for, withdrawals and drop outs. In one publication (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002</LINK>) a flow diagram is provided that clearly documents the treatment assignment and follow up. Complete follow up for all participants through 31 December 2006, was achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparability of study groups at baseline</HEADING>
<P>Both groups appear well-balanced in terms of patient age, mean PSA, tumour stage, WHO grade, Gleason score and tumour detection methods with baseline mean PSA levels of 12.3 ng/mL (WW) and 13.5 ng/mL (RP).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study power</HEADING>
<P>Details of power calculations are presented. The initial target sample size was 520 men assuming a disease-specific survival of 85% (WW) and an ability to detect a reduction in mortality from prostate cancer due to RP that would yield a disease-specific survival of at least 95% (<LINK REF="REF-Holmberg-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmberg 2002</LINK>). Following an interim data analysis after enrolment of 520 participants, the overall mortality rate was less than anticipated. The target sample size was subsequently increased to 700 men, based on an ability to detect a 6% absolute difference in survival rate between groups if the disease-specific survival rate was 95% in one group, with an 80% power, a risk of type 1 error at 5% and a risk of type II error at 20%. The study was not powered to analyse subgroups e.g., older and younger than 65 years.</P>

However, the trial authors state that "to resemble 'blinding' and avoid investigator-related bias, the questionnaire was filled out by the men at home and sent to an address not related to past and future care, thus increasing the likelihood that errors in measurement were similar in the two groups, which tends to reduce observed differences in risk" (<LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Response rate to the questionnaire</HEADING>
<P>The overall response rate was 86.7% (326/376). Response rates did not vary significantly by study group (response rate of 88% in RP group and 86% in the WW group). For each specific question, some men did not respond. Persons who failed to respond to a specific question were not included in the analysis for that specific variable. For the key quality of life outcomes included in our review the numbers of non-responses in each group were generally small (&lt; 13) and did not differ between study groups.</P>
<P>Analyses were performed by the trial authors according to the intention-to-treat principle and according to the treatment received. The trial authors reported that relative risks were similar for both analyses and they presented unadjusted intention-to-treat values in the paper reporting the quality of life data (<LINK REF="REF-Steineck-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steineck 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Analysis of quality of life data stratified on the basis of numbers of physical symptoms, and presence of androgen deprivation (Johansson 2009)</HEADING>
<P>The data analyses sought to determine the influence of the number of physical symptoms on levels of anxiety: depressed mood, sense of well being and self assessed quality of life. In the presence of three physical symptoms, the RP group scored greater than or equal to 5.0 and the WW group scored less than 5.0 for anxiety, depressed mood and sense of well being. The self assessed quality of life scores was 5.0 for RP and 4.5 for WW. Thus, anxiety and depressed mood were more common in the WW group and self assessed quality of life and sense of well being were better in the RP group.</P>
<P>Erectile dysfunction was high in the RP group initially, this remained the situation during the mean follow-up time of 4.1 years. However incidence of erectile dysfunction increased in the WW group over time with a figure of 55% noted for 6 to 8 years post randomisation.</P>
<P>Figures for androgen deprivation were quoted as 20 men were androgen deprived for a mean duration of 2.8 years (RP group) and 25 men in the WW group were androgen deprived for a mean duration of 1.7 years. Levels of depressed mood (68% versus 35%), low sense of well being (72% versus 30%) and low self assessed quality of life (76% versus 40%) (%WW versus %RP) were all noted to be higher in the WW group post androgen deprivation. This indicates that androgen deprivation negatively affected men in the WW group as changes reached statistical significance.</P>

In this paper the trial authors carried out a sensitivity analysis of the trial results according to whether or not this death was defined as due to prostate cancer. If post-operative death was not defined as due to prostate cancer, the hazard ratios (comparing RP with WW) for the outcomes of disease-specific mortality and rate of development of distant metastases were 0.50 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.91) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.96), respectively. These estimates were reported as changing to 0.53 and 0.64 respectively if the postoperative death was defined as due to prostate cancer (no confidence intervals were reported).</P>
<P>This postoperative death is not mentioned in later publications describing the trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bill_x002d_Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bill-Axelson 2008</LINK>) and the death does not appear to have been classified as due to prostate cancer.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-09-08 13:32:02 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Treatment of prostate cancer remains a highly controversial issue. This systematic review aimed to compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-09-03 10:16:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two randomised controlled trials, the <LINK REF="STD-VACURG" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial, involving a total of 837 patients met the inclusion criteria for the review.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-VACURG" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG</LINK> trial the differences between the study groups for all-cause (overall) mortality after 15 years of follow up were not statistically significant - the confidence interval around the hazard ratio (HR) was compatible with either a reduction or an increase in overall mortality associated with radical prostatectomy (HR 0.9 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.43)). Similarly, after a median follow up of 23 years there was no statistically significant difference in median overall survival between the groups. These results must be interpreted in the context of the poor methodological quality of the trial. In particular, the study groups were not comparable at baseline for important prognostic factors (age and tumour stage) which suggests that the randomisation process may have been compromised. Furthermore, data were not analysed in the accordance with the intention-to-treat principle and 31 participants (22% of the initial study population) were excluded from the final analysis. The study population in the trial was also small (N = 142) and the trial was underpowered to detect important survival differences between the groups (<LINK REF="REF-Graversen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graversen 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>By contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial was judged to be of good methodological quality. After the longest period of follow up in the trial (12 years), the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was lower in the RP group than the WW group ((32.7% versus 39.8%) RD -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5)). However, the confidence interval around this estimate is compatible with a range of effects of RP, from a 14.7% reduction to a 0.5% increase in the absolute risk of overall mortality.</P>
<P>The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was also lower in the RP than the WW group at 12 years ((12.5% versus 17.9%) RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2)). However, the confidence interval around this estimate is compatible with a range of effects of RP, from an 11.1% reduction to a 0.2% increase in the absolute risk of mortality due to prostate cancer.</P>
<P>The cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was lower in the RP group than the WW group at 12 years (19.3% versus 26%; RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2)). Again, the confidence interval around the risk difference point estimate (-6.7%) is compatible with a range of effects.</P>
<P>The cumulative incidence of local progression was considerably lower in the RP group than the WW group at 12 years (21.7% versus 45.6%; RD -23.9% (95% CI -30.9 to -16.8).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial results suggests that effects of radical prostatectomy may vary according to age. In men under the age of 65 years at diagnosis, RP was associated with statistically significant reductions in the cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality, prostate cancer-specific mortality and distant metastases after 12 years of follow up. However, for men aged 65 years and older, any differences between RP and WW did not reach statistical significance (see '<LINK TAG="INTERVENTION_EFFECTS" TYPE="SECTION">Effects of interventions</LINK>' section). These findings should be interpreted very cautiously as the analysis was not pre-specified in the trial protocol, the trial was not designed to investigate age groups separately and there was no a priori biological hypothesis underpinning the sub-group analysis.</P>
<P>The reported benefits of RP over WW in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial must be carefully weighed against the side effects of surgical treatment. The adverse events of greatest concern are damage to the urinary sphincter and erectile nerves resulting in urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction which can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Quality of life was measured in the SPCG-4 trial via a questionnaire administered to a sample of trial participants after a median follow up of 4.1 years. Approximately 80% (129/161) of men in the RP group reported erectile dysfunction compared with 45% (71/158) in the WW group (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)). Urinary leakage (once a week or more) was also higher in the RP group than in the WW group (48.7% (80/164) versus 21.3% (33/155); RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). However, urinary obstruction was lower in the RP group (34.5% (55/159) versus 49.3% (74/150); RD -15% (95% CI -26 to -4)). Differences between RP and WW groups in reported levels of worry, anxiety, depression or subjective (self-reported) quality of life were comparatively small in absolute terms (ranging from 1% to 8%) and were not statistically significant. </P>
<P>These quality of life results were self administered and likely to be less accurate than those for other trial outcomes; additionally they were obtained from a sample of trial participants (N = 326), rather than from the entire study population (N = 695). Furthermore, no baseline quality of life data were obtained from the trial participants. It is therefore unknown if symptoms (such as erectile dysfunction, urinary leakage, etc) were initially equally distributed in the respondents from the RP and WW groups, although one would presume so if men were randomised adequately. In addition, as the questionnaire was administered at a single point in time it cannot be determined whether quality of life outcomes change over time. The trial authors also dichotomised the outcome data which may have resulted in a loss of statistical power for some outcomes. Finally, the overall response rate to the questionnaire was 86% and there were some missing responses for specific questions.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-09-08 13:31:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="James Tacklind">
<P>Only two trials relevant to addressing the objectives of this review were located in a search of the literature up to 30 July 2010. The <LINK REF="STD-VACURG" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG</LINK> trial was judged to be of poor quality and therefore any extrapolation of the trial results is dubious due to the lack of internal validity. By contrast, the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial was judged to be of good methodologic quality. However, the external validity of this trial is questionable for a number of reasons. Firstly, participants in the trial were men under the age of 75 years with a life expectancy of 10 years; hence, the trial results may not apply to patients with significant co-morbidities. In addition, only 5.2% of trial participants had screen-detected prostate cancer, 42% presented with symptoms and 76% had stage T2 (palpable) cancer. This stage of cancer is more advanced than that typically detected by screening. In countries where the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test is widely used the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer will have impalpable disease. Consequently, the trial results may not be applicable to patients with no clinically symptomatic disease who have been identified through screening. Furthermore, use of the PSA test is associated with significant over-diagnosis and lead time effects. It is therefore unclear whether the benefits of RP reported in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial could be replicated in a population of men with PSA-detected cancers. Results from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PCLO) Cancer Screening trial (<LINK REF="REF-Andriole-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andriole 2009</LINK>) and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Schr_x00f6_der-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schröder 2009</LINK>) may help to answer questions relating to the effect of PSA screening on prostate specific mortality. The results of an ongoing trial (the <LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK> trial) will also provide valuable information on the relative effects of RP and WW in men with tumours detected by PSA testing (see section entitled 'Ongoing randomised controlled trials' below).</P>
<P>The relevance of the trial to current clinical practice is also questionable due to the nature of the interventions used. As noted in the '<LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK>' section of this review, in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial the "radical nature of the surgery (provided in the SPCG-4 trial) was given priority over preservation of potency". Hence nerve-sparing surgery does not appear to have been provided routinely for the trial participants undergoing RP. Consequently the trial results may not be applicable to prostate cancer patients undergoing nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy which has the potential to reduce complications such as impotency and urinary incontinence. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the urologists in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial had only recently adopted the Walsh-Lepor procedure into practice and that the trial results may not therefore be generalisable to settings where the procedure is performed in high volume surgical centres (<LINK REF="REF-Drachenberg-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drachenberg 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, the watchful waiting protocol followed in the SPCG-4 trial cannot be equated with an &#8220;active surveillance&#8221; approach to prostate cancer management where patients are monitored closely and appropriate treatment with curative intent is promptly initiated when signs of disease progression are noted (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardie 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klotz-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adolfsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adolfsson 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Klotz-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 2008b</LINK>). The relative benefits and risks of radical prostatectomy versus active surveillance approaches for men with localised prostate cancer are currently unknown pending the results of two ongoing trials (see section entitled '<LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK>' below).</P>

<P>The results of our review are generally in agreement with other systematic reviews and guidelines that have reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions for the management of prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESMO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P> One systematic review prepared for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2008</LINK>) compared the relative benefits and risks of various treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer and investigated how patient, provider and tumour characteristics affected treatment outcomes. The AHRQ review included both randomised and non-randomised studies and the strength of the available evidence was rated on a three-point scale (low, medium, high). Based on the findings of the SPCG-4 trial after a median follow up of 8.2 years, the review authors concluded that there was evidence of "medium quality" that RP reduced overall mortality, disease specific mortality and incidence of distant metastases compared with WW (medium = data from fewer than two high quality studies or studies that did not have long-term follow up). The evidence that RP increased erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence was judged to be of "low quality" (low = studies with inconsistent results or studies of low quality or from populations with little relevance to current patients/practice). Similarly, the evidence from the subgroup analysis suggesting that effectiveness of RP may be limited to men under 65 years, was judged to be of "low quality".  Overall, the reviewers concluded that &#8220;no one therapy can be considered preferred for localised prostate cancer due to limitations in quality of the body of comparative effectiveness research.&#8221; The main difference between the (<LINK REF="REF-AHRQ-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHRQ 2008</LINK>) review and our review is the inclusion of the 12 year follow-up data from the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Recent guidelines developed by the European Society for Medical Oncology (<LINK REF="REF-ESMO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO 2009</LINK>) have also reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of treatment options for patients with clinically localised prostate cancer. The guideline developers concur with our review by suggesting that the results of the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial may not be generalisable to screen-detected cancers. They also contend that the trial results may not be applicable to settings where radical prostatectomy is provided in "high-volume surgical centres". The guideline developers conclude that "there is no general consensus as to what constitutes best treatment. Patients should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of the different options" (<LINK REF="REF-ESMO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESMO 2009</LINK>). These conclusions are consistent with other guidelines from the American Urological Association (<LINK REF="REF-AUA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AUA 2007</LINK>) and the European Association of Urology (<LINK REF="REF-EAU-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">EAU 2008</LINK>) that have reviewed similar evidence as part of the guideline development process.</P>
<P>Guidance on the clinical management (diagnosis and treatment) of prostate cancer has also been published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>). The guidelines recommend that urological cancer multidisciplinary teams should assign a risk category to all men with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer (low, intermediate or high risk based on PSA levels, Gleason score and clinical stage). The guidelines include treatment recommendations for each risk category taking into account the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms of various treatment options, patient values and preferences and resource considerations. In this context the (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>) guideline goes beyond the scope of this Cochrane review which focuses on providing information rather than making recommendations.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Ongoing randomised controlled trials</HEADING>
<P>There are currently three ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-ProtecT" TYPE="STUDY">ProtecT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-START" TYPE="STUDY">START</LINK>) that will provide important evidence to inform clinical practice on the treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer. It is envisaged that only the results of one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK>) will be incorporated in future updates of this review because it compares radical prostatectomy with a watchful waiting approach involving palliative treatment for disease progression. The remaining trials compare radical prostatectomy with active surveillance/active monitoring strategies and their results will be incorporated into future updates of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2008</LINK>) (note: this review is currently ongoing).  Brief details of all three trials are provided below.</P>
<P>The Prostate cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK>) is a multi-centre, pragmatic randomised trial involving subjects enrolled between 1994 and 2002 from 52 sites across the United States. 731 men with clinically localised prostate cancer have been randomised to radical prostatectomy (n = 364) or watchful waiting (n = 367). Men randomised to watchful waiting have been offered palliative therapies for symptomatic or metastatic disease progression. Interventions for asymptomatic progression (e.g. changes in PSA values) have been discouraged. The characteristics of the trial participants are different to those enrolled in the SPCG-4 trial. Most notably, approximately 75% of PIVOT participants have tumours detected by PSA testing. In this context, the result of this trial will provide important information regarding the comparative beneficial and adverse effects of radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for men with screen-detected cancers. The PIVOT trial has also enrolled an ethnically diverse population (approximately 33% African American, 60% white; 7% other). The baseline demographic and tumour characteristics of the trial participants indicate that they are representative of men diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary trial outcome is all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints include prostate cancer specific mortality, biochemical (PSA), local and metastatic progression. Additional general and disease specific quality of life outcomes and harms of therapy are being measured (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2009</LINK>). A number of pre-specified subgroup analyses of the trial results will be carried out (including age &lt; 65 years versus &#8805; 65 years) which may help to clarify the subgroup findings from the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial. Initial trial results are anticipated in mid 2010.</P>
<P>The Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (<LINK REF="STD-ProtecT" TYPE="STUDY">ProtecT</LINK>) trial is a UK based multi-centre pragmatic randomised controlled trial that commenced in 2001 following an initial feasibility study (<LINK REF="REF-Donovan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donovan 2003</LINK>). More than 1500 men aged 50 to 69 years (mean age 61) with clinically localised prostate cancer detected via a PSA testing programme have been randomised to radical prostatectomy, radical conformal radiotherapy or active monitoring. Those assigned to active monitoring are following a treatment plan decided in conjunction with their healthcare providers that includes a clinical examination and PSA test every 3 to 6 months. Clinicians and patients discuss the results of clinical examinations and any changes in PSA test scores and then jointly decide to continue active monitoring, undergo restaging or receive interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2008a</LINK>). The outcomes assessed will include overall survival (at 5, 10 and 15 years after treatment), disease progression (biochemical and clinical), treatment complications, lower urinary tract symptoms, psychosocial impact and the costs and outcomes of treatment in terms of survival and health related quality of life. The current anticipated end date of this trial is December 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-ISRCTN-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISRCTN 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Surveillance Therapy Against Radical Treatment<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-START" TYPE="STUDY">START</LINK>) trial is currently in its feasibility stage in Canada. The full trial aims to enroll 2130 participants with "favourable risk" adenocarcinoma of the prostate in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial based in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2008a</LINK>). Favourable risk prostate cancer is defined as clinical stage T1b, T1c, T2a or T2b at the time of diagnosis, clinical (diagnostic biopsy) Gleason score &#8804; 6 and PSA &#8804; 10.0 ng/mL. Participants will be randomised to one of two trial arms: In Arm 1 participants will undergo radical intervention: radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 to 8 weeks; permanent prostate brachytherapy; or high-dose rate temporary brachytherapy). The choice of radical intervention will be based on patient and physician preference. In Arm 2<B> </B>participants will undergo active surveillance (involving regular PSA testing, digital rectal exams and periodic biopsies) with radical intervention at the time one or more pre-specified criteria (biochemical progression, histologic/grade progression, and/or clinical progression) are met (<LINK REF="REF-Wilt-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilt 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NCI-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary outcome of the trial is disease-specific survival. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, quality of life, distant disease-free survival, PSA relapse/progression after radical intervention, initiation of androgen deprivation therapy, proportion of patients on the active surveillance arm who receive radical intervention, prognostic significance of PSA doubling-time prior to diagnosis and the prognostic significance of molecular biomarkers. The current estimated final data collection date for the primary outcome measure is 2023 (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>The collective results of these three trials will provide valuable information on the relative effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-08-23 06:34:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-08-23 06:33:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a paucity of randomised controlled trials directly comparing radical prostatectomy (RP) versus watchful waiting (WW) for patients with clinically localised prostate cancer. Only two trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. One trial (the VACURG trial) was judged to have a high risk of bias and therefore did not provide reliable evidence. The second trial (the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial) was judged to have a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>The two trials were initiated in an era prior to the widespread use of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test as a screening test for prostate cancer. There is no evidence currently available from randomised controlled trials regarding the relative beneficial and adverse effects of RP and WW for patients with prostate cancers detected as a result of PSA testing. The results of an ongoing trial (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK>) will provide evidence on the comparative effects of these two management options for men with PSA-detected cancers.</P>
<P>The one good quality trial included in this review (the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial) which had a follow up of 12 years provides evidence on the relative effects of RP and WW in men with the following characteristics:</P>
<UL>
<LI>under the age of 75 years with a life expectancy &#8805;10 years and deemed fit to undergo radical prostatectomy;</LI>
<LI>clinically localised prostate cancer <I>detected by methods other than PSA testing</I> (e.g. detection following the presentation of a patient with symptoms of the disease);</LI>
<LI>tumour well or moderately well differentiated as defined by World Health Organisation Criteria.</LI>
</UL>
<P>For such men, the results of the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial provide evidence that radical prostatectomy (RP) may reduce the risks of all-cause mortality, and is likely to reduce prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases after 12 years compared to watchful waiting (WW), but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain. For the outcome of all-cause mortality the trial results are compatible with an absolute reduction in risk associated with RP of as much as 14.7% or an absolute risk increase of 0.5% (RD -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5)). For the outcome of prostate cancer mortality the trial results are compatible with an absolute reduction in risk associated with RP of as much as 11% or an absolute risk increase of 0.2% (RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2)). For the outcome of distant metastases the trial results are compatible with an absolute reduction in risk associated with RP of as much as 13.2% or as little as 0.2% (RD - 6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to - 0.2)).</P>
<P>The imprecision of these results compromises their ability to assist in making decisions about patient care. Further evidence from randomised controlled trials is required to improve the precision of these estimates thereby allowing more confident statements to be made about the relative effects of RP and WW.</P>
<P>Any potential benefits of RP must be carefully weighed against the adverse effects of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence associated with this surgical procedure. Compared to WW, radical prostatectomy increases the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage by 35% (95% CI 25 to 45) and 27% (95% CI 17 to 35), respectively. These estimates are derived from data obtained from a questionnaire survey of a sample of <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial participants after a mean follow-up time of approximately four years. Because these data were not obtained longitudinally from the entire study population, they must be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed in the <LINK REF="STD-SPCG_x002d_4" TYPE="STUDY">SPCG-4</LINK> trial and it is therefore unclear whether the rates of complications would be as high in a setting where the surgical procedure is performed at a high-volume centre.</P>
<P>Ultimately the decision to opt for RP or WW will depend on the values and preferences of each individual patient and the relative importance placed on the potential for prolonging life versus the preservation of erectile function and urinary continence. The need to make such difficult "trade-offs" highlights the importance of a shared approach to decision-making whereby patients and their healthcare providers openly discuss the patient's personal values and the limitations of the available evidence on potential benefits and potential harms of different treatment options.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-23 06:34:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Initial results from the <LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK> trial comparing radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting in men with PSA detected tumours are expected within the next year. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-PIVOT" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT</LINK> trial will be incorporated into future updates of this review and will facilitate in formulating recommendations for future research and in clarifying the precise populations, interventions, comparisons and outcomes that should be considered in future randomised controlled trials.</P>
<P>Any future trials comparing RP with WW should clearly define the watchful waiting protocol adopted including the timing (frequency) of follow-up examinations; the precise monitoring procedures used at follow-up examinations (e.g., precise nature of any clinical examinations, laboratory tests, imaging, biopsy procedures); the criteria used to establish progression (e.g. local tumour progression detected by digital rectal exam (DRE) or trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS), PSA kinetics, grade progression on biopsy, radiological evidence of progression or any combination of these procedures) and finally the precise treatment(s) administered after disease progression is detected.</P>
<P>Quality of life should be assessed during trials at baseline and measured longitudinally at a number of time points until trial completion to ascertain any changes in quality of life outcomes over time and to monitor the long term impact of RP and WW on quality of life. Quality of life assessments should particularly focus on urinary and sexual function. In addition psychological distress should be measured longitudinally. This is particularly important for patients assigned to WW who have to cope with the uncertainty associated with living with a cancer diagnosis and any related anxiety and depression. Detailed economic cost outcomes should also be collected to allow estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the two approaches.</P>
<P>Finally, during the preparation of this review it became apparent that a wide variety of terms are currently used to describe approaches to the management of prostate cancer that involve initial monitoring of the patient with the intention of providing treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. The literature is replete with references to terms such as watchful waiting, deferred treatment, observation, delayed therapy, active surveillance, active monitoring, conservative management, careful monitoring and expectant management. These terms are often used inconsistently by researchers which is undoubtedly confusing for consumers, clinicians, policy makers, and researchers. Researchers should carefully define any terms they use and should provide detailed descriptions of observation/monitoring approaches adopted in trials. In particular, researchers should clarify whether the intention is to provide treatments with palliative or curative intent if there is evidence of disease progression. Such clarity of reporting is important for those endeavouring to appraise and interpret the evidence and ascertain its relevance to clinical practice.</P>

<P>The definition of "watchful waiting" that appears in the final review is different to that presented in the protocol. The protocol stated that:</P>
<P> "Watchful waiting will include any conservative 'watch and wait' approach to the management of prostate cancer, whereby a decision is made to monitor the patient and to defer any 'active therapies' until such a time as the monitoring procedure adopted documents biochemical, clinical or histological progression that is deemed sufficient to warrant further therapeutic intervention. 'Active therapies' will include surgery, radiation therapy and hormone therapy".</P>
<P>As such, our original definition of "watchful waiting" was intended to capture all monitoring and deferred treatment approaches to the management of prostate cancer, irrespective of whether any subsequent treatment provided was intended for palliative purposes (e.g. hormone therapy for relief of symptoms) or curative purposes (e.g., radical prostatectomy).</P>
<P>However, during the review process it became apparent that many (but not all) researchers draw a clear distinction between a "watchful waiting" approach and an "active surveillance" approach to the management of prostate cancer. The key distinction between the two approaches is that "watchful waiting" involves patient monitoring <U>with the intention of providing palliative treatment</U>
<I> </I>where there is evidence of disease progression. By contrast, "active surveillance" involves close monitoring of the patient <U>with the intention of providing treatment that has the potential to cure the patient</U>  (e.g. radical prostatectomy) when there is evidence of disease progression. In this context, we felt that our original definition of "watchful waiting" could lead to confusion and we therefore modified this original definition to read as follows:</P>
<P>"Watchful waiting (WW) was defined for the purposes of this review as any conservative approach to the management of prostate cancer whereby a decision was made to provide no initial treatment and to monitor the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment(s) if the monitoring procedure documented biochemical, clinical or histological disease progression that was deemed sufficient to warrant intervention. In this review palliative treatments were defined as treatments intended to alleviate disease symptoms without significantly altering the course of the disease or attempting to cure it. Palliative treatments considered in this review included palliative hormone treatment, palliative surgery (e.g. transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)), palliative radiation therapy and palliative chemotherapy".</P>
<P>It was also deemed prudent to adopt the above definition of "watchful waiting" to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort because another Cochrane review by (<LINK REF="REF-Lam-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 2008</LINK>) which is currently ongoing intends to compare radical prostatectomy versus an active surveillance/active monitoring approach to the management of localised prostate cancer.</P>

<P>Our search strategy included an electronic search of Ovid for MEDLINE, from 1966 to 30 July, 2010, to identify all relevant published randomised trials which compared RP with WW. A variety of terms have been used in the literature to describe observation and monitoring approaches to the management of prostate cancer. Hence, the search strategy was designed to capture studies that adopted the following terminology: 'watchful waiting', 'deferred treatment', 'delayed therapy', 'active surveillance', 'conservative management', 'careful monitoring', 'observation', 'expectant management' and 'no initial treatment'. The search strategy was as follows.</P>
