<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:12:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Globally about 170 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus and routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother-to-infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high-risk sexual behavior, and blood transfusion. Chronic hepatitis C is in most patients a benign viral infection, but a minority of patients develop liver cirrhosis and may suffer from complications due to cirrhosis or die.</P>
<P>It is known that treatment with the drug interferon clears hepatitis C virus from the blood in about 15% of patients. This review identified studies comparing ribavirin plus interferon with interferon alone in patients with chronic hepatitis C. This review shows, by combining the results from all trials, that adding ribavirin to interferon increases the number of patients who clear the hepatitis C virus to about 40% as well as the number of patients who demonstrate improved liver histology. Ribavirin and interferon may also reduce the risk of liver-related morbidity or all-cause mortality. However, the number needed to treat to prevent one patient developing morbidity or dying seems very large. Furthermore, combination therapy was associated with increased risk of anaemia and several other adverse reactions.</P>
<P>The results gives rise to a dilemma - should we, by adding ribavirin to interferon, increase the risk of haematological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, infectious, and miscellaneous adverse reactions in a situation where it has not yet been clearly demonstrated that the antiviral effect of the intervention is directly linked to the reduction of all-cause mortality? We, therefore, suggest that the combination intervention is applied only with stringent emphasis on the individual patients' well-being. Furthermore, we suggest that all future trials within the area should focus more on adverse reactions and long-term clinical outcomes.</P>

<P>Hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Standard therapy is ribavirin plus pegylated interferon to achieve undetectable level of virus in the blood, but the effect on clinical outcomes is controversial.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 11:11:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The primary outcome measures were serum sustained loss of hepatitis C virus, liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality, and adverse events. We performed subgroup analyses of patients who were naive, relapsers, or non-responders to previous antiviral treatment. All outcomes were analysed with the random-effects model. We used Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for analysis of morbidity plus mortality. The remaining outcomes were presented as relative risks (RR). We used trial sequential analyses to examine the robustness of our findings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 11:14:30 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We included 83 randomised trials with 12,707 patients. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias. We did not find any significant influence of bias on our results but cannot exclude outcome measure reporting bias as many trials did not report on the primary outcomes of this review. Compared with interferon, ribavirin plus interferon had a significant beneficial effect on sustained virological response in subgroups of naive patients (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 0.75), relapsers (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70), non-responders (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93), and in all patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.79). Combination therapy significantly reduced morbidity plus mortality in all patients (Peto OR, 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.79), but not in naive, relapsers, or non-responders individually. Combination therapy significantly increased the risk of haematological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, infectious, and miscellaneous (cough, dyspnoea, fatigue) adverse reactions. Accordingly, combination therapy significantly increased the risk of treatment discontinuation and dose reductions. Trial sequential analyses confirmed our findings regarding virological effects, but not regarding liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 15:35:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Compared with interferon alone, ribavirin plus interferon is more effective in clearing hepatitis C virus from the blood. Combination therapy may reduce liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality, but we need more evidence. The number needed to treat to obtain a beneficial effect is considerable considering the increased risk of several severe adverse reactions and costs.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 12:13:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus affecting about 170 million people worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>). Routes of transmission include intravenous drug use, mother-to-infant transmission, unsafe medical practices, high-risk sexual behaviour, occupational exposure, blood transfusion, and infected donor organs (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 2002</LINK>). In up to 40% of patients, however, no identifiable risk factor is found (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2000</LINK>). It is estimated that three to four million persons are newly infected each year. Acute hepatitis C is usually asymptomatic but about 70% will develop chronic hepatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Seeff-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 1997</LINK>). The majority of chronically infected patients will never experience symptoms as the onset to cirrhosis is very protracted (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koretz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koretz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>). The risk of developing cirrhosis probably depends on several factors, eg, age, race, alcohol abuse, obesity, steatosis, transaminase activity, viral load, as well as co-infections (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsay 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seeff-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seeff 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>). Once histological cirrhosis is established, hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 1% to 4% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Hoofnagle-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoofnagle 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poynard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poynard 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hepatitis C is an RNA virus of the <I>Flaviviridae</I> family. There are six hepatitis C genotypes including several subtypes, and hepatitis C is characterised by the continuous emergence of virus variants (<LINK REF="REF-Who-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Who 2000</LINK>). Genotypes differ with geographic regions. Although the genotype does not predict the outcome of the infection, it does predict the treatment response to current antiviral therapy and accordingly influences the choice of treatment regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:50:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Therapy with interferon leads to serum sustained virological response (SVR) in 15% of patients with chronic hepatitis C and was the treatment of choice during the 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002a</LINK>). Due to the low number with SVR, ribavirin was suggested as an alternative to interferon. Subsequent small randomised trials found no clear beneficial effect of ribavirin monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2004</LINK>), but adding ribavirin to interferons significantly increased the number with SVR (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Pegylated interferon compared with conventional interferon-alpha further increases the number with SVR (<LINK REF="REF-Simin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simin 2007</LINK>). Accordingly combination therapy with ribavirin plus pegylated interferon is currently recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The primary observed adverse reactions to ribavirin is haemolytic anaemia, leukopenia, and skin reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Ribavirin is teratogenic in some animals species and thus poses a theoretical reproductive risk in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Querenghi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querenghi 2001</LINK>). Ribavirin is administered orally as tablets or capsules. The main adverse reactions to interferon is flu-like symptoms, immunosuppression, and emotional effects (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Myers-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>). There are several types of interferons. The pegylated form is injected intramuscularly once weekly, rather than three times per week for conventional interferon-alpha. Duration and dose of ribavirin and interferon are usually adjusted according to body weight and hepatitis C genotype.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-11-10 10:59:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Ribavirin is a broad spectrum nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity against a range of RNA viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Patterson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 1990</LINK>). The exact mechanism through which ribavirin produces its antiviral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C is unclear. Suggested mechanisms include an immunomodulatory effect favouring an antiviral T-helper cell-1 cytokine, inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, or inhibition of HCV-RNA dependent RNA polymerase which both may inhibit viral replication, or that ribavirin is a viral mutagen causing lethal mutagenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Lutchman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutchman 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interferon is a cytokine and is produced to the presence of double-stranded RNA which is an indicator of viral infection. Interferons assist the immune response by inhibiting viral replication within host cells, activating natural killer cells and macrophages, increasing antigen presentation to lymphocytes, and inducing the resistance of host cells to viral infection.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-09 21:22:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Previuosly, we found that compared with interferon alone, ribavirin plus interferon significantly improved SVR and liver histology. However, the evidence on clinical outcomes, ie, liver-related morbidity and mortality was week (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). This review updates our knowledge about adding ribavirin to interferon for chronic hepatitis C.</P>

<P>From each trial we extracted the virological response to previous antiviral therapy, mean age, proportion of men, proportion of patients with cirrhosis, proportion of patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1, limit of detectable HCV-RNA, type of interferon, dose and duration of interferon and ribavirin, risk of bias, publication status, duration of follow-up, and all outcome measures. We also extracted patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. In order to obtain a reasonable overview, these data are omitted from the table 'Characteristics of included trials'.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>We performed the review and meta-analyses following the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). The analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) and Trial Sequential Analysis version 0.8 (<LINK REF="REF-TSA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">TSA 2008</LINK>). Data were analysed by intention to treat, including all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up. Because many patients relapse after the end of therapy, patients lost to follow-up were counted as non-responders. A large number of patients did not have post-treatment liver biopsies. An additional per protocol sensitivity analysis of histological response was, therefore, performed.</P>
<P>Binary outcomes were expressed as relative risks (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Rare events (morbidity plus mortality) were estimated by Peto odds ratio (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 1999</LINK>). Data were analysed by a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) as we expected significant heterogeneity among intervention regimens and types of patients. Regression analyses were performed to estimate funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). Heterogeneity was explored by the chi-squared test, with significance set at a P value of 0.10, and heterogeneity was measured by I<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>). We performed subgroup analyses for patients with different previous antiviral treatment (naive, relapsers, or non-responders), bias components (allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding), and type of interferon (pegylated, leukocyte, or standard interferon). We estimated the difference between the estimates of the subgroups<SUP> </SUP>according to tests of interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>).<SUP> </SUP>We performed sensitivity analyses including only trials with genotype 1, only trials with many (&gt; 25%) cirrhotic patients, and only trials with the same interferon regimen in the combination and monotherapy group.</P>
<P>Review Manager 5.0 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) does not include trials with zero events in both arms when calculating RR. Exempting these trials from the calculation of RR and CI may lead to overestimation of a treatment effect. As we expected many trials with zero events on clinical outcomes in both arms, we performed a sensitivity analysis by applying empirical continuity corrections to these trials by applying an imaginary mortality of 0.001 and 0.5 in both arms (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keus-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2009</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial sequential analyses</HEADING>
<P>We performed trial sequential analysis for SVR with a type I error of 5%, type II error of 10% (90% power), and adjusted for heterogeneity among included trials (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). We assumed an event proportion of 85% without SVR in the interferon group (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). Because ribavirin is associated with adverse events, is expensive, and the duration of treatment is long, we considered that a minimally clinically relevant relative risk reduction (RRR) should be relatively high. Thus, we calculated the required information size (ie, number of patients in the meta-analysis to detect or reject the estimated RRR) using an assumed event proportion of 76.5% (RRR = 10%) without SVR in the ribavirin plus interferon group.</P>
<P>We also performed trial sequential analysis for liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality. We assumed an event proportion of 1% for morbidity or mortality events in the interferon group (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2005</LINK>). We calculated the required information size using an assumed event proportion of 0.5% (RRR = 50%) for morbidity or mortality events in the ribavirin plus interferon group.</P>

Of these references, we excluded clearly irrelevant references, non-randomised studies, and duplicates (n = 3124). Five additional references were identified through manual searches.</P>
<P>Twenty-one references referred to 16 studies that are awaiting assessment because we were unable to extract data or because we were not sure whether they referred to a randomised trial or observational study. Three references referred to three ongoing trials and data were not available. Accordingly, this review includes data from 153 references reporting 83 randomised trials.</P>
<P>The included trials were published from 1995 to 2009. Twenty-five trials were published in abstract form and 58 trials as full paper articles.</P>
<P>We contacted all authors for updated information about clinical outcomes and received answer from authors of 20 trials. Of these, two trials provided new data whereas the remaining informed that no further follow-up was carried out or it was not possible to perform further follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Patients</B>
<BR/>The 83 trials included 12,707 patients. In 18 trials patients were followed to the end of treatment. In the remaining trials patients were followed for four weeks to eight years after the end of treatment (median 34 weeks). Thirty-five trials included treatment-naive patients, nine trials included relapsers, 22 trials included non-responders, and 15 included mixed patients. Previous treatment was unclear in two trials. The mean age of the included patients was reported in 74 trials (median 45 years; range 28 to 54 years). The proportion of patients with histological cirrhosis was reported in 59 trials (median 14%; range 0 to 74%). The proportion of men was reported in 72 trials (median 66%; range 20 to 100%). The proportion of patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 was reported in 72 trials (median 61%; range 0 to 100%).</P>
<P>The average patient included was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C according to hepatitis C HCV-RNA positivity and elevated transaminases or histological diagnoses. Most trials excluded patients with other liver diseases, alcohol or intravenous drug abuse, severe co-infections, and cardiovascular diseases.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions<BR/>
</B>In 55 trials, the dose of ribavirin was 1000 to 1200 mg daily. In 14 trials the dose was 800 to 1000 mg daily, in seven trials it was 14 to 15 mg per kg per day, and in two trials 600 mg daily. In five trials, the dose of ribavirin was not reported. The median duration of therapy was 29 weeks (range 6 to 78 weeks).</P>
<P>The dose, duration, and type of interferon varied substantially. The dose of interferon was the same in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups in 70 trials. In the remaining trials patients were randomised to a slightly different dose or duration of interferon (<LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1998a" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1998a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pawlotsky-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pawlotsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taliani-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Taliani 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barbaro-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Barbaro 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bellobuono-2000a" TYPE="STUDY">Bellobuono 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiffman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shiffman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tempini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tempini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_dinghen-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Lédinghen 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-L_x00e9_dinghen-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Lédinghen 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scotto-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Scotto 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brouwer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Brouwer 2004</LINK>). In total, 36 different treatment regimens were evaluated; the most common was interferon alpha-2b (three million units) given subcutaneously thrice weekly for 24 weeks. The type of interferon was alpha-2a/2b (50 trials), leukocyte (13 trials), pegylated alpha-2a/2b (10 trials), consensus (2 trials), omega (1 trial), or lymphoblastoid (1 trial). In six trials, the type of interferon was not described.</P>
<P>
<B>Limit of detection of HCV-RNA</B>
<BR/>The lower limit of detection of HCV-RNA in serum was reported in 39 trials. The limit was 100 copies/ml in 16 trials and varied between 10 to 1000 copies/ml in the remaining trials.</P>

<P>In 32 trials (39% of included trials), a computer or table of random numbers was used to generate the allocation sequence. In 26 trials (31%), the allocation sequence was concealed through the use of a central independent unit or by using sealed envelopes.

Accordingly, only six trials (7%) reported adequate allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding and were considered trials with low risk of bias.</P>
<P>We observed risk of outcome measure reporting bias. Only 67 out of 83 trials (81%) reported on SVR, and only about 33 out of 83 trials (39%) specifically reported on clinical outcomes in the publication or in a correspondence mail/letter.

<P>
<B>Failure of serum sustained virological response<BR/>
</B>Combination therapy significantly reduced the number with failure of SVR when all patients were combined (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.79; 67 trials). The inter-trial heterogeneity was considerable (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 83%). Combination therapy had a significant effect on the response in subgroups of naive (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.75; 25 trials, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 34%), relapsers (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70; 14 trials, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 57%), and non-responders (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93; 22 trials, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 63%).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses with test of interaction found that adding ribavirin was significantly more beneficial in naive (P &lt; 0.0001) and relapsers (P &lt; 0.0001) compared to non-responders. Subgroup analyses found that adding ribavirin was significantly more beneficial in adequately blinded trials compared to inadequately blinded trials (P &lt; 0.0001) and in trials using pegylated interferon compared to non-pegylated interferon (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses of trials with genotype 1 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.80, 7 trials), trials with many cirrhotic patients (&gt; 25%) (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.90, 14 trials), and trials with same interferon regimen in both intervention groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.79, 56 trials) gave the same overall results showing that adding ribavirin significantly reduced the number with failure of SVR.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis found that the cumulative Z-curve crossed the monitoring boundary in 1998 after nine trials. At this time point, we had firm evidence for at least a relative risk reduction of 10% for adding ribavirin to interferon on SVR. Subsequently, at least 58 randomised trials were published (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Trial sequential analysis according to response to previous antiviral treatment (naive; relapsers and non-responders) (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), high prevalence of cirrhosis (more than 25%) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>), only virus genotype 1 (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), according to dose of ribavirin (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), and type of interferon (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>) all echoed the overall results.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality<BR/>
</B>Few patients developed cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or died (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). On combination therapy the number of outcomes was 16 out of 7482 patients, and on monotherapy the number of outcomes was 29 out of 5225 patients. Combination therapy significantly reduced morbidity plus mortality (Peto OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.79, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Excluding patients with cirrhosis events provided similar result (Peto OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92). The results were not significant for naive alone (Peto OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.55), relapsers alone (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.00 to 6.78), or non-responders alone (Peto OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.19).</P>
<P>Many trials had zero clinical events. Adding an imaginary value of 0.001 per zero-outcome trials (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.87) and 0.5 (Peto OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.00) in each treatment group did not change the overall findings noticeably.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis found that the number of included patients does not reach the needed information size, and the cumulative Z-score does not cross the monitoring boundary. Accordingly, more evidence is needed to detect or reject a RRR of 50% for adding ribavirin to interferon regarding clinical outcomes. An additional 3918 patients randomised to combination versus monotherapy are needed to assess such an effect (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>). Alternatively, an additional 27 events in long-term follow-up on existing trials are needed to identify assess such an effect (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Adverse events and reactions </B>
<BR/>The most frequent adverse reaction was anaemia, which occurred in 727 out of 4448 patients (16%) on combination therapy and 43 out of 2944 (1%) on monotherapy (RR 9.45, 95% CI 7.42 to 12.05; 35 trials). Combination therapy significantly increased the risk of leukopenia (RR 3.42, 95% CI 1.38 to 8.49; 3 trials), but not neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Combination therapy increased the risk of several dermatological adverse reactions, eg, dermatitis (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.30; 3 trials), pruritus (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.02; 18 trials), and rash (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.61; 12 trials). Combination therapy also led to a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse reactions (dyspepsia and anorexia or nausea), insomnia, and miscellaneous adverse events (cough, dyspnoea, and fatigue). Adverse events or reactions led to a relatively large number of protocol deviations. In 37 trials, dose reductions were necessary in 1016 out of 4801 (21%) patients on combination therapy and 231 out of 2895 (8%) patients on monotherapy. Accordingly, combination therapy significantly increased the risk of necessary dose reductions (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.04). In 48 trials, 836 of 6014 (14%) patients on combination therapy and 433 of 3727 (12%) patients on monotherapy discontinued treatment (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.26). Combination therapy did not appear to increase the risk of flu-like symptoms and psychological adverse reactions that are known to be associated with interferon.</P>
<P>
<B>Failure of end-of-treatment virological response<BR/>
</B>Combination therapy significantly reduced the number of patients with failure of virological response (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.77; 78 trials). Combination therapy also had a significant effect on virological response of naive patients, relapsers, and non-responders individually.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Failure of histological response </B>
<BR/>All post-treatment biopsies were performed between 3 to 12 months after the end of treatment. Combination therapy significantly reduced the number of patients with failure on both inflammation score (grading) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.91; 11 trials) and fibrosis score (staging) (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97; 9 trials). Combination therapy also had a significant effect on liver histology of naive patients, relapsers, and non-responders individually. These results were supported by our per protocol analyses.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life </B>
<BR/>Only one trial with 257 relapsers reported data on quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>). Combination therapy had a significant beneficial effect on some subscales. These included scales on general health (MD 7.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 13.33), social functioning (MD 6.00, 95% CI 1.22 to 10.78), and mental health (MD 5.00, 95% CI 1.53 to 8.47).<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 15:29:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>This systematic review of 83 randomised trials including more than 12,000 patients with chronic hepatitis C found that ribavirin and interferon had a significant beneficial effect on the sustained virological response, which may lead to reduced liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality. However, the number needed to treat to prevent liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality is high (n = 313) and combination therapy significantly increased the risk of several adverse events.<BR/>
<BR/>Only few of the included trials reported both adequate randomisation and blinding. These aspects may be essential to minimise the risk of selection, performance, and ascertainment bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Balk-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balk 2002</LINK>). Even in trials with use of placebo tablets, ribavirin may be guessed because of the adverse events (eg, anaemia) and this may bias therapy. However, the impact of bias seems to vary across interventions and disease areas and outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Als_x002d_Nielsen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als-Nielsen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). We did not find that trials with inadequate bias components overestimated the beneficial effect of ribavirin. These findings support the robustness of our results but do not exclude the possibility of bias. In fact, in many of the included trials the primary outcomes were not specifically reported which leaves the risk of selective reporting of outcomes and increases the risk of too optimistic results (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The included patients and intervention regimens varied considerably, which are the likely causes of the substantial inter-trial heterogeneity in many analyses. This can be considered both a weakness and a strength. Limiting our analysis to include trials on one specific intervention regimen would have provided a more focused answer. However, the variety of patients and intervention regimens increase the external validity of the results. Most importantly we found that adding ribavirin to interferon was beneficial regarding SVR in all subgroups of naive, relapsers and non-responders, genotype 1, trials with many cirrhotics, and trials using any type of interferon.<BR/>
<BR/>A weakness of the present review is that the limit for detecting hepatitis C virus RNA varied considerably among the included trials. This may affect the assessment of the SVR. It also affects the classification of relapsers and non-responders and may contribute to the inter-trial heterogeneity, which was considerable in several meta-analyses. We found that adding ribavirin to interferon decreased the number without SVR with 25% (95% CI 21% to 29%). This correspond to a number needed to treat to achieve one more patient with SVR of 4 (95% CI 4 to 5) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). This number varies according to genotype and type of interferon.<BR/>
<BR/>Chronic hepatitis C treatment recommendations are based on non-validated surrogate outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>). SVR is associated with clinical improvement but has never been validated as a surrogate outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Chander-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chander 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2007</LINK>). This is due to the short follow-up of the trials, which makes it difficult to assess protracted clinical outcomes. Our results indicate that combination therapy significantly reduced morbidity plus mortality, but our findings have some weaknesses. First, the result is based on a composite outcome of measures that have very different consequences to patients. Combination therapy showed no significant effect on mortality or morbidity individually. Second, many deaths seemed without relation to hepatitis C infection. Third, cirrhosis events are not a clinical outcome if assessed by liver biopsy, but excluding these events from our analysis did not change the result. Fourth, it has never been proved that the control group (interferon alone) compared with no intervention is beneficial (or harmful) regarding clinical outcomes. Furthermore, in trials with long-term follow-up on clinical events retreatment may have interfered the clinical course.<BR/>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis confirms the benefits of combination therapy on SVR. However, the number of redundant trials published after such evidence was established is overwhelming. Conversely, trial sequential analysis found that we still needed more evidence to detect (or reject) a relative risk reduction of 50% regarding morbidity plus mortality. The estimated number of patients required to obtain firm evidence is the difference between the accrued number of patients and the required information size (equalling a difference of n = 3918 patients) (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). However, additional trials are very unlikely to be launched. Therefore, it may be more relevant to estimate the required number of clinical events, which is 27 to obtain firm evidence (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>). This could be potentially achieved by, eg, doing long-term evaluation of patients included in previous trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Several patients did not have post-treatment liver biopsies, but the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses found that combination therapy had a significant beneficial effect on liver histology. Different score-systems for liver histology assessment were used and some may have weak inter- and intraobserver reproducibility (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) (<LINK REF="REF-Marcellin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcellin 2002</LINK>). The short-term histological results seem encouraging and are in accordance with our beneficial findings on SVR.<BR/>
<BR/>Even in the absence of complications, chronic hepatitis C may impair quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1999</LINK>). Three trials including naive and relapsers patients (<LINK REF="STD-Davis-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHutchison-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McHutchison 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fried-2002b" TYPE="STUDY">Fried 2002b</LINK> (data were not available)) found that combination therapy reduced SVR and improved quality of life post-treatment. However, one study (<LINK REF="REF-Rodger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodger 1999</LINK>) found that quality of life was significantly reduced in HCV-seropositive patients aware of their serostatus compared to those unaware of their HCV status. Thus, improved quality of life associated with combination therapy may reflect patients' knowledge of their achievement of clearing HCV-RNA rather than lack of symptoms.<BR/>
<BR/>Ribavirin may be teratogenic (<LINK REF="REF-Ferm-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferm 1978</LINK>) and induces haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Maddrey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddrey 1999</LINK>). Therefore, most patients were required to practice birth control and were excluded if they had cardiovascular diseases or low level of haemoglobin. A total of 16% of patients treated with combination therapy experienced anaemia. In accordance with previous studies (<LINK REF="REF-Maddrey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maddrey 1999</LINK>), combination therapy was associated with several dermatological, gastrointestinal, haematological, and miscellaneous adverse reactions. Treatment discontinuation were necessary in 22% of all patients on combination therapy. Adverse reactions may be reduced lowering the dose of ribavirin or by replacing ribavirin with a prodrug, viramidine, without necessarily affecting the virological response rate (<LINK REF="REF-Bonkovsky-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonkovsky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hass-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hass 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hadziyannis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadziyannis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Banhamou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banhamou 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dienstag-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dienstag 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simin 2007</LINK>). Ribavirin regimen usually varies according to bodyweight and viral genotype. Genotype 1 and 4 are treated with 1000 or 1200 mg/day for 48 weeks, whereas genotype 2 and 3 are treated with 800 mg/day for 24 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Reddy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 2009</LINK>). Currently, several studies are trying to further identify the optimal balance between benefits and harms regarding ribavirin dose and duration for subgroup of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Reddy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reddy 2009</LINK>). Systematic reviews on these aspects seem to be needed.<BR/>
<BR/>We excluded trials with patients with human immune deficiency virus, but the majority of trials also excluded patients with history of alcohol or intravenous drug abuse or hepatitis B infection. Many patients with hepatitis C have these diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Alter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 2002</LINK>). Thus, the average patient included in this review is not likely to be representative of the average patient with chronic hepatitis C virus infection in clinical practice. Therefore, the reports on these trials showing cost-effectiveness may be biased (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gebo-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gebo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stein-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stein 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-San-Miguel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">San Miguel 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebert-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebert 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, the reports of the included trials all lacked sufficient data on clinical outcomes, including liver diseases and deaths.<BR/>
<BR/>The beneficial effects of adding ribavirin to interferon is not fully understood and several mechanisms have been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Lutchman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutchman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Clercq-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Clercq 2009</LINK>). Interestingly, ribavirin seems without beneficial effects as monotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brok-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2004</LINK>). Irrespective the exact mechanism, research on the optimal ribavirin regimen seems relevant. Most importantly, we need long-term follow-up to confirm the beneficial effect of ribavirin on clinical outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 11:45:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Adding ribavirin to any type of interferon should be considered the treatment of choice to obtain undetectable virus level in the blood for patients with chronic hepatitis C, irrespective previous antiviral treatment and viral genotype. However, the number needed to treat to prevent one patient from developing liver-related morbidity or dying seems very large (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) considering the increased risk of severe adverse reactions and costs. Treatment should be monitored carefully as combination therapy is associated with several adverse reactions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 11:45:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Additional trials comparing the short-term effect of interferon with or without ribavirin do not seem justified. However, longer follow-up assessment on the existing trials and research on the long-term association between therapy-induced virological response and therapy induced changes in liver-related morbidity and mortality seem warranted. Additional research is needed to evaluate the optimal dose and duration of treatment with ribavirin. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT Statement (www.consort-statement.org) and involve ribavirin, placebo, and adequate blinding.</P>

Stratton-Hans Popper Department of Pathology, Mount Sinai&lt;br&gt;Medical Center, City University of New York, NY 10029, USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of hepatic iron may impair the response of patients with&lt;br&gt;chronic hepatitis C to treatment with interferon-alfa, but combination therapy&lt;br&gt;with ribavirin has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of hepatitis C. When&lt;br&gt;used alone or with interferon-alfa, ribavirin may cause a dose-dependent&lt;br&gt;reversible hemolytic anemia. We compared the extent and cellular localization of&lt;br&gt;iron deposition in liver tissue from biopsy specimens obtained before and after&lt;br&gt;36 weeks of therapy with ribavirin or placebo for 59 patients with chronic&lt;br&gt;hepatitis C. Paired slides were available for review from 26 ribavirin and 27&lt;br&gt;placebo recipients. Iron deposition was assessed using coded slides stained with&lt;br&gt;Perls Prussian blue and was semi-quantitated in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and&lt;br&gt;areas of fibrosis. The overall iron score fell by 0.96 in the placebo group and&lt;br&gt;increased 1.69 in the ribavirin recipients. Iron was deposited mainly in&lt;br&gt;hepatocytes; the hepatocyte iron score increased from 2.19 to 3.81 in the&lt;br&gt;ribavirin group. The amount of iron staining in Kupffer cells declined in the&lt;br&gt;placebo group and increased slightly in the ribavirin group. Iron changes in&lt;br&gt;areas of fibrosis were minor and did not differ between groups. Increased total&lt;br&gt;hepatic iron deposition occurred during a 9-month course of ribavirin.&lt;br&gt;Ribavirin-associated hemolysis deposits iron preferentially in hepatocytes. This&lt;br&gt;increased deposition of hepatic iron does not seem to affect the biochemical or&lt;br&gt;histologic response to ribavirin therapy but may have implications for&lt;br&gt;hepatocyte susceptibility to future injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication Types:&lt;br&gt;Clinical trial&lt;br&gt;Multicenter study&lt;br&gt;Randomized controlled trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Trial sequential analysis illustrating that the cumulative Z-curve (blue) crossed the monitoring boundary (red) during the tenth trial, which is needed to detect an effect size of relative risk reduction of 10%. Subsequently, 58 trials have been published.<BR/>
<BR/>Trial sequential analysis was performed with a maximum type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% (80% power). We assumed an event proportion of 85% without sustained virological response in the interferon monotherapy group. We used an event proportion of 76.5% (RRR = 10%) without sustained virological response in the combination group. We adjusted the required information size with the heterogeneity I<SUP>2 </SUP>among the included trials (n = 3365).</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis illustrating that the cumulative Z-curve (blue) had not crossed the monitoring boundary (red) or surpassed the information size. Thus, we need more evidence to detect (or reject) a relative risk reduction of 50% for adding ribavirin to interferon regarding clinical outcomes. We need additionally 9340 - 5422 = 3918 patients to detect or reject this effect size.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was performed with a maximum type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% (80% power). We assumed an event rate of 1% with clinical events in the interferon monotherapy group. We assumed an event proportion of 0.5% (RRR = 50%) in the group treated with ribavirin plus interferon. We adjusted the required information size with the heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>) among the included trials (n = 9340).</P>

<P>Trial sequential analysis illustrating that the cumulative Z-curve (blue) had not crossed the monitoring boundary (red) or surpassed the event size. Thus, we need more evidence to detect (or reject) a relative risk reduction of 50% for adding ribavirin to interferon regarding clinical outcomes. We need additionally 70 - 43 = 27 patients with a clinical outcome to detect or reject this effect size.</P>
<P>Trial sequential analysis was performed with a maximum type I error of 5% and type II error of 20% (80% power). We assumed an event proportion of 1% with clinical events in the interferon monotherapy group. We assumed an event proportion of 0.5% (RRR = 50%) in the group treated with ribavirin plus interferon.</P>
