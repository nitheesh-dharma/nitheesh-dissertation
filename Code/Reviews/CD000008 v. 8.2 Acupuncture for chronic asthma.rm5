I have worked through the review. First I was a bit sceptic with all these graphs etc. but at a second detailed look I&lt;br&gt;have to admit that the review has not only been updated but greatly been improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here my comments:&lt;br&gt;- synopsis: is that still the old one (refers to 7 studies) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE AMENDED THIS TO REFLECT THE NEW EVIDENCE IN THE REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- abstract selection criteria: in the last years a frequent critique re acupuncture reviews was the inclusion of non-needle&lt;br&gt;techniques which are &amp;quot;not true acupuncture.&amp;quot; I would therefore (not in the title) use the expression &amp;quot;needle acupuncture and/or other&lt;br&gt;forms of stimulation of acupuncture points&amp;quot; throughout the review. In the abstract here I proprose: Randomised and possibly&lt;br&gt;randomised trials using needle acupuncture or other forms of stiumlation of a. points...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE DONE THIS - PLEASE SEE THE TEXT OF THE REVIEW ROB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- abstract, data collection: I thought that Benno not only assesses sham but although true acup. interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE INSERTED THIS IN THE TEXT OF THE ABSTRACT ROB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- abstract main results: I would include as second phrase here a statement on the strong heterogeneity (true, sham, outcome&lt;br&gt;measurement and timing, presentation). I am sceptic whether it makes sense to present the &amp;quot;pooled data&amp;quot; - these come only from 2&lt;br&gt;studies, although, in principle they have been measured in other trials, too, but were not presented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: THIS IS A VALID POINT, BUT I THINK THAT SYMPTOMS AND LUNG FUNCTION ARE IMPORTANT OUTCOMES TO MEASURE. WE SHOULD TRY AND CONVEY OUR FINDINGS, IF ONLY WITH THE CAVEAT THAT THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. I HAVE PASTED ONE RESULT ON LUNG FUNCTION IN TO THE REVIEW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- background: After the first phrase of para two I would insert a statement what we mean by needle acu and other forms of stimulation&lt;br&gt;of a. points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: - ROB COULD YOU INSERT SOMETHING SUITABLE HERE? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- background: Kim's and my review are quite old and no longer recent, don't you thinkl so&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I AGREE THEY ARE AS OLD AS THE HILLS - BUT DO WE HAVE ANYTHING ELSE? ROB HOW ABOUT THAT META-ANALYSIS YOU PICKED UP THAT WAS RECENT? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- objectives: again &amp;quot;needle acup and other forms...&amp;quot; Should we be more explicit with comparisons here? I think it is ok as it is now.&lt;br&gt;- types of interventions: I do not understand the last phrase on the control interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE ALTERED THIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- methods: again, why restrict Benno to the assessment of sham?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE ALTERED THIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- methods: it might make sense to add a para on how we classified trials according to true and sham interventions before the para&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;for continuous variables...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE ADDED A PARAGRAPH IN RED PLEASE SEE THIS ROB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-description of studies: I find it confusing that the first para only refers to the update. I think it is better to refer in the&lt;br&gt;whole new review and maybe say what of this is new stuff. It has to be said what the actual number of included studies is now...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE ADDED SOME INFO IN THE DESCRIPTION OF STUDIES SECTION OF THE REVIEW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- sample sizes: I would also give the sum of patients (it is in the abstract, too)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- interventions characteristics - control: I would prefer to speak of &amp;quot;sham interventions&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;control acupuncture&amp;quot; which is&lt;br&gt;in my view a quite unclear term. The phrase &amp;quot;However according to TCM...&amp;quot; should be placed after phrase 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: PLEASE SEE TEXT. I HAVE ADDED SOME MORE TEXT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- outcome assessment: lung function for the Joos study was reported by Schott 1997, although only for subgroups of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: TEXT ADDED. DATA NOT AVAILABLE TO US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- methodological quality: &amp;quot;all trials attempted to blind patients and evaluators&amp;quot; - In section &amp;quot;design of study&amp;quot; only 9 trials are listed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE INSERTED JOOS AND MALMSTROM STUDIES. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- discussion, first para, phrase 2: Again, I do not like the pooling issue because in my view this is not very helpful if only 2 are&lt;br&gt;usable. The numbers in results and in the graphy are ok, but I would say somewhere in the disucssion that meaningful pooling was not&lt;br&gt;possible with the available trials for heterogeneity and reporting issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I HAVE INSERTED SOMETHING HERE - PLEASE CHECK THIS ROB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- discussion, last para: I wonder whether we should here somewhere that the results are not very promising even if there are a few&lt;br&gt;positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL HOW WE TREAT NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- graphs: as I said, at a first look I did not like this large number of graphs as there is always so little in. But probably you are&lt;br&gt;right to put it in, particularly as new studies might become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: I'M DAMNED IF I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE GRAPHS OUT NOW! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- tables: I did not check for typos and details so far here. Are already all excluded studies listed? Seem so few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: THERE WERE A FEW MORE ADDED - BUT THEY ARE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- other references: I don't know whether Dincer 2003 is already citable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: IF IT IS UNPUBLISHED (WHICH IT IS) - WE CAN LEAVE IT AT THAT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- details for co-reviewers: don't know whether Benno should be described as acupuncturist (only - what do you say, Benno?); my phone&lt;br&gt;number is now +49-89-726697-15, fax is ok email is Klaus.Linde@lrz.tu-muenchen.de; Kim should be skipped as secondary contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benno your assessment is very neutral, don't you want to make some more &amp;quot;judgement&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL 020703: LIKEWISE, CAREFUL ABOUT HOW BOMBASTIC WE APPEAR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;br&gt;Klaus Linde&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Acupuncture for chronic asthma (WITH TJL AND RM FOR COMMENTS)&lt;br&gt;Old title: Acupuncture for chronic asthma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;TJL inserted 290703: &lt;br&gt;Email from Klaus LInde&lt;br&gt;Hi Rob,&lt;br&gt;I have read through the new version (although I did not check the TIS and MetaView graphics in details). It looks good to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have only one major comment: I still do not understand our inclusion criterion for the control treatment (applies to abstract and methods). My proprosal: &amp;quot;Any form of control treatment was considered (no treatment in addition to conventional asthma treatment, sham or placebo interventions, active comparator interventions).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor points:&lt;br&gt;- contact details Klaus Linde: instead of Department of Gastroenterology Department of Internal Medicine II, my phone is now +49-89-72669715, my email Klaus.Linde@lrz.tu-muenchen.de (please do not use the old address)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- contact details Benno: he is an MD with specialization in internal medicine and he has received training in acupuncture.

Why not using the more reader-firendliy RR instead of OR which noone is able to interpret? Proprosal for para 2: Fixed effects... unless heterogeneity (p &amp;lt;= 0.1).... (you wrote p &amp;gt;=0.1, and 0.1 is not significant). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para 4: achieve instead of acheive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Description of studies - intervention ch. - sham: Proposal first phrase: All trials included a sham or placebo comparison group. Para 2:&lt;br&gt;Some of &amp;quot;these&amp;quot; points. These in my view refers to Joos and Mitchell which is not fully clear. &amp;quot;No trial included a no treatment&lt;br&gt;control...&amp;quot;??? What about the thrid group in Medici? - Methodological quality, phrase 2; proprosal: All trials attempted to&lt;br&gt;blind patients and evaluators except Joos 2000; Malmstr&amp;#246;m 2002 in which only patients were blinded.&lt;br&gt;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 1-Aug-2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - Emply for Carlson and Bruer as secondary refs in included studies. Please complete! Dincer ref in additional references just says author copy????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;040803TJL: This is an unpublished manuscript. Should this be reflected in the reference? We got sent a copy. Carlsson and Bruer gave us unpublished data and I think that we can take out the ghost references. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - Please explain Jadad score x-x-x in the footnotes. Otherwise good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;040803TJL: Done this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metaview Labels - fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract -fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - Is there paired data for the cross-overs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;040803TJL: Biernacki was two-tailed. Does this help Chris? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results - fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - I have taken out the recommendation about matching patients with the control goup as randomisation should deal with this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - fine (helpful to list the new studies as you have done)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues -definition of the intervention and comparisons! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;040803TJL: I think that the concept of acup is fairly dealt with in the review and the absence of a definitive process may be a function of the intervention and subsequent attempts to quantify the effects of acup on asthma will be hindered by the very nature of the differing approaches to the intervention, as well as other potential confounders like concomitant medication. Should this be more prominently in the discussion section? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cross-over studies pooled for FEV1. Shapira and Biernacki. Unknown status for randomisation re Hirsch study. Is publication bias likely to be a problem? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly - although we did get hold of some unpublished data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next action : back to Toby.&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;050803 TJL: I HAVE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL EXCLUDED STUDY TO THIS REVIEW ON THE BACK OF SOME MORE PAPERS IDENTIFIED BY ELECTRONIC SEARCHING DONE BY KAREN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer Review comments received 12/9/03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have incorporated a few textual changes (marked in red) at the suggestion of the peer reviewer.

<P>Five new studies were identified for the 2003 update of this review (Biernacki 1998; Joos 2000; Malmstrom 2002; Medici 2002; Shapira 2002). One study previously included was deemed not to have met the inclusion criteria for the review as it was carried out in COPD patients.<BR/>
<BR/>The Description of studies, Methodological Quality of Included Studies, Results and Discussion sections were substantially revised, to reflect the need for more focused clinical trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Following the inclusion of these studies data could be pooled for two outcomes (lung function and improvement in well-being). These did not alter the conclusions of the review.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Acupuncture is a treatment originating from traditional Chinese medicine. It consists of the stimulation of defined points on the skin (mostly by insertion of needles). The objective of this review was to assess whether there is evidence from randomised controlled trials that asthma patients benefit from acupuncture. The studies included in the review were of variable quality and had inconsistent results. Future research should concentrate on establishing whether there is a non-specific component of acupuncture which benefits recipients of treatment. There should be an assessment not merely of placebo treatment, but also of 'no treatment' as well. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the value of acupuncture as a treatment for asthma based on current evidence. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:56:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acupuncture has traditionally been used to treat asthma in China and is used increasingly for this purpose internationally. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of asthma or asthma-like symptoms.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:56:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (last searched August 2008), the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field trials register, AMED, and reference lists of articles. We also contacted trialists and researchers in the field of complementary and alternative medical research.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and possibly randomised trials using needle acupuncture or other forms of stimulation of acupuncture. Any form of control treatment was considered (no treatment in addition to conventional asthma treatment, sham or placebo interventions, active comparator interventions). Studies were included provided outcome was assessed at one week or more. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:03:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>At least two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. A reviewer experienced in acupuncture assessed the adequacy of the active and sham acupuncture used in the studies. Study authors were contacted for missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 12:03:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria recruiting 350 participants. Trial reporting was poor and trial quality was deemed inadequate to generalise findings. There was variation in the type of active and sham acupuncture, the outcomes measured and time-points presented. The points used in the sham arm of some studies are used for the treatment of asthma according to traditional Chinese medicine. Two studies used individualised treatment strategies and one study used a combination strategy of formula acupuncture with the addition of individualised points. No statistically significant or clinically relevant effects were found for acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture. Data from two small studies were pooled for lung function (post-treatment FEV1): Standardised Mean Difference 0.12, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 0.55).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is not enough evidence to make recommendations about the value of acupuncture in asthma treatment. Further research needs to consider the complexities and different types of acupuncture. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-13 16:22:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-13 16:12:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bronchial asthma is a major health problem and has a significant mortality. Data on the prevalence of asthma vary between 3% and 6% for adults and between 8% and 12% in children and suggest an increasing incidence within recent years. Although the symptoms can be controlled by drug treatment in most patients, effective low-risk, non-drug strategies could constitute a significant advance in asthma management.</P>
<P>Acupuncture is a form of therapy derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) involving the stimulation of points on the body with the use of needles, for therapeutic or preventative purposes. The points are derived from TCM theory and relate to the meridians, a system that purportedly allows the flow of 'Qi' through the body, blockages of which are thought to cause health problems. As the use of acupuncture has become more prevalent in the West these theories have been developed to fit in with a Western understanding of bodily function: for example needling is thought to reduce local muscle tension or release pain-killing endorphins (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2002</LINK>). Other methods of stimulation are traditionally used, such as the use of pressure (acupressure), and others have been developed (e.g. laser), and for the purposes of this review they have been included. One important but under-researched aspect of treatment is the subjective element of this complex therapy. This is shared with a number of other therapies involving one-to-one session work, such as pulmonary rehabilitation. It is very difficult to remove acupuncture treatment from its context and this has not been addressed in existing research.</P>
<P>Acupuncture has traditionally been used in asthma treatment in China and is increasingly applied for this purpose in Western countries. In 1991 Kleijnen et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Kleijnen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleijnen 1991</LINK>) published a systematic review of the controlled clinical trials in asthma. They concluded that claims for the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of asthma are not based on the results of well performed clinical trials. Unfortunately, this review was limited mainly to an assessment of methodological quality and gave little information on what was investigated in the primary studies.

<P>At least two of the four reviewers independently assessed search results, eligibility and selected studies for inclusion in the review. Initial disagreements occurred for two papers but could be resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>We considered each active intervention to determine whether the acupuncture being administered consisted of stimulation by needle or by laser of indicated acupuncture points. We also determined the extent to which the sham acupuncture could be construed as an active stimulation of non-acupuncture points or whether it involved non-stimulation of any points. Studies where active was compared with non-stimulation of active points (potentially a double-blind study) were analysed separately from studies where active was compared with stimulation of non-active points. Attempts to achieve de qi sensation were noted. Please see Characteristics of Included Studies for further details.</P>

Eight trials used formula acupuncture (identical points for all patients - <LINK REF="STD-Dias-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tandon-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Tandon 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hirsch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hirsch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biernacki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Biernacki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Medici-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Medici 2002</LINK>), but formulas differed strongly between trials. In two trials individualised acupuncture points were used according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (<LINK REF="STD-Joos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 2002</LINK>).

<P>Of the nine studies using needle acupuncture, six stated that they sought the de qi sensation (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malmstr_x00f6_m-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malmström 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention characteristics - sham acupuncture group</HEADING>
<P>All trials included a sham comparison group. Of the needle acupuncture studies two used points not indicated for asthma as controls (<LINK REF="STD-Mitchell-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Mitchell 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Joos 2000</LINK>). Six stimulated points on the body not considered active acupuncture points (<LINK REF="STD-Dias-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Dias 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tashkin-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Tashkin 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Biernacki-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Biernacki 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Medici-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Medici 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shapira-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Shapira 2002</LINK>). One used a pseudo-intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Malmstr_x00f6_m-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Malmström 2002</LINK> - inactive TENS machine). One study included a non-treatment control group in addition to a sham acupuncture group (<LINK REF="STD-Medici-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Medici 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>However according to Chinese medicine, some of these points might have some treatment effect, so they might not be considered to be fully inert placebo strategies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 16:22:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve randomised clinical trials with a total of 350 patients, comparing needle or laser acupuncture with some form of dummy acupuncture in addition to standard maintenance medication, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Differences in study design, outcome and intervention meant that data could be pooled for only two outcomes comparing needle acupuncture with sham needle acupuncture (PEFR and global assessment of well being). Both outcomes did not show a statistically and clinically difference between active treatment and control. Although we did pool data for two outcomes which involved two small studies, there were insufficient data available to facilitate extrapolation of the effects of acupuncture to the general population level.</P>
<P>The validity of real and sham acupuncture used in the studies merits comment. It could be questioned whether the acupuncture used in the studies is representative of that used in practice. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western formula acupuncture were used in the studies for this review. A major issue complicating the evaluation and integration of acupuncture in the western world is the model of treatment. If applied according to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture often comes as part of a package of care that includes diet and herbal medicines. The acupuncturist may modify the sites in different patients with asthma, as according to the traditional Chinese nosology these patients may have different disorders. From a western perspective such a treatment seems "individualized". Outside China, "standardized" treatment strategies are frequently used. These strategies are more compatible with western thinking. However, as a growing number of western acupuncturists also apply traditional Chinese strategies, a deliberate restriction to evaluating only the "standardized" model might not be adequate.</P>
<P>Although the focus of this review differs slightly from that of <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2002</LINK>, the conclusions, and in particular the implications for research, largely echo the findings of that review. This review highlights the fact that any trial or investigation of acupuncture is a complex challenge and that many different parameters need to be controlled for and investigated. For example, needle depth, type of needle manipulation (manual, electrical stimulation, moxibustion etc), siting of needles, induction of de qi (an irradiating sensation after needling thought to indicate effective needling), duration of insertion, duration of stimulation, use of standardised formulae versus individualised prescribing, to cite but a few. Researchers would therefore be well advised to consult widely and in particular to take advice from those who have knowledge of the different styles of acupuncture practice and of trial design and methodology. Adherence to the STandards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) guidelines could help to elucidate the validity of future clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore the included studies utilised different sham strategies as control treatments, including needling at non-points (i.e. points on the body where acupuncture is not considered to be effective) and needling at non-indicated points (i.e. a true acupuncture point not indicated for asthma). Some would argue that needling of non-points may produce a therapeutic effect (<LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK>). However, testing whether there is genuinely different response across these potentially different forms of control is undermined by different interventions, study designs, patient samples and outcomes measured. <LINK REF="REF-Birch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birch 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dincer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dincer 2003</LINK> argue that pooling trials with different controls as described in the included studies of this review would be methodologically unsound. Further research into what constitutes an acceptable control procedure, and whether there are non-specific benefits associated with an acupuncture treatment 'package' (e.g. holistic consultation, and different approach to patients' disease) should help to elucidate this issue further.</P>
<P>None of the included studies reported data on side-effects and tolerability. Few trials specifically evaluated the side-effect and morbidity profile of acupuncture treatments, but some have drawn attention to the complications which may follow acupuncture treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Jobst-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobst 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jobst-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobst 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norheim-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norheim 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is inconclusive evidence to indicate that short term (1 to 12 weeks) acupuncture treatment has a significant effect on the course of asthma when used in conjunction with drug maintenance treatment. Furthermore, the severity of participants included in this review was mild to moderate, and so extrapolating the findings to the general population is not possible. The subgroup analysis performed in this review was inadequately powered to detect a difference between adults and children. Therefore more research is required before the response to treatment according to both age and severity can be assessed adequately. Some studies did report significant positive changes in subjective parameters, and medication use, which suggest that some patients with asthma may benefit from acupuncture. However, due to fundamental differences between trials and inadequate data presentation little of the data were suitable for meta-analysis.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>On the basis of this review, no recommendations could be made for the practice of acupuncture. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is an urgent need for information on the different ways in which acupuncture is practiced and might be evaluated in order that appropriate trials can be designed. The methodological inconsistencies and problems encountered in all the trials reported to date indicate that more pilot data should be acquired before proceeding to any large scale randomised trials. In particular, researchers should pay attention to the nature of sham/control points selected since in a number of the studies the control points selected can be used for the treatment of asthma according to Traditional Chinese Acupuncture practice. Future trials should attempt to include a no-treatment control arm, in addition to active and sham groups. </P>
<P>Acupuncture should also be assessed in the context of more severe asthma, in order to be able to generalise the findings of more rigorously conducted and reported clinical research. </P>
<P>Attention needs to be paid to the nature or style of acupuncture used (for a introduction to acupuncture see <LINK REF="REF-Stux-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stux 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helms-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helms 1998</LINK>). The available evidence does not allow objective comparison between different acupuncture types. Therefore, it is not possible to comment on claims by proponents of any technique or style that any one is better than any other. </P>

<P>From a large number of papers on acupuncture and asthma screened we identified 21 controlled clinical trials. At least two of the three original reviewers independently assessed eligibility and selected seven studies for inclusion in the review. The main reasons for exclusion were short observation periods (i.e. studies on induced/spontaneous asthma attacks) and non-random allocation (see reasons for exclusions in the table of excluded studies). Trials with short observation periods do not seem relevant for the primary objective of this review as acupuncture is primarily used as an adjuvant therapy in the long-term treatment of asthma. These trials have been summarized in the reviews by Jobst (Jobst 1995) and Linde et al. (Linde 1996).</P>

<P>We identified sixty-four references from electronic searches and alerts, of which ten studies were retrieved. Five met the inclusion criteria (Biernacki 1998; Joos 2000; Malmström 2002; Medici 2002; Shapira 2002) and four were excluded from the review (Choudhury 1989; Maa 1997; Eber 2001; Gruber 2002; Karst 2002 - please see "Table of characteristics of excluded studies"). One study is awaiting assessment due to inadequate reporting (Abdel Khalek 1999). One study was excluded that had previously been included (Jobst 1986) as the study recruited people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</P>
