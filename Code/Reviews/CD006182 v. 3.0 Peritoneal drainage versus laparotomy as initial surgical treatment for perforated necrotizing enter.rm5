<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-02-18 20:06:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intestinal perforation is a very serious condition in very premature babies. Standard treatment of intestinal perforation is the surgical opening of the abdomen and removal of the unhealthy or dead intestine. Insertion of a drain into the abdomen instead of surgical opening has been tried to treat this condition. This review did not find any significant advantages or harms of insertion of the drain over surgically opening the abdomen; however, there is too little evidence to fully understand the risks and benefits of this approach.</P>

<P>Only two randomised controlled trials (RCT) met the eligibility criteria.

Nearly 50% of the infants in the peritoneal drainage group could avoid the need for laparotomy during the study period (44/90 versus 95/96; typical RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; N = 186, two trials). One study found that the time to attain full enteral feeds in infants &#8804; 1000 g was prolonged in the peritoneal drainage group (mean difference (MD) 20.77, 95% CI 3.62 to 37.92).</P>

<P>Evidence from two RCTs suggests no significant benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:37:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-05 11:37:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Tudehope-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tudehope 2005</LINK>). Bell staging criteria with the Walsh and Kliegman modification allow uniformity of diagnosis and treatment based on severity of illness (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>). Stage I is defined as suspected NEC, manifesting as feeding intolerance, abdominal distention and occult or frank blood in the stool; Stage II is definite NEC, presenting with marked abdominal distention, blood in the stool and pneumatosis intestinalis on radiograph; Stage III is advanced NEC, with impending or proven perforation in addition to pneumatosis intestinalis in a critically ill baby with metabolic derangement (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 1986</LINK>). The incidence of significant NEC (&#8805; stage 2) is 5% to 12% in very low birth weight (&lt; 1500 g) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horbar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgibbons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgibbons 2009</LINK>), with a higher incidence at lower length of gestation and birth weight. NEC is characterised by variable damage to the intestinal tract, ranging from mucosal injury to full-thickness necrosis and perforation. The areas most commonly affected are the terminal ileum and proximal ascending colon. The pathogenesis of NEC is multifactorial (<LINK REF="REF-Kanto-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanto 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Isolated intestinal perforation or spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), on the other hand, is thought to be a distinct clinical entity that is different from NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Pumberger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pumberger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarrado-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarrado 2005</LINK>). The onset of illness in SIP is usually significantly earlier than in NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Okuyama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okuyama 2002</LINK>). Presence of free intraperitoneal air in the absence of pneumatosis intestinalis on preoperative x-rays suggest the possibility of SIP. SIP is usually not associated with significant metabolic derangement such as metabolic acidosis, hypotension, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and hyponatraemia (<LINK REF="STD-Tepas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tepas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2007</LINK>). At operation, SIP is usually located in the terminal ileum in an antimesenteric position, with the rest of the bowel being normal.</P>
<P>However, it may not be possible to definitely distinguish between perforated NEC and SIP during the preoperative period and often these two conditions are described together as perforated NEC and treated similarly. Hence, the term 'perforated NEC' is used by the majority of the published studies to include both conditions.</P>
<P>Reported mortality rates for preterm infants with perforated NEC range from 10% to 50%, with lower gestational age groups carrying a higher risk (<LINK REF="REF-Schullinger-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schullinger 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blakely-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Blakely 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luig-2005A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luig 2005A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luig 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgibbons-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgibbons 2009</LINK>). Survivors of significant NEC are at high risk of serious short and long term complications, including neurodevelopmental impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Tobiansky-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobiansky 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonntag-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonntag 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blakely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blakely 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulzke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulzke 2007</LINK>). Infants with NEC requiring surgery are at higher risk for neurodevelopmental impairment compared to those who require only medical therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulzke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulzke 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-18 20:25:29 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard surgical treatment for perforated NEC or SIP is laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2008</LINK>). The principal objectives of laparotomy are to remove gangrenous or perforated bowel and to preserve as much of the intestine as possible. Options include resection of necrotic areas of bowel with enterostomy, resection with primary anastomosis, proximal jejunostomy, the 'clip and drop' technique and 'patch, drain and wait' (<LINK REF="REF-Pierro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierro 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Peritoneal drainage on the other hand involves the simple procedure of inserting a Penrose drain into the peritoneal cavity. This is usually done at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit under local anaesthesia.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-02-18 20:26:08 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The peritoneal drain removes the toxic effluents in the peritoneal cavity such as blood, gas and pus. This decompresses the abdomen and facilitates the stabilisation of the infant. In addition, the unique features of wound healing described in experimental fetal models may play a role in the healing of the gastrointestinal perforation. Fetal wound healing without inflammation and scarring is well documented for humans and appears to be related to intrinsic differences in fetal cells and the extracellular matrix (<LINK REF="REF-Longaker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longaker 1989</LINK>). This type of wound healing begins to diminish at the start of the third trimester and does not occur once gestational maturity is attained. These findings would suggest that if the bowel were to heal on its own, it would be less likely to produce scarring and stricture in preterm infants. The ability of the fetal peritoneal cavity to resorb infarcted bowel is well demonstrated by intestinal atresia (<LINK REF="REF-Longaker-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longaker 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adzick-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adzick 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roh 2001</LINK>). Peritoneal drainage also avoids the intra and immediate postoperative complications in critically ill very preterm infants undergoing surgery. The other theoretical advantage is the potential for the avoidance of deleterious effects of general anaesthesia on the developing brain (<LINK REF="REF-Loepke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loepke 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Laparotomy on the other hand allows direct visualisation of the intestines, enabling the surgeon to undertake appropriate procedures such as resection of the gangrenous segment; peritoneal lavage with evacuation of pus, stools and blood; and creation of enterostomies. Removal of gangrenous segments in turn helps control the sepsis and other metabolic derangements.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-18 20:34:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peritoneal drainage was initially introduced in the late 1970s to stabilise the critically ill, extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant prior to laparotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Ein-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ein 1977</LINK>). Subsequently Ein et al (<LINK REF="REF-Ein-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ein 1990</LINK>) reported that some of the preterm infants who were treated with peritoneal drainage recovered completely without the need for any laparotomy. Since then, many units have tried peritoneal drainage as either a stabilising or even definitive procedure for perforated NEC or SIP; 95% of the surgeons who responded to a recent survey in the UK used peritoneal drainage for stabilisation and 58% used it as definitive treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Rees-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2005</LINK>). A USA study also found that peritoneal drainage was very commonly used for perforated NEC or SIP (<LINK REF="REF-Blakely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blakely 2006</LINK>). Many retrospective studies have tried to address the role of peritoneal drainage for perforated NEC and SIP in preterm infants (<LINK REF="STD-Cheu-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Cheu 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Takamatsu-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Takamatsu 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snyder-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Snyder 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Demestre-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Demestre 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gollin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gollin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Morgan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dimmitt-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dimmitt 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierro-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierro 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romero-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Romero 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ibanez-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ibanez 2009</LINK>). Two RCTs have been published addressing this issue. If peritoneal drainage is as effective as or superior to laparotomy as a treatment of acute cases of perforated NEC or SIP, it will have significant implications for the management of these critically ill infants. Hence we undertook this systematic review to evaluate the benefits and risks of peritoneal drainage compared to laparotomy as the initial surgical treatment of perforated NEC or SIP in preterm infants.</P>

<P>Two review authors (SR and GD) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion involving KS and NS as the new assessors.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and entered into the 'Risk of Bias' table using the following criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Was there adequate sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)?</B>
</P>
<P>The method used to generate the allocation sequence in each included study was described as: low risk (any truly random process such as random number table, computerised random number generator); high risk (any nonrandom process, for example odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Was there adequate allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)?</B>
</P>
<P>The method used to conceal the allocation sequence in each included study was described as: adequate (for example telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); inadequate (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); or unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Was there adequate blinding (checking for possible performance bias)?</B>
</P>
<P>The methods used to blind the personnel from the knowledge of which intervention the participants received: was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study; and at the time of outcome assessment? <BR/>
<BR/>
<B>4. Were incomplete outcome data addressed (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)?</B>
</P>
<P>If attrition and exclusion were reported: the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomised participants); reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported; and whether missing data were balanced across the groups or were related to outcomes where reported. We assessed the methods as low risk (&lt; 20% missing data); high risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or unclear risk.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Was there selective reporting bias? </B>
</P>
<P>The possibility of selective outcome reporting bias was investigated. We assessed the methods as low risk (where it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported); high risk (where not all of the study's prespecified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or unclear risk.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>6. Were there any other sources of potential bias?</B>
</P>
<P>Any important concerns we had about other potential sources of bias (for example whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process) were described. We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: low risk; high risk; or unclear risk.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Population</HEADING>
<P>Preterm infants less than 34 weeks gestation at birth and birth weight less than 1500 g with evidence of perforated necrotizing enterocolitis or SIP were eligible for inclusion. Intestinal perforation was defined as the presence of free intraperitoneal air on abdominal radiographs (96 infants); stool, bile or pus found at abdominal paracentesis (five infants) or clinical evidence of perforation in the joint opinion of the attending surgeon and the neonatologist (16 infants). The investigators did not differentiate between perforated NEC and those with SIP at the time of randomisation. Infants with gastrointestinal anomalies, a previous abdominal operation or bilateral grade four intraventricular haemorrhage were not eligible. A total of 55 were randomised to primary peritoneal drainage and 62 to primary laparotomy. The study infants in both groups were similar with respect to their baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Inteventions</HEADING>
<P>Primary peritoneal drainage: infants randomised to primary peritoneal drainage received a 0.6 cm full thickness incision in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Stools and pus were expressed manually from the peritoneal cavity, which was then irrigated with warmed normal saline until clear. A long 1/4 inch Penrose drain was placed via the incision in the right lower quadrant. A second drain was placed if the surgeon believed it was needed to provide effective drainage. If the air or fluid re-accumulated, the original drain was manipulated or an additional drain inserted. The protocol allowed, but did not encourage, early laparotomy in infants with persistent metabolic acidosis, haemodynamic instability and respiratory failure.</P>
<P>Primary laparotomy: infants assigned to the laparotomy underwent abdominal exploration through a transverse abdominal incision. All frankly necrotic intestines were resected and stomas created. If evidence of further intestinal necrosis or perforation developed, additional laparotomies were performed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes assessed</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Population</HEADING>
<P>Extremely low birth weight preterm infants (&lt; 1000 g) with evidence of intestinal perforation were eligible. Intestinal perforation was defined as the presence of free intraperitoneal air on abdominal radiographs. Infants with extensive disease as well as those with SIP were included in the study. The investigators stated that they did not differentiate between perforated NEC and SIP because it is difficult to differentiate between them preoperatively. Infants were excluded from the trial if they had: previous episodes of NEC, a previous laparotomy or peritoneal drain, bilateral grade 4 intraventricular haemorrhage or were treated in a neonatal intensive care unit where access to paediatric surgeons was not available. A total of 35 were randomised to primary peritoneal drainage and 34 to primary laparotomy.

<P>Primary peritoneal drainage: infants randomised to primary peritoneal drainage underwent this procedure at the bedside in the neonatal unit. The paediatric surgeons performed this procedure under local anaesthesia, via an incision made in the right or left lower quadrant of the abdomen. The peritoneal cavity was entered under direct vision and a 1/4 inch soft drain inserted. Irrigation via the drain was not recommended. Infants whose clinical condition was stable continued with peritoneal drainage. Infants with a deteriorating clinical condition were allowed laparotomy at the discretion of the surgeon, after at least 12 hours of being on peritoneal drainage. The criteria for laparotomy were based on worsening of the clinical condition (for example inotrope requirement, respiratory support, decreased urine output, increasing or persistent pneumoperitoneum, palpable mass, increasing abdominal distension or discolouration, and persistent intestinal obstruction).</P>
<P>Primary laparotomy: infants assigned to the laparotomy underwent abdominal exploration either in theatre or in the neonatal unit. The choice of surgery was at the discretion of the operating surgeon.</P>

<P>Trials were evaluated for their methodological quality in terms of adequacy of sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of intervention and outcome assessment, completeness of follow up and completeness of reporting. Details are given in the table 'Characteristics of included studies' and the 'Risk of bias' table.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK> trial, infants were randomised to receive primary peritoneal drainage or laparotomy within permuted blocks of four, with the block size unknown to the investigators. A computerised random number generator was used to generate the allocation sequence. Allocation concealment was maintained by means of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes for each stratum; randomisation was stratified according to birthweight (&lt; 1000 g; 1001 to 1499 g). Being a surgical intervention, it was not possible to mask the intervention. The statisticians were blinded to the interventions. All infants were followed and they were accounted for at the final evaluation. All the study's prespecified outcomes were reported.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2008</LINK> trial, infants were randomised to receive primary peritoneal drainage or laparotomy by weighted minimisation. Minimisation criteria used were: weight at enrolment (&lt; 800 g, 800 to 1000 g), gestational age (&#8804; 26 weeks, &gt; 26 weeks), platelet count (&lt; 100,000 or transfused, &#8805; 100,000), mechanical ventilation required (yes, no), inotropic support required (yes, no), facilities for onsite laparotomy (that is ambulance transfer required: yes, no), and geographical location (10 groups). This minimised the chance that patient management differed preoperatively and postoperatively between the allocated groups. The method used to generate the allocation sequence numbers was not clear. Minimisation and allocation were performed centrally, the clinical trials unit at the University of Aberdeen, independent of the trial researchers. Being a surgical intervention it was not possible to mask the intervention. It was not clear if the outcome assessors or the statisticians were blinded to the interventions. Parents of only one infant withdrew consent immediately after randomisation. The authors mentioned that the infant was excluded from the analysis in accordance with the UK Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) guidelines. All other infants received the allocated treatment and were followed up and accounted for at the final evaluation. All the study's prespecified outcomes were reported.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-05-05 12:42:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peritoneal drainage for perforated NEC or SIP is an attractive concept because, if effective, it will avoid exposure to inhalational anaesthesia and laparotomy in critically ill preterm infants. Clinicians and parents would be keen to adopt this approach if it can be proven that peritoneal drainage is as effective as, if not superior to, laparotomy. Hospital and National Health policy makers will also be interested if it can be proven to be a cost effective alternative to laparotomy.</P>
<P>This systematic review found only two trials addressing the issue of peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy. The review did not find major benefits or harms of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy as the initial surgical management. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution because the very small sample size could have easily missed clinically significant differences between the two groups.</P>
<P>The review also demonstrated that in the two trials, 49% (44/90) of the initially drained patients received a subsequent laparotomy; that the risk of subsequent laparotomies (both early and late) was significantly higher in the peritoneal drainage group; and that, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK>), infants &#8804; 1000 g in the peritoneal drainage group took a longer time to achieve full enteral feeds.</P>
<P>A possible explanation for the prolonged time to achieve enteral feeds in the peritoneal drainage group is the continued presence of necrotic gut and associated inflammation resulting in delayed initiation and progression of the enteral feeds. The <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK> trial, which had very few crossovers from peritoneal drainage to laparotomy, showed increased time to full enteral feeds. The <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2008</LINK> trial protocol allowed easy provision of laparotomy, which might have resulted in minimisation of gut related morbidities and hence no differences in the time to achieve full enteral feeds. This was reflected by the fact that nearly 50% of the participants (&#8804; 1000 g) randomised to peritoneal drainage underwent laparotomy within one week in the <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2008</LINK> trial compared to none in the <LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Believers of peritoneal drainage could argue that potential for the avoidance of laparotomy and hence inhalational anaesthesia is an important benefit. On the other hand, advocates of laparotomy may argue that prolongation of time to attain full enteral feeds, by nearly 20 days, carries a significant risk of sepsis and other morbidities. Also, infants undergoing peritoneal drainage are at higher risk of having unplanned laparotomies on an emergency basis (within seven days of peritoneal drainage). Such emergency laparotomies can put infants at higher risk of intra as well as postoperative complications.</P>
<P>Peritoneal drainage allows the necrotic intestines to remain inside the abdomen, causing the release of inflammatory mediators which are known mediators of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Grave-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grave 2007</LINK>). On the other hand, use of general inhalational anaesthesia in extremely preterm infants may result in apoptosis of brain cells resulting in neurodevelopmental delay (<LINK REF="REF-Loepke-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loepke 2008</LINK>). Hence it is highly essential that the published and future RCTs report the long term neurodevelopmental outcomes of the surviving trial participants.</P>
<P>Two previous meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Moss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2001</LINK>: ten retrospective studies; <LINK REF="REF-Sola-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sola 2009</LINK>: five prospective studies) found increased mortality rates for peritoneal drainage versus laparotomy. The incidence of mortality was 62.3% in the peritoneal drainage group versus 35.6% in the laparotomy group (P = 0.0009) in the <LINK REF="REF-Moss-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moss 2001</LINK> meta-analysis. <LINK REF="REF-Sola-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sola 2009</LINK> also found excessive mortality in the peritoneal drainage group (odds ratio (OR) 1.55, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.22, P = 0.02). A large prospective, multicentre observational study by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) involving 156 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants with perforated NEC found that 48 (68%) of the infants in the initial laparotomy group had either died or developed neurodevelopmental impairment compared to 64 (84%) in the initial drain group at 18 to 22 months corrected age (<LINK REF="REF-Blakely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blakely 2006</LINK>). However, the infants receiving peritoneal drainage were more immature and unstable than the infants who received laparotomy. The unadjusted OR for adverse outcomes in the laparotomy group relative to the drain group was substantially less than 1.0 (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86). The risk adjusted OR was also lower in the laparotomy group, but the confidence intervals were wide and hence not statistically significant (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.2). After excluding all the infants who were deemed to be too sick to undergo laparotomy, and adjusting for all the confounders, the re-calculated OR continued to be lower in the laparotomy group but the results were not statistically significant (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.69). Observational studies and their meta analyses suffer from limitations because of multiple inherent biases and confounding factors (<LINK REF="REF-Stroup-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stroup 2000</LINK>). Hence, their results should be interpreted cautiously and usually do not influence clinical practice.</P>
<P>Another issue that needs to be addressed in future RCTs is the preoperative differentiation between perforated NEC and spontaneous intestinal perforation, because SIP is usually a milder entity with better outcomes. However, experts (<LINK REF="REF-Blakely-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blakely 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2008</LINK>) differ on whether such differentiation is possible preoperatively. <LINK REF="STD-Tepas-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tepas 2006</LINK> hypothesised that the acuity of the metabolic derangement is the determinant of the outcome and should dictate the choice of peritoneal drainage or laparotomy. In a retrospective study of 65 very low birth weight infants with suspected gut disruption, they investigated the effects of metabolic derangement and initial surgical care (laparotomy versus peritoneal drainage) on mortality. Metabolic derangement was scaled by assigning one point each for thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, neutropenia, a left shift of segmented neutrophils, hyponatremia, bacteremia or hypotension. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated metabolic derangement to be the best predictor of mortality (OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.41 to 16.13, P = 0.012). Infants with a metabolic derangement receiving peritoneal drainage had a four-fold increase in mortality (OR 4.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 14.29, P = 0.0126). Conversely, those without metabolic derangement and sudden free air who underwent laparotomy had a three-fold increase in mortality (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.69, P = 0.03). Hence, they proposed that peritoneal drainage should be considered in infants without metabolic derangement, and laparotomy considered for those with metabolic derangement. Along similar lines, <LINK REF="REF-Cass-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cass 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rovin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rovin 1999</LINK> also reported positive outcomes of peritoneal drainage for infants with SIP (that is those without metabolic derangement) but not for those with NEC. <LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2007</LINK> expressed a similar opinion after a review of the available literature. Since both the RCTs in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Moss-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moss 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rees-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rees 2008</LINK>) did not stratify the intervention based on the primary diagnosis, that is SIP versus NEC, this logical hypothesis remains unanswered.</P>
<P>In summary, this Cochrane review found a very limited number of RCTs addressing this clinically important question, necessitating the need for further trials. Future RCTs will need to consider stratifying the infants based on the preoperative diagnosis (isolated SIP versus perforated NEC). If such differentiation is deemed difficult, the stratification could be based on objective criteria such as the presence or absence of metabolic derangement. The long term follow up of the participants from published and future RCTs is very important to find out if the type of initial surgical intervention affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. In addition, costs and cost effectiveness of peritoneal drainage over laparotomy also needs to be addressed.</P>
