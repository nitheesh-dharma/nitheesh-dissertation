<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-01 09:46:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pressure ulcers (also called bed sores, decubitus ulcers or pressure sores) are sores on the skin caused by pressure or rubbing. They usually affect immobile people on the bony parts of their bodies such as hips, heels and elbows, and take a long time to heal. Electromagnetic therapy is not a form of radiation or heating, but uses an electromagnetic field with the aim of stimulating healing. However, the review of trials concluded that there is no strong evidence that electromagnetic therapy helps or hinders healing of pressure ulcers.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-01 09:45:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified no new trials for this update.Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), involving 60 participants, at unclear risk of bias were included in the original review. Both trials compared the use of EMT with sham EMT, although one of the trials included a third arm in which only standard therapy was applied. Neither study found a statistically significant difference in complete healing in people treated with EMT compared with those in the control group. In one trial that assessed percentage reduction in wound surface area, the difference between the two groups was reported to be statistically significant in favour of EMT. However, this result should be interpreted with caution as this is a small study and this finding may be due to chance. Additionally, the outcome, percentage reduction in wound area, is less clinically meaningful than complete healing.</P>

<P>The results provide no strong evidence of benefit in using EMT to treat pressure ulcers.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-08-19 14:21:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-08-19 14:21:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) and National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP), a pressure ulcer (also known as bed sore, bed ulcer, decubitus ulcer or pressure sore) is "an area of localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear" (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002d_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP-NPUAP 2009</LINK>). Pressure ulcers usually develop on skin that covers bony areas such as the sacrum, heels, hips and elbows. Most often the ulcers develop in immobile elderly people (for example, elderly orthopaedic patients), patients with severe, acute illnesses (such as in people in intensive care units) and in people with neurological problems (for example, those with spinal cord injuries).</P>
<P>One cross-sectional European study involving five countries found that the overall prevalence of pressure ulcers was approximately 18% of hospital patients (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK>). In the UK, pressure ulcers have been recorded in 5% to 32% of patients admitted to a District General Hospital (the precise rate depends on case-mix), and in 4% to 7% of patients in community settings (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2001</LINK>). These ulcers represent a major burden of sickness and reduce quality of life for patients and their carers. There is also a considerable cost both to the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 1994</LINK>) and the health service (<LINK REF="REF-Touche-Ross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touche Ross 1993</LINK>). The annual treatment cost of pressure ulcers has been estimated to range from £1.4 to 2.1 billion, or 4% of total healthcare expenditure in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers present as a continuum of tissue damage from unbroken skin with sustained redness after the release of pressure (non-blanching erythema) to destruction of the muscle and bone.</P>
<P>The treatment of pressure ulcers has four main elements:</P>
<OL>
<LI>local treatment of wounds using wound dressings and other topical applications;</LI>
<LI>pressure relief using beds, mattresses or cushions, and repositioning of the patient;</LI>
<LI>treatment of concurrent conditions that may delay healing, e.g. poor nutrition and infection; and</LI>
<LI>use of physical therapies, such as electrical stimulation, ultrasound and laser therapy.</LI>
</OL>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-08-19 14:17:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recently there has been an increasing interest in the therapeutic use of electromagnetic fields for various medical conditions, including pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Markov-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markov 2007</LINK>). Electromagnetic therapy (EMT), also known as electromagnetism, bioelectricity, magneto biology, magnetic healing and magnetic field therapy, uses electromagnetic energy applied to the body to treat various medical conditions, from bone and cartilage repair (<LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ryaby-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryaby 1998</LINK>) to pain relief (<LINK REF="REF-Shupak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shupak 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2007</LINK>), wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenkre-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenkre 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stiller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiller 1992</LINK>) and relatively new applications such as chronic musculoskeletal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2007</LINK>). EMT does not use direct electrical effects or radiation, unlike other forms of electrotherapy, but induces a field effect (<LINK REF="REF-Stiller-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stiller 1992</LINK>). A number of devices (e.g. Diapulse®, SoffPulse®, Pulsatron®) have been constructed to deliver a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) in the radio frequency band. The frequency of short-wavelength radio waves ranges from 10 to 100 MHz and the frequency commonly used in EMT is 27.12 MHz.</P>
<P>PEMFs are produced with an "on-off" effect of pulsing current to produce effects which, it has been suggested, influence many biological processes, and thus may be useful for wound healing. The main advantage of PEMF compared with continuous fields is that the short duration of the pulses protects the tissues against potential damage from heat generated by continuous fields (<LINK REF="REF-Athanasiou-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Athanasiou 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitchen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchen 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-08-19 14:17:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several theories that explain how the PEMF may exert its effect on tissue generation and cell proliferation in wound healing. <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK> suggested that PEMF might facilitate the migration of electrically charged cells involved in repairing the wound area, thereby restoring the metabolic conditions of the healing cells. It has also been proposed that PEMF induces a tiny electrical signal on the injured cell membrane, which initiates a series of physiological effects that include an increase in the number of macrophages and fibroblasts present in the wound, a reduction of the inflammation and an increased deposition of collagen and fibrin, all of which contribute to the healing process (<LINK REF="REF-Markoll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markoll 2003</LINK>). Other theories suggest that PEMF is associated with the production of free radicals within cells, which mediate intracellular communication (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2007</LINK>). PEMF may exert several biological processes involved in wound healing, but the exact mechanism is not clear.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-05-05 15:39:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several anecdotal reports of the beneficial effects of EMT for chronic skin wounds, despite the lack of standardisation of the PEMF devices in terms of type, duration, frequency, intensity and length of exposure. A systematic review to assess the available evidence for EMT on pressure ulcers was warranted.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As recommended by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we assessed the following methodological domains:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation - was the method used to generate the allocation sequence appropriate to produce comparable groups?</LI>
<LI>Allocation sequence concealment - was the method used to conceal the allocation sequence appropriate to prevent the allocation being known in advance of, or during, enrolment?</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors - were measures used to blind study participants, personnel and outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received?</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data - how complete were the outcome data for the primary outcomes? Were drop-out rates and reasons for withdrawal reported? Were missing data imputed appropriately? We considered an overall completion rate of 80% or higher as having a low risk of bias.</LI>
<LI>Selective outcome reporting - were appropriate outcomes reported and were any key outcomes missing?</LI>
<LI>Other potential threats to validity (considering external validity, e.g. relevant use of co-interventions) - what was the funding source of each of the studies?</LI>
</UL>
<P>We explicitly judged each of these criteria using the following system: Yes (i.e. low risk of bias); No (i.e. high risk of bias); and Unclear (i.e. either lack of information, or uncertainty over the potential for bias).</P>

<P>Two studies of EMT for the treatment of pressure ulcers, involving a total of 60 people, are included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>). The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>) was conducted in a social care unit in Bucharest, Romania. This study was a three-arm study; EMT (plus standard therapy), sham EMT (plus standard therapy) and standard therapy alone. The treatment and follow up was over a two to eight-week period. A total of 30 people were recruited: 17 female and 13 male, aged from 60 to 84 years, with Satge II (16 participants) and Stage III (14 participants) pressure ulcers (the grading system used was not described). Participants were described as randomly allocated to one of the three groups. Twenty people received EMT (Diapulse®) therapy plus standard therapy; five received sham EMT (Diapulse®) therapy plus standard therapy; and five received standard therapy alone. The EMT therapy involved local application of electromagnetic field at a frequency of 600 pulses per second, peak power 6 (117 V, 27.12 MHz). Treatment was given for 30 minutes, twice a day. The standard therapy involved cleansing with hydrogen peroxide and local application of talcum powder, methylene-blue in solution and antibiotic ointment (tetracycline). The outcome assessed was the percentage of ulcers healed within two to eight weeks.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>) compared EMT with sham EMT over a 12-week period or until healing (if this was shorter than 12 weeks). The participants were volunteers admitted to a Veterans' Administration Hospital in New York and consisted of 30 male hospital inpatients with spinal cord injuries (20 with Stage II and 10 with Stage III pressure ulcers). The treatment with an electromagnetic field provided a radio frequency of 27.2 MHz and a pulse repetition rate of 80 to 600 pulses per second. This study also gave treatment for 30 minutes twice a day. A clear definition of the grading of the ulcers was provided by the authors: Stage II ulcers were defined as a partial-thickness skin loss involving epidermis or dermis, superificial and clinically presenting as a deep crater, abrasion, blister or shallow crater; while Stage III were defined as full-thickness skin loss involving damage or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue extending down to, but not through, underlying fascia, clinically presented as a deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissue. The outcomes assessed were time to complete healing, percent change in ulcer area and proportion of ulcers healed.</P>

<BLINDING MODIFIED="2012-09-21 08:49:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In judging the risk of bias for this item, we considered how subjective or objective an outcome is. There are particular risks of bias with more subjective outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The two trials were judged to have unclear risk of bias for blinding. Both described how patients and investigators were blinded to EMT and sham EMT therapy but did not provide information on the blinding of the outcome assessors. In wound trials assessment of treatment outcome, namely reduction in surface area, involves an element of subjectivity (for example in judging where the wound edge lies), therefore it is important that outcome assessors are blinded.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Proportions of ulcers healed</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared EMT with sham EMT, although the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK> included a third arm in which only standard therapy was applied.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK> trial, 17 out of 20 (85%) ulcers in the EMT group achieved complete healing within the duration of treatment compared with no ulcers healing in either of the other two groups (five ulcers in each); the risk ratio (RR) was 10.00 (95% CI 0.70 to 143.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). The difference between the groups was statistically not significant.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK> trial, at one week three out of 10 (30%) Stage II pressure ulcers and three out of five (60%) Stage III pressure ulcers in the EMT group had healed, compared with none in the sham EMT group (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 120.16) and (RR 7.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 108.26) respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). The pooled RR for Stage II and III was 7.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 50.38) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results from these two studies do not indicate a statistically significant treatment effect associated with EMT in healing pressure ulcers, however there is a great deal of uncertainty as there are only two small studies, both at unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>We did not combine the results of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>) because of the different treatment durations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Change in ulcer area</HEADING>
<P>Change in ulcer area was not assessed in <LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>, the overall change in ulcer area was presented in the discussion section of the paper. The ulcer area reduction at one week was 77% (SD = 21%) in the EMT group and 40% (SD = 28%) in the sham EMT group. The mean percent difference in area reduction between the two groups was statistically significantly greater in the EMT group (RR 37%, 95% CI 17.36 to 56.64) (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). However, this result should be interpreted with caution for two reasons; firstly, this is a small study and there is a possibility that this finding may be due to chance differences in prognostic variables. The randomisation process did not provide for an even distribution of large pressure ulcers between the two groups with the sham EMT group having larger ulcers than the EMT group. In general, a change in area or volume would give a larger percentage reduction for a smaller ulcer than for a bigger ulcer. Subsequently, this would favour the EMT group as it has the smallest median wound size at baseline for stage II ulcers (baseline values for stage III ulcers were not provided). Secondly, the risk of bias due to generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment and blinding of the outcome assessor was assessed as 'unclear' due to poor reporting.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time to complete healing</HEADING>
<P>Time to complete healing was reported only for the EMT group in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>). Healing in Stage II ulcers was achieved between one and four weeks (mean 3.28 weeks), while for Stage III ulcers healing time was between two and eight weeks (mean = 4.87). In <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>, the median time to complete healing was 13 days for the EMT group, compared with 31.5 days for the sham EMT group (P value &lt; 0.001). However, the results of these two studies could not be combined as measures of variance were not reported. Furthermore baseline imbalances for wound area in <LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK> introduce bias for this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Secondary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes, namely costs, quality of life, pain and acceptability of treatment were not assessed in either trial.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-10-01 10:55:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no strong evidence from two small trials that EMT speeds pressure ulcer healing. Both trials contained small numbers of patients and used different regimens of treatment over different time scales. There was evidence from one trial showing that the EMT group achieved more reduction in wound area than the sham EMT group. However, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. The result was based on data from a trial with a moderate risk of bias in which randomisation sequence, concealment allocation and blinding of outcome assessor were unclear.</P>
<P>The extent to which EMT contributes to healing in patients who are also receiving pressure relief and moist wound healing strategies should be explored. The included trials, particularly <LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>, did not report severity of pressure ulcers and baseline comparisons adequately. Consequently, the results should be viewed as unreliable until further research involving larger numbers of patients that can be considered alongside these trials becomes available.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-04-26 18:06:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no reliable evidence of benefit for EMT in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The small number of trials available for analysis (both with methodological limitations and small numbers of participants) means that the possibility of benefit, or harm, of this treatment cannot be ruled out.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-08-19 14:20:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials comparing EMT with sham therapy, or standard care, are required to establish whether or not EMT improves the healing of pressure ulcers. In addition, future trials should explore whether particular subgroups of participants are more likely than others to benefit from treatment with EMT and, if the treatment is shown to be effective, to establish the point in a treatment regimen at which it should be applied.</P>
<P>Both studies summarised in this review were small and had methodological problems. Future trials will require:</P>
<OL>
<LI>participant numbers that ensure sufficient statistical power to detect true treatment effects;</LI>
<LI>use of true randomisation with allocation concealment (e.g. telephone randomisation, computer-generated codes);</LI>
<LI>measures to help ensure comparability of treatments at baseline (e.g. stratification for ulcer size);</LI>
<LI>blinded outcome assessment;</LI>
<LI>use of objective outcome measurement (e.g. ulcer area, complete healing rates); and</LI>
<LI>use of intention-to-treat analysis.</LI>
</OL>
<P>It is also recommended that studies should clearly describe the frequency and duration of treatment, location of wounds and any treatment(s) applied concurrently with the EMT.</P>
<P>Randomised controlled trials should be adequately reported. The CONSORT 2010 statement (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>) lists 25 items that need to be reported to show readers whether or not a trial is likely to produce valid and reliable results. Further research into the relationship of EMT and pressure ulcer healing needs to be reported in accordance with these guidelines.</P>

<P>Your review analyzed two papers:</P>
<P>1. The effects of Diapulse Therapy on the healing of decubitus ulcers. Comoroson S, et al, Romanian Journal of Physiology;1993, 30, 41-5.<BR/>2. The effects of pulsed EM (Diapulse) on wound healing of pressure ulcers in the spinal cord injured patients. Salzberg CA. et al, Wounds, 1995; 7,1, 11-16</P>
<P>The reviewer's conclusions: "Neither study found a statistically significant difference between the healing rates of electromagnetic therapy treated and control group patients. The results suggest no evidence of a benefit in using electromagnetic therapy to treat pressure ulcers."</P>
<P>This conclusion can not be correct.</P>
<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Comorosan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Comorosan 1993</LINK>) I performed, and the results did in fact prove that Diapulse was a benefit in treating pressure ulcers. The study was performed in accordance with the main request of the statistical studies: randomized groups and double blind assessments. Moreover, it refers to a placebo group, compared to a control (conventional treatment) and an experimental one (Diapulse and Conventional). After controlling the patients' baseline, the null hypothesis is implicitly assumed: there will be no statistically significant difference in the healing rates of patients receiving Diapulse therapy and those who receive placebo treatment. Evaluation of the healing process is basically a qualitative medical assessment. Apart from size, no other quantitative (reliable) parameters are available. Granulation percentage and epithelialization percentage were used to establish the classic scale of the healing process: excellent (healed), very good (75-95% healed), good (50-75% healed), fair (25-50% healed), poor (less than 25% healed) and no improvement.</P>
<P>The results showed:<BR/>*In the conventional treatment group of 5 patients, 4 were rated unhealed and 1 less than 25%.<BR/>*In the conventional treatment and placebo Diapulse group of 5 patients, all were rated unhealed.<BR/>*In the Diapulse treated group of 20 patients, 18 were rated healed and 2 between 75-95%.</P>
<P>20 cases healed versus 10 unhealed, and the reviewers statement that there is not a significant difference and no evidence of benefit from the electromagnetic therapy as one can see, is completely false and misleading.</P>
<P>I suggest you re-read the study, and correct the assumptions that are clearly ignoring clear-cut evidence. Based on the fact that an evaluation was made after 5 weeks for the untreated Diapulse group and only 3 weeks for the Diapulse treated group, there was significant benefit for the treated group.</P>
<P>In the second published study (<LINK REF="STD-Salzberg-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salzberg 1995</LINK>), the authors concluded that, "Diapulse treatment significantly improved healing." Strong evidence of 30 spinal cord injured patients, treated successfully with Diapulse therapy is presented, again in a randomized double-blind study. The baseline comparison of active Diapulse treatment versus placebo included each ulcer's area, granulation percentage and epithelialization percentage and was assessed by P-value, based on Mann-Whitney U tests. The authors used chi-square statistics for categorical variables and t-test for normal distribution. For the entire group of 30 participants (20 stage II and 10 stage III), a clear acceleration of wound healing was recorded.</P>
<P>After controlling the size, granulation and epithelialization, Diapulse treatment was found to be independently associated with percent healed at one week (P = .002) and days to 100% healing (P = 0.007).</P>
<P>Somehow these data were ignored. Average percentage healing achieved at one week was 77% in the treated group (standard deviation of 21%) versus 40% in the control group (standard deviation of 28%). This translates into an advantage of 3 to 1 for the active Diapulse treated group. Again, ignoring this strong evidence, it was considered devoid of statistical significance and judged to be without therapeutic merit.</P>

<P>Clinical decision making should give due weight to the research evidence, and that weight is determined by the volume and validity of the research. The validity of a study is the extent to which its design and conduct are likely to prevent systematic errors or bias (Moher et al, 1995). The criteria by which we assessed the validity of the primary research studies were pre-determined and peer reviewed, and are also internationally accepted as important criteria by which to judge studies which aim to evaluate the clinical effects of interventions. It is only by making rigorous, systematic assessment of the primary studies using criteria which have been determined a priori, and peer reviewed, that we can minimise biases in the review process and be sure of identifying biases in the primary research which may lead to invalid study results.</P>
<P>Generally, Cochrane Reviews tend to use the following broad criteria when assessing the internal validity of primary research studies (usually RCTs):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Protection against selection bias. An unpredictable allocation sequence must be generated e.g. by computer algorithm, and then this sequence must be concealed from investigators who are enrolling patients. Knowledge of impending assignments can cause selective enrolment of patients based on prognostic factors (Schulz et al). We therefore look to the trial report, and try to contact investigators possible, to satisfy ourselves that there was true randomisation with allocation concealment. We also look for evidence that the randomisation was successful in providing treatment groups which are balanced for important prognostic variables (particularly baseline wound size in wound care studies, since wound size is known to predict time to heal).</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Protection against performance and detection bias. Performance bias occurs if any additional therapeutic interventions are provided to one of the comparison groups. Blinding of patients and care providers helps prevent this kind of bias as well as reducing the chance of differences in placebo responses between the groups. Detection bias may arise if knowledge of the patient assignment can influence the measure of outcome.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Protection against attrition bias. Protocol deviations and loss to follow up may lead to exclusion of patients after they have been allocated to treatment groups. Such 'lost' patients are unlikely to be representative of all patients in a study as is also the case with patients who do not 'adhere' to the treatment. All patients should be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised on an 'intention-to-treat' principle, so maintaining the randomisation and avoiding selection bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>I would like to address our assessment of the internal validity of each of the papers in this review separately.</P>
<P>Comorosan et al. The effect of Diapulse therapy on the healing of decubitus pressure sores. Romanian Journal of Physiotherapy 1993,30,41-5.</P>
<P>Allocation to the three treatment groups in this study was described as randomised, however, we always look for a report of how this randomisation was achieved in order to satisfy ourselves that selection bias was avoided. There was no such description nor explanation of why there were 20 patients in the treatment group and five patients in each of the other therapy groups (obviously having unequal treatment groups is a potentially valid approach but the allocation must be by a random process). The lack of a description of the process of allocation also meant that we were unable to ascertain the degree of allocation concealment - which also protects against selection bias (see above). However if you can provide us with information we will happily consider it.</P>
<P>During our validity assessment we also look for evidence of successful randomisation demonstrated by treatment groups which are balanced at baseline for important prognostic factors such as wound size. Balanced allocation is frequently not achieved in studies as small as this. Tests for 'significant' differences are unhelpful in detecting baseline differences since a) they are underpowered, and b) any differences have by definition arisen by chance if the patients were randomised. Whilst you did not report the average baseline wound area in your paper, your recent correspondence has just prompted us to calculate it from Tables 2, 3 and 4 in your paper. The median baseline ulcer area in the conventional treatment group was 3.9 cm<SUP>2</SUP>, 9 cm<SUP>2</SUP> for the placebo treatment group, and 3.8 cm<SUP>2</SUP> for the electromagnetic treatment group. This baseline difference biases the evaluation in favour of the electromagnetic treatment group. Percentage reduction in wound area is a measure that is itself biased in favour of the treatment group with the smallest average wound size at baseline (since a change in area or volume will be a larger percentage of a smaller wound than a bigger wound), whereas actual changes in size bias towards larger wounds. Time to complete wound healing is also a measure which would bias the study in favour of the active treatment group since smaller wounds take longer to heal. The baseline inequalities in this study were not adjusted for in the analysis.</P>
<P>Turning now to the possibility of performance and detection bias in this study, whilst clinicians and technicians were reportedly blinded to Diapulse and sham Diapulse therapy, it would not have been possible to blind to the third therapy. Furthermore you do not state who measured outcome (was it "the clinician"? Was there only one?). We are sure you are aware of the biases that can occur due to lack of blinding. One of our major concerns with regard to detection bias is the lack of information reported on outcome assessment. When an outcome relies on the judgement of a clinician (the primary outcome of this study was described as a "qualitative medical assessment") and that clinician is aware of the allocation of the patient being assessed then interpretation of the clinical findings may be biased. Qualitative outcome measures such as this are of dubious validity anyway, especially when wound healing is relatively easy to measure objectively (by measuring time to complete healing or serial measures of wound size). In our opinion a better approach would be to present the actual reduction in area for each group along with confidence intervals to allow interpretation of the differences in healing and the associated precision.</P>
<P>We would welcome any information that might give us further clarity on how the outcome assessment was undertaken. Incidentally we are even more confused now given that your letter states that the evaluation was made after five weeks for the untreated Diapulse group and only three weeks for the Diapulse treated group. How could these assessments have been made at different times if the assessor was blinded? Why does the published paper state in the Abstract that there was is a maximum two-week treatment period; but in Tables 2, 3 and 4 that the duration of treatment was variously one, two, three, four, five, six and eight weeks!</P>
<P>From your data we calculated the relative risk (RR) for healing with Diapulse therapy. The Cochrane Collaboration recommends that RRs are produced for dichotomous data whenever the event rate is greater than 30%. As you will be aware from reading the review the RR for healing in your trial was 10 (95% CI 0.7 to 143.7). Whilst the result of this seems to favour the use of Diapulse therapy to heal pressure ulcers, the wide confidence intervals, which include 1, indicate a lack of statistical significance. Unfortunately your trial was extremely small, resulting in a lack of statistical power to detect a clinically important treatment effect as statistically significant (the result for the main comparison are consistent with a RR anywhere between 0.7, i.e. in favour of conventional treatment, to 143.7 in favour of electromagnetic therapy). This together with the baseline difference in wound area means that whilst there may be a real treatment effect your trial does not provide convincing evidence of it.</P>
<P>Salzberg CA et al. The effects of non-thermal pulsed electromagnetic energy (Diapulse) on wound healing of pressure sores in spinal cord injured patients: A randomised double blind study. Wounds 1995; 7:1 11-16.</P>
<P>We were unable to obtain assurance of random sequence generation or allocation concealment from Salzberg's written report. The allocation process for people with Stage II ulcers did not result in a balanced allocation between the two treatment groups although this was corrected for in the analysis (whilst the statistical tests for differences were not significant the differences are not unimportant). The low power of the study, again due to low sample size, is compounded by the separation of Stage II and Stage III patients which is, in effect, a subgroup analysis. Such subgroup analyses should be pre-planned, and in this case it is severely underpowered, but is the basis of the "statistically significant" difference in the original report. No baseline data were provided for patients with Stage III pressure ulcers, therefore we were unable to judge the success of the randomisation. However, these patients account for 33% of the patients in the study and they are effectively lost from the overall analysis. Readers cannot exclude chance or bias as possible causes of the treatment difference. We calculated the RR of healing for people with Stage III pressure ulcers as 7 (95% CI 0.45 to 108.26). Whilst this result is in the direction of benefit from Diapulse, there is no statistically significant difference.</P>
<P>The substantial questions about the internal validity of the two studies reviewed, and the small size of these studies, means that whilst both studies show results in the same qualitative direction (that of benefit of electromagnetic therapy), it would have been wrong to draw the conclusion that this is an effective treatment. This is clearly an important area for future high-quality research. Such research should involve sufficient numbers of patients to ensure a realistic chance of detecting important treatment effects, and should avoid the threats to validity so frequently observed in wound care trials. We would also urge that any further studies follow the internationally respected CONSORT statement for the reporting of RCTs.</P>
<P>As I am sure you are aware, the systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Collaboration use an internationally agreed process, which includes pre-publication peer review of the review protocol and the finished review, and open peer review of the review at any time after publication. This peer review did not identify similar concerns to yours. I am afraid we are unable to change the conclusions of the Cochrane Review as requested.</P>
