<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-07-15 04:01:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no evidence of benefit from corticosteroids for acute ischaemic stroke. Stroke from blockage of an artery to a part of the brain causes swelling of that part of the brain. The swelling produces pressure effects, may cause additional brain cells to die, or delays the recovery of damaged but recoverable brain cells. Reduction of this swelling may relieve pressure on adjacent parts of the brain, reduce the number of brain cells that are killed and allow better recovery of damaged brain cells. Corticosteroids have been used to reduce this brain swelling in order to help limit damage and speed recovery. However, from the small and inadequate amount of evidence available from eight trials involving 466 participants, this review found no benefit of corticosteroids on reducing the number of deaths or improving functional outcome in survivors.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-04 11:27:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The majority of strokes are due to cerebral infarction. Ischaemic cerebral tissue tends to develop cytotoxic oedema which, if the blood-brain barrier is disrupted, may be followed by vasogenic oedema. Large infarcts can develop life-threatening massive oedema. Early treatment with corticosteroids could theoretically help reduce both cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema and so improve the clinical outcome after a stroke.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-15 04:10:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cerebral oedema can cause clinical deterioration and death after ischaemic stroke by producing direct pressure and vascular occlusive effects, as well as indirect effects through vasospasm and necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Battistini-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battistini 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes 2005</LINK>). Massive cerebral oedema following a large hemispheric infarction can lead to transtentorial herniation and death, but in appropriately selected younger patients decompressive hemicraniectomy can be life-saving (<LINK REF="REF-Staykov-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staykov 2011</LINK>). Oedema complicating ischaemic stroke therefore remains of considerable potential relevance to acute stroke care. Cerebral oedema may be classified into cytotoxic and vasogenic types where cytotoxic oedema is related to cell membrane dysfunction while vasogenic oedema is related to the breakdown of the function of the blood-brain barrier. Vasogenic cerebral oedema associated with intracranial tumours often responds well to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gomes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomes 2005</LINK>), and though most of the oedema associated with large cerebral infarcts is vasogenic, some of the brain swelling in cerebral infarcts is due to cytotoxic oedema. It is not clear if corticosteroids reduce cytotoxic oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Battistini-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battistini 1981</LINK>). Although studies of their use in acute stroke have been disappointing, some physicians continue to treat stroke with corticosteroids. For example, some 20% of patients with acute ischaemic stroke in the USA in the 1980s, who were involved in the Stroke Data Bank study, were treated with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Faulkes-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faulkes 1988</LINK>). In a survey in China, 19% of physicians reported that they used corticosteroids routinely and 61% said that they used them at times for certain patients (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1997</LINK>). However, there are potentially serious side-effects from the use of corticosteroids.</P>

<P>See the 'Specialized register' section in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/STROKE/frame.html">Cochrane Stroke Group</A> module.</P>
<P>We identified trials in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, which was last searched by the Managing Editor on 17 February 2011.</P>
<P>For the original review, the review authors contacted numerous researchers in an effort to identify unpublished and ongoing studies, and also asked investigators of published trials to provide additional information on cause of death. We have not repeated this exercise for this update.</P>
<P>One new trial meeting the inclusion criteria has been identified for this update.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-07-15 15:36:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>For the original review, two review authors (NQ, SL - see <LINK TAG="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS" TYPE="SECTION">Acknowledgements</LINK>) independently selected the trials for inclusion.</P>
<P>For this update, we independently agreed that one additional study was eligible for inclusion. We re-assessed the methodological quality of each study for this update. We did not use a scoring system to assess quality but noted the following details: randomisation method, blinding, whether intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were documented and possible from the published data, and the number of patients lost to follow-up. We independently extracted and cross-checked the data, and discussed discrepancies. We sought data on the number of patients with each outcome measure (where available) by allocated treatment group. To allow an ITT analysis, we sought the data irrespective of compliance, and whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. We also sought data on whether or not CT scanning was performed prior to randomisation.</P>
<P>For the original review, if any of the above data were not available in the publications, the review authors requested further information through correspondence with the trialists. Where no further information was obtained, the results from the 'on-treatment' analysis were used, based on the data extractable from the publication. Due to the age of many of the studies, data regarding disability were difficult to obtain. Where data were not available about the type of stroke and cause of death, these were sought by the original review authors from the trialists. For this update, we did not seek to contact any of the trialists.</P>
<P>For the original review both proportional and absolute risk reductions were calculated for each outcome. A test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between the trials was made using a standard Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. The typical treatment effect across trials, the 'typical odds ratio (OR)' (that is the odds of an unfavourable outcome amongst treatment-allocated patients to the corresponding odds amongst controls), was calculated using the Peto OR method.</P>

<P>See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. We identified 24 trials from the search of the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register of which eight fulfilled the entry criteria. We did not identify any ongoing trials. All included trials used dexamethasone except two, which used betamethasone. Four trials compared dexamethasone with an unspecified placebo, two trials compared dexamethasone with placebo water, one trial compared betamethasone with vitamin C and one trial compared betamethasone with an unspecified placebo.</P>
<P>The mean age of the patients in the trials, where it was quoted, ranged from 66 years to 75 years. Approximately half the patients were male. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1986</LINK>) used CT scanning to exclude haemorrhage. The severity of stroke as judged by overall case fatality ranged from 7% to 79%, though this assessment is confounded with duration of follow-up. Only three trials had follow-up beyond one month: three months for <LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1978</LINK>, and 12 months for <LINK REF="STD-Mulley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mulley 1978</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ogun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ogun 2001</LINK>. The timing of treatment from onset of stroke was within 24 hours for four trials, 48 hours for three trials and not specified for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-McQueen-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McQueen 1978</LINK>). Only two trials used a measure of functional disability (<LINK REF="STD-Mulley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mulley 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ogun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ogun 2001</LINK>), the remainder used neurological impairment scales.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2011-07-15 04:28:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The total number of individuals included in the eight trials was 466. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. The eight trials showed a non-significant decrease in the odds of death (within one year) of 0.87 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.34). Only one small trial reported a marginal statistically significant hazard in the odds of death and all other trials were statistically non-significant. There was no evidence that the effect on deaths within one month (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.47) was substantially different from the effect on deaths within one year. The results of the trials that used betamethasone did not substantially differ from those using dexamethasone.</P>
<P>We could not do analysis by cause of death since we did not receive appropriate data from the trial investigators.</P>
<P>Six trials reported neurological impairment scales but pooling these data was impossible because no common scale nor time interval was used. Four trials reported no difference in neurological impairment, one reported a statistically significant benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Patten-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Patten 1972</LINK>) and one reported a statistically significant worsening (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1976</LINK>). The only trials to report functional disability found a non-significant difference at 12 months. Mulley et al found full independence in 10 survivors in the dexamethasone group and eight in the placebo group; for severe disability the figures were four in the dexamethasone group and three in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Mulley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mulley 1978</LINK>). Ogun et al found of the three survivors in the dexamethasone group two were ambulant and one was chair bound, whilst in the placebo group the two survivors were bed bound and chair bound (<LINK REF="STD-Ogun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ogun 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one of the eight trials reported non-fatal adverse effects in a systematic manner (<LINK REF="STD-Norris-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1986</LINK>); there were generally few adverse events and these were limited to gastrointestinal bleeding, infection and hyperglycaemia. Diabetes or its worsening was reported to be more frequent in the treatment group in three trials (12 versus 0). Infection was more frequent in the treatment group in two trials (4 versus 0) but less frequent in one trial (0 versus 4). Gastrointestinal bleeding was reported as being more frequent in the treatment group in three trials (7 versus 4) but less frequent in one trial (0 versus 3). <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1986</LINK> reported withdrawals from adverse events as follows (treatment versus control): gastrointestinal bleeding (3 versus 2), infection (0 versus 4), worsening hyperglycaemia (4 versus 0).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-07-15 04:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review do not support the hypothesis that intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids reduce all-cause case fatality following stroke. However, the small number of patients and events in the trials mean that there is great imprecision and that this treatment could increase the odds of death by as much as 34%, or reduce it by as much as 43% (95% CI). Few patients had the diagnosis of ischaemic stroke confirmed by a CT scan, and it is conceivable that the results were influenced by the inclusion of haemorrhagic strokes. It is possible that the relative treatment effects of corticosteroids may vary between patients with differing levels of absolute risk. Although the evidence is limited, the present review would be compatible with the notion that corticosteroids are beneficial in high-risk patients with large infarcts and much vasogenic oedema (<LINK REF="STD-Mulley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mulley 1978</LINK>), and either ineffective or harmful among low-risk patients with smaller infarcts and less vasogenic oedema. Two trials with higher case-fatality rates in the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Mulley-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mulley 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Norris-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Norris 1986</LINK>) both reported trends (statistically non-significant) in favour of treatment. However, one other trial with a higher case-fatality rate did not favour treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ogun-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ogun 2001</LINK>). There was no significant heterogeneity of results from the different trials, nor was there any evidence to suggest bias from selective reporting of trials based on the results. The point estimates of the ORs for the different trials were evenly spread around the pooled point estimate.</P>
<P>In general, neither neurological nor functional outcome was any better in those patients who survived. Treating severe disability and death as one endpoint (from the one trial that measured functional outcome) made no difference to the conclusion.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of treatment were few (approximately 10%). They were generally more frequent in the treatment group, for infection, worsening hyperglycaemia and gastrointestinal bleeding, as would be expected from the mode of action of corticosteroids. Given the unsystematic manner of reporting adverse events in these trials, there may have been under-reporting as trials of dexamethasone using similar doses in cerebral haemorrhage report much higher adverse event rates in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Poungvarin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Poungvarin 1987</LINK>). Evidence from a much larger-scale trial of high-dose corticosteroids in traumatic brain injury highlights the potential hazards. The MRC CRASH study, a randomised controlled trial of high-dose corticosteroids in over 10,000 patients with acute traumatic brain injury, showed that allocation to corticosteroids was associated with a significant excess of deaths from all causes, and was not associated with any significant reduction in disability in survivors (<LINK REF="REF-CRASH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">CRASH 2005</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-07-04 10:47:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Trials of corticosteroids do not provide evidence of a beneficial effect on death following acute (presumed) ischaemic stroke. Nor do the data on neurological impairment or functional outcome suggest any benefit in survivors. There is, therefore, no evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in the management of acute ischaemic stroke.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Is it possible to compare outcomes between included and certain excluded trials where the latter were excluded on the grounds that they were confounded?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2010-10-06 12:57:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Since non-randomised studies may be biased towards a positive treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), it would introduce a systematic bias into the analysis by comparing outcomes between included studies and those excluded trials which were confounded. Larger scale randomised evidence is required if it is still considered appropriate to further test these drugs.</P>
