<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:15:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The association between low income and poor outcome in all dimensions of child health is strong and consistent across countries and time. Disadvantage in childhood is often associated with lifetime poor outcomes. This review aimed to assess whether additional monies provided to socially or economically disadvantaged families could affect children's health, well-being and educational attainment. Nine studies were identified that met inclusion criteria. There was tentative evidence of benefit in early language development, but given lack of effect on all other outcomes, authors conclude that the evidence did not show an effect on child outcomes in the short to medium term in response to direct financial benefits to families. In the context of the monetary value of interventions observed, and the conditions placed on receipt of benefits, authors conclude this is a statement of "no evidence of effect" rather than "evidence of no effect". Implications for research and practice are noted.</P>

<P>In total, 10 electronic databases were searched, including CENTRAL (searched Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (searched 1966 to May 2006), EconLit (searched 1969 to June 2006) and PsycINFO (searched 1872 to June 2006), together with three libraries of working papers (MDRC, SSRN, SRDC). The general search strategy was [terms for income and financial benefits] and [paediatric terms] and [RCT filter].</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:04:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies selected provided money to relatively poor families (which included a child under the age of 18 or a pregnant woman), were randomised or quasi-randomised, measured outcomes related to child health or well-being and were conducted in a high income country.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:18:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Titles and abstracts identified in the search were independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. Data were extracted and entered into Review Manager software (RevMan), synthesised and presented in both written and graphical form (forest plots).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine trials including more than 25,000 participants were included in this review. No effect was observed on child health, measures of child mental health or emotional state. Non-significant effects favouring the intervention group were seen for child cognitive development and educational achievement, and a non-significant effect favouring controls in rates of teenage pregnancy. </P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:11:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review set out to examine the potential of financial support to poor families to improve circumstances for children. However, on the basis of current evidence we cannot state unequivocally whether financial benefits delivered as an intervention are effective at improving child health or well-being in the short term. Our conclusions are limited by the fact that most of the studies had small effects on total household income and that, while no conditions were attached to how money was spent, all studies included strict conditions for receipt of payments. We note particular concerns by some authors that sanctions and conditions (such as working hours) placed on families may increase family stress.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Within OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries relative poverty is a problem for a significant proportion of families with children. Data on relative poverty show that while the UK and the USA are among the wealthiest nations, they show high rates of relative poverty (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OECD-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">OECD 2006</LINK>). The UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand constitute the small group of OECD countries where inequalities have increased since the 1960s (<LINK REF="REF-Weeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weeks 2005</LINK>). Whilst some data show that the UK, USA and New Zealand began reversing this pattern in the 1990s, overall the proportion of children living in relative poverty has increased (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2005</LINK>). According to US Census figures in 2004, around 17.8% of under 18s were living in households with income below what the US government defines as the poverty threshold (income below the federal poverty level (<LINK REF="REF-DeNavas_x002d_Walt-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeNavas-Walt 2005</LINK>)). Using internationally recognised assessments of relative poverty this figure rises to 21.9% for the USA, second only within OECD countries to Mexico (27.7%), followed by Italy (16.6%), New Zealand (16.3%), Ireland (15.7%), Portugal (15.6%), and the UK (15.4%) (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2005</LINK>). These figures all consider income before housing costs are taken into account, but some consider income after housing costs to be a better estimate of household poverty. In the UK in 2002/3 28% of children lived in households with incomes below fifty percent of the mean after housing costs, giving the UK the fifth highest rate of relative child poverty in the EU (<LINK REF="REF-Bradshaw-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradshaw 2005</LINK>). In contrast to a generation ago, poverty in the UK is now most prevalent in households with children (<LINK REF="REF-Darton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darton 2003</LINK>). Whilst there has been some progress in the UK, the aspirations to end child poverty are unlikely to be met on current predictions (<LINK REF="REF-Hirsch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirsch 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attree's systematic review of qualitative work confirms that from children's own viewpoint, despite their efforts to maximise their resources, many poor children experience a gradual narrowing of their horizons, both socially and economically (<LINK REF="REF-Attree-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Attree 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The WHO commission on the social determinants of health (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2007</LINK>) which was set up to support countries and global health partners to address the social factors leading to ill health and inequities has produced a number of reports touching on this area, including those on early childhood development (<LINK REF="REF-Siddiqi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siddiqi 2007</LINK>) which point out that in every society, inequities in socioeconomic resources result in inequities in early childhood development, and that investment in this area is highlight efficient.</P>
<P>Inequalities in the distribution of resources are known to have marked impacts on child health and wellbeing. A UNICEF report in 2007 which ranked the wellbeing of children in 21 rich countries found both the United States and the United Kingdom well to the bottom of the list (<LINK REF="REF-UNICEF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNICEF 2007</LINK>). Despite the fact that for the most part relative poverty does not severely restrict access to essential resources (water, shelter, food) differences in health and life opportunities are still apparent between the poorest and richest in a wealthy society (<LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2006</LINK>) The impact of relative poverty, even in rich countries, is illustrated by a comparison between infant mortality in urban areas of Kerala, India, with that among African Americans living in Washington DC. Despite far higher national wealth, the infant mortality rate is higher in the USA group (<LINK REF="REF-UNDP-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNDP 2005</LINK>, Chapter 2). In high income countries, relative poverty reduces the life chances of children in many ways (<LINK REF="REF-Acheson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acheson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dearing-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dearing 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petterson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petterson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HM-Treasury-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">HM Treasury 2004</LINK>). Poverty in early life has far reaching consequences, Roberts (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>) points to the "long shadow forward" (p. 1123) cast over physical and emotional health that can result from the experience of living in poverty during childhood. People from the lowest social classes are at increased risk from serious or long-term life-limiting illness. Children from these groups are less likely to meet their full potential in education and are more likely to be unemployed or working in unskilled, poorly paid manual jobs in adult life (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1999</LINK>). Davey-Smith (<LINK REF="REF-Davey_x002d_Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davey-Smith 1999</LINK>) argues that fluctuations in income also impact on health outcomes, with higher mortality rates amongst those who experience reductions in income levels, even if temporary.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:16:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism for the impact of income on child health is not clear, but it would appear that household income is important over and above access to resources. One might suppose that, for example, lack of access to health care would be the key factor limiting the health chances of poor children in the USA. In fact, comparisons of data between USA, Canada and UK suggest that while the universal health care provided by the latter countries may lessen the impact of growing up poor, the association between health and wealth persists (<LINK REF="REF-Case-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Case 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Currie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Currie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2004</LINK>). These data imply that within-country factors may mediate the relationship between health and income. Research from Canada has also found that children from poorer backgrounds are more likely to be diagnosed with mental health problems in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Currie-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Currie 2005</LINK>). Oral health shows similar income gradients, where international studies have shown that children from poorer families have higher rates of dental decay (caries) and poorer oral health than richer children living in the same country (<LINK REF="REF-Petersen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petersen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watt 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:19:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the consistent observation of an association between economic status and health outcomes, this review seeks to answer the question of whether reducing relative poverty through additions to income may have beneficial effects. Income, rather than social support, is at the heart of the interventions explored in this systematic review, which aims to interrogate the evidence to assess the effectiveness of additional money given to poor families in improving child health. 'Health' is interpreted here in its widest sense, incorporating physical and mental health, as well as social wellbeing indicated by factors such as educational attainment.</P>
<P>This review considers evidence of effectiveness in randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials of interventions that provide additional monies to socially and economically disadvantaged families. The history of the use of RCTs in the social sciences is mixed. While experimental methods have a significant history in the social sciences (<LINK REF="REF-Oakley-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oakley 1998</LINK>), they are not universally welcomed. Resistance to the use of trials in social interventions on practical, ethical or political grounds has been documented (<LINK REF="REF-Petticrew-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petticrew 2005</LINK>) and such views have had an impact on the types of studies conducted (for example see <LINK REF="REF-Seethaler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seethaler 2005</LINK>). In addition, some changes (such as universal policy interventions) can be documented only across a cohort as a whole, since an entire population is (or is intended to be) in receipt of such changes. In view of these issues the inclusion of non-randomised trials and other study types was considered by authors and discussed at length with the co-ordinating editor of the review group. The final decision to include only RCTs and quasi-RCTs was informed by a preference for studies with the greatest potential to attribute causality to the intervention, as well as by the constraints of systematically searching for multiple study types in a broad field. Searching only for RCTs resulted in some 16,000 to 20,000 hits. In MEDLINE alone a search that included non RCTs produced &gt; 31,000 hits. While the findings of the review are based on experimental evidence from controlled trials only, it is important to consider other types of study when interpreting the findings of this review.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:39:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Two members of the research team independently assessed the following aspects of study quality for the included studies.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Method of allocation</HEADING>
<P>Allocation (method by which participants are assigned to group) was classified as follows:</P>
<P>(A) Allocation described as adequate if allocation was by a well described randomisation process (e.g. flipping a coin, central randomisation using number tables).<BR/>(B) Allocation described as unclear if the unit of allocation is not described or is not described in sufficient detail to be certain of quality of randomisation.<BR/>(C) Allocation described as inadequate if allocation was undertaken using a non-random method (e.g. by day of the week)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Allocation concealment was assessed as follows:</P>
<P>(A) Allocation described as adequately concealed if allocation was centralised (e.g. allocation by a central office unaware of participant characteristics), used pre-numbered sealed opaque envelopes, generated by computer or other methods not accessible to those in charge of allocation.<BR/>(B) Allocation concealment described as unclear if the method of concealment is not described or is not described in sufficient detail to be certain of concealment<BR/>(C) Allocation concealment described as inadequate if allocation was undertaken by personnel with access to participant characteristics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Loss to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow-up as a percentage of those entering each study group is reported where data are available. When considering loss to follow-up a cut off is often used; for example, a loss of more than 25% of the sample may be judged unacceptable. The position of such a cut off at 25% rather that 30% or 20% is difficult to justify. However, a summary of quality assessment is useful and thus, in addition to actual loss, a description using the following categories is given:</P>
<P>(A) Loss to follow-up considered acceptable if attrition is both similar across intervention groups, and of an acceptable level. We take acceptable loss to follow-up to be no greater than 25% of sample entering intervention, but allow for reviewer judgement (for example up to 30% loss may be acceptable for follow-up of 5+ years, or where populations are highly mobile).<BR/>(B) Loss to follow-up recorded as not reported<BR/>(C) Loss to follow-up recorded as unacceptable if loss is either high (greater than 25% overall noting the possibility of exceptions e.g. highly mobile populations or long term follow-up as described above), or unevenly distributed across groups. Uneven attrition will be further considered in sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>There were no cases where attrition was close to the cut off for acceptability, and therefore reviewer judgement of potential for bias was not required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Blinding of outcome assessment</HEADING>
<P>In the case of psychosocial and service interventions blinding of participants and providers isn't possible and therefore isn't assessed here. Blinding of outcome assessment was reviewed, and judged as follows:</P>
<P>(A) Blinding of outcome assessment was considered adequate if authors state assessor was blind to participant allocation, or outcome assessed by means outside of the study (e.g. school records).<BR/>(B) Blinding of outcome assessment was considered unclear where insufficient information is provided to judge blinding.<BR/>(C) Blinding of outcome assessment was considered inadequate where assessors are likely to know the group allocation of participants.</P>
<P>In studies with multiple outcomes, blinding on each outcome is discussed in the study description below.</P>
<P>Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and first authors contacted for clarification in the case of unclear methods.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:05:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Characteristics of included studies are shown in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>In total, 63 studies were excluded (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Most were excluded because the intervention did not meet inclusion criteria or because child outcomes were not included. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jagannathan-FDP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jagannathan FDP 2005</LINK>) included an intervention of interest, but was excluded because the only outcome reported was child involvement with child welfare services (such as fostering services). It was judged by the review group that since it was not possible to identify a desirable direction of effect this study would be excluded. The same was held to be true of household changes where they were reported. Moving house or being taken into foster care could be beneficial (e.g. where the move is to better circumstances or where children are at risk in home environment) but they may also be harmful, for example the result of homelessness. Without further long term data it was judged unwise to incorporate these outcomes.</P>
<P>One other study was excluded after consultation among reviewers as to whether it was within the scope of the review or not. <LINK REF="STD-Bos-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bos 1997</LINK> reports on a trial of cash incentives given to teenage parents in return for attending school. After some discussion it was decided that this study was excluded because outcomes for the children of these parents were not recorded, only school attendance for the parents themselves. Similarly we also discussed grants and incentives given to young people in return for school attendance (such as the UK Education Maintenance Allowance see also excluded studies <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 1995</LINK>), and decided these were excluded because they did not change family income, but rather the child's expendible income.</P>
<P>In addition four publications were considered for inclusion but rejected on the basis of group assignment. These papers all referred to the well known Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance experiments, where the Conlisk-Watts method of allocation was used. This method is designed to produce unbiased estimates of effect by modelling of the data to account for differences at baseline produced by the selection and allocation procedures. The authors excluded these studies from the review on the basis that the consensus is that this method uses non-random allocation (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keeley-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keeley 1980</LINK>). Moreover, the modelling needed to produce unbiased estimates makes comparison with RCTs inherently difficult. However since these studies are well known and are likely to be considered relevant to this review brief details from these studies are included in additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Nine studies were identified, with more than 19 associated publications. Only those publications which include extracted methods or outcome data are referenced here.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Population location</HEADING>
<P>Eight studies were based in the USA (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK> in Delaware, <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> in Iowa, <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> in Minnesota, Huston 2006 in Wisconsin, <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK> in Connecticut, <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK> in Denver, Colorado, <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>, in Florida and <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) and one in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> in British Columbia and New Brunswick).</P>
<P>All studies except <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK> were multi-site and included a mix of rural, urban and sub-urban samples.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK> recruited young women (&lt;18 years) with a child younger than 5 months. All other studies recruited welfare recipients or applicants.</P>
<P>Three studies recruited single-parent samples, and these samples were largely female (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK> single parents, <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK> Female welfare recipients, <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> single parents).</P>
<P>Six studies only recruited participants with at least one child (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>). For all studies findings are only reported for participants with children in this review (i.e. only parent sample reported from <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>), and wherever possible recruitment and attrition rates in this group are reported. The ages of the children at randomisation varied from 5 months to 18 years, but most were between 3 and 10 years at randomisation.</P>
<P>Ethnic mix of participants where it was reported reflects local norms, and therefore varies across studies but the samples were majority white in all studies.</P>
<P>No studies included non-disadvantaged participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention type</HEADING>
<P>Specific intervention characteristics are summarised in the table of included study characteristics. Eight of the nine included studies were welfare reform studies (A Better Chance in Delaware (ABC), Welfare Reform in Iowa, Minnesota Family Investment Project (MFIP), Florida Transition Program (FTP), New Hope, Jobs First in Connecticut, Welfare Restructuring Project in Vermont (WRP) and Self-Sufficiency Project in New Brunswick &amp; British Columbia (SSP)). One study was a teenage pregnancy reduction study (Dollar-a-day Program <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK>). The welfare reform studies combined cash incentives (e.g. negative taxation, income supplements) with work support or requirement to work along with other changes to provision of welfare payments.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Control and comparison groups</HEADING>
<P>All studies used no-intervention control groups (in these cases participants received standard care or welfare benefits).</P>
<P>Three studies included alternative intervention groups. <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK> tested monetary incentives with and without peer support group, a peer support only group and a no-treatment control. <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> included a comparison group that received additional financial incentives, but without job search assistance. <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK> included a comparison group that received additional financial incentives, but without the work requirement. Unfortunately <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK> reports only school outcomes and <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> no child outcomes for these alternative intervention conditions so while their existence is noted here, few results can be reported for these groups.</P>

Parents were asked to report child health status on a 1-5 Likert scale in 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>, Huston 2006, <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>). Whether or not children had current health insurance, and whether there had been periods without health insurance were reported by parents in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> also reports parental reports of visits to emergency departments following accident or injury, and <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK> parent-reported health service use including use of routine health and dental clinics.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK> reports child maltreatment, collected using state Division of Family Service records. Any alleged maltreatment was reported, differentiated by substantiated cases and type of abuse.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> used The Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome 1: children's psychomotor or cognitive development.</HEADING>
<P>Three studies used measures of cognitive development in young children (those under 5).

</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary outcome 2: educational progress or attainment.</HEADING>
<P>Education progress was most often provided as parental report of current educational standard (compared to others) on a 1-5 point Likert scale (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>). For older children (adolescents at follow-up) <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> also reports child reported school achievement.</P>
<P>Parent report was also used to collect data on grade retention (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) and school absences (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) suspension or expulsion from school (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) any time in special education (<LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>) and school drop out (<LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Length of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Length of follow-up was calculated as time since randomisation for all included studies. Three studies had follow-up periods of 1 to 3 years post randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK> 18 months; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK> 12 and 24 months; <LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK> 12, 24 and 36 months). Two other studies had multiple follow-up periods, <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> followed up at 36 and 72 months although different outcome measures are reported at each time. <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> followed up at 36, 54 and 72 months.

<P>The conduct of the studies was generally of a high quality, but across the studies as a whole the reporting of methodological detail with regard to the group of interest here (families with children) was sometimes lacking.</P>

<P>For most outcomes, which relied on participant self-report, it was not possible to blind outcome assessments. Where used, no studies stated whether assessors were blinded to group allocation. Where outcomes were recorded by independent means (such as routinely recorded data, or independent testing) this is noted in the narrative (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens_x002d_Simon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens-Simon 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Drop out and loss to follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Attrition and drop out rates are reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> "Additional Quality Assessment - Included Studies". This data was incomplete in 4 cases (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>). In the other 5 studies retention appears to be adequate, although in all studies loss to follow-up was slightly higher in intervention than control groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intention to treat</HEADING>
<P>Across all studies follow-up was collected for all participants regardless of intervention uptake. However, we also note that in all cases missing cases and data points are excluded and attrition rates are often unknown. Thus while follow-up was reported for all participants regardless of treatment uptake (one element of intention to treat), information is not available to account for non-response and therefore outcome assessments may be biased towards responders.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> analysed differences between responders and non-responders and found that non-responders were more likely to be male, but did not differ on other characteristics at baseline.<BR/>

<SELECTIVE_REPORTING MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:42:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>While most outcomes seem to have been reported in published studies, selective reporting by sub-group is a considerable difficulty in several of the included studies. Where outcomes are reported by subgroup (for example by age group, gender or welfare status) it isn't always possible to report these outcomes. For example, <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> reports child health insurance coverage for rural samples only, excluding urban samples, and is therefore not reported here. Such sub-group reporting leaves open the possibility of reporting bias, where published outcomes are not representative of all outcomes.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ethical conduct of trials</HEADING>
<P>The ethical conduct of trials is not often considered in Cochrane reviews. However, since eight of the included studies were based on government supported welfare reforms we considered it important to examine the extent to which these studies conformed with principles of informed consent (<LINK REF="REF-CIOMS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CIOMS 2002</LINK>), in particular whether participants had the right to choose not to take part in the research. Three studies discuss opt out from the trial; <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> states that participants could chose to "to seek employment instead of FTP benefits" (p. 22), <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> invited welfare applicants to take part (thus they could refuse), and SSP describes an informed consent procedure where participants could refuse to take part and where 10% of those approached did not participate (<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>). The remaining five studies describe only eligibility criteria and do not state whether welfare recipients could choose to opt out of the trial.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:06:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julie G Millener">
<P>Although many studies report continuous data, findings reported here are largely dichotomized. The use of dichotomized data enabled us to combine across groups where they were reported separately. For example, where the proportion of those judged to be in poor health were reportedly separately for rural and urban samples these were combined by reviewers to give an overall proportion in poor health across the entire sample. All such data transformations were conducted using Excel, and the first author of this review can be contacted for access to this file. In no cases were continuous outcomes reported in sufficient detail to allow combination in a similar fashion across reporting groups. Similarly, where continuous data were reported for the whole sample it was often not possible to calculate Standardised Mean Differences from data provided (eg group means and p values reported without a test statistics or measures of variance). In these cases the continuous data are reported, noting missing statistics , but meta-analysis across studies was not possible</P>
<P>Since varied outcome measure were used across the nine studies reviewers judged that meta-analysis <I>across</I> outcomes was not appropriate and so outcomes are reported separately. Within each outcome data are combined where appropriate and possible, as described below.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcome 1: child physical health</HEADING>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Child coverage by health insurance</HEADING>
<P>In total, data were available for 3095 intervention and 1983 control cases concerning health insurance coverage for children (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> also reports child health insurance coverage, but since only data from rural samples were reported it is not included here. Data reported are the number of households where there have been gaps in insurance coverage for children. A non-significant effect favouring controls was observed (OR 1.05 [0.90,1.23]).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">General Health rating by parents as a continuous variable</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> report differences in health ratings by intervention and control parents in the SSP study but only for age sub-groups (e.g. children aged 1-5 at randomisation and children aged 6-12 at randomisation). Since these age groups were mutually exclusive a summary estimate was derived using a generic inverse variance approach to estimate the effect size across these groups. Using this approach a non significant effect size was found in 54 month data (SMD=0.01, CI=-0.04,0.05) .</P>
<P>Health status is also reported by <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>. Overall parental health rating was higher among intervention (mean=4.3 n=429 using 1-5 scale) than control (mean=4.2 n=421) although the reported difference is non-significant (p=0.39).</P>
<P>FTP 2003 reports general health rating for a subsample of focal child aged 5-12 years at 51 month outcome. Standard deviations were not reported. Instead, the difference between means and the effect size (difference in mean outcome/control group standard deviation) were reported alongside p value following a two-tailed t test. Parents reported general state of health as slightly better among the intervention group. The difference is reported as being significant at the 10% level (as reported by study authors control mean=4.1, diff=0.1 (i.e. intervention mean 4.2) effect size=0.09) although significance level for a two-tailed t test is usually 5% so others would report this as a non-significant difference.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dichotomous Child Health rating by parents</HEADING>
<P>In three further studies a dichotomous variable of poor health is reported. As shown in <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> reported child health rated as average or poor, while <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> report child health rated as poor. <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> reports any long term health problems. Heterogeneity was high (I<SUP>2</SUP>=82.8%) so meta-analysis was not conducted. Of these 4 studies and 3 outcomes, two report a statistically significant effect, <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> reports a significant effect favouring control (OR 1.73 [1.26,2.37]) and <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK> a significant effect favouring intervention (OR 0.55 [0.31,0.97]). Non-significant differences favour both control (<LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>) and intervention (<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Parental rating of those 'in good health' were also reported in <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>, where a non-significant effect favouring control was observed (intervention n=753, control n=720 OR=0.89 [0.69,1.14]).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">c. Child maltreatment</HEADING>
<P>Child maltreatment recorded in state records was reported in <LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK>. Insufficient data were reported to allow calculation of SMD for maltreatment. Little difference was observed between the percent of families where alleged maltreatment took place at year 1 (control=10.5% intervention=11.6%) year 2 (c=11.6% i=11.0%) or year 3 (c=10.9% i=12.3%) after random assignment. All differences were non-significant and in year 1 and 3 favour control. For substantiated cases differences were non-significant in year 1(c=4.9% i=5.7%) and year 2(c=5.6% i=4.9%) but significantly different at year 3 (c=3.1% i=4.5% p&lt;0.05). Authors report differences by abuse type (physical/emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect) in each study year. In none of years 1, 2 or 3 do rates of physical/emotional or sexual abuse vary significantly between intervention and control groups. In year 1 and 3 a significant difference in rates of neglect was observed where a larger proportion of the intervention group were found to have neglected their children in year 1 (c=2.6% i=4.1% p&lt;0.01) and year 3 (c=1.5% i=2.4% p&lt;0.1), this difference was not observed in year 2 ((c=2.9% i=3.0% p&gt;0.1). Neglect was the most common type of substantiated maltreatment, with 3.3% of all children in the sample experiencing one or more substantiated incidents.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">d. Accidents and sudden illness</HEADING>
<P>Parent reported visits to emergency department by study child was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>. Neither study reports a significant effect, and pooled effects suggests a non-significant effect favouring treatment (OR=0.99 [0.79,1.24]). SSP Study (<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>) give the number of injuries in the last year reported by parents 36 and 54 month follow-up (for 54 month follow-up OR=1.06[0.82,1.35]). No effect was observed (OR=1.02 [0.86,1.21] fixed effects) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">e. Routine health check-ups</HEADING>
<P>Only one study reported the use of routine health care (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>). The odds of receiving a routine medical check up favoured intervention (OR=1.06 [0.79,1.43]) and of receiving a dental check up favoured control (OR=0.93 [0.73,1.20]) however neither result reached statistical significance (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Child health summary</HEADING>
<P>Excluding health insurance coverage, only one meta-analysis was possible within this category where 3 studies showed no effect on injuries or visits to emergency department. Other data were available for single studies, and most differences were not statistically significant and did not show a consistent direction of effect. Being in poor health was reported significantly more often once in an intervention group, and once in a control group. Measures of child maltreatment in one study favoured control. Given that benefits observed were not consistent across studies or outcomes we conclude that no effect on child health has been observed.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Parent-rated child behaviour</HEADING>
<P>Measures of children's mental health or emotional state were largely assessed through child behaviour (positive behaviour, problem behaviour, and criminal behaviour). The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale was used but outcome not reported in <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> because "reliabilities for younger children were generally low" (<LINK REF="REF-Huston-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huston 2001</LINK> p. 328) although authors state there were no programme effects observed. No findings from the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Scale were reported (<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Child behaviour ratings as continuous outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>) report group mean scores from parent ratings on problem behaviour scales (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>) and positive behaviour indexes (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>), no measures of variance in the sample are reported in either study. <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> study authors report non-significant differences; parent rated problem behaviour scale (SMD=0.11, p=0.184, n=530, no CI reported) favours intervention and parent rated positive behaviour (SMD=0.15, p=0.061, no CI reported) favours intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> reports mean scores for new welfare applicants and existing welfare applicants separately and reviewers have combined these to give overall mean scores per group (problem behaviour intervention mean=11.57, control mean =11.51; positive behaviour intervention mean=58.4, control mean =58.3) indicating slightly better scores for control in both cases, although sub-group differences are reported as non-significant by <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> also reports behaviour problems. In this case data from subgroups could not be combined (only group means and standard error of difference provided) and therefore these cannot be reported here. Within subgroups, none of the differences between intervention and control group were statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Dichotomised data from child behaviour scales</HEADING>
<P>Four studies report dichotomised post ive behaviour data. <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK> reports high scores on positive behaviour scale and <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK> report parents positive assessment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Across all four studies heterogeneity is low (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0) so a meta-analysis is appropriate, but the differences between groups is non-significant (OR 0.96 [0.79,1.16]).</P>
<P>Five studies report dichotomised problem behaviour data (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK> reports those with a high score on problem behaviour scales, while <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK> all report parent identification of problematic behaviour. Since heterogeneity in the sample is low (I<SUP>2</SUP>=0%) meta-analysis is appropriate. Overall a small effect of borderline significance favouring controls is observed (OR=1.09 [0.98, 1.22]).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">b. Police involvement</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reports on parent reports of involvement with police (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>), WRP (<LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) reports any trouble with police, while FTP and Jobs first (<LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>) report any arrests to children in sample. Since I<SUP>2</SUP> is high (54.4%) indicating heterogeneity in the sample, meta-analysis of involvement with police was not appropriate. Loeb appears to be an outlier favouring intervention, while Scrivener favours control and Wilk shows a null effect. <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK> reports child report of 'delinquent behaviour' on a 1-5 scale and reports a non-significant effect favouring controls (SMD=0.11, p=0.26, no CI reported). <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK> also reports convictions, slightly different data are reported each of the two publications relating to this study both relating to 10-17 year olds in the sample. <LINK REF="REF-Bloom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bloom 2000</LINK> reports convictions recorded to 13/455 intervention and 12/484 control children. In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Morris-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2003</LINK> reports convictions to 13/454 intervention and 11/467 control children. The differences are slight, and the differences between groups is non-significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">c. Activities for child</HEADING>
<P>Two studies report child involvement in 'organised activities' (<LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>), and we take this to contribute to child well-being. Although both studies suggest an effect in the same direction (favouring treatment, <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK> shows a significant effect), I<SUP>2</SUP> suggested significant heterogeneity (43.9%) and a meta-analysis was not appropriate (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>New Hope also reports use of organised activities such as sport clubs (<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>). Mean frequency of involvement in organised activities were given (intervention=2.4, control=2.3) along with regression coefficient of 0.1 (used as an estimate of effect), which shows a non-significant effect (p=0.218) favouring intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Child mental health or emotional state summary</HEADING>
<P>Two meta-analyses were possible within these outcomes (parent rated positive and problem behaviour) the combined effect in each case favoured control although neither were statistically significant. Treatment groups were reported as being more likely to take part in organised activities in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>), though neither reached significance. Positive child behaviour was more common in the treatment groups twice and control groups twice across 4 studies, none reaching significance. Involvement with the police was more likely among intervention children in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vermont-WRP-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Vermont WRP 2002</LINK>) and among control children in one other (<LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>). Again we would conclude that no consistent effect has been observed on measures of child mental health or emotional state.</P>
<P>Primary outcome 3: Oral health</P>
<P>None reported, aside from dental check ups in <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> see above.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome 1: children's psychomotor or cognitive development.</P>
<P>The MacArthur Communication Development Inventory was used to assess language development in the Jobs First study (<LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>). The group means were not reported, instead the regression coefficient for the composite (combined data across 12-42 month olds n=283) was transformed to give an estimate of effect of 0.26 (standard deviation units higher than control) with t=2.21, although a p value is not reported this t value suggests that this finding is likely to be significant, favouring intervention.</P>
<P>The Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test was used in the New Hope studies (<LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>). In this study effect sizes are given as an SMD but differing statistics were given; in the summary report (<LINK REF="REF-Huston-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huston 2003a</LINK>) the SMD was given as 0.12 (intervention mean=98.05 control mean=96.01 p=0.091, n=816, no CI reported) and in body of text SMD=0.12 (intervention mean=96, control mean =94.2 p=0.108, n=816, no CI reported) (<LINK REF="REF-Huston-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huston 2003b</LINK>). Although the effect size and direction remain the same (favouring intervention) the significance and mean values differ.</P>
<P>The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Scale (revised) was used in SSP study at 36 month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>). Results are reported for two age groups, those aged 1-2 years at random assignment (control group mean=90.7, control n=396, intervention mean=93.0 n=379, SE=1.4) and those aged 3-4 years at random assignment (control group mean=91.7, control n=374, intervention mean=93.6 n=387, SE=1.6), both showing a non-significant effect favouring treatment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Child psychomotor or cognitive development summary</HEADING>
<P>Three studies reported results from three different cognitive tests. All three report in favour of intervention children, one of which reaches significance at 95% confidence level.</P>
<P>Secondary outcome 2: Educational progress or attainment.</P>
<P>
<I>a. Educational Attainment in Public Records</I>
</P>
<P>MFIP reports Minnesota public school test assessments taken between 5 and 9 years post randomisation for children of single parents (<LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>). Results are reported separately for children living with single parents or two parent families. Reviewers combined these and results are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>. Children in the intervention group score higher on both reading and mathematics tests and a greater proportion of the intervention sample met the age expected level for reading and mathematics in both the 3rd and 5th grades. We cannot ascertain whether these differences reached statistical significance since measures of variance in the sample are not available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>

<P>As noted in study descriptions the actual value of the interventions for participants varied across studies and participants, but was often low. Findings were compared across three categories of level of predicted additional income (i.e. combining earnings and welfare payments):<BR/>1) Value &lt;US$50 per month.

This average level of benefit was reported by <LINK REF="STD-FTP-2003" TYPE="STUDY">FTP 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-New-Hope-2003" TYPE="STUDY">New Hope 2003</LINK>; and single parents in <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>.<BR/>3) Value &gt;US$100 per month (approximately 50 or Can$120). This average level of benefit was reported by <LINK REF="STD-SSP-2006" TYPE="STUDY">SSP 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jobs-First-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jobs First 2003</LINK>; and couples in <LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>.</P>
<P>To put these values in context, if we compare these sums to USDA reports of the estimates of money spent by low income couples on a child aged 3 to 5 years in the year $50 would have contributed 10.7% of this spend in 1995, 9.3% in 2000 and 8.0% in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Lino-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lino 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lino-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lino 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lino-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lino 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>It was possible to compare four outcomes by value of intervention: child health insurance coverage, parent-reported positive behaviour, parent-reported problem behaviour and involvement with the police.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-07-11 12:46:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review set out to assess the effects of a financial intervention to families on child health, psychosocial and educational outcomes. No overall effect was observed in the examined outcomes. There was a trend toward improved early language performance among children in the intervention group. In other cases where significant outcomes were observed in individual studies, other studies found outcomes in the other direction. Within the nine included studies the value of the intervention did not seem to determine outcome. Outcomes themselves often relied on parental report alone and therefore may be subject to reporting bias. These findings mirror results found in the Seattle and Denver Income Maintenance experiments, where outcomes were mixed in favour of control, intervention or null effects<I>. </I>
</P>
<P>We were not able to examine the effect of conditional receipt of money, which was unfortunate since interest in the impact of increasing family choice through income increases was core to the rationale for the review. Of the three studies collecting data for incentives only groups, only one reports data for this group and results from this study suggest that for most outcomes (five out of seven reported) the unrestricted incentives group showed mixed results but tended to have less positive outcomes than the control or conditional incentives groups. Psychosocial factors have been proposed to explain links between relative poverty and health (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Wilkinson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilkinson 2006</LINK>). If the increased stress experienced by disadvantaged groups explains poor outcomes (for example by increasing aggression) even in part, then the extent to which an intervention targeting these groups is likely to reduce stress may be important in understanding effectiveness. Promoting work amongst the jobless may increase status for those that are successful and therefore increasing employment provide psychosocial as well as monetary benefits. The studies included in this review did increase employment, but they also introduce new controls on participants. However, enforcing the uptake of low status work may increase stigma and stress rather than reducing it. Since income benefits could not be disentangled from conditions we were not able to test this suppostion. We hope that future publications by study authors may report differential effects for incentive only intervention groups.</P>
<P>Some of the reporting studies were concerned with the potential impact of the conditionality itself; for instance the imposition of sanctions on families, and of increased working hours among single parents with young children. Had we been able to report on outcomes for study groups with and without conditions we too could comment on the effects of conditionality.<BR/>There were also tentative but important evidence that sanctions and work requirements involved in the interventions may place additional stresses on families with young children and has the potential to increase family breakdown and child abuse (<LINK REF="STD-ABC-Study-2003" TYPE="STUDY">ABC Study 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>When interpreting the findings we also note that the monetary value of many interventions was low. Most studies the total increase in income to intervention families was less than US$50 per month (or US$11.50 per week), despite the fact that many parents were compelled to work full time. For a whole family, we would question whether this level of income increase is likely to effect living conditions, and therefore whether the studies show no effect because the intervention was too small. Only three studies provided benefits of more than US$150 per month, and within one study (<LINK REF="STD-MFIP-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MFIP 2005</LINK>) this was only for a minority of participants, most received less. We have reported here outcomes by income level, but we treat these findings with caution as total increase in family income differs by subgroup in all these studies. For example, despite an everage increase in income <LINK REF="STD-Fraker-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fraker 2002</LINK> reports a <I>decrease </I>of $202 per month in total household income among single mothers under the new welfare regime. Authors suggest this is due to "a positive impact on being never-married and negative impact on being currently married" (p. 62), in other words the intervention made remaining or becoming a lone parent more likely. The impact of these interventions on poverty seems to be questionable in at least some cases, and any conclusions made on the basis of these studies is therefore limited to interventions of similar value.</P>
<P>In a similar vein, economic theory would suggest that it is not just the increase in income that matters, but also the likelihood that the income increase be sustained (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1957</LINK>). The permanent income hypothesis suggests that people do not change their spending habits in response to what are seen to be temporary changes in income, only if they see a significant and sustained change will they change their lifestyles. We have suggested the changes in income observed here may not be significant, and the short term nature of support offered in some of these studies may not be interpreted by families as sustained. In other words, none of these interventions are large enough or sustained enough to constitute a sufficient 'dose' and this may explain the lack of observed effect.</P>
<P>Length of outcome data for these studies was reasonably long term (up to 6 years in some cases), but other studies which aim to change future outcomes for children by preventive intervention in childhood have shown that very long term data is needed to assess the effects of such preventive work (e.g. High/Scope Pre-school Perry). Future updates of this review should seek out follow-up data for the studies reported here, as well as any new studies reporting.</P>
<P>It is also useful here to consider the limitations of the review methodology. The systematic searches undertaken here were highly inefficient (with a high abstract hit rate for few relevant studies) and made searching for study types other than RCTs impractical. The review methodology also means that intervention types are included or rejected a priori. We could not predict that we would only locate studies where additional monies were modest and were made conditional on strict employment or attendance requirements, despite the fact that the scope of the review was broader. We were not able to report on the effect of unconditional additional monies, nor of interventions with higher 'dosage' (i.e. interventions of higher value and/or longer period). We also did not include studies where money was paid to young people rather than parents (such as education maintenance allowance), previous studies suggests that the division of household income is not straightforward (<LINK REF="REF-Goode-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goode 1998</LINK>) and is not inevitably shared . We acknowledge that a different decision might have been made here, but could find no evidence supporting (or rebutting) the view that this is considered family money.</P>
<P>There is a very strong and consistent association in observational data between family income and virtually every health, behavioural and educational outcome in children. This association is again reported in all of the studies discussed here with substantial levels of ill health reported amongst children of participants. A number of studies have highlighted the significant stress experienced by families with young children on low incomes and the association with adverse psychological outcomes for children and mothers. Previous observational studies cannot address causation, so these associations may relate to other causal factors. In addition, it is unclear whether any effects are the consequence of long term material deprivation, and whether such effects could be remedied in the short term by the provision of increased financial resources. The response of government to the recognition of the increased risk to children of the poorest families has been, in general, to provide services to attempt to ameliorate adverse consequences or increase work among welfare recipients. The welfare reform studies cited here were largely successful in their aims; that is they increased employment and reduced welfare payments over time. However, the question of 'what works?' is more correctly phrased 'what works for whom?'. Given that increased parental employment is thought to be critical to the reduction of child poverty in many countries including the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Freud-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freud 2007</LINK>) it is important to monitor effects on children as well as on employment.</P>
<P>On the basis of current evidence we have not been able to establish whether unconditional financial benefits delivered as an intervention are effective at redressing inequalities in health and wellbeing resulting from relative poverty in the short term. This is in essence a statement of no evidence of effect rather than evidence of no effect and, given the constraints on participants in these cases, we would not conclude that the potential impact of additional income has yet been assessed. There is tentative evidence that young children (under 42 months) in the intervention groups had improved early language skills, an improvement that may well be associated with greater use of organised child care (<LINK REF="REF-Allhusen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allhusen 2002</LINK>). The association between lower income and poorer outcome across all dimensions of child health is strong and consistent across countries and time, and small value interventions with strict conditions attached have not been shown to reverse the pattern of disadvantage for poor groups.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The association between low income and poor outcome in all dimensions of child health is strong and consistent across countries and time. On the basis of current evidence we have not been able to establish that direct financial benefits delivered as an intervention are effective in redressing this balance in the short term. It is plausible that studies reviewed here did not offer a significant 'dose' (an interventions of larger value or longer duration). This is in essence a statement of "no evidence of effect" rather than of "evidence of no effect" viewed in the context of the monetary value of the interventions studied. While this review has not found significant benefits associated with low-value, strictly conditional welfare reform, the implications for practice is that increasing family income remains a promising intervention. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Large scale evaluations of conditional payments of small value have been thoroughly tested and, not withstanding the limited child outcome data in these studies, probably do not need to be repeated. The gaps in the research evidence remain in the evaluation of unconditional payments of higher value, with high quality child outcome measures. For those studies completed, data collection for outcomes of children in experimental families should be ongoing.</P>

<P>Overall there is no significant difference between intervention and control groups. However, in a series of sub-group analyses, beneficial effects were observed in some subgroups. The largest positive effects are seen in the group of mothers under the age of 18, with an interval of less than 18 months between pregnancies who smoked. Other positive effects are seen in sub groups in whom adverse circumstances cluster. While the authors argue that these are the groups in which the largest effects were expected, it is not clear that this analysis was planned a priori. It is likely that this division into a large number of sub-groups is responsible for the apparently adverse effect of the programme within one group (18-34 year olds with a long interval between pregnancies and who didn't smoke). The results of this type of post-hoc analysis must be treated with scepticism.</P>
