<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-02-07 14:46:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-epileptic attacks look like epileptic seizures but they are not caused by epilepsy. There have been many investigations of the causes, but evidence about successful treatment is less available. We reviewed the existing studies treating people having non-epileptic attacks. We found 12 studies looking at different types of treatment such as psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnosis. Three hundred and forty three participants were recruited to these 12 studies. Four studies were randomised controlled trials, and 8 were non-randomised studies. Most of the controlled trials included patients with other diagnoses as well as non-epileptic attacks. Most of the non-randomised studies included patients with mainly non-epileptic attacks. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the treatment they were investigating. One randomised trial investigating Cognitive Behavioural Therapy found that seizures were significantly reduced. Due to the variety of treatments and designs of the included studies, it was not possible to combine the results to produce an overall outcome for our review. </P>
<P>Many of the studies did not use satisfactory methods which meant that the evidence was rated as high risk of bias. The overall evidence for the main outcome of reducing seizures as a result of treatment is not considered reliable except in one study. Our conclusion is there is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment for people with non-epileptic attacks. The evidence in this review is up to date as from 4 February 2013. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:21:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, also known as non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), have the outward appearance of epilepsy in the absence of physiological or electroencephalographic correlates. Non-epileptic seizures can occur in isolation or in combination with epileptic seizures. The development and maintenance of non-epileptic seizures has been well documented and there is a growing literature on the treatment of non-epileptic seizures which includes non-psychological (including anti-anxiety and antidepressant pharmacological treatment) and psychological therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy and paradoxical therapy). Various treatment methodologies have been tried with variable success. The purpose of this Cochrane review was to establish the evidence base for the treatment of non-epileptic seizures with behavioural and psychological therapies only.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:21:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess whether behavioural or psychological treatments for non-epileptic seizures or NEAD result in a reduction in the frequency of seizures or improvement in quality of life, or both, and whether any treatment is significantly more effective than others.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:21:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialised Register (4 February 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 1) (January 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to 4 February 2013), PsycINFO (4 February 2013) and SCOPUS (4 February 2013). No language restrictions were imposed. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:21:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before and after controlled and non-controlled studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies were required to assess one or more types of behavioural or psychological interventions, or both, for the treatment of non-epileptic seizures. Studies of childhood non-epileptic seizures were excluded from our review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-11-23 09:12:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (JM, JP) independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included reduction in seizure frequency and improvements in quality of life.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-02-07 14:12:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twelve studies, with a total of 343 participants, met our inclusion criteria (four RCTs and eight before and after non-controlled studies). Of the four RCTs, one examined patients with non-epileptic seizures and three had a mixed diagnosis (pseudoseizures, conversion disorder and somatisation disorder). Most of the non-randomised studies used non-epileptic seizure patients exclusively. Overall, five studies examined the effectiveness of psychotherapy, three examined CBT, two investigated hypnosis, one assessed paradoxical intention and one had a mixed intervention design. We classified two included studies as low risk of bias, one as unclear and nine as high risk of bias. Meta-analysis could not be undertaken due to the heterogeneity of design and interventions. Most included studies reported improved outcomes for the intervention under investigation. One RCT investigating the effectiveness of CBT in this patient group found a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to controls (P &lt; 0.001).</P>

<P>There is little reliable evidence to support the use of any treatment, including CBT, in the treatment of non-epileptic seizures. Further randomised controlled trials of CBT and other interventions are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:22:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:22:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been many names given to this condition over the years. In this review we refer to non-epileptic seizures or NEAD, but such attacks have variously been called pseudo seizures, psychogenic seizures, somatoform disorders, dissociative seizures, conversion disorders and hysterical seizures, to name but a few. Whatever terminology is used, they are describing attacks which look very similar to seizures caused by epilepsy, but they do not have the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that characterises epilepsy. Instead they are unconsciously produced, beyond the control of the person having the attacks, in response to overwhelming distress and can be triggered by many situations, emotions, thoughts, etc. People with non-epileptic seizures are not always aware of what triggers their attacks and may say they "just happen". Psychologists may formulate the development and maintenance of the attacks in terms of emotional trauma or stress but identifying a particular causative factor may not always be straightforward.</P>
<P>There are various sources citing the incidence of non-epileptic seizures. The<I> </I>
<LINK REF="REF-NEAD-Trust" TYPE="REFERENCE">NEAD Trust</LINK> website states that the incidence of NEAD is approximately three people per 100,000 per year in England alone. However, they add that these data were obtained from neurology centres and only video/electroencephalogram (EEG)-proven cases were counted, therefore the figure is likely to represent a significant underestimate. The same source indicated that on average it took five years for patients to be correctly diagnosed with non-epileptic seizures. The website <LINK REF="REF-Non_x002d_Epileptic-Attacks" TYPE="REFERENCE">Non-Epileptic Attacks</LINK> cites a higher incidence rate of two or three people per 10,000. More recent papers have indicated a general population incidence from 1.5per 100,000 persons per year (<LINK REF="REF-Bodde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodde 2009</LINK>) to 4.6 per 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Szaflarski-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szaflarski 2000</LINK>). In the UK specifically 4.9 per 100,000 has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 2011</LINK>). In addition, it is indicated that 25% to 30% of patients referred to tertiary epilepsy centres for refractory epilepsy are found to have non-epileptic seizures. Of these, 5% to 40% have a dual diagnosis of epilepsy or have a past history of epilepsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bodde-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodde 2009</LINK>). The prevalence of non-epileptic seizures has been cited to be between 5% and 20% in the outpatient epilepsy population (<LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:22:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are many interventions that have been tried for non-epileptic seizures. It is unclear as yet whether one particular intervention is suitable for all people given that these seizures occur in many different contexts and develop in response to many different situations.</P>
<P>Behavioural and psychological treatments have been used to help people with non-epileptic seizures with varying levels of documented success. Some of the most common forms of intervention include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): aims to identify and link thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and behaviour. The therapist works with the patient to address difficulties such as thinking errors to help the person deal with problems more effectively. One of the key components is self monitoring (completing behavioural diaries) and analysing these to look for alternative ways of thinking about or managing the situation.</LI>
<LI>Psychodynamic therapy: this approach looks at the impact of early life events on the way people view themselves today, their current relationships and how they handle emotions. Difficult experiences from the past may be repressed and people may not realise how they have been affected by the experiences until they start thinking about it in therapy.</LI>
<LI>Cognitive analytical therapy: aims to help people identify unhelpful patterns of actions and how they have developed over time. Links are made between childhood behaviour patterns and current behaviour and thoughts.</LI>
<LI>Interpersonal therapy: aims to identify the connections between symptoms experienced and current interpersonal problems in key relationships. These interpersonal difficulties are seen as central to the development and maintenance of the symptoms. Therapy focuses on current social relationships and how expectations within these relationships may be causing a patient&#8217;s symptoms.</LI>
<LI>Family therapy: involves working with several members of a family at the same time. Relationships within the family unit are the focus, as are the ways in which the family views and solves problems - or makes them worse.</LI>
<LI>Hypnotherapy: this approach involves the person experiencing deep relaxation and their attention is focused on the suggestions made by the therapist. These suggestions are made with the aim of helping people make positive changes within themselves and in the behaviour outside sessions.</LI>
<LI>Paradoxical therapy: the therapist encourages the patient to engage in the unwanted behaviour, in this case doing something to deliberately bring on a non-epileptic seizure.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:22:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Much research has been devoted to the aetiology of non-epileptic seizures and it is from this that some of the hypotheses about treatment methodologies arise. Significant links have been found between certain life events and the occurrence of non-epileptic seizures. In particular there have been consistent findings of co-occurrence of experiences of abuse in childhood or early adulthood and the development of non-epileptic events (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reilly-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reilly 1999</LINK>). An understanding of how these early life events contribute to the development of maladaptive behaviours that are triggered in later life is seen as crucial in some treatment methodologies (e.g. psychodynamic) and less so in others (e.g. CBT). Psychological factors such as anxiety, stress, anger and other emotions, as well as mental tasks and thoughts (<LINK REF="REF-Francis-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1999b</LINK>), can trigger an attack, as can physiological states such as over-exertion and pain (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 2004</LINK>). It is on the basis of such studies that much literature has evolved regarding potential treatments. For example, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (<LINK REF="REF-Chemali-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chemali 2004</LINK>) is thought to ameliorate symptoms by re-processing the memory of the event so that it no longer feels as bad as the first time it was experienced. Following eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, the person still remembers the event, but the associated images, sounds and feelings that were evoked are no longer triggered to the same extent. CBT, on the other hand, is usually more focused on the link between thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Rusch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rusch 2001</LINK>). Therefore, if the presenting symptoms were anxiety or panic the patient would be treated with CBT by looking at strategies such as thought challenging and exposure of the feared thoughts, memories or situations, perhaps in a graded way. It is hypothesised that the way we interpret these events or situations can be modified by challenging negative automatic thoughts that arise in these contexts and replacing such thoughts with a more appropriate response.</P>
<P>Hypnosis or deep relaxation allows the conscious mind to rest and go into a neutral state. By doing so, it allows communication with the subconscious mind directly. This process is powerful because the subconscious mind can create positive changes by accepting positive suggestions. Through this communication with the subconscious mind, hypnotherapy can help the patient to release negative feelings and beliefs that may restrict their ability to achieve their potential to live life to the full.</P>
<P>Other methodologies are thought to work by different mechanisms, e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy involves resolving relationship problems or finding new relationships or activities as compensation.<BR/>

The tool examines selection bias (sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data, blinding), detection bias (blinding, other potential threats to validity) and reporting bias (selective outcome reporting).</P>
<P>For non-randomised evidence, we assessed each study for bias using the extended Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool developed by the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Group. This tool assesses all domains mentioned above with the addition of confounding variables. We rated blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, confounding variables and other bias on a five-point scale ranging from low to high risk of bias according to the risk for the outcome. The review authors determined the parameters of the scale. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for a table of scale parameters.</P>
<P>We made an overall summary judgement of risk of bias for each study followed by an overall judgement across studies. We could not incorporate the 'Risk of bias' judgements into the analysis using sensitivity analysis as meta-analysis was not undertaken. We created four 'Summary of findings' tables, one consisting of RCT evidence and one non-randomised evidence. We graded each outcome accordingly using the GRADE approach.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2004</LINK> and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of CBT for adults with dissociative seizures using a before and after design. Twenty patients were recruited consecutively from the Maudsley Hospital, London. Inclusion criteria included experience of at least one characteristic attack during EEG. Only 16 completed the treatment (14 female; mean age 34.9, standard deviation (SD) 13.4). Participants had 12 sessions of weekly, individual CBT; sessions lasted one hour except for the initial session which was allocated two hours. The experienced CBT therapist who delivered the treatment followed a detailed, session-by-session treatment schedule prepared for the study. Outcome measures were administered pretreatment, at discharge and at six-month follow-up.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2010</LINK> and colleagues used a randomised controlled trial to compare CBT to standard medical care for people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Sixty-six participants were recruited from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London. Inclusion criteria included diagnostic confirmation by video-EEG telemetry in most patients. Patients were randomised to CBT or standard medical care. The CBT treatment manual was based on the previously reported 2004 study. Patients were offered up to 12 weekly or fortnightly hour-long outpatient sessions with a trained therapist. Thirty-three participants were allocated to each group; of these 31 received standard medical care (two withdrew post-randomisation) and 24 received at least nine CBT sessions (nine participants received fewer than nine sessions). Three of the CBT group patients were lost to follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis captured 33 data sets for the CBT group (24 females, mean age 37.4, SD 12.6) and 31 for the standard medical care group (26 females, mean age 35.9, SD 15.1).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-LaFrance-2009" TYPE="STUDY">LaFrance 2009</LINK> evaluated the effect of CBT on reduction of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) using a before and after design. Twenty-one participants (17 female, 81%; mean age 36, SD 10.4) with video/EEG-confirmed PNES were enrolled into the Rhode Island Hospital study and 17 completed the 12 sessions of manualised CBT intervention. Three people with mixed epileptic seizures and PNES who could clearly distinguish between their events were included in the group. One of the 21 participants was not included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis as they dropped out the day after completing the baseline measures and so did not receive any intervention. Twenty were therefore included in the treatment analyses. Patients recorded their seizures on a daily seizure calendar in one-week intervals. Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI), Modified Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MHRSD), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy 31 (QOLIE). After completing the CBT sessions, a follow-up questionnaire was administered via the phone at four, eight and 12 months post-enrolment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Hypnosis studies</HEADING>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials investigated the effects of hypnosis on conversion symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study investigated the effects of hypnosis on non-epileptic seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK>). This study included 49 adult inpatients with conversion disorder. Seven experienced paroxysmal myoclonic outbursts and eight had seizures or convulsions. Twenty-six were allocated randomly to the experimental group and 23 to the control group. The average duration of conversion disorder was 3.9 years (range two months to 22 years; SD 4.5 months). Forty per cent (18) of the 45 had acute onset (within three days). Sixty-two per cent (28) (an undisclosed proportion of whom had acute onset) developed conversion symptoms in connection with a previous physical complaint or affliction in the relevant part of the body. Thirty-two (72.7%) of the patients used medication (benzodiazepines (43.2%), medication for somatic complaints (45.5%) and painkillers (44.4%) most frequently). No discussion of withdrawal of medication or otherwise was included. Patients in both treatment and control groups followed a group therapy programme with the aim of increasing problem-solving skills. This programme consisted of group psychotherapy, social skills training, formulating and evaluating treatment goals, creative therapy and sports. In addition, conversion patients also had physiotherapy, individual exercise sessions and bed rest. The experimental group had the addition of hypnotic treatment. This involved one preparatory session followed by eight weekly sessions lasting one hour. Part of this treatment involved the patients learning self hypnosis and they were instructed to practise each day for 30 minutes. In the control group, instead of hypnosis, a treatment aimed at optimising non-specific or common therapy factors was implemented. This involved a preparatory session followed by eight weekly sessions lasting one hour.The primary outcome measure used was the Video Rating Scale for Motor Conversion Symptoms (VRMC). Follow-up in this study was eight months after pretreatment assessment.</P>
<P>A further study by <LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> included 49 adult outpatients with conversion disorder (motor type) or somatisation disorder (with motor conversion symptoms). Of the 49, six experienced paroxysmal myoclonic outbursts and two had seizures or convulsions. Twenty-four were randomly allocated to the treatment group and 25 to the waiting list control group. The treatment group received one preparatory session followed by 10 weekly sessions. Two hypnotic strategies were used: (1) direct symptom alleviation used suggestions designed to alter conditioned cues to motor symptoms; (2) emotional expression/insight involved age regression to explore factors implicated in the development of the symptoms. Self hypnosis was also taught and patients were asked to practise the symptom alleviation strategies for 30 minutes a day. A waiting list control group was used. Average duration of conversion disorder was 3.7 years (range two months to 16.7 years; SD 4.7 months). In terms of onset, 37.2% (16) patients had acute onset (within three days) and 47.8% (21) developed conversion symptoms in connection with a previous physical complaint or affliction in the relevant part of the body. Twenty-one (48.8%) of the patients used medication (benzodiazepines (14%), medication for somatic complaints (30.2%) and painkillers (34.8%) most frequently). No discussion of withdrawal of medication or otherwise was included. The primary outcome measure used was the VRMC. Follow-up for the treatment group was at six months after their 10th session. No follow-up was arranged for the waiting list control group. It is noted that preliminary data on eight adults with motor conversion symptoms (one described as having pseudo epileptic seizures) was published by Moene in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Moene-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moene 1998</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Paradoxical intention therapy studies</HEADING>
<P>We found one randomised controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of paradoxical intention therapy on non-epileptic seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK>). This study included 30 adults with conversion disorder, specifically pseudoseizures. Fifteen were randomly allocated to the experimental group and 15 to the control group after exclusions for abnormal EEG, organic disease, previous psychiatric treatment etc. In the experimental group, patients were hospitalised and given two paradoxical intention treatment sessions per day. During sessions, patients were encouraged to imagine anxiety-provoking situations or experiences, or both. The aim was to help the patients to re-experience their traumas and experience their conversion attacks. After three weeks, patients were discharged. Three weeks post-discharge, a reassessment took place and comparisons of anxiety and conversion scores were made. In the control group, patients were prescribed diazepam as outpatients (5 to 15 mg). They were given appointments at 10, 20, 30 and 45 days to review their progress and were also reviewed at the end of treatment for anxiety and conversion symptoms. The overall mean duration of conversion disorder for the whole sample was 42 days (experimental group 34 days; control group 48 days). There was no discussion of medication use in these groups. The aetiology was not detailed; however anxiety-provoking situations and experiences, and traumatic events were mentioned. The primary outcome measure was anxiety score as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA). Follow-up in this study was three weeks after the study finished. The study duration was six weeks therefore follow-up was approximately two months after the start of the study. It is noted that an earlier account of this research was published by Ataoglu in 1998 (<LINK REF="REF-Ataoglu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ataoglu 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>This pilot before and after study which used psychodynamically focused group therapy for people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (<LINK REF="STD-Barry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2008</LINK>) recruited 12 female patients to the study; seven (aged from 30 to 60) completed at least 75% of the weekly sessions. They met for 90 minutes once a week for 32 weeks. The authors state in their paper that the overall goal of the therapy was to develop conscious and verbal expression of emotional distress which would obviate the need for somatic displays of stress. In addition to the group therapy, five of the participants had intermittent individual cognitive behaviour therapy with one of the authors during the study period. Another patient saw a former therapist sporadically during the study. The primary outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the patient's diary of seizure frequency. The BDI and SCL-90 were completed by each patient at the start of the study, 16 weeks into group therapy and finally at completion of the 32-week trial. The seizure logs were completed daily by patients and documented the number of seizures, times they occurred and types of seizures.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Kuyk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuyk 2008</LINK> looked at the effect of an uncontrolled, prospective inpatient treatment programme for PNES using a before and after design. This treatment was offered in the Epilepsy Institute in Heemsteded, The Netherlands. The treatment programme ran five days per week and was provided by a multidisciplinary team and followed cognitive behavioural principles. At the weekends when the unit was closed, the patients went home. Twenty-nine patients agreed to participate, of these 26 were included in the study (77% were females; mean age 30.6, SD 10.8). Four of the participants were excluded from the analysis because they had a dual diagnosis and experienced both epileptic seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Sixteen of these were followed up six months post-treatment. The duration of the programme varied from two to six months with an average of 4.8 months. The main outcome measures included seizure frequency (observed and counted by nursing staff at the start of treatment and at discharge and reported by patients at the six-month follow-up), medication use, SCL-90 and BDI. Mean weekly seizure frequency at the end of treatment and at six-month follow-up had decreased significantly compared to the previous measurement.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Prigatano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Prigatano 2002</LINK> used a before and after design and provided two six-month group psychotherapy programmes for 15 patients (all female; mean age 36, range 20 to 48) diagnosed as having non-epileptic seizures by EEG/video monitoring and brain imaging (one of the patients from the second group was thought to have both epileptic seizures and non-epileptic seizures). These sessions took place in St Joseph's Hospital and Medical Centre, Phoenix, Arizona. Patients met for 1.5 hours per week for 24 group therapy sessions. Eight participants were treated during the first programme and seven during the second. No quality of life measures were included in this study. Instead the authors looked at various psychometric measures such as sub-tests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (WAIS-III), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). At the beginning of each session, patients completed a weekly log of seizures.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Ramani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ramani 1982</LINK> investigated the effectiveness of intensive and highly individualised behavioural psychotherapy using a before and after design in nine patients (eight female; average age 31.6, range 17 to 54 years) with video-EEG confirmation of "hysterical" seizures as well as epileptic seizures. One of the nine was described as "severely retarded". Seven patients received behavioural therapy using supportive re-educative methods. The "severely retarded" patient received a programme of behaviour modification, while the final patient received short-term dynamic therapy. All treatments were completed as intensive inpatient treatments during a four to nine-week hospital stay in the seizure unit at the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program (CEP) of Minnesota, Minneapolis.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Zaroff-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zaroff 2004</LINK> used a before and after design to investigate the effectiveness of an open-ended group psychotherapy programme which included a disorder-specific psychoeducational treatment component in the first 10 weeks. Ten patients were included (six female; mean age 25.7, SD 12.9, range 21 to 57). Before starting the group therapy sessions, all participants completed various self report measures including seizure frequency and QOLIE-31. The sessions were one hour per week for a total of 10 weeks. The 10 patients were seen in three separate groups, although the authors state that identical treatments were used in each group. At the end of the 10-week programme, group psychotherapy continued in a less structured and more supportive format, without specific session topics. Of the 10 patients with PNES that were recruited to the study, seven completed the majority of the psychoeducational sessions.</P>

<P>In a randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2010</LINK>), monthly seizure frequency reduced significantly (P = 0.002) at the end of treatment in the CBT group compared to the standard medical care group. Monthly seizure frequency was as follows (monthly median seizure frequency and interquartile range): start of treatment, CBT 12 (22.50), standard medical care 8 (29.25); end of treatment, CBT 2 (6), standard medical care 6.75 (38.63). There was a trend toward lower seizure frequency at follow-up: CBT 1.5 (8), standard medical care 5 (24). Scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) showed no significant improvements.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2004</LINK> study, monthly seizure frequency reduced significantly (P &lt; 0.01) from a pretreatment mean of 18.22 (standard deviation (SD) 43.70) to 2.88 (SD 4.73) at the end of treatment and this was maintained at six-month follow-up (2.59, SD 4.14). Scores on the HADS also showed some improvement (P &lt; 0.05): anxiety at pretreatment 10.06 (SD 5.62) reduced to 7.81 (SD 5.52) at the end of treatment. The depression mean score was 6.75 (SD 3.55) pretreatment and reduced to 4.63 (SD 4.22) at the end of treatment. Both of these improvements were maintained at six-month follow-up (anxiety 8.13, SD 6.71; depression 4.63, SD 5.08).<B> </B>
</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-LaFrance-2009" TYPE="STUDY">LaFrance 2009</LINK> study, 16 participants out of the 21 reported a 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 11 of the 17 completers reported no seizures by the end of the 12 sessions (P = 0.001). Mean scores for depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, quality of life and psychosocial functioning all showed improvement from baseline to final session. The mean Quality Of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE) score at baseline of 46.7 improved to 53.3 at one month and further improved to 62.8 at final assessment (P = 0.0049).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2002</LINK> provided no results specific to non-epileptic seizures. It is stated that the frequency and duration of seizures was noted by staff and patients throughout the study. From this they calculated the mean percentage change in frequency and duration which was converted to a representative score on the Video Rating Scale for Motor Conversion Symptoms (VRMC) rating scale. However, none of these scores were provided in the paper. The authors' analyses were time and condition by time interactions. Their outcome measures were the VRMC, SCL-90 (Symptom Checklist-90; Dutch version) a self report measure of psycho-neuroticism, the ICIDH (International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps) sub-scale for physical activities) and the ICIDHP (the perceived problems sub-scale). The authors reported significant symptom reduction in patients with a conversion disorder of the motor type; however, this was independent of the treatment condition. They reported no significant condition effects and no significant condition by time interactions for any of the outcome measures. However, a significant main effect for time was reported for all of the outcome measures VRMC, P = 0.001; SCL-90, P = 0.05; ICIDH, P = 0.000; ICIDHP, P = 0.000). The authors concluded that the addition of hypnosis to the treatment programme did not affect outcome.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moene-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Moene 2003</LINK> provided no results specific to non-epileptic seizures. As with the 2002 study, the outcome measures were VRMC, SCL-90 and ICIDH. The authors reported significant treatment results for a hypnosis-based treatment in patients with a conversion disorder, motor type. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean VRMC scores (treatment group 5.9, SD 1.3; control group 3.8, SD 1.4; P = 0.001). The analysis of the ICIDH results indicated that the treatment group improved more than controls on this interview measure of general motor impairment (treatment group, P &lt; 0.01; control group, P = 0.29). The authors found no significant effect of treatment on the SCL-90 (main effects: group, P = 0.54; time, P = 0.064; interaction, P = 0.56). At six-month follow-up the authors reported that improvement was maintained.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Paradoxical intention therapy</HEADING>
<P>No specific non-epileptic attack frequency or severity results were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Ataoglu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ataoglu 2003</LINK> as the primary outcome measure in this study was an anxiety score. However, the authors noted the percentage of the sample in each group who showed no conversion symptoms in the last two weeks at follow-up: experimental group 14 (93.3%); control group 9 (60%). There was a significant improvement in recovery rate in the paradoxical intention therapy group when compared than the diazepam-treated group (P = 0.034) although individual group significance levels were not provided. The authors analysed anxiety scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HRSA) before and after treatment. There was no significant difference between pretreatment anxiety scores. Both groups recorded significantly decreased anxiety scores by the end of treatment (diazepam-treated group, P = 0.0012; paradoxical intention therapy group (P = 0.0007). A greater degree of significance was found in the paradoxical intention therapy group when comparing the difference between pre- and post-treatment anxiety scores (P = 0.015).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Psychotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Results found from <LINK REF="STD-Barry-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Barry 2008</LINK> showed a decrease (improvement) in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) over the course of treatment, with a mean decrease from 16.6 ± 10.1 (SD) to 13.3 ± 7.9 (SD) post-treatment. A mean reduction was found on 10 of the 12 SCL-90 sub-scales, with effect sizes ranging from 0.03 to 0.92 (e.g. Global Severity Index, effect size = 0.47; Obsessive&#8211;Compulsive, effect size = 0.92; Phobic Anxiety, effect size = 0.71; Depression, effect size = 0.67; and Somatization, effect size = 0.31). In addition, six of the seven patients experienced a decrease in non-epileptic seizure frequency during the treatment period. Four of the seven (57%) had no non-epileptic seizure events, except for occasional recurrence when they experienced increased emotional distress. Several months after the 32-week trial, a follow-up questionnaire was completed. The results showed that two of the seven remained seizure-free. The rest reported a reduction in severity, intensity and duration. At the time of write-up, the authors' long-term follow-up had shown that of the five participants who had continued in therapy with one of the authors, all had been either seizure-free or had only a mild increase in seizure activity at times of stress.</P>
<P>Of the 22 participants in <LINK REF="STD-Kuyk-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Kuyk 2008</LINK>, 7.7% reported being seizure-free at the start of treatment; 27.3% (P = 0.02) and 44% (P = 0.05) respectively were seizure-free at the end of treatment and follow-up. Fourteen per cent reported an increase in seizures at the end of treatment and 12.5% at follow-up. With regard to antiepileptic drug use, 14 of the 22 patients (63.6%) were taking antiepileptic drugs at the start of treatment, but by the end of treatment only four patients were taking antiepileptic drugs. At follow-up, of the 16 patients who responded, there had been no change in their medication use since the end of treatment, i.e. 14 used no antiepileptic drugs. Significant improvements were seen in the scores on the psychological measures including the BDI and SCL-90. The scores improved at the end of treatment and either maintained or showed further improvement at follow-up. For example, mean BDI scores were in the mild-moderate severity category at the start of treatment and decreased at the end of treatment (P = 0.003) and follow-up (P = 0.001) to the minimally depressed category.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Prigatano-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Prigatano 2002</LINK> reported that of the 15 patients, nine completed at least 58% of the treatment sessions. Of those nine patients, six (66.6%) reported a decline in seizure frequency, two (22.2%) reported no change and one (11.1%) reported an increase.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Ramani-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ramani 1982</LINK> study, at the time of admission, all patients were averaging two to three "hysterical" seizures per day. At the four-year follow-up seven of the eight had no further hysterical seizures, although three of these reported occasional "nervous spells", "shaking" or dizziness when tired or under emotional stress. One patient remained refractory to treatment and one was lost to follow-up. Detailed tables or figures were not included in the paper.</P>
<P>Out of the seven patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Zaroff-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zaroff 2004</LINK> study who completed the intended therapy sessions, three were already seizure-free at the start of treatment, one reported no change, two reported a decline and one an increase in seizure frequency. The authors reported a trend towards an improved overall score for quality of life (P = 0.07).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mixed intervention</HEADING>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Rusch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rusch 2001</LINK> study, of the 26 patients who completed treatment, 21 were event-free at the end of treatment and five were reported to demonstrate a significant reduction in frequency, but no P value for this was provided. Psychotherapy was reported to be ineffective for one of the patients. At six-month follow-up, three of the patients who had been episode-free at the end of treatment reported recurrence of non-epileptic events. They were given two to three more sessions and were reported to respond effectively. As a result of their study, <LINK REF="STD-Rusch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rusch 2001</LINK> grouped the 26 adults who completed treatment into six categories based on psychosocial history, non-epileptic event aetiology and mechanisms of and response to specific psychotherapeutic interventions. For example, six of the 26 responded to accurate identification of anxiety and panic symptoms and cognitive therapy with exposure; and two of the 26 responded to insight-oriented psychotherapy to recognise both the physical and emotional consequences of adverse conditions and experience etc.<B>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:27:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients with non-epileptic seizures represent a heterogeneous group with diverse psychological problems against a background of longstanding physical, psychological or sexual abuse, inadequate social skills and chronic adjustment problems (<LINK REF="REF-Devinsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devinsky 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Francis-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Francis 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reilly-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reilly 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rusch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rusch 2001</LINK>). Consequently, non-epileptic seizures represent a serious problem for the patient, the family and the treating clinician. The costs to society can be significant with reported costs in the US of USD 100,000 per year per patient (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2003</LINK>). The challenge for the treating clinician relates to providing an accurate diagnosis and an effective treatment. The evidence for how best to manage and treat patients with this condition, however, is scarce.</P>
<P>This review considers the evidence provided by four randomised controlled trials and several before and after studies. Non-randomised studies provide important indicators for future treatment options and research, however, they are not considered to be gold standard. Unfortunately in this population much of the evidence is provided by studies using a non-randomised design. This review found that non-randomised studies were the research methodology of choice, however, the interventions under investigation were heterogeneous as was the patient population. Deciding on the relative efficacy of different treatment options in some studies was complicated by the use of multiple interventions being used within the same research paradigm. These studies were not designed to compare the relative contributions towards the treatment outcomes.</P>
<P>A number of authors have recognised the benefits of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), including <LINK REF="REF-Betts-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lesser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesser 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Ramani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramani 1993</LINK>. There was a clear recognition by these authors that patients with non-epileptic seizures would benefit from cognitive behavioural treatment and this should be in the context of a multidisciplinary team (<LINK REF="REF-Betts-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Betts 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lesser-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesser 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramani-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramani 1993</LINK>). We found one randomised clinical trial of CBT in the non-epileptic seizure patient group (<LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2010</LINK>). The study was well designed and reported a significant reduction in seizure frequency at the end of treatment. However, at follow-up reduction of seizures continued but this did not reach statistical significance. Although the authors concluded that CBT is effective in reducing psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), the non-significant result at follow-up calls the long-term effectiveness of this approach into question. A similar randomised controlled trial (RCT) of guided self help in patients with medically unexplained symptoms also found reduced effectiveness at follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 2011</LINK>). Despite this, the <LINK REF="STD-Goldstein-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Goldstein 2010</LINK> study represents the strongest evidence we found of an effective intervention for people with non-epileptic attacks.</P>
<P>With regard to review outcomes, our primary measure was seizure reduction and the secondary outcome measures were quality of life and seizure severity. Within the included studies, seizure frequency was the primary outcome in most. However, only four studies reported quality of life outcomes and non-examined seizure severity.</P>
<P>This review, like previous reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Rusch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Rusch 2001</LINK>), clearly highlights that there is little evidence from well-designed trials to inform treating physicians as to what therapeutic treatments exist and how effective they may be for this condition. According to Reuber and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Reuber-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuber 2005</LINK>) lessons can, however, be drawn from the treatment of similar types of psychopathology (somatoform disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and hypochondria), where cognitive behavioural treatment is considered the psychological treatment of choice. Finally, it is difficult to disagree with the view of Devinsky who comments that while "our ability to diagnose NES has advanced significantly in the past two decades, our understanding of its pathophysiology and our ability to provide effective treatment has progressed in small tentative steps in the past century" (<LINK REF="REF-Devinsky-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devinsky 1998</LINK>). It would seem that the status quo remains.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-01-13 10:27:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence provided by the included RCTs show benefits for the intervention under study in seizure reduction. One RCT investigated CBT in people with non-epileptic attack disorder and we rated the evidence as high quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). We rated three other RCTs, looking at a variety of behavioural interventions in people with conversion disorder in synthesis, as moderate quality (see <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>). We rated the non-randomised evidence for behavioural interventions in people with non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) as very low quality due to methodological weaknesses (see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>) and we rated the non-randomised evidence for conversion disorder patients as low quality (See <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). Overall, this evidence was problematic due to the variety of interventions under study. There is a lack of both RCTs and non-randomised studies which investigate the effectiveness of individual behavioural interventions delivered to people with NEAD. The evidence presented within this review therefore requires cautious interpretation.</P>
