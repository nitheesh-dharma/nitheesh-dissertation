</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:34:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Few areas of arthritis care management generate as much emotional controversy as the use of low dose corticosteroids for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Low dose corticosteroid use in RA is currently widespread with up to 80% of patients using prednisone or similar corticosteroid preparations in many arthritis practices (<LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Saag-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 1996</LINK>). Despite a relative paucity of published data, several authors have debated the value of corticosteroids for the treatment of RA (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Remus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Remus 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1993</LINK>). Weiss advocated a disease modifying role for corticosteroids in RA and Kirwan's randomized, double-blind controlled trial supports this view (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>). Caldwell and Furst proposed that corticosteroids should be used cautiously as a "bridge" to the safer, more effective slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Caldwell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldwell 1991</LINK>). Weisman suggested that low dose corticosteroids provide near complete disease activity control in people with a good prognosis, and that they can assist with symptomatic management of patients with seropositive, aggressive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Weisman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisman 1993</LINK>). In contrast, Ramos-Remus, McDougall, Russell, and colleagues have emphasized corticosteroid toxicity and the natural preservation of functional status that may occur in patients not treated with prednisone (<LINK REF="REF-Ramos_x002d_Remus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos-Remus 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McDougall-1994" TYPE="STUDY">McDougall 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>Despite these qualitative reviews, there has been no quantitative analysis of the literature evaluating the effectiveness of moderate-term low dose corticosteroids for control of RA disease activity. Meta-analysis (MA) provides an appropriate statistical framework for quantitatively combining the results of several studies on a similar topic (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mann-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Nettleman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nettleman 1992</LINK>). MA has previously been used to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line therapies and short-term low dose prednisolone for the treatment of RA (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Felson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 1998</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aims of our investigation were to perform a systematic qualitative review of studies evaluating low-dose corticosteroid efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. We sought to quantitatively combine results from similar studies using meta-analysis to determine summary measures of corticosteroid efficacy. </P>
<P>Based on clinical perceptions, we hypothesized that low-dose corticosteroids would prove to be significantly better than placebo and at least equivalent to active controls in improving rheumatoid arthritis disease activity over the moderate term.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:34:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Criteria for inclusion were based on recommendations of the conference on Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (<LINK REF="REF-OMERACT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">OMERACT 1993</LINK>). We accepted only studies that were randomized controlled or cross-over trials lasting 3 months or longer.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with a diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We included studies that used prednisone (or a comparable corticosteroid preparation) at a mean dose of less than or equal to 15 mg per day. We included studies that utilized either placebo controls or active controls (i.e. comparative studies).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>We required studies to report at least one of the following outcome measures in a quantitative fashion: joint tenderness (JT), joint swelling (JS), grip strength (GS), or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</P>
<P>We reported the results of all available outcomes suggested by OMERACT, including: JT, JS, ESR, pain, functional status (FS), patient global assessment, and physician global assessment. We also report grip strength (GS). We did not consider radiographic outcomes in this review since we were evaluating treatment duration substantially shorter than the one year period currently recommended for evaluation of radiographic change in RA.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-11-05 16:34:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using "corticosteroids" and "rheumatoid arthritis" as subject headings we performed a computerized literature search of all English language clinical studies from MEDLINE inception in 1966 through to May 1998. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register will be searched for the next update. The search strategy is in <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>We also hand-searched all issues of Arthritis and Rheumatism as well as the Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology from their dates of first publication to 1994. To ensure completeness, two independent reviewers examined the reference lists of all identified studies. Furthermore, we examined all Arthritis and Rheumatism abstracts over the period 1980 to 1994 in order to identify preliminary studies that had not been published. The authors of all unpublished manuscripts were contacted.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Once study selection was complete, data on outcome measures was abstracted from the studies at the baseline time point and at the time point closest to six months of follow-up for both the corticosteroid and the control arms. Data was abstracted by two independent reviewers (LC, KS) using a standard form. During data abstraction, any ambiguities were resolved by consensus of the reviewers, or in several cases by contacting the authors of a given report. We also abstracted data for other variables that might affect outcomes including: patient age, sex, duration of disease, severity of disease (indicated by baseline joint counts and rheumatoid factor seropositivity), and the source of funding for each study.</P>
<P>We conducted a standard meta-analysis using methods for continuous data developed by Hedges and Olkin (Hedges 82) and described recently by Petitti (Petitti 94). A fixed effects model was used unless the test for homogeneity indicated significant heterogeneity among the studies. The homogeneity of the trials for each pooled analysis was estimated using a chi-square test. In case of significant heterogeneity, a random effects model was used. </P>
<P>When the scale of a particular outcome varied among the studies, we calculated a standardized mean difference for that outcome. Specifically, we calculated the standardized mean difference in the endpoint outcomes between the corticosteroid and control arms. When there was consistency across studies in the outcome scale used, we calculated the weighted mean difference between the endpoint treatment and control arms. Baseline standard deviations for each treatment arm were used in these calculations using RevMan 3.1. Negative values indicate a benefit of corticosteroids over the control arm.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Although we identified thirty-four studies of interest for the meta-analysis, only seven studies met criteria for inclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Million-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Schaardenburg-95" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schaardenburg 95</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Gestel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Gestel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stenberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenberg 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Empire-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Empire 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>). Five were placebo-controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Million-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Gestel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Gestel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stenberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenberg 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>) and the other two were active-controlled studies comparing prednisone to another agent, which included chloroquine (Van Schaardebburg 95) and aspirin (Empire 55). The seven studies were published between 1955-1995. Characteristics of the included studies are shown in the table of Characteristics of Included Studies. </P>
<P>Although the study by Million et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Million-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1984</LINK>) reported many outcomes, standard deviations were not provided for most outcomes and pain was available only at 10 years. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK> reported an articular index derived from both joint pain and swelling scores, weighted by the size of the joint. We therefore used this information for both the JT and JS outcome calculations.</P>
<P>Of the studies selected, all enrolled only adults ( &gt; 18 years old), and in six of the seven selected studies at least 90% of subjects were documented to satisfy either the 1958 or 1987 ACR (American College of Rheumatology, formerly American Rheumatism Association) criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. The seventh study was conducted before ACR criteria were in use but the authors indicated that all subjects with arthritis diagnoses other than RA were excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Empire-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Empire 1995</LINK>). In all but two studies, background use of second-line agents and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents was allowed. In total, approximately 35 to 45% of subjects in both the corticosteroid and control treatment arms were receiving second-line agents concurrently.<BR/> <BR/>Joint tenderness, joint swelling, grip strength, and ESR were reported most commonly. Particularly deficient, and used only in recent studies, were measures of patient functional assessment using instruments such as the Health Assessment Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Fries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1982</LINK>) or the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Meenan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meenan 1982</LINK>). Ritchie articular index or other quantitative evaluations of joint scores (when reported) were equated with tender joint count (<LINK REF="STD-Ritchie-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Ritchie 1968</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Eberl-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eberl 1976</LINK>).</P>
<P>The excluded studies and reasons for exclusion are summarized in the table of excluded studies. Many studies had more than one reason for exclusion. Of the other twenty-seven studies excluded from the meta-analysis, twelve did not randomize subjects, three used an average corticosteroid dose above 15 mg per day and seven were of less than three months duration. Two studies used an alternative corticosteroid preparation (deflazacort) as the control arm, and five studies were continuations of earlier reports already included. Of note, from the multiple publications of the Empire Rheumatism Council and the Joint Commission of the Medical Research Council and Nuffield Foundation, we included only one study comparing cortisone with aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Empire-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Empire 1995</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All included studies were formally evaluated for quality using Jadad's scale, which ranges from -2 to +5 (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>). Six of the seven included studies were also formally assessed using a method developed by <LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1981</LINK>. This technique assigns a maximum of 100 points to each study depending on the quality of its design. Chalmer's method weights the degree of blinding most heavily, but it also considers other characteristics including the choice of analytic techniques and the control of bias. </P>
<P>Of note and reflected in the quality ratings, only 4 of the 7 studies used a double blind design (<LINK REF="STD-Harris-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Stenberg-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stenberg 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Gestel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van Gestel 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kirwan-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kirwan 1995</LINK>).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The included studies involved 253 patients randomized to corticosteroids, 177 to placebo, 50 to ASA and 28 to chloroquine.</P>
<P>The results of our pooled analysis comparing corticosteroids to placebo controls indicated that corticosteroids were significantly more effective than placebo for four of the six outcomes available. The standardized (or weighted) mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for the six outcomes were: JT = -0.37 (95%CI: -0.59, -0.14), JS = -0.41 (-0.67, -0.16), pain = -0.43 (-0.74, -0.12), FS = -0.57 (-0.92, -0.22), GS = +0.30 (-0.19, +0.80), and ESR (WMD) = -7.03 (-18.06, +4.01). </P>
<P>Only a single trial compared corticosteroids (prednisone) to aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Empire-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Empire 1995</LINK>), and only two outcomes were available for this comparison. This comparison indicated no statistically significant difference between these groups for the two outcomes assessed [SMD for JT = +0.10 (-0.35, +0.55), WMD for ESR = 0.00 (-11.09, +11.09)].</P>
<P>Four outcomes were available for the single trial that compared prednisone to chloroquine treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Schaardenburg-95" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schaardenburg 95</LINK>). The results of this study suggested that the effectiveness of these two agents is similar. Specifically, the SMD (or WMD) for the four outcomes were: JT = +0.23 (-0.30, +0.75), JS = +0.43 (-0.11, +0.96), FS = -0.27 (-0.80, +0.26), and ESR (WMD) = -16.00 (-30.58, -1.42). </P>
<P>All results reported were derived from fixed effects models because we did not find evidence of significant study heterogeneity for any of the comparisons.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Our findings highlight the limited data available which directly assess the moderate-term effectiveness of low-dose corticosteroids for RA. It was surprising to us that in an area as controversial as this one, published information is so sparse. Furthermore, the existing studies are of generally poor quality reflecting weaknesses in study design. The results of our pooled analyses indicate that corticosteroids appear to be more effective than placebo and comparable to active controls in improving most conventional outcome measures. </P>
<P>Our analysis was not intended to address the relative toxicity of corticosteroids; toxicity concerns have been previously investigated in observational studies by us and others (<LINK REF="REF-Michel-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michel 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Saag-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1995</LINK>). However, putative corticosteroid toxicity was not inconsequential in the studies included in our analysis. For example, in Million and colleagues' study two deaths and six vertebral fractures were potentially attributable to corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Million-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1984</LINK>). In comparison, however, second-line agents used to treat RA are also associated with serious side-effects (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1992</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Fries-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fries 1993</LINK>) and this may limit their long-term usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Iannuzzi-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iannuzzi 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1989</LINK>). Given the drawbacks of the currently available second-line agents, as well as data showing that corticosteroids are the RA therapy least likely to be discontinued by a rheumatologist over a five year period (<LINK REF="REF-Pincus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pincus 1992</LINK>), we undertook this critical assessment of the RA corticosteroid effectiveness literature. </P>
<P>The subjects included in our meta-analysis are representative of the general RA population likely to be prescribed corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Byron-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byron 1986</LINK>). However, the generalizability of our results to older, rheumatoid arthritis patients and to patients with a longer duration of disease may be limited due to the relatively younger age distribution and shorter disease duration of our subjects. Although one of our studies included only subjects with elderly onset rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Schaardenburg-95" TYPE="STUDY">Van Schaardenburg 95</LINK>), this study was too small to allow us to determine whether the effectiveness of corticosteroids for RA treatment is systematically different among older RA patients.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis is not a substitute for large, well designed controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Borzak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borzak 1995</LINK>). However, it provides a formal quantitative synthesis of the available data (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1992</LINK>). There are general limitations of meta-analysis (particularly those describing arthritis therapies) including methodologic ambiguities in dealing with continuous data and the potential for publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1987</LINK>). In addition to these general meta-analysis limitations, our corticosteroid meta-analysis was further limited by the small number of studies satisfying inclusion criteria. Indeed, the small number of included studies limits our ability to perform sensitivity analyses among subgroups of the studies. </P>
<P>Background therapy, which included second line drugs in many studies, also may confound interpretation of corticosteroid's independent effect. However, subject randomization and a generally equivalent use of second-line agents in both the corticosteroid and the non-corticosteroid treatment arms largely eliminates these concerns. </P>
<P>Data beyond one year were not available in sufficient studies to perform a longer-term meta-analysis and determine whether improvements demonstrated over shorter periods are sustained beyond 6-12 months.<BR/>In this meta-analysis, we focused on disease activity outcome measures routinely included in arthritis clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1990</LINK>). Although these measures of disease activity are not a substitute for long-term evaluation of disease progression (most often assessed by radiographic changes) disease activity measures have a strong association with long-term disease outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Hassell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hassell 1993</LINK>). As particularly evident in the report by Million et al, and in the open-label study of Bernsten and others (not included in the meta-analysis), improvements in disease activity parameters are strongly correlated with patient satisfaction and with better functional ability (<LINK REF="STD-Million-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Million 1984</LINK>, Bernsten 61). In a condition like rheumatoid arthritis with such profound socioeconomic consequences (<LINK REF="REF-Yelin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yelin 1995</LINK>), even moderate term improvement in function may be a worthwhile objective from both a patient and a societal perspective.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Although our findings are based on very few controlled studies, they generally uphold the widely held belief that corticosteroids, when administered for periods of approximately 6 months, are effective for the treatment of RA.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further investigation is needed to carefully weigh the relative effectiveness of corticosteroids by their known toxicity, and to assess the effectiveness of longer corticosteroid treatment periods.</P>
