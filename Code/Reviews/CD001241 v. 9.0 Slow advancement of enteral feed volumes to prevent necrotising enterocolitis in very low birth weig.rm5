<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does limiting the rate of increase in milk feeds that very low birth weight infants receive each day during the first few weeks after birth reduce the risk of severe bowel problems?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Very low birth weight infants (infants weighing &lt; 1500 grams at birth) are at risk of developing a severe bowel disorder called necrotising enterocolitis (where the bowel becomes inflamed and dies). It is thought that one way to prevent this condition may be to limit the milk feeds that infants receive each day for the first few weeks after birth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for clinical trials comparing slow versus faster rates of increase in the amount of milk fed to newborn infants who were very low birth weight. When performing searches updated in June 2017, we found 10 trials involving 3753 infants in total.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Combined analysis of these trials did not show an effect of slow feeding on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis or death (moderate-quality evidence) but did suggest that infants fed more slowly might have higher risk of acquiring a severe infection than infants fed more quickly (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>Slow feeding does not appear to provide benefits and may cause some harms.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-03 22:09:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early enteral feeding practices are potentially modifiable risk factors for necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Observational studies suggest that conservative feeding regimens, including slowly advancing enteral feed volumes, reduce the risk of NEC. However, slow feed advancement may delay establishment of full enteral feeding and may be associated with metabolic and infectious morbidities secondary to prolonged exposure to parenteral nutrition.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-03 22:12:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard Cochrane Neonatal search strategy to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to June 2017), Embase (1980 to June 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to June 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, previous reviews, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-04 12:58:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We analysed treatment effects in individual trials and reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous data, and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analyses and explored potential causes of heterogeneity via sensitivity analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-06 15:31:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 10 RCTs in which a total of 3753 infants participated (2804 infants participated in one large trial). Most participants were stable very preterm infants of birth weight appropriate for gestation. About one-third of all participants were extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW), and about one-fifth were small for gestational age (SGA), growth-restricted, or compromised in utero, as indicated by absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocity (AREDFV) in the fetal umbilical artery. Trials typically defined slow advancement as daily increments of 15 to 20 mL/kg, and faster advancement as daily increments of 30 to 40 mL/kg. Trials generally were of good methodological quality, although none was blinded.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses did not show effects on risk of NEC (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.39; RD 0.0, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02) or all-cause mortality (typical RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.42; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03). Subgroup analyses of extremely preterm or ELBW infants, or of SGA or growth-restricted or growth-compromised infants, showed no evidence of an effect on risk of NEC or death. Slow feed advancement delayed establishment of full enteral nutrition by between about one and five days. Meta-analysis showed borderline increased risk of invasive infection (typical RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05). The GRADE quality of evidence for primary outcomes was "moderate", downgraded from "high" because of lack of blinding in the included trials.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-03 22:23:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available trial data do not provide evidence that advancing enteral feed volumes at daily increments of 15 to 20 mL/kg (compared with 30 to 40 mL/kg) reduces the risk of NEC or death in very preterm or VLBW infants, extremely preterm or ELBW infants, SGA or growth-restricted infants, or infants with antenatal AREDFV. Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at a slow rate results in several days of delay in establishing full enteral feeds and may increase the risk of invasive infection.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-04 13:31:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), a syndrome of acute intestinal necrosis of unknown aetiology, affects about 5% of very preterm (&lt; 32 weeks) or very low birth weight (VLBW) (&lt; 1500 grams) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Gagliardi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagliardi 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moro-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 2009</LINK>). Infants who develop NEC experience more infections, have lower levels of nutrient intake, grow more slowly, and have longer durations of intensive care and hospital stay than gestation-comparable infants who do not develop NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Bisquera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisquera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guthrie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guthrie 2003</LINK>). The associated mortality rate is greater than 20%. Compared with their peers, infants who develop NEC have a higher incidence of long-term neurological disability, which may be a consequence of infection and undernutrition during a critical period of brain development (<LINK REF="REF-Berrington-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrington 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pike-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pike 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soraisham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soraisham 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-06 15:26:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low gestational age at birth is the major clinical risk factor for developing NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Beeby-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beeby 1992</LINK>). The other major risk factor is intrauterine growth restriction, especially if it is associated with absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocities in Doppler studies of the foetal aorta or umbilical artery (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garite-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garite 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Luig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luig 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samuels-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuels 2017</LINK>). Most very preterm or VLBW infants who develop NEC have received enteral milk feeds. Evidence shows that feeding with artificial formula rather than human milk increases the risk of developing NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2014</LINK>). Other differences in enteral feeding regimens, such as the timing of introduction of feeds and the size of daily volume increments, may also contribute to inter-unit variation in the incidence of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Chauhan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chauhan 2008</LINK>). Multi-centre benchmarking studies have found that neonatal centres where enteral feeding is introduced earlier and feeding volumes are advanced more quickly tend to report higher incidences of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1991</LINK>). Observational studies have suggested that delaying the introduction of enteral feeds beyond the first few days after birth, or increasing the volume of feeds by less than about 20 to 24 mL/kg body weight each day, is associated with lower risk of developing NEC in very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeown-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeown 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patole-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2005</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-04 13:05:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential disadvantages associated with slowing the advancement of enteral feed volumes include delaying establishment of full enteral nutrition and extending the duration of receipt of parenteral nutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Flidel_x002d_Rimon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flidel-Rimon 2004</LINK>). Prolonged use of parenteral nutrition is associated with infectious and metabolic risks that may have adverse consequences for survival, growth, and development (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>). It has been argued that the risk of NEC should not be considered in isolation from these other potential clinical outcomes when feeding policies and practices for very preterm or VLBW infants are determined (<LINK REF="REF-Flidel_x002d_Rimon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flidel-Rimon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00e4_rtel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Härtel 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other Cochrane reviews have addressed the questions of whether delaying the introduction of any enteral milk feeding or restricting feed volumes to trophic levels (minimal enteral nutrition) affects the risk of NEC in very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2014a</LINK>). This review focused on the question of whether advancing feed volumes at slow rates compared with faster rates affected risks of NEC, mortality, and other morbidities.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-04 13:20:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Available trial data do not provide evidence that advancing enteral feed volumes at slow rates (15 to 20 mL/kg/d) compared with faster rates (30 to 40 mL/kg/d) reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The boundaries of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimate of effect are consistent with either two extra or one fewer cases of NEC in every 100 infants who have slow rates of feed advancement. Meta-analysis of data from these trials did not show an effect on all-cause mortality, and prespecified subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant effects on risk of NEC or death among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) or extremely preterm infants, nor among infants with growth restriction or evidence of absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocity (AREDFV). Meta-analysis of data from eight trials showed borderline higher risk of late-onset infection among infants who had slow advancement of enteral feeds. The point estimate suggested that an extra episode of late-onset infection occurs for every 33 infants who have slow feed advancement.</P>
<P>Infants who had slow advancement of feed volumes established full enteral feeding and regained birth weight several days later than infants who had faster rates of advancement of feed volumes. The clinical importance of these effects is unclear, as longer-term growth or developmental outcomes were not assessed. The included trials did not show consistent evidence of an important effect on duration of hospital admission.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-04 13:37:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most participants in the included trials were stable very preterm or VLBW infants of birth weight appropriate for gestational age. About one-third of all participants were extremely preterm or ELBW, and about one-fifth were small for gestational age, growth-restricted, or compromised in utero, as indicated by AREDFV in the foetal umbilical artery. Infants who had severe respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation or ventilatory support were eligible to participate in all but three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Karagol-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Karagol 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krishnamurthy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Krishnamurthy 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salhotra-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Salhotra 2004</LINK>). Therefore, review findings should be applicable across these populations at highest risk of developing feed intolerance or NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Luig-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luig 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most participating infants were fed, at least partially, with breast milk. Evidence indicates that artificial formula feeding increases risks of feed intolerance and NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2014</LINK>). The risk-benefit balance of enteral feeding strategies may differ between human milk-fed and formula-fed very preterm or VLBW infants, but available data were insufficient to show effects of different rates of feed advancement on important outcomes for infants fed exclusively with artificial formula. It is also unclear whether review findings can be applied to infants who receive continuous infusion of intragastric feeds, as a vast majority of the infants in included trials received enteral feeds as interval boluses. Randomised controlled trials have reported conflicting findings about the effect of continuous enteral infusion on feed tolerance in very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the finding that slow enteral feed volume advancement delays establishment of full enteral feeds may seem intuitive, it is plausible that advancing feed volumes faster could have resulted in more feed intolerance and therefore a delay in establishment of full enteral feeding. Included trials prespecified definitions of feed intolerance that mandated interrupting or ceasing feed volume advancement, principally detection of prefeed 'gastric residuals' (gastric content aspirated before a planned gastric tube feed) and abdominal distension. However, trial reports presented only limited data on the frequency of these outcomes. Furthermore, limited evidence suggests that the volume or colour of gastric residuals is predictive of risk of NEC for infants whose feed volumes are advanced conservatively (<LINK REF="REF-Cobb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bertino-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertino 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mihatsch-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihatsch 2002</LINK>). Similarly, the clinical importance of abdominal distension or bowel loops visible through the abdominal wall (without other features of intra-abdominal pathology) is unclear, especially in the modern era, when early and prolonged use of continuous positive airway pressure results in intestinal gaseous distension.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-08-04 02:02:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The GRADE quality of evidence for primary outcomes was "moderate", downgraded from "high" because of lack of blinding in the included trials (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Although these trials were generally of good methodological quality, in common with other trials of feeding interventions in this population, it was not possible to mask caregivers and clinical assessors to the nature of the intervention (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Lack of blinding may have resulted in surveillance and ascertainment biases. It is more likely, however, to have caused an overestimation of the incidence of feed intolerance and NEC among infants whose feed volumes were advanced faster. Assessment of abdominal radiographs for signs of NEC was masked in most trials to ensure that the diagnosis of severe NEC (confirmed by radiological detection of gas in the bowel wall or portal tract) was not prone to bias. However, as microbial generation of gas in the bowel wall is substrate dependent, infants who received more enteral milk (substrate) may have been more likely to demonstrate this radiological sign than infants with equally severe bowel disease who had less intraluminal substrate. This 'substrate effect' is also more likely to cause over-ascertainment of NEC among infants who had faster rates of feed volume advancement (<LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2007</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-04 02:02:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The main concern with the review process is the possibility that findings are subject to publication and other reporting biases. We attempted to minimise this threat by screening the reference lists of included trials and related reviews and searching the proceedings of major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that are not (yet) published in full form in academic journals. Only one of the meta-analyses that we performed included sufficient trials to explore symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or small study bias, and this did not show sufficient asymmetry to raise concerns (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-04 02:03:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focused specifically on the comparison of slow versus faster rates of feed volume advancement and did not compare progressive advancement with enteral fasting or trophic feeding (minimal enteral nutrition). Only one randomised controlled trial has compared trophic feeding with progressive enteral feed volume advancement (at daily increments of 20 mL/kg) (<LINK REF="STD-Berseth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Berseth 2003</LINK>). Although this trial found the risk of NEC to be statistically significantly higher among infants whose feed volumes were progressively advanced, this finding should be interpreted cautiously. The trial was stopped early following an interim analysis; therefore, the finding of an effect on the incidence of NEC may be spurious (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2005</LINK>). Caregivers and assessors were not blinded to the intervention. As discussed above, this may have resulted in several sources of bias that are likely to cause an overestimation of the incidence of NEC among infants whose feed volumes are being advanced.</P>

<P>Advancing enteral feed volumes at slow rates (slower than 24 mL/kg/d) does not reduce the risk of feed intolerance, NEC, or death in very preterm or VLBW infants, including extremely preterm or ELBW infants, or in infants who are growth-restricted or growth-compromised in utero. Advancing the volume of enteral feeds at faster rates (daily increments of 30 to 40 mL/kg) shortens by several days the time taken to regain birth weight and establish full enteral feeds, and may reduce the risk of late-onset invasive infection.</P>

<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation and blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved any disagreement by discussion. We added this information to the table 'Characteristics of included studies'. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the risk of bias table.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. High risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or class of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and</P>
<P>b. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel.</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk for outcome assessors;</P>
<P>b. High risk for outcome assessors; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (when it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. High risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk;</P>
<P>b. High risk; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
