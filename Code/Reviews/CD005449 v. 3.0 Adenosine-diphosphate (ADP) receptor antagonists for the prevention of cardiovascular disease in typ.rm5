<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-05 11:34:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Patients with type 2 diabetes have a much higher risk of strokes and heart attacks than the general population. Most strokes and heart attacks are caused by blood clots. Adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists are drugs which prevent the aggregation ('clumping') of platelets and consequently reduce the formation of blood clots. These medications are used to prevent cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks and strokes in the general population. This review assessed if these medications would be useful in patients with diabetes. We included eight trials with 21,379 patients and a mean duration of follow-up ranging from 365 to 913 days. Specific data for patients with diabetes were only available in full for one of these trials and partial data were available for two trials. Analysis of the available data demonstrated that adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine) were not more effective than other blood thinning drugs or placebo for death from any cause, death related to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes. There was no available information on the effects of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists on health-related quality of life, adverse effects specially for people with diabetes, or costs. The use of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes needs to be guided by the information available from trials which included patients with and without diabetes. All future trials on adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists should include data which relate specifically to patients with diabetes in order to inform evidence-based clinical guidelines.</P>

<P>Eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes were included. Three included studies investigated ticlopidine compared to aspirin or placebo.

<P>Data for diabetes patients on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality and myocardial infarction were only available for one trial (355 patients). This trial compared ticlopidine to placebo and did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences for all-cause mortality, vascular mortality or myocardial infarction.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-12 01:20:24 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nyoli A Valentine">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About', 'Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the role of platelets</HEADING>
<P>The most prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus is cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is estimated that 65% of patients with type 2 diabetes die of a cause related to atherosclerosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gu 1998</LINK>). Risk of mortality and morbidity due to myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral arterial disease are two- to four-fold increased compared with the general population. Once diagnosed with having diabetes, overall survival is comparable to a patient with a prior myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Haffner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffner 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the upcoming pandemic of patients with diabetes, world wide prevalence is expected to increase from 2.8% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2030 (<LINK REF="REF-Wild-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wild 2004</LINK>), cardiovascular disease will continue to be responsible for a large proportion of global healthcare expenditures. This stresses the need for preventive measures. In the development of a cardiovascular event, platelets play an important role. Platelet adhesion and subsequent activation on dysfunctional endothelium fuel the inflammatory process in the atherosclerotic plaque. After disruption of the plaque, large aggregates of platelets lead to vessel occlusion. In the patient with diabetes, anti-aggregatory mechanisms in the endothelium are impaired (<LINK REF="REF-Ceriello-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceriello 2004</LINK>). Platelets are more susceptible to activation and aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Kutti-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kutti 1986</LINK>) and antifibrinolytic activity is attenuated (<LINK REF="REF-Colwell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colwell 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-12 01:20:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) is a platelet activator that is released from red blood cells, activated platelets and damaged endothelial cells which induces platelet adhesion and aggregation (<LINK REF="REF-Kam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kam 2003</LINK>). ADP receptor antagonists noncompetitively and irreversibly inhibit platelet ADP receptors preventing platelet activation. This prevents the activations of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor complex and prolongs bleeding time, impairs platelet aggregation and fibrinogen-mediated platelet cross-linking (<LINK REF="REF-Goodwin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goodwin 2011</LINK>). The result is a 50% to 70% inhibition of platelet fibrinogen binding achieved after three to five days (<LINK REF="REF-Kam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kam 2003</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Gastrointestinal side effects and skin rashes are common. Neutropenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are significant but rarely fatal adverse events. Recovery of platelet function is delayed after discontinuation of the medication for approximately three to seven days (<LINK REF="REF-Kam-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kam 2003</LINK>). In terms of cost, ADP receptor antagonists are considerably more expensive than aspirin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-05-02 16:13:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nyoli A Valentine">
<P>There are clues that ADP receptor antagonists are superior to aspirin in preventing cardiovascular disease. In a Cochrane review, clopidogrel and ticlopidine were slightly, but significantly, more effective than aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in high-risk patients (previous clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease) (<LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>). Other evidence was derived from an analysis of the diabetic subgroup in the CAPRIE-study. In that trial, 15.6% of patients with diabetes experienced a vascular endpoint versus 17.7% in the aspirin group (P = 0.042). In addition, patients in the clopidogrel group had less bleeding events: 1.8% versus 2.8% in the aspirin group (P = 0.031) (<LINK REF="REF-Bhatt-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatt 2002</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-10-12 01:20:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Nyoli A Valentine">
<P>Despite the evidence for possible advantages, the role of ADP receptor antagonists in the treatment of patients with diabetes seems to be limited. A recent position statement by the American Diabetes Association suggested the use of clopidogrel only in case of allergy for aspirin or in combination therapy with aspirin for one year after acute coronary syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2011</LINK>). The high costs of ADP receptor antagonists seem to be the major reason for the modest position these drugs have in treatment strategies. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses is lacking for ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes. To value the use of these agents in the treatment of patients with diabetes, a well-designed systematic review is needed.</P>

<P>As there was substantial clinical heterogeneity, study results were only reported as meta-analytically pooled effect estimates for stroke (fatal and non-fatal). We identified heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, by using a standard Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>test and a significance level of &#945; = 0.1, in view of the low power of this test. We specifically examined heterogeneity with the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic quantifying inconsistency across studies to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), where an I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic of 75% and more indicates a considerable level of inconsistency (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

A total of 21,379 patients with diabetes participated in the eight studies. The mean duration of follow-up was 913 days (range 365 days to 2373 days).</P>
<P>Three of the included studies investigated ticlopidine (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CATS-1988" TYPE="STUDY">CATS 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS-1989" TYPE="STUDY">TASS 1989</LINK>).

One study compared clopidogrel to aspirin in 3866 diabetes patients with ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-PRoFESS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PRoFESS 2008</LINK> study compared clopidogrel to aspirin and dipyridamole in 20,332 patients with ischaemic stroke, of which 5473 patients had diabetes.

<P>For most studies, data for patients with diabetes were incomplete. Although eight trials comparing ADP receptor antagonists with other antiplatelet drugs or placebo were eligible for inclusion, only three provided data on patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-CATS-1988" TYPE="STUDY">CATS 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRoFESS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PRoFESS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS-1989" TYPE="STUDY">TASS 1989</LINK>) and only one <LINK REF="STD-CATS-1988" TYPE="STUDY">CATS 1988</LINK> provided data on more than one outcome for patients with diabetes. Authors of all eight trials were contacted, one author provided information (<LINK REF="STD-CATS-1988" TYPE="STUDY">CATS 1988</LINK>), the author of one study declined to provide information (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS 2003</LINK>), one author did not have any further data (<LINK REF="STD-PRoFESS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PRoFESS 2008</LINK>) and the authors of the five remaining studies did not respond to two requests (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHARISMA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHARISMA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CURE-1998" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS-1989" TYPE="STUDY">TASS 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>All trials reported on safety and adverse outcomes for all included patients; however, none of the trials reported on adverse outcomes for patients with diabetes separately. For all patients, all four trials comparing ADP receptor antagonists with aspirin noted slightly lower bleeding rates for clopidogrel and ticlopidine compared to aspirin or aspirin and dipyridamole in combination (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS-2003" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE-1996" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PRoFESS-2008" TYPE="STUDY">PRoFESS 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS-1989" TYPE="STUDY">TASS 1989</LINK>). However, these trials used higher doses of aspirin than are commonly prescribed today. The trial comparing ticlopidine to placebo noted one serious bleeding event in the placebo group compared with two serious bleeding events in the ticlopidine group (<LINK REF="STD-CATS-1988" TYPE="STUDY">CATS 1988</LINK>). The three trials which compared dual aspirin and clopidogrel therapy to aspirin alone all noted increased bleeding risk with dual therapy (<LINK REF="STD-CHARISMA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHARISMA 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CURE-1998" TYPE="STUDY">CURE 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2010</LINK>). A Cochrane review comparing dual therapy of clopidogrel and aspirin to aspirin alone noted there would be an additional six major bleeds per 1000 people treated (<LINK REF="REF-Squizzato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squizzato 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>None of the included trials reviewed peripheral vascular disease as a cardiovascular endpoint. No trial used standard diagnostic criteria to diagnose diabetes and none of the trials separated patients into type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>There are no trials specifically designed to look at the efficacy and safety of ADP receptor antagonists for patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes have different metabolism and platelet function to patients without diabetes which predisposes them to cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Angiolillo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angiolillo 2009</LINK>) and this may change the efficacy and safety of ADP receptor antagonists.</P>
<P>The use of ADP receptor antagonists in diabetes patients is based on evidence for their use from the analysis of patients with and without diabetes. Many major guidelines now recommend the use of clopidogrel in certain situations. For example, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommend clopidogrel for 12 months in all patients with unstable angina or non-ST elevated myocardial infarction with a six month mortality risk of greater than 1.5% (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>), based on the CURE trial findings. As a result, many patients with diabetes are being prescribed ADP receptor antagonists and newer ADP receptor antagonists are now compared to clopidogrel rather than to other antiplatelet agents despite there being limited evidence for patients with diabetes.</P>
<P>The intention of this review was to assess the use of ADP receptor antagonists in primary and secondary prevention. However, all of the trials except one (<LINK REF="STD-CHARISMA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">CHARISMA 2002</LINK>) enrolled patients who had previous cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events. ADP receptor antagonists in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in high risk vascular patients was investigated by the CHARISMA trial, however, outcome data for patients with diabetes were unavailable from this trial.</P>

<P>Most studies reported composite end points as well as individual outcome events.

<P>The largest meta-analysis of antiplatelet therapy versus control was done by the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Antithrombotic-Trialists_x0027_-Collaboration-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration 2002</LINK>). This meta-analysis reviewed all antiplatelet agents including aspirin and failed to show a statistically significant reduction in risk of serious vascular events in patients with diabetes.</P>
<P>There are two Cochrane reviews on ADP receptor antagonists which differ from our review as they are not limited to patients with diabetes. One review included all patients with previous clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis of the cerebral, coronary or peripheral circulation and assessed the composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. This review noted that ADP receptor antagonists modestly reduced the odds of a serious vascular event when compared to aspirin. The result just reached statistical significance (11.6% versus 12.5%, OR 0.92 (0.85 to 0.99)) and the authors concluded that ADP receptor antagonists were at least as effective as aspirin, possibly more so (<LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>). A different Cochrane review of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone included all patients with known cardiovascular disease or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. The authors concluded that in patients with acute non-ST coronary syndromes the benefits of clopidogrel plus aspirin outweighed the harms (<LINK REF="REF-Squizzato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squizzato 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The role of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes is unclear. The use of ADP receptors for prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes needs to be guided by evidence available from analysis done on all patients, including those with and without diabetes. Current available evidence analysed in previous Cochrane reviews suggests ADP receptor antagonists were at least as effective as aspirin, possibly more so in preventing cardiovascular disease in secondary prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Sudlow-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sudlow 2009</LINK>) and that in acute non-ST coronary syndromes the benefits of clopidogrel and aspirin outweighed the harms (<LINK REF="REF-Squizzato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Squizzato 2011</LINK>). Another factor to take into account is the cost of ADP receptor antagonists which in many countries is significantly higher than aspirin.</P>

<P>All future trials should separately report outcome data for patients with diabetes to allow for development of clinical guidelines for this specific patient population. Any previously conducted trial should make diabetes specific data available for analysis regardless of outcomes. Improved identification and thorough analysis of subgroups of diabetes patients in large primary and secondary prevention trials would provide a more solid evidence base for recommendations for primary and secondary prevention in diabetes patients.</P>

<P>At the time of protocol publication, it was anticipated there would be more data on patients with diabetes available for this review. Due to the limited data available, we were not able to undertake various statistical analyses. The protocol stated that data would be extracted on outcomes including peripheral artery disease, health-related quality of life and costs; however, these were not available. Similarly, data were not available on potential patient covariates such as compliance and glycaemic control.</P>
<P>The protocol also intended for an analysis to be done on patients with type 2 diabetes only. None of the included trials separated patients into type 1 and type 2 diabetes so analysis was done on all types of diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>The search strategy published in the protocol was changed as it was found to be too narrow. The actual search strategy used (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) did not include a subheading 'diabetes' as all of the trials on ADP receptor antagonists were conducted on patients both with and without diabetes.</P>
<P>The authors undertaking this review were different to the authors of the protocol due to other commitments. The title of the review has been expanded to include additional oral ADP receptor antagonists which have become available since the publication of the protocol.</P>
