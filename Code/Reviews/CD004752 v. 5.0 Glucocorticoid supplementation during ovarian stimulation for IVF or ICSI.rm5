<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does glucocorticoid supplementation improve outcomes in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation during in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles?</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on women having a glucocorticoid component added to the usual ovarian stimulation protocols versus those that received only the standard traditional ovarian stimulation protocols.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Ovarian response to stimulation during IVF and ICSI cycles plays an important role in determining live birth rates. Most ovarian stimulation regimens administer a combination of hormones to stimulate the ovaries, suppress the pituitary gland and prevent surges of natural hormones that may be detrimental to egg maturation. Various add-on (adjuvant) treatments during ovarian stimulation have been used in an attempt to improve this process, and it has been suggested that the addition of a glucocorticoid component may improve results.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), but useable data were available for only two of these. The trials compared adjuvant treatment with systemic glucocorticoids during ovarian stimulation for IVF cycles versus no placebo. The evidence is current to October 2016.</P>
<P>Key results</P>
<P>Two RCTs were included in our analyses (310 women). For the outcome of live birth, data were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data available from only one study centre.</P>
<P>There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the primary outcome of live birth rate and the secondary outcome of clinical pregnancy rate. Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with placebo is assumed to be 15%, the chance following supplementation would be between 7% and 31%, and that if the chance of clinical pregnancy with placebo is assumed to be 24%, the chance following treatment with supplementation would be between 23% and 47%. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the multiple-pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. Neither of the studies reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) or side-effects.</P>
<P>Thus, the safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates. Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on the live birth rate.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events.</P>

<P>Ovarian response to stimulation during in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) plays an important role in determining live birth rates. Adjuvant treatments during ovarian stimulation that have different modes of action have been used to improve ovarian response to stimulation and outcome of IVF. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a class of steroid hormones that have been used either alone or in combination with other stimulatory regimens in order to improve folliculogenesis and pregnancy rates. However, considerable uncertainty remains over whether administration of glucocorticoid during ovarian stimulation until oocyte recovery is superior to no glucocorticoid in improving live birth rates in women undergoing IVF/ICSI.<BR/>

<P>This review addresses the use of glucocorticoids as an adjuvant treatment during ovarian stimulation for subfertile couples with any cause of infertility undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Ovarian response to stimulation during IVF and ICSI plays an important role in determining live birth rates.<BR/>
<BR/>Most ovarian stimulation regimens employ a combination of exogenous gonadotrophins and a gonadotrophin-releasing agonist (GnRH-a) or antagonist (GnRH antagonist). It is common practice to combine gonadotrophins with a GnRH-a to suppress the pituitary gland and prevent endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion during ovarian stimulation as LH elevation in the follicular phase is detrimental to egg maturation. More recently, GnRH antagonist preparations have been used as an alternative to GnRH-a. GnRH antagonists have an immediate suppressive effect on the pituitary gland in contrast to the agonists that have an initial &#8220;flare-up&#8221; effect on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH secretion before suppression occurs.</P>
<P>Between 9% and 26% of treatment cycles respond poorly to ovarian stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 1997</LINK>). The effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving ovarian response to stimulation has been evaluated in several trials (<LINK REF="REF-Tarlatzis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlatzis 2003</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown little or no benefit in increasing the strength of gonadotrophin stimulation or the use of recombinant FSH to overcome poor ovarian response (<LINK REF="REF-Tarlatzis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlatzis 2003</LINK>). Improving ovarian responsiveness by reducing the dosage of GnRH-a or using GnRH antagonist instead of GnRH-a has not been adequately evaluated in the context of RCTS. The effectiveness of natural cycle IVF has also been poorly studied.<BR/>
<BR/>Adjuvant treatments during ovarian stimulation that have different modes of action has been used to improve ovarian response to stimulation and outcome of IVF. The effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-Khairy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khairy 2007</LINK>), growth hormone (<LINK REF="REF-Howles-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Howles 1999</LINK>), nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Battaglia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Battaglia 1999</LINK>) and steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miell 1993</LINK>) have not been adequately evaluated.</P>

<P>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a class of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids can be natural (cortisol) or synthetic (dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and 16-methyl prednisolone). They differ in the pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance), and in pharmacodynamics (for example, the capacity of retention of sodium (Na+) and water).<BR/>
<BR/>Despite the side-effects of steroid therapy (hypertension, hypernatraemia (high sodium content in the blood) and water retention, hypokalaemia (low potasium content in the blood), diabetes, osteoporosis, proximal myopathy, psychosis and peptic ulceration), which are largely dose- and duration-dependent, the adjuvant use of glucocorticoids during ovarian stimulation has been reported to be effective in improving ovarian response, reduce cycle cancellation rates (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trott 1996</LINK>), and improve IVF outcome. The overall cost of the treatment cycle may also be lower, due to reduction in the amount of gonadotropins required.<BR/>
<BR/>Glucocorticoids have been used either alone (<LINK REF="REF-Duvan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duvan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenblatt-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenblatt 1956</LINK>), in combination with clomiphene citrate (<LINK REF="REF-Daly-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daly 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Diamant-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamant 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elnashar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elnashar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kemeter-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemeter 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lobo-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lobo 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trott 1996</LINK>), or in combination with human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) (<LINK REF="STD-Bider-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bider-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Bider 1997a</LINK>), to improve folliculogenesis and pregnancy rates.<BR/>
<BR/>Although most studies have been of women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOS) who were hyper androgenic (exhibiting higher levels of testosterone and related hormones) (<LINK REF="REF-Evron-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evron 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanky 2004</LINK>) treated with clomiphene (CC), the use of steroids has also been reported to improve ovarian response in women with normal androgen levels (normoandrogenic) (<LINK REF="REF-Elnashar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elnashar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trott 1996</LINK>).<BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-08 01:03:36 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High androgen levels, regardless of their origin, are detrimental to normal folliculogenesis. Natural (for example, cortisol) and synthetic (for example, prednisolone or dexamethasone) glucocorticoids suppress androgens levels by acting on ovaries, adrenal and pituitary glands, improve follicle development and increase production of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which is known to amplify the action of gonadotropins (<LINK REF="REF-Langford-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langford 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miell 1993</LINK>). In natural cycles, higher follicular fluid cortisol:cortisone ratios have been found in pregnancy cycles compared to non-pregnancy cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Keay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keay 2002</LINK>). Immediately prior to ovulation a significant rise in follicular cortisol occurs, suggesting this steroid may exert a physiological role in final egg maturation and ovulation (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harlow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harlow 1997</LINK>). Glucocorticoids also induce changes in cytokine levels that may be an important determinant in a woman&#8217;s response to ovarian stimulation (<LINK REF="REF-Mathur-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathur 1997</LINK>).<BR/>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-03-09 00:52:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool for the following domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, providers and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias. Two review authors (TK, SB) assessed these six domains, with any disagreements resolved by consensus or by discussion with a third review author (ZP). All judgments were fully described. The conclusions are presented in the 'Risk of bias' table and are incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-03-24 14:07:10 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>For dichotomous data (for example, live birth rates), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). We anticipated that all our review outcomes would be reported as dichotomous data. We calculated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by Cochrane and found in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, section 8 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The outcome of clinical pregnancy is considered a positive consequence of treatment, therefore a higher proportion of women with a pregnancy is considered a benefit. Whereas, outcomes such as multiple pregnancy are a negative consequence therefore higher numbers are considered to be detrimental. This needs to be taken into consideration when the summary graphs are viewed.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-03-09 00:54:14 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis as far as possible, and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original investigators. Where these were unobtainable, we planned that imputation of individual values would be undertaken for the primary outcome only: live birth would be assumed not to have occurred in participants with an unreported outcome.<BR/>
<BR/>For other outcomes, only the available data were analysed. We planned that imputation undertaken would be subjected to sensitivity analysis (see below).<BR/>
<BR/>We assessed the included trials to check whether an ITT analysis was performed and if details of dropouts were extractable. If this information could not be extracted, we contacted the principal author of the trial/s. Reminders were sent to authors if there was no reply after four weeks of initial request. A second reminder was sent to authors who had not replied in that time space, after another four weeks. A letter was sent to authors, if they did not reply to the e-mails.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Fridstr_x00f6_m-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fridström 1999</LINK>) included 20 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOS) undergoing IVF, whereas the other (<LINK REF="STD-Keay-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keay 2001</LINK>) included 290 women undergoing IVF cycles.</P>
<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Fridstr_x00f6_m-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fridström 1999</LINK>, women were receiving 10 mg of prednisolone daily throughout ovarian stimulation until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Keay-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Keay 2001</LINK>, women were receiving 0.5 mg of dexamethasone daily, until hCG administration.

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-03-24 14:07:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates. Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on live birth rate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-29 11:15:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A large well-designed randomised controlled trial reporting live birth is needed. It should include assessment of the effects of different glucocorticoid administration protocols, as protocols vary.</P>

<P>
<B>Methodological update</B>
</P>
<P>More precisely, the following sensitivity analyses were added: analyses of the primary outcome using a random-effects model; analyses of the primary outcome where the summary effect measure was risk ratio rather than odds ratio; adoption of alternative methods (described in the appropriate section) of data imputation. The planned sensitivity analysis regarding exclusion of studies with outlying results was removed.</P>
<P>The implementation of "GRADE" and 'Summary of findings' table methodology is a post-protocol addition to meet current Cochrane standards.</P>
<P>We edited the wording in the Data extraction and management section to make clear that studies meeting our inclusion criteria but with no useable data would be included in the review. <BR/>
