<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:29:53 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute respiratory infection (including pneumonia) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in developing countries. Antibiotics are needed when a bacterial infection is suspected. When children are hospitalised they often receive injectable antibiotics. This has disadvantages: pain, risk of other infections and cost. There are studies that show that oral antibiotics are effective when children are treated as outpatients. The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of oral antibiotics compared to parenteral antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia in children less than five years old. Oral therapy appears to be an effective and safe alternative to parenteral antibiotics in hospitalised children with severe pneumonia who do not have any serious signs or symptoms. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the relative benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children with severe pneumonia if serious signs and symptoms are present or in children with severe pneumonia associated with bacterial confirmation or lobar consolidation on chest X-ray.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in developing countries. When hospitalisation is required, the usual practice includes administering parenteral antibiotics if a bacterial infection is suspected. This has disadvantages as it causes pain and discomfort to the children, which may lead to treatment refusal or reduced compliance. It is also associated with needle-related complications. In some settings this equipment is in short supply or unavailable necessitating transfer of the child, which increases risks and healthcare costs. </P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the equivalence in effectiveness and safety of oral antibiotic compared to parenteral antibiotic therapies in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children between three months and five years of age. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The search yielded more than 1300 titles. Only three studies met all criteria for eligibility. One of the identified trials is yet to publish its results. We did not perform a meta-analysis because of clinical heterogeneity of therapies compared in the included trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Campbell 1988 compared oral co-trimoxazole versus intramuscular procaine penicillin followed by oral ampicillin in 134 children. At the seventh day of follow up, treatment failure occurred in 6/66 (9.1%) in the oral co-trimoxazole group and 7/68 (10.2%) in the combined-treatment group. The risk difference was -0.01% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.09). The APPIS Group 2004 evaluated 1702 patients comparing oral amoxicillin versus intravenous penicillin for two days followed by oral amoxicillin. After 48 hours, treatment failure occurred in 161/845 (19%) in the amoxicillin group and 167/857 (19%) in the parenteral penicillin group. The risk difference was -0.4% (95% CI -4.2 to 3.3). The authors reported similar recovery in both groups at 5 and 14 days. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:52:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:41:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Garenne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garenne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WB-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">WB 1993</LINK>). It is estimated that 4.3 million children under the age of five die from ARIs each year. In Colombia, ARI is the most frequent reason to attend an outpatient clinic; the most frequent cause of hospitalisation in children less than five years old; and the second most frequent cause of mortality in this age group, after diarrhoea. Present evidence indicates that bacterial infection plays a far greater role as a cause of pneumonia in children in developing countries than it does in developed countries. Bacterial pathogens have been isolated using lung aspirates in up to 74% of patients with pneumonia in developing countries. The primary pathogenic organisms are <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) </I>and <I>Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae)</I> (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:52:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The ARI control programme was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in response to the high mortality rate of this illness. Its principal purpose was to reduce mortality and to support the rational use of antibiotics. The recommendations have also been incorporated into the WHO/UNICEF Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) programme. These simple strategies provide advice that children with a cough and normal respiratory rate (having a cough or cold) should not be treated with antibiotics or be hospitalised. Children who have rapid breathing but no chest in-drawing (pneumonia) should receive antibiotics as outpatients. Children who have chest in-drawing, with or without rapid breathing (severe pneumonia), should be hospitalised and treated with parenteral penicillin or parenteral ampicillin every six hours for at least three days. After the child recovers, treatment should be changed to oral ampicillin or amoxicillin or intramuscular procaine penicillin. Treatment should continue for at least five days. If the child does not recover within 48 hours of starting treatment with penicillin or if the child's clinical condition deteriorates, antibiotic treatment should be changed to chloramphenicol every six hours. This strategy has resulted in a reduction of mortality when used in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1991</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:52:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hospitalisation required for the administration of injectable therapy has several drawbacks. Firstly, the routine use of injectable antibiotics, either intravenously or intramuscularly, is associated with a significant increase in the risk of morbidities such as abscess formation and transmission of HIV, hepatitis or other pathogens associated with the use of contaminated needles. Secondly, in some settings, needles for injection and equipment are in short supply or are periodically unavailable. Thirdly, hospitalisation can substantially increase the cost of health care. Fourthly, children who are referred for admission for injectable therapy may not be able to get to the hospital. Finally and most importantly we must keep in mind the discomfort and pain caused to children when receiving injectable antibiotics. Some treatments require daily intramuscular administration of antibiotics. This exposes children to much pain and to potential complications (for example, sciatic nerve injury, infection or local reactions like swelling and redness). As a consequence, there is a concern that the use of injectable antibiotics may reduce compliance with treatment</P>
<P>Recent studies conducted in outpatients (<LINK REF="REF-CSG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">CSG 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MASCOT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MASCOT 2002</LINK>) have shown that oral antibiotics (amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole) are effective and safe treatments in non-severe pneumonia in children in developing countries. The <LINK REF="REF-MASCOT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MASCOT 2002</LINK> study found that azithromycin is equally effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate acid or erythromycin estolate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children between six months and 16 years of age. Clinical success (complete recovery of symptoms) was reported as 94% in the azithromycin group and 96% in the control treatment group. Another RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Tsarouhas-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tsarouhas 1998</LINK>), conducted in a large urban American paediatric emergency clinic, evaluated 170 outpatient children with a radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients were randomised to receive amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day or procaine penicillin G 50,000 IU/kg. Treatment failures were 40% (27/68) in the amoxicillin group and 33% (29/86) in the intramuscular penicillin group (risk difference 7%, 95% CI -8 to 23). The authors concluded that there was no significant difference between oral amoxicillin and intramuscular penicillin in the early treatment of non-severe pneumonia in paediatric outpatients</P>
<P>There is less evidence with regard to the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalised children. Mulholland (<LINK REF="REF-Mulholland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulholland 1998</LINK>) studied 144 malnourished children, younger than five years of age, admitted to the General Hospital in Fajara, Gambia with a clinical or radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia. Children were randomly assigned to receive either oral chloramphenicol or oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX or co-trimoxazole). Failures were defined as deterioration or failure to improve; death or evidence of persistent pneumonia at the end of seven days of treatment; or clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia at the time of the outpatient review. There was no difference in the outcome between malnourished children with pneumonia who received oral TMP/SMX and those who received oral chloramphenicol. The authors found no difference in the outcome between the groups (risk difference 0%, 95% CI -17 to 16). However, the failure rate was high (36%) and this was probably due to the malnourished status of the patients. In addition, the Mulholland study (<LINK REF="REF-Mulholland-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulholland 1998</LINK>) has several methodological limitations. It had unclear classification and diagnosis criteria; excluded patients from the analysis after randomisation; and had non-specific outcome measurements.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:51:19 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Whether oral antibiotic treatment strategies can be used effectively and safely in children with severe pneumonia is still unclear. This review helps to find an answer to this question. If oral antibiotics are shown to be as effective as injectable antibiotics in the treatment of severe pneumonia, substantial improvements in access to appropriate care could be achieved. Children would benefit from less pain and discomfort; the reduced risk of certain adverse treatment events (that is to say, nosocomial infections and iatrogenic complications); and lower treatment costs. This review also contributes to the rational use of antibiotics, with avoidance of antibiotic overuse and appropriate antibiotic prescribing.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:34:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>We decided that no statistical analysis should be performed to pool the results due to the significant clinical heterogeneity between the included studies. The results of each study are described in the review. Each trial was individually analysed to determine the relative risk and absolute risk difference between treatments for the predetermined categorical outcomes, based on the intention-to-treat principle. According to the outcomes reported in the included studies, persistence of respiratory signs that were consistent with severe pneumonia, changing antibiotic therapy during follow up due to clinical deterioration and the need for ventilation due to respiratory distress were considered as a treatment failure.</P>
<P>If, in the future, the results of individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous to pool results for any of the outcomes, meta-analysis using a random-effects model will be used. In addition to combining all oral antibiotic and all parenteral antibiotic therapies, antibiotics will be classified as follows: cephalosporins, penicillins, macrolides, aminoglycosides and other. Therapies will be considered as equivalent if the 95% CI of the risk difference for the proportion of treatment failures between groups (oral versus parental) are within -5% to 5%. A subgroup analysis will be conducted according to the category of antibiotic used, when this is feasible.</P>

<P>More than 2000 abstracts and titles were scanned. The search yielded 32 potentially eligible studies. Only three met all criteria for eligibility and 29 were rejected (see 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table). Six studies were not controlled trials, 10 studies included only adult populations, eight studies compared only oral therapies, two studies looked at parenteral therapies only, and three studies were excluded because the population studied did not meet the WHO criteria for severe pneumonia or another consistent definition for severe pneumonia.</P>

<P>We classified one clinical trial as ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT-Trial-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT Trial 2004</LINK>). The authors of this study tested the hypothesis: "The outcome of previously well children with community acquired pneumonia treated with oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy will be no different". According to the study protocol, the trial outcome measurements include: length of hospital stay, time for temperature to settle, time to resolution of clinical signs and risks of morbidity and mortality. An e-mail communication with the author informed us that the study has now finished and is ready for publication. By the time of writing this review the PIVOT trial had not yet been published.</P>
<P>Two studies were included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-APPIS-Group-2004" TYPE="STUDY">APPIS Group 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1988</LINK> was conducted in seven rural villages in Gambia. The trial included children from one month to four years of age with severe pneumonia (as defined by the WHO) who had not received antibiotics in the previous two weeks. Patients were sequentially assigned to receive a five-day course of oral co-trimoxazole or a single intramuscular injection of fortified procaine penicillin followed by five days of oral ampicillin (oral versus combined therapy comparison). A total of 134 children were studied with 66 in the oral group and 68 in the combined group, of which 62% and 55% were males, respectively. The mean age was 22 months, and less than 35% of the study population was under one-year old (well balanced in both groups). Children were treated as outpatients due to the reduced resources available in the hospital of the area. Outcomes were assessed at seven days and 14 days after treatment was started. At seven days, trained field workers performed a blinded evaluation of the following outcomes: improvement of condition, defined as in-drawing cessation; reduction of respiratory rates and reduction of temperature. At a 14-day follow-up visit, unblinded project clinicians evaluated the following outcomes: incomplete recovery and the need for further treatment.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-APPIS-Group-2004" TYPE="STUDY">APPIS Group 2004</LINK> conducted a multi-centre RCT in hospital settings in Asia, Africa and South America. The study population met the WHO severe pneumonia criteria and had no past history or current symptoms of asthma at the time of enrolment (patients had a negative response to the salbutamol test). A total of 1702 children were randomly assigned to receive oral amoxicillin syrup (45 mg/kg/per day in three doses) or parenteral penicillin G (200,000 IU/kg per day in four doses); 857 children were allocated to the oral group and 845 to the injectable group. Gender and age were well balanced in the two treatment groups: 62% in the oral and 63% in the parenteral group were males, 62% were aged 3 to 11 months of age (infants) and 38% were aged one to five years. The main outcome evaluated was treatment failure due to any of the following: worsening of the respiratory condition, low oxygen saturation, persistence of lower chest in-drawing, serious adverse drug reactions, the need to include another antibiotic or to change the antibiotic due to treatment failure, and death. Treatment failure was assessed at 48 hours, 5 days and 14 days after treatment was started.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1988</LINK> used a quasi-randomised allocation method (sequentially) to assign patients to the treatment groups. Therapies were not masked. The evaluators were blinded at the seventh day of the follow-up visit but clinicians who performed the 14-day evaluation of outcomes were not blinded. Analysis was per protocol, but the data reported in the article also allowed an intention-to-treat analysis. According to our quality assessment guidelines this trial had a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-APPIS-Group-2004" TYPE="STUDY">APPIS Group 2004</LINK> used the sealed, opaque envelope method for random assignment to the treatment groups; these were prepared in advance by a co-ordinating centre. The assessment of eligibility was standardised among trial physicians before starting the patient enrolments. Therapies were not masked for ethical reasons and evaluation of outcomes was not blinded. However, to minimise the possibility of bias a third physician confirmed all treatment failures. Rates of loss to follow up were lower than 20% and had a similar distribution in both groups. The analysis was by intention to treat. Authors reserved per protocol analysis for the efficacy assessment. According to our quality assessment guidelines this trial had a low risk of bias.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-24 21:48:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The most common practice in treating severe pneumonia has been intravenous penicillin administered for several days. However, this requires specialised healthcare workers to administer injections, which are painful for children and stressful for their parents, and probably costs more than using oral therapy. Currently, the evidence from an exhaustive search suggests that there is no significant difference between oral and parenteral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. The available evidence supports the hypothesis that oral antibiotic treatment strategies could be used as effectively as parenteral therapies in this particular group of children.</P>
<P>The review authors searched for clinical trials from several sources. We searched for trials in any language and scrutinised bibliographic references of identified studies and clinical practice guidelines for treatment of acute respiratory infections in children. In addition, we visited recognised websites of scientific societies and contacted some pharmaceutical companies for further information. Our findings represent the best available evidence about oral versus parenteral antibiotic therapies in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children.</P>
<P>Several authors have tried to evaluate the effectiveness of different antibiotic therapies in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children. Most of them have addressed the clinical effectiveness of two different regimens of combined therapies or two parenteral therapies. One trial included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1988</LINK>) addressed the issue of clinical success in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children from one month to four years of age with oral versus combined therapy (one dose of injectable antibiotics followed by five days of oral antibiotics). We found only one published trial (<LINK REF="STD-APPIS-Group-2004" TYPE="STUDY">APPIS Group 2004</LINK>) that addressed the effectiveness and safety of oral antibiotics compared to parenteral antibiotics in the first 48 hours of treatment of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-08-24 21:48:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-APPIS-Group-2004" TYPE="STUDY">APPIS Group 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1988</LINK>) compared different antibiotic therapies, both had an exclusively oral treatment arm. Both studies reported no differences between groups with respect to treatment failure at one week after treatment started and also no differences in clinical success at the end of treatment and at follow up (14 days). Since neither trial included children with severe pneumonia and serious signs and symptoms (inability to drink, abnormal sleepiness, central cyanosis and convulsions), we cannot draw any conclusions about the role of oral antibiotics compared to parenteral antibiotics in these circumstances. Similarly, these trials did not assess the effects of oral antibiotics in severe pneumonia associated with bacterial confirmation or lobar consolidation identified on chest X-ray.</P>
<P>The studies reviewed did not permit assessment of other important issues relating to the treatment of pneumonia such as, time for recovery of respiratory symptoms and mean number of days of hospitalisation. This information would assist in the estimation of costs associated with the therapies. The one ongoing trial identified (<LINK REF="STD-PIVOT-Trial-2004" TYPE="STUDY">PIVOT Trial 2004</LINK>) seems to have measured these outcomes. This trial has been carried out in children admitted to hospital with severe community-acquired pneumonia, in the UK. Despite this, the PIVOT trial results could help to define other outcomes related to time to recovery and length of hospital stay with each type of treatment (oral and parenteral) that can be applied to developing countries. This trial will also contribute to knowledge about clinical treatment failure criteria and morbidity and mortality risks within hospital settings in developed countries. Any future updates of this review will hopefully include the PIVOT trial.</P>
<P>The available evidence supports the hypothesis that oral antibiotic treatment strategies can be used as effectively as parental therapies in this particular instance. These findings have important implications for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia in developing countries; particularly the reduction of needle-associated complications and patient discomfort during treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:25:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence from one large well-designed trial supports equivalence in the effectiveness of oral amoxicillin and intravenous penicillin in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children between three months and five years of age. In this study, there was no substantial difference in global treatment failure or safety aspects at 48 hours, 5 days and 14 days. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the relative benefits and harms of oral antibiotics in children with severe pneumonia if serious signs and symptoms are present or in children with severe pneumonia associated with bacterial confirmation or lobar consolidation on chest X-ray. There is also insufficient evidence to determine whether oral antibiotics are equivalent to parenteral antibiotics in the prevention of rare complications such as, need for mechanical ventilation, progression to empyema or sepsis.</P>
<P>This equivalence of oral and parenteral antibiotics in terms of treatment failure has important clinical implications for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. Oral antibiotic treatment provides some advantages over parenteral treatment in terms of reducing patient discomfort, needle-associated complications, need for referral or admission from first-level healthcare centres and direct and indirect costs. To apply these findings in general practice, clinicians must take into account that oral antibiotic therapy showed equivalence in children who were under close supervision by health workers, assuring adherence and quick response to complications. However, in hospital settings it may be difficult for clinicians and for parents to accept oral antibiotic therapy even if it has been shown to be equally effective in treating severe pneumonia in children.</P>
<P>Evidence also suggests that there are no differences in effectiveness between oral co-trimoxazole compared to combined therapy (one dose of parenteral penicillin followed by oral ampicillin). However, these results should be applied carefully since they come from a single small study with a high risk of bias.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-08-24 20:25:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of exclusively oral antibiotic therapies compared to parenteral antibiotic therapies in children with severe pneumonia when serious signs and symptoms are present and in children with severe pneumonia associated with bacterial confirmation or lobar consolidation on chest X-ray. Further studies in other high-risk groups and studies comparing oral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in out-patient settings are also appropriate. Ideally, these studies should use an accurate definition of severe pneumonia and have enough power to identify differences in responses and treatment failures between therapies in infants and older children. </P>
