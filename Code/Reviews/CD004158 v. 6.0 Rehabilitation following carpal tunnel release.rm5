<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Are rehabilitation interventions after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome effective and safe?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which a nerve that runs through a bony and fibrous tunnel in the wrist is compressed. This leads to pain, numbness and tingling in the hand, sometimes extending into the forearm. At advanced stages, some people with CTS have weakness and muscle wasting in the hand. CTS is more common in women and individuals with certain risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, arthritis, older age, working in certain occupations, and previous wrist fracture. Many people undergo surgery to reduce pressure on the nerve, to lessen pain, and improve sensation and hand function. Sometimes individuals receive rehabilitation following CTS surgery. Rehabilitation treatments are believed to speed up recovery and manage pain or symptoms from the surgery itself. This is the first update of a review first published in 2013.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>On 29 September 2015, we searched for all relevant clinical trials in which a rehabilitation treatment was compared with another rehabilitation treatment, no treatment or placebo (sham treatment). We found 22 trials with a total of 1521 participants that assessed the benefits and harms of different rehabilitation treatments following CTS surgery. Two of the trials were newly identified at this update.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Based on these studies, we found limited and low quality evidence for the benefit of the reviewed treatments, including immobilisation with a wrist orthosis (splint), use of dressings post surgery, exercise, cold and ice therapy, different types of hand rehabilitation provided in combination, laser therapy, electrical treatments, scar desensitisation, and arnica. Few studies reported on the safety of these treatments.</P>
<P>More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the various types of rehabilitation treatment available for people following CTS surgery.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to September 2015.</P>

<P>Various rehabilitation treatments may be offered following carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) surgery. The effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. This is the first update of a review first published in 2013.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-02-02 21:31:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>To review the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation interventions following CTS surgery compared with no treatment, placebo, or another intervention.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:24:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>On 29 September 2015, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, AMED, LILACS, and PsycINFO. We also searched PEDro (3 December 2015) and clinical trials registers (3 December 2015).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:25:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials that compared any postoperative rehabilitation intervention with either no intervention, placebo, or another postoperative rehabilitation intervention in individuals who had undergone CTS surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:19:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach according to standard Cochrane methodology.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-04 12:46:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>In this review we included 22 trials with a total of 1521 participants. Two of the trials were newly identified at this update. We studied different rehabilitation treatments including immobilisation using a wrist orthosis, dressings, exercise, controlled cold therapy, ice therapy, multi-modal hand rehabilitation, laser therapy, electrical modalities, scar desensitisation, and arnica. Three trials compared a rehabilitation treatment to a placebo, four compared rehabilitation to a no treatment control, three compared rehabilitation to standard care, and 15 compared various rehabilitation treatments to one another.</P>
<P>Overall, the included studies were very low in quality. Thirteen trials explicitly reported random sequence generation; of these, five adequately concealed the allocation sequence. Four trials achieved blinding of both participants and outcome assessors. Five were at high risk of bias from incompleteness of outcome data at one or more time intervals, and eight had high risk of selective reporting bias.</P>
<P>These trials were heterogeneous in terms of treatments provided, duration of interventions, the nature and timing of outcomes measured, and setting. Therefore, we were not able to pool results across trials.</P>
<P>Four trials reported our primary outcome, change in self reported functional ability at three months or more. Of these, three trials provided sufficient outcome data for inclusion in this review. One small high-quality trial studied a desensitisation programme compared with standard treatment and revealed no statistically significant functional benefit based on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to 0.33). One low-quality trial assessed participants six months post surgery using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and found no significant difference between a no formal therapy group and a group given a two-week course of multi-modal therapy commenced at five to seven days post surgery (MD 1.00, 95% CI -4.44 to 6.44). One very low-quality quasi-randomised trial found no statistically significant difference in function on the BCTQ at three months post surgery with early immobilisation (plaster wrist orthosis worn until suture removal) compared with a splint and late mobilisation (MD 0.39, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.23).</P>
<P>Differences between treatments for secondary outcome measures (change in self reported functional ability measured at less than three months; change in CTS symptoms; change in CTS-related impairment measures; presence of iatrogenic symptoms from surgery; return to work or occupation; and change in neurophysiological parameters) were generally small and not statistically significant. Few studies reported adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:32:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is limited and, in general, low quality evidence for the benefit of the reviewed interventions. People who have undergone CTS surgery should be informed about the limited evidence of effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation interventions. Until researchers provide results of more high-quality trials that assess the effectiveness and safety of various rehabilitation treatments, the decision to provide rehabilitation following CTS surgery should be based on the clinician's expertise, the patient's preferences and the context of the rehabilitation environment. It is important for researchers to identify patients who respond to a particular treatment and those who do not, and to undertake high-quality studies that evaluate the severity of iatrogenic symptoms from surgery, measure function and return-to-work rates, and control for confounding variables.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-02 21:29:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:48:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a neurological condition caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist due to increased pressure within the carpal tunnel (<LINK REF="REF-AAOS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAOS 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phalen-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phalen 1966</LINK>). Patients with CTS usually present with sensory or motor symptoms, or both, in the hand and wrist. Patients often experience pain, paraesthesia or numbness in the distal distribution of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and in the radial half of the ring finger (<LINK REF="REF-Phalen-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phalen 1966</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rempel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rempel 1998</LINK>). Extramedian spread of sensory and pain symptoms has been reported in 37.5% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zanette-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanette 2010</LINK>). At advanced stages, wasting of the thenar muscles and hand weakness are observed (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>CTS is one of the most common disorders of the upper extremity (<LINK REF="REF-AAOS-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAOS 2007</LINK>). The prevalence of CTS in the general population is 3.8% when diagnosed clinically and 2.7% when diagnosed neurophysiologically (<LINK REF="REF-Atroshi-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atroshi 1999</LINK>). CTS is more prevalent among women than among men (<LINK REF="REF-Gelfman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gelfman 2009</LINK>). Whilst some authors have indicated that occupational risk factors, such as vibration, force and repetition (<LINK REF="REF-Barcenilla-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barcenilla 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbert-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbert 2000</LINK>), and certain occupations contribute to CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wyatt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wyatt 2012</LINK>), controversy continues regarding its work-relatedness (<LINK REF="REF-Stapleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stapleton 2006</LINK>). Other risk factors for CTS, such as obesity, diabetes, previous wrist fracture, and arthritis, have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-Geoghegan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geoghegan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lam-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lam 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Rijn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Rijn 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>CTS can be treated both non-surgically (conservatively) and surgically. Conservative treatment options are usually offered to individuals who experience mild or intermittent symptoms, are pregnant, or cannot or choose not to have surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012a</LINK>). Non-surgical interventions that may be offered include therapeutic ultrasound, splinting, exercise prescription, mobilisation techniques, ergonomic modification, oral medication, corticosteroid injections, vitamins and complementary therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012c</LINK>). Few have any proven therapeutic benefit.</P>
<P>CTS surgery - most commonly referred to as carpal tunnel release (CTR) - may be indicated for individuals with persistent symptoms that have not responded to conservative management, those presenting with more severe symptoms (such as frequent numbness or thenar muscle wasting) or those with electrophysiologically severe disease (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdugo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdugo 2008</LINK>). Surgery involves division of the transverse carpal ligament to increase the volume of the carpal tunnel, thereby reducing pressure on the median nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Aroori-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aroori 2008</LINK>). In the United States of America, approximately 40% of patients with CTS are treated operatively (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2003</LINK>), and in the United Kingdom, 31% of persons with CTS undergo surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Latinovic-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Latinovic 2006</LINK>). CTR has a reported long-term success rate of 75% to 90% (<LINK REF="REF-Louie-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louie 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two surgical approaches are commonly used to release the transverse carpal ligament: open CTR and endoscopic CTR. In open CTR, the carpal tunnel ligament is divided by a palmar incision. In recent years, minimal-incision-open (or mini-open) techniques have become more common in an attempt to minimise surgical trauma, iatrogenic symptoms from the surgery and recovery time (<LINK REF="REF-Bromley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromley 1994</LINK>). Over time, several variations of these techniques have been developed to reduce postoperative pain, improve function and shorten recovery time. A number of secondary procedures may be performed concurrently. These include techniques such as epineurotomy, internal neurolysis, synovectomy and reconstruction of the transverse carpal ligament (<LINK REF="REF-Huisstede-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisstede 2010</LINK>). Endoscopic CTR (ECTR) involves division of the transverse carpal ligament whilst leaving overlying structures intact. This is believed to reduce postoperative pain and scarring while hastening early return to function and work (<LINK REF="REF-Sanati-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanati 2011</LINK>). Two techniques are commonly used for ECTR: the single-portal technique (<LINK REF="REF-Agee-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agee 1992</LINK>) and the two-portal technique (<LINK REF="REF-Chow-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chow 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications following CTR may include nerve injury, neuroma formation, palmar arch injury, hematomas, complex regional pain syndrome, tendon adhesions, bowstringing of the flexor tendons, pillar pain, scar pain and other iatrogenic complications resulting from surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Braun-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Braun 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, symptoms of CTS may recur or persist following surgical release (<LINK REF="REF-Gerritsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerritsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Idler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idler 1996</LINK>). Reasons for persistence of symptoms following surgical release include incorrect diagnosis, inadequate decompression of the median nerve, iatrogenic compression or nerve injury, double crush syndrome, and end-stage disease (<LINK REF="REF-Idler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Idler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Louie-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Louie 2012</LINK>). The prognosis following CTS has been associated with several factors, such as age, psychological factors, workers' compensation, duration of CTS symptoms, presence of thenar atrophy and absence of sensory and motor nerve conduction (<LINK REF="REF-Amick-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amick 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cowan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cowan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Finestone-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finestone 1996</LINK>). The presence of other disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, may also affect the prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-DeStefano-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeStefano 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:49:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Various rehabilitation treatments may be recommended following CTR. These interventions are believed to expedite recovery by improving mobility, strengthening the hand and promoting earlier return to function and work (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). Interventions that may be prescribed to manage iatrogenic symptoms of surgery include control of postoperative swelling, scar desensitisation, management of pillar pain and wound healing (<LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>). Therefore, postoperative rehabilitation might include interventions such as advice, exercise prescription, mobilisation techniques, splinting of the wrist with an orthosis, wound and scar management, oedema management, electrotherapy, cryotherapy, desensitisation, ergonomic modification, strengthening and work modification (<LINK REF="REF-Groves-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groves 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK>). These interventions may be provided as stand-alone interventions or as part of a programme of rehabilitation treatments.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-02 20:52:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>The goal of postoperative rehabilitation is to speed up and enhance symptom resolution and functional recovery following surgery. Various arguments in support of individual rehabilitative techniques have been reported. For instance, immobilisation of the wrist with an orthosis has been recommended to minimise postoperative pain, wound dehiscence, and nerve entrapment, and to prevent bowstringing of the flexor tendons (<LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jessurun-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jessurun 1988</LINK>). Laser therapy and modalities that use electrical stimulation have been advocated to stimulate wound healing and neuronal regeneration and to control pain postoperatively (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>). Lighter postoperative dressings are advocated to allow easier and earlier mobilisation of the hand and wrist (<LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>). Advocates of early mobilisation following surgery propose that motion of the wrist and digits promotes longitudinal gliding of the median nerve through the surgical bed and prevents adhesion formation between the nerve and the flexor tendons (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skirven-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skirven 1994</LINK>). Oedema management techniques are used to minimise effects of the inflammatory response on digital range of motion (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2002</LINK>). Scar management techniques, such as massage, pressure, and application of silicon-based products, are advocated to loosen adhesions between skin and underlying tissues, to aid in desensitisation of the incisional scar and to promote scar remodelling (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>). Strengthening exercises and progressive functional activities are incorporated into the rehabilitative programme to maximise occupational performance following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK>). Some authors advocate the use of comprehensive multi-component therapy programmes (consisting of various rehabilitation treatments, such as advice, mobilisation and management of iatrogenic symptoms from surgery by physiotherapists or occupational therapists who specialise in hand therapy) to promote early return to function and work (<LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1993</LINK> also found that compliance with hand therapy was the strongest prognostic factor for early return to function and work.</P>

<P>The evidence base for rehabilitation following CTR has grown. Three reviews have focused on specific treatments following CTR (<LINK REF="REF-Huisstede-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisstede 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Isaac-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Isaac 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Keilani-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keilani 2002</LINK>). Cochrane systematic reviews have explored various non-surgical interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012c</LINK>) and surgical treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdugo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdugo 2008</LINK>) for CTS. However, no Cochrane systematic review has examined rehabilitation treatments following surgical management of CTS. There are many rehabilitation treatments that may be offered to patients who have had CTR. As evidence and guidelines for the use of any of these interventions are limited, a Cochrane systematic review is warranted.</P>

Each review author independently examined the titles and abstracts of trials for possible inclusion identified from the search and categorised studies into the following groups.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Possibly relevant: studies that met the inclusion criteria and studies from which it was not possible to determine whether they met the criteria by review of title or abstract.</LI>
<LI>Excluded: studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria.</LI>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-02-04 10:02:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data using a data extraction form specifically developed for this review. Review authors resolved any discrepancies through discussion until they reached consensus. We piloted and accordingly modified the data extraction form before use. In addition to collecting relevant data to perform the risk of bias assessment along with study results, we collected the following information for each study:</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-02-02 21:47:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We expressed results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes, if the same measurement tool was used across separate studies.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-02-02 21:47:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>As CTS can affect one or both hands, a unit of analysis error can occur if an appropriate statistical analysis is not used (<LINK REF="REF-Stanek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanek 1996</LINK>). Hence, we sought information about the unit of randomisation (participants or wrists). In studies that randomised wrists, we sought information about whether, in participants with bilateral CTS, each wrist was allocated to a different treatment, or whether no such constraint was present. Given that results are unlikely to be independent for wrists from the same participant, we assessed how investigators accounted for this in their analyses (e.g. paired or matched analyses, generalised estimating equations). If reports did not include this information, we contacted trialists for clarification. We requested individual wrist outcome data from trialists for re-analysis of the data.</P>

<P>Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria and are described in full in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The included studies involved a total of 1521 participants, of whom 296 were male and 744 female (with demographic data missing for 481 participants). The trials presented findings across 11 treatments: immobilisation using a wrist orthosis, dressings, exercise, controlled cold therapy, ice therapy, multi-modal hand rehabilitation, laser therapy, electrical modalities, scar desensitisation, sensory relearning and arnica. Rehabilitation interventions varied in type, intensity, duration and treatment setting. In 15 studies, participants contributed only one CTS-affected wrist to the study (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). In five studies, some participants had bilateral CTR and contributed both wrists to the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). Of these, two randomised each wrist to different interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>); one randomised both wrists to the same intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>); and two were unclear regarding the wrist allocation method used (<LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). A unit of analysis error occurred in three of these studies, as no attempt was made to control the correlation between wrists (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK> avoided a unit of analysis error. However, it was unclear whether a unit of analysis error occurred in <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>. In two studies, it was unclear whether any participants had bilateral CTS (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>), so a unit of analysis error may have occurred.</P>
<P>Four of the 22 included studies reported the primary outcome for this review at three months or more (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>).

In some studies, adverse events were reported as iatrogenic symptoms of the surgery, not as adverse events of the rehabilitation intervention.</P>
<P>One of the studies was unpublished, and review authors obtained data entirely from unpublished sources (thesis and communication with trial authors) (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>). We obtained additional data not reported in study publications from trialists of the following studies: <LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Suitability of trials for meta-analysis</HEADING>
<P>We were not able to statistically pool data from the included trials because they were too clinically heterogeneous with respect to type and duration of interventions and outcome measures reported. Twelve types of postoperative rehabilitation treatment were identified in the included trials (immobilisation with wrist splint, soft bulky dressings, exercise, specific nerve and tendon gliding exercises, controlled cold therapy, ice therapy, multi-modal hand rehabilitation, laser therapy, continuous ultrasound, scar desensitisation, sensory relearning and arnica). The duration of treatment ranged from 48 hours (in <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>) to six weeks (in <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>). In 12 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>), the reported data could not be included in the statistical analysis for several reasons: omission of measures of variability in reports of continuous outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>), no report of the number of participants assessed for an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>), outcome data presented in graphical or other format (<LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>), conclusions stated without support for point estimates, measures of variability or frequency counts of outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>), or CTS-specific data not provided when participants with other diagnoses were included in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>). Two studies reported median values and CIs indicating skewed data (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>); data were not appropriate for inclusion in a standard meta-analysis.</P>

<P>We rated generation of the randomisation sequence as at low risk of bias in 13 included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). Six trials used random number tables to determine allocation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>), and two trials used random envelope draw (<LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). One trial used a technique of randomly drawing coloured cubes from a bag (<LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>), and three trials drew allocation from a box or a bowl (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>). One trial used a blocked randomisation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>).

Low-level laser therapy was applied with an aluminium gallium Ibramed laser pen with 830 nm wavelength and 30 mW power. Treatments were delivered in five daily consecutive sessions, with a rest (no treatment) interval of two days, followed by another five consecutive days of treatment. Laser was delivered at a total of 3 Joules at three points in the carpal tunnel (pisiform, middle of the carpal tunnel and distal limit of the carpal tunnel). Outcomes were assessed at two weeks and at one, two, three and six months or until discharge (mean 3.6 months both groups). Outcomes included iatrogenic pain following surgery (pillar pain or palmar pain); iatrogenic scar discomfort; paraesthesia or numbness; other clinical signs of CTS (numbness, nocturnal pain, paraesthesia, pain or positive Tinel's sign); and time to return to activities of daily living (ADL) and work.</P>

<LI>Swelling was recorded by taking wrist circumference measurements immediately postoperatively and at three days post surgery. Both end point and change scores were reported on the basis of a per-protocol analysis and an intention-to-treat analysis. At the end of three days of treatment, investigators reported no statistically significant difference in the amount of swelling (end point score) between controlled cold therapy and ice therapy groups on the basis of a per-protocol analysis or an intention-to-treat analysis. However, when change scores were measured, the controlled cold therapy group had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline to day three compared with the ice therapy group on the basis of a per-protocol analysis (MD -1.00, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.74) and intention-to-treat analyses (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.87) (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We have assumed that the mean change from baseline to day three in oedema (wrist circumference) in the "ice therapy group" was incorrectly reported by trial authors. In both cases, the value reported was -0.7, but end point scores suggest that these values should be +0.7, as wrist circumference increased in the ice therapy group. Further, study authors report the following: "At 3 days, of the 24 CCT [controlled cold therapy] patients, 19 showed reduction in mean wrist circumference from baseline, three showed no change and two showed an increase. In contrast, all patients in the ice therapy group showed an increase in mean wrist circumference at 3 days. When all patients for whom edema scores were available were included in an intention-to-treat analysis, the CCT group again showed a statistically significant greater reduction in wrist circumference from baseline and significantly greater mean percentage reduction in wrist circumference than the ice-therapy group." Attempts to contact study authors to confirm this have been unsuccessful.</LI>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-04 11:51:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness and safety of various rehabilitation treatments to optimise outcomes following carpal tunnel release (CTR) compared with no treatment, placebo, or another non-surgical intervention. We included 22 studies investigating a total of 1521 participants. Included studies showed that currently limited and low to very-low quality evidence is available to support the use of a variety of rehabilitation treatments after CTR. These studies were heterogeneous in types of rehabilitation treatment provided; intensity, dosage and duration of treatment; timing of treatment; outcome assessment; and treatment setting. Therefore, we could not pool data across studies.</P>
<P>Among the quality issues of these studies, unit of analysis errors are important. <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK> avoided a unit of analysis error; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK> committed such errors; and whether such errors occurred was unclear in <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>. Therefore, clinicians and researchers must interpret the results of these studies with caution.</P>
<P>One study compared multiple treatments to a control (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>); six studies compared one rehabilitation treatment to no treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>); three studies compared one rehabilitation treatment to placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>); and 15 studies compared one rehabilitation treatment to other rehabilitation treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only four studies reported the primary outcome of interest, that is, long-term self reported functional ability at three months or more (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>). Only three of these trials reported outcome data suitable for inclusion in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>). One high-quality trial with a small sample size found no statistically significant effect on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) of a desensitisation programme over standard treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>). One low-quality trial assessed 150 participants at six months post surgery using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and found no statistically significant difference in scores between the no therapy group (instructed preoperatively on tendon gliding exercises, scar massage and return to activity) and a group given a two-week course of multi-modal therapy commenced at five to seven days post surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>). However, this study included only employed persons, which limits the generalisability of findings to non-employed or retired people. One very low-quality quasi-randomised trial found that participants who received a bulky dressing and commenced early mobilisation showed no statistically significant difference in function on BCTQ at three months post surgery when compared with participants who received a postoperative wrist orthosis at three months post surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two low-quality trials compared immobilisation using a wrist orthosis to a bulky dressing and mobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>). Both reported incomplete data and limited data on measures of variability. <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK> found that improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms among participants who wore a wrist orthosis for two weeks was not statistically significantly different from improvement among those who wore a bulky dressing. Lack of participant blinding in this study means that outcomes should be interpreted with caution, as reporting of participant symptoms may have been influenced by knowledge of the intervention group.</P>
<P>Four trials compared immobilisation of the wrist using an orthosis with a programme of early mobilisation (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>). Studies by <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK> provided incomplete data, which limited analysis and reporting of study results. Measures of variability were missing for several outcome measures in each trial, and some outcomes were reported as median values, indicating that data may have been skewed (<LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK> found no significant differences between the two interventions, which suggests that one intervention is not superior to the other in terms of change in CTS symptom severity and sensibility measured using two-point discrimination. No significant differences in iatrogenic symptoms secondary to CTR were found between groups in studies by <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>. Only one study reported adverse events related to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK> reported that 80% of participants in the splinted group experienced discomfort compared to none in the mobilisation group, which was a statistically significant difference. However, results from these studies should be interpreted with caution as they lacked appropriate randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martins-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Martins 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the use of arnica as an intervention compared with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>). Results of <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK> suggested no significant differences in grip strength or swelling after seven days of arnica compared with placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK> found no difference between participants who received high or low doses of oral arnica when compared with those given placebo with respect to bruising of the hand post surgery.</P>
<P>Two trials compared multi-modal hand therapy or physiotherapy to a non-graduated home exercise programme (preoperative education regarding tendon gliding exercises, scar management and advice on return to activity) (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>) or a progressive patient-directed home exercise programme (<LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK> did not report outcome data in a manner that allowed further analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK> found no significant differences between groups during the short-term postoperative period or at three months of follow-up for changes in self reported functional ability and impairment measures based on grip or pinch strength.</P>
<P>We identified two trials that compared short duration postoperative dressing versus extended duration dressing (<LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK> found no significant differences between short and longer duration dressings in terms of improved functional status and symptom severity on the BCTQ, and <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK> found that participants who had their dressing removed early had better grip and pinch strength. However, neither study provided participant blinding. These results should be interpreted with caution as participant assessments of effectiveness may have been influenced by their awareness of the intervention.</P>
<P>One RCT compared continuous ultrasound in conjunction with nerve and tendon gliding exercises versus laser therapy plus nerve and tendon gliding exercises versus nerve and tendon gliding exercises alone (<LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>). This study found significant improvement after treatment in all groups but no significant difference between continuous ultrasound with nerve and tendon gliding exercises, laser therapy with exercises and exercise alone. Investigators found significant differences between the ultrasound and exercise groups and between the laser therapy and exercise groups. However, trialists did not compare these interventions for any of the outcomes included in this review. No participant blinding was provided in this study; therefore, participants' assessment of effectiveness of pain may have been influenced by their knowledge of the intervention to which they were allocated.</P>
<P>We identified one trial that examined a sensory relearning home programme versus no treatment control (<LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>). Trialists found weak evidence supporting use of a sensory relearning programme in a pilot study design. In general, trialists had controlled risks of bias for selection, attrition and reporting. However, participants were not blinded for the duration of the study. Therefore, study results must be considered in the light of the high risk of performance bias.</P>
<P>One moderate-quality randomised trial found no statistically significant differences in the amount of swelling among participants receiving contrast baths plus exercises compared with those receiving contrast baths alone, although investigators reported statistically significantly more swelling than with exercise alone (<LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>). Further, those receiving contrast baths alone had statistically significantly more swelling than those receiving exercises alone.</P>
<P>We identified one randomised trial that compared effects of controlled cold therapy versus ice therapy commenced immediately post surgery and continued for three days (<LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>). Results from this trial support the use of controlled cold therapy over ice therapy for both pain and swelling reduction in the short term. However, participants and outcome assessors in this study were not blinded, and this may have influenced their expectations of the effects of interventions.</P>
<P>We identified one quasi-randomised trial that compared low-level laser therapy with placebo laser treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>). Trialists found no statistically significant differences in CTS symptoms with low-level laser therapy versus placebo and no differences between groups in the return to work outcome at three months post surgery. Results of this trial should be interpreted cautiously as participants were allocated to groups according to a quasi-random sequence.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK> examined elevation using a home elevation device and a Bradford sling versus standard care. Trialists found no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of pain or swelling.</P>
<P>Trials conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK> (electrical stimulation versus control), <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK> (bulky dressing and splint versus light dressing), and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK> (electrical stimulation versus decimeter wave therapy versus no treatment control) did not report outcome data in a format that was meaningful, or provided incomplete data that could not be analysed.</P>

<P>Evidence in this review is limited in its completeness and applicability. Authors of included studies did not provide important details about the conduct of studies and did not report complete data. Inclusion of a wide variety of rehabilitation treatments in this review made it difficult for review authors to draw conclusions about the overall efficacy of rehabilitation interventions after CTR. In addition, we were not able to include in this review a number of treatments used in rehabilitation (such as ultrasound, scar massage, mobilisation techniques, strengthening, return to work interventions and work modification) because no RCTs had evaluated their efficacy. Moreover, two studies investigated the benefits of a programme of multi-modal hand therapy, making it difficult to isolate interventions within the multi-component treatment that could be effective (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). Several studies did not report demographic data such as gender and age distribution, setting, details of the type of CTS and eligibility criteria; this limits the potential to generalise findings of these studies to a particular population or treatment setting. Only three studies clearly reported results of interventions at three months or longer (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-02-04 11:25:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Methodological quality varied greatly across studies. All studies were small, ranging from 21 participants (in <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>) to a maximum of 150 participants (in <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>). Four studies included 100 or more participants who underwent CTR and were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). According to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011b</LINK>), the overall quality of evidence was moderate when multi-modal hand therapy was compared with a control of advice and normal activity and when the primary outcome was reviewed.</P>
<P>Only 13 trials explicitly reported that the sequence was generated in a randomised fashion (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jerosch_x002d_Herold-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Jerosch-Herold 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritting-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ritting 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2008</LINK>). Four trials adequately concealed the allocation sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sawan-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sawan 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>). This is important as inadequate allocation concealment can lead to distortion of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Odgaard_x002d_Jensen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odgaard-Jensen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Few trials were rated as having low risk of performance bias and detection bias for self reported outcomes because of lack of participant and personnel blinding. Only four studies achieved blinding of both participants and outcome assessors (<LINK REF="STD-Janssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Janssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jeffrey-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Jeffrey 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevinson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stevinson 2003</LINK>). Lack of blinding of participants is often unavoidable in situations for which the interventions are obvious (e.g. type of dressing or intervention versus lack thereof). Therefore, minimising performance and detection bias is almost impossible. However, this can be problematic as participants in trials with unblinded assessment of subjective outcomes, such as pain and function, are estimated to exaggerate the treatment benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Therefore, these studies need to be interpreted with some caution. In comparison, blinding of outcome assessors is nearly always possible but was not clearly reported in 11 of the 20 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Alves-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Alves 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cebesoy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cebesoy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hochberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hochberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risk of bias from incomplete outcome data was unclear or high for both short-term and long-term data in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>), and eight studies had high risk of bias from selective reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Bury-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Bury 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cook-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fagan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fagan 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finsen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Finsen 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gordon-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Gordon 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huemer-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Huemer 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pomerance-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Pomerance 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Provinciali-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Provinciali 2000</LINK>). Studies with high risk of selective reporting bias are problematic as they can bias results and conclusions of a systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kirkham-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirkham 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In general, further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the treatment effect, but this needs to consist of efficacious therapies provided in studies of adequate power, with valid outcomes assessed at appropriate periods of time.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-02-03 21:13:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Although review authors attempted to minimise bias in selection of studies for this review, collection of published data and analysis, our searches were limited to electronic databases and clinical trial registries. We included one unpublished study identified through a clinical trials database (<LINK REF="STD-Powell-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 2003</LINK>), but we may have missed results of some unpublished studies. Furthermore, it was difficult to obtain all relevant data required for a systematic review from the authors of the included studies, often because of the length of time that had passed since some of the studies were completed. It was also difficult to assess selective outcome reporting for studies for which study protocols or trial registry data were not available or accessible, and for which study authors did not adequately report the methods used.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-02-04 12:29:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Limited and very low-quality evidence is available for rehabilitation treatments following carpal tunnel release (CTR). People who have undergone CTR require sufficient information to make an informed decision about recommended rehabilitation treatments. They need to be informed of the limited evidence of effectiveness and safety of any interventions recommended by the treatment provider. Factors to be considered before treatment providers and those who refer patients for treatment recommend a rehabilitation following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are the environmental context, the nature of the intervention, and the patient's preference. Benefits of rehabilitation treatments in the short term compared with the long term have not been adequately evaluated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-04 12:28:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth  Brassington">
<P>Carpal tunnel release surgery is generally successful in reducing symptoms of CTS with few reported adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdugo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdugo 2008</LINK>). Therefore, studies with large samples and the power to detect statistically significant differences between groups are needed to determine the effects of interventions in improving postoperative outcomes, including function and return to work. The high success rate of surgery may contribute to the lack of high-quality studies. Second, a wide variety of poor outcomes are possible after surgery, and it can be difficult to design a study to examine multiple outcomes while controlling for various confounding variables. Poor outcomes can result from failure to relieve preexisting symptoms or iatrogenic complications from the surgery itself (e.g. scar pain, hypersensitivity, and reduced grip strength). However, for patients who have persistent symptoms or iatrogenic effects resulting from CTR, research into effects of various rehabilitation modalities remains relevant and necessary.</P>
<P>Therefore, additional high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of rehabilitation treatments delivered after CTR. Researchers must consider various issues when designing a study (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 2014</LINK>). Trials should attempt to blind participants and outcome assessors when possible. Trial authors should clearly report demographic details and rehabilitation setting information, so that results can be interpreted and applied to similar populations and settings. In addition, data on adverse effects of the rehabilitation intervention rather than iatrogenic effects of the surgery should be recorded. If participants with bilateral CTS are included in the study, trialists should use appropriate methods and should clearly report how bilateral cases were handled in their statistical analysis to prevent a unit of analysis error. Study authors should place trial information on appropriate clinical trials registers to ensure transparent reporting of methods planned for their study. Moreover, trialists should be careful to include in the study report means and appropriate measures of variability for all outcomes prespecified in their methods, thereby avoiding selective reporting bias. The nature of these interventions and the results reported by trials included in this review show that benefit may be observed for early return to function and return to work that is not observed at three months or later. However, longer-term effectiveness should not be ignored. Assessment of longer-term benefit after cessation of the intervention should be incorporated in future research. Researchers should focus on postoperative care regimens that have been designed to reduce the symptoms of CTS. They need to measure the severity and type of CTS symptoms preoperatively and should stratify the patient population accordingly. Additionally, consistent reporting of outcomes (common instruments and timing of outcome assessments) will allow for meta-analysis of similar outcomes in future reviews. The only consistent effects of treatment involved CTS symptom scores; therefore, these outcomes might be useful to include in future studies. Finally, many commonly used rehabilitation treatments have not yet been evaluated for their effectiveness or safety, and these therapies should be included in future trials.</P>

<P>We updated 'Risk of bias' methods and added outcomes for inclusion in a 'Summary of findings' table. We updated background information to reflect changes in the literature since the protocol was published in 2003. We updated references to previous versions of RevMan software. We expanded 'types of interventions' included in this review to include rehabilitation interventions, and we excluded interventions related to postoperative analgesia. We modified outcomes from the original protocol (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2003</LINK>) for the review for consistency with other Cochrane reviews on CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2012c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2012c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vasiliadis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vasiliadis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verdugo-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verdugo 2008</LINK>).

<P>Those responding with mild or worse numbness (score &#8805; 2) in a previously operated hand and mild or worse difficulty with grasping and using small objects (score &#8805; 2) were invited to attend a clinical assessment of hand sensibility. Clinical assessment involved standardised tests: (1) touch threshold using WEST (Connecticut Bioinstruments, Riverdal, Connecticut, USA); (2) statistical 2-point discrimination according to Moberg; (3) a locognosia test; and (4) STI test.

<P>Sensory retraining intervention was developed specifically for the trial. It included techniques for retraining discriminative functional sensibility suitable for patients after CTR. Participants were given a standardised set of materials and instructions but were told that they may alter the materials used to suit their level of sensory impairment, such as by replacing training objects with smaller or more complex and intricate ones. Standard materials consisted of 9 textures made from different textile materials, an opaque cloth bag containing 14 small objects (various sizes of metal nuts, bolts, coins, wooden knobs, balls and buttons) and a booklet of standardised instructions. Participants were asked to practice their exercises in short sessions of 5 to 10 minutes at least 3 times per day for 4 weeks, and to record daily the type and frequency of their exercises</P>

<P>All participants received a postoperative bulky dressing, which was reduced to a smaller dressing by the participant at 48 hours to enable gentle active mobilisation of the hand. All participants were given standard postoperative instructions, which included advice on elevation to minimise oedema, gentle active mobilisation of the hand and avoidance of heavy activities</P>
<P>Sutures were removed at 14 days by a wound nurse to standardise suture removal and wound management. A light dressing was applied to the wound site, and participants were asked to keep the scar covered until their next review. The nature of CTS and the CTR were discussed with each participant, and general advice was given regarding their likely return to function based on recent research evidence and clinical experience. Interventions were assigned to each group at a hand therapy assessment 1 week later</P>
<P>
<B>Intervention group 1: desensitisation</B>
</P>
<P>Intervention group received a general hand exercise regimen and a desensitisation programme, which was demonstrated and advised by the occupational therapist. Participants were instructed to massage their scar tissue with a continuous, circular massage for 2 min, 5 times daily. They were then instructed to repeat the exercise with a rough towel, which was rubbed gently over the scar. All participants in the treatment group received a desensitisation programme advice sheet with specific instructions. This programme was upgraded at 6 weeks and at 3 months</P>
<P>
<B>Control group 2: standard treatment control</B>
</P>
<P>Control group received a general hand exercise regimen, and individuals were advised to carry out 5 of each of the wrist and hand exercises 5 times daily.

<B>Intervention group 2: </B>low (6C) homeopathic arnica tablets to be taken 3 times daily for 7 days preoperatively and 14 days postoperatively  </P>
<P>
<B>Placebo group 3: </B>placebo tablets (indistinguishable from arnica tablets) to be taken 3 times daily for 7 days preoperatively and 14 days postoperatively</P>
<P>Participants were advised to refrain from handling the tablets and from eating, drinking, smoking or brushing teeth within 20 minutes of taking the tablets, and were asked to suck the tablets rather than simply swallow them. Homeopathic and placebo tablets were supplied by A Nelson &amp; Co Ltd (London, UK). For all participants after surgery, a palmar plaster splint was applied to maintain the wrist in slight dorsiflexion, allowing the fingers to be gently mobilised within the dressing, and the hand was elevated in a high sling. Oral analgesic medication (paracetamol or diclofenac) was routinely prescribed on discharge. All participants were seen by the physiotherapist at 4, 9, and 14 days post surgery. At day 4, the splint was removed, and digits and wrists were mobilised. A Futura aluminium wrist splint was given to participants to wear for an additional week. Sutures were removed at day 14</P>

<P>&#8226; Pain assessed by the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire, which includes a 0 to 100 visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the intensity of pain and a list of 15 descriptive words (e.g. stabbing, gnawing, shooting), each rated on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 45. Measured presurgery and at 4, 9 and 14 days post surgery<SUP>b</SUP>
</P>
<P>&#8226; Objectively measured bruising: a photograph of the participant's wrist at the distal crease taken under standard lighting conditions. For each participant, frames representative of normal skin (thenar zone) and of bruised areas (operative site) were selected. The distribution of red and blue pixels within each frame was calculated. This information, displayed as a histogram of the number of pixels (y-axis) against an increasing scale of colour brightness from 0 to 255 (x-axis), enabled a comparison of the colour of the bruised area against the colour of the normal skin. Measured at 4, 9 and 14 days post surgery<SUP>b</SUP>
</P>
<P>&#8226; Clinician-rated bruising, assessed independently by 2 plastic surgeons on a 3-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild-moderate, 2 = severe). Measured at 4, 9, and 14 days post surgery<SUP>b</SUP> </P>
<P>&#8226; Swelling: measured as wrist circumference (mm) at the distal wrist crease. Three readings were taken of each measurement. Measured presurgery and at 4, 9, and 14 days post-surgery<SUP>b</SUP> </P>
