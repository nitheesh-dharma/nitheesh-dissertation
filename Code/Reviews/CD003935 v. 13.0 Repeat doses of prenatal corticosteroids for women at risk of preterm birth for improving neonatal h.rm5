<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-29 12:20:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>This review shows that a repeat dose of prenatal corticosteroids given to women who remain at risk of an early birth after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids helps the baby's lungs and reduces serious health problems in the first few weeks of life.</P>
<P>Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) are at risk of difficulty breathing and lung disease because their lungs are not fully developed. Women at risk of preterm birth include those with ruptured membranes, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm labour, cervical incompetence, pre-eclampsia or multiple pregnancy. Preterm babies who survive the early weeks of life are also at risk of long-term neurological disabilities such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy. A single course of corticosteroids, given to women who may give birth early, helps develop the baby's lungs. This benefit does not last beyond seven days. This review of 10 randomised controlled trials, involving 4733 women who remained at risk of early birth more than seven days after an initial course of corticosteroids and 5700 babies between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation at trial enrolment showed that repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids reduced the risk of the baby having breathing difficulties and serious health problems in the first few weeks of life. Some of the trials showed that the baby may be smaller at birth, but not if adjusted for gestational age nor by the time of hospital discharge. In four trials that followed up the babies to early childhood, no long-term benefits or harms were seen at 18 months to two years' corrected age. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the woman and baby, which should include later child health, growth and development.</P>
<P>Repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment could increase the risk of infection and suppress pituitary-adrenal function for the mother and her baby. For the women, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis, and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged.</P>
<P>Betamethasone was the only corticosteroid evaluated. It is uncertain whether the effects seen for betamethasone would be the same for dexamethasone.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 12:19:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>We included 10 trials (a total of 4733 women and 5700 babies) with low to moderate risk of bias. Treatment of women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with repeat dose(s), compared with no repeat corticosteroid treatment, reduced the risk of their infants experiencing the primary outcomes <I>respiratory distress syndrome</I> (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.91, eight trials, 3206 infants, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 17, 95% CI 11 to 32) and <I>serious infant outcome</I> (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, seven trials, 5094 infants, NNTB 30, 95% CI 19 to 79).</P>
<P>Treatment with repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid was associated with a reduction in <I>mean birthweight</I> (mean difference (MD) -75.79 g, 95% CI -117.63 to -33.96, nine trials, 5626 infants). However, outcomes that adjusted birthweight for gestational age (birthweight Z scores, birthweight multiples of the median and small-for-gestational age) did not differ between treatment groups.</P>
<P>At early childhood follow-up, no statistically significant differences were seen for infants exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with unexposed infants for the primary outcomes (total deaths; survival free of any disability or major disability; disability; or serious outcome) or in the secondary outcome growth assessments. In women, for the two primary outcomes, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of <I>chorioamnionitis</I> or <I>puerperal sepsis</I>, and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-16 11:44:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The short-term benefits for babies of less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. These benefits were associated with a small reduction in size at birth. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm in early childhood, although no benefit.</P>
<P>Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the woman and baby. Individual patient data meta-analysis may clarify how to maximise benefit and minimise harm.    </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:27:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:27:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Infants born preterm (before 37 weeks' gestation) are at high risk of neonatal lung disease and its sequelae. The more preterm the baby the greater are the risks, especially when birth occurs before 32 weeks' gestation. In Australia, in 2003, 1.6% of all births were before 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Laws-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laws 2005</LINK>). Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), as a consequence of immature lung development, is the principal cause of early neonatal mortality and morbidity and contributes significantly to the high costs of neonatal intensive care. Preterm babies who survive the early weeks of life are at risk of long-term neurological disability (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>). Parents are understandably worried and distressed when their baby is born preterm. Strategies to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory disease for infants who are born preterm have received considerable attention (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>A single course of prenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of RDS from 26% to 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.73, 21 trials, 4038 infants) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Other beneficial effects include a reduced risk of neonatal death, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and early sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Prenatal corticosteroids enhance the benefits of postnatal surfactant therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Jobe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jobe 1994</LINK>) and reduce the need for blood pressure support (<LINK REF="REF-Moise-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moise 1995</LINK>). Overall, there is a reduction in the cost and duration of neonatal care. The cost benefit of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids is estimated as USD 3000 (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 1995</LINK>). Long-term follow-up into adulthood of babies in the New Zealand trial (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972</LINK>), exposed to prenatal corticosteroids have shown no adverse clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2005b</LINK>). However, even though prenatal corticosteroids remain the most effective known strategy for reducing the adverse consequences of preterm birth, and despite postnatal intensive care and exogenous surfactant, there is still significant neonatal morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Rojas_x002d_Reyes-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas-Reyes 2012</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:27:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Prenatal corticosteroid treatment compared with no prenatal corticosteroid treatment has not been shown to be effective in babies who are born more than seven days after an initial treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Specifically no reduction in the incidence of RDS or neonatal mortality has been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>), and birthweight is significantly reduced (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). There may be benefit in repeating the dose of prenatal corticosteroids to women who remain at risk of preterm birth more than seven days after the initial course. This was suggested by Liggins and Howie in the first reported controlled trial of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for the prevention of RDS in premature infants (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1972</LINK>). Indeed, in some clinical centres this has been standard practice. However, until recently, there has been little formal assessment of such a policy, and the effect of this practice on the women and infants has been unclear (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2000</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:27:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Animal studies have suggested that repeat treatment with prenatal corticosteroids may be more effective than a single course in reducing the risk of RDS. In sheep fetuses; there is a dose-dependent improvement in lung function with repeat doses of betamethasone (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1997</LINK>). In human infants, improved cardiovascular responses to preterm birth have been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Padbury-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Padbury 1996</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:27:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The potential benefits of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment on neonatal lung function and cardiovascular health may be balanced by increased maternal risks such as infection and suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (<LINK REF="REF-Ashwood-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashwood 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKenna-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 2000</LINK>). In addition, experimental reports raise concerns about the use of repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids because of potential adverse effects for the offspring.</P>
<P>It is well known that corticosteroids inhibit cell growth and DNA replication. Studies in both small and large animals demonstrate that exogenous steroids inhibit fetal growth and increase fetal blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Fowden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowden 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2002</LINK>). In sheep there is a dose-dependent reduction in birthweight in lambs exposed to up to four doses of betamethasone administered to the ewe (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1997</LINK>), although exogenous steroids administered directly to the fetus do not inhibit fetal growth (<LINK REF="REF-Newnham-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newnham 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other animal experimental studies have shown that repeat doses of corticosteroids may have harmful effects on neuronal myelination (<LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 1997</LINK>), the development of the alveolar septa leaving 'emphysematous' -like alveoli (<LINK REF="REF-Tschanz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tschanz 1995</LINK>) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function (<LINK REF="REF-Ikegami-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikegami 1997</LINK>). Effects on the HPA axis can persist into adulthood.</P>
<P>In humans, similar concerns have been raised from non-randomised cohort studies, with adverse effects after repeat doses of corticosteroids on measures of growth at birth (<LINK REF="REF-French-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1999</LINK>), risk of neonatal infection, fetal pituitary-adrenal axis function, neonatal blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Mildenhall-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mildenhall 2006</LINK>), childhood behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-French-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1998</LINK>), and high levels of stress in parents (<LINK REF="REF-French-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1998</LINK>). Long-term developmental follow-up studies of infants exposed to repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids are limited to date and have produced conflicting results. Some non-randomised studies suggest delayed development (<LINK REF="REF-Esplin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esplin 2000</LINK>) and adverse effects on childhood behaviour (<LINK REF="REF-French-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1998</LINK>), whilst other non-randomised studies have shown no difference between exposed and non-exposed children (<LINK REF="REF-French-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hasbargen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasbargen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorp-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorp 2002</LINK>), or possible reduced cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-French-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2004</LINK>). Another long-term potential adverse outcome that requires further investigation is the possibility that single or repeat doses of antenatal corticosteroids could program cardiovascular settings in the fetus and lead to adult hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Benediktsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benediktsson 1993</LINK>), and insulin resistance leading to diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Dalziel-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalziel 2005a</LINK>). Increased exposure of the fetus to glucocorticoids has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying the epidemiological association between small size at birth and adult cardiovascular and metabolic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Seckl-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seckl 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>There remains uncertainty therefore about whether there is benefit in repeating the dose of prenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth after an initial course. This review will assess the benefits and harms of repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety, using the best available evidence, of a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids, given to women who remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids with the primary aim of reducing fetal, infant and childhood morbidity and mortality. </P>

<P>All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised trials with reported data that compared outcomes for women at risk of preterm birth randomised to receive a repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids with outcomes in controls given a single course of prenatal corticosteroids, with or without additional placebo administration. The trials used some form of random allocation and reported data on one or more of the prestated outcomes. We excluded quasi-randomised trials. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. Cluster trials were eligible for inclusion.</P>

<P>Women considered to be at risk of preterm birth who have already received a single course of prenatal corticosteroid seven or more days previously.</P>
<P>Predefined subgroups were planned to examine separately the outcomes for women and infants based on the reasons the woman was considered to be at risk for preterm birth (e.g. presence or absence of ruptured membranes, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm labour, cervical incompetence, pre-eclampsia, growth restriction), and the number of infants in utero (singleton, twin or higher order multiple pregnancy).</P>

<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>
<P>We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>

<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but we did not identify any. Should we include cluster-randomised trials subsequently, we will include them in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in <I>Handbook</I> <I>[Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6]</I>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta-analysis.</P>

</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2015-01-05 11:57:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analyses. If missing data were such that they might significantly affect the results, we excluded these data from the analysis. This decision rested with the review authors. If missing data become available subsequently, we will include them in the analyses.</P>
<P>For all outcomes we carried out analyses as far as possible on an intention-to-treat basis. We attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and analysed all participants in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was taken as the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing, ('available case' analysis).</P>

<P>We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the Tau² was greater than zero and either the I² was greater than 30% or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. When we identified high levels of heterogeneity among the trials, we explored this by pre-specified subgroup analysis.

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:31:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Where we suspected reporting bias (see selective reporting bias above), and the missing data were thought to introduce serious bias, we explored the impact of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Where there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we planned to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots, although we identified none. In future updates, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:31:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.</P>
<P>If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment effects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau² and I².</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical subgroups</HEADING>
<P>We planned secondary analyses to explore clinical diversity by examining separately the outcomes for women exposed to repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids compared with women receiving no repeat prenatal corticosteroids/placebo based on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the reasons the woman was considered to be at risk of preterm birth (e.g. presence or absence of ruptured membranes, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm labour, cervical incompetence, pre-eclampsia and growth restriction);</LI>
<LI>the number of babies in utero (singleton, twins or higher order multiples);</LI>
<LI>the type of corticosteroid given (betamethasone, dexamethasone);</LI>
<LI>the planned interval between corticosteroid treatments (minimum interval of seven days or less, between eight and less than 14 days, 14 days or more);</LI>
<LI>the planned number of repeat courses of corticosteroids to be given (one, two, three, four or more repeat courses);</LI>
<LI>the number of repeat courses of corticosteroids actually given post-randomisation (one, two, three, four or more repeat courses);</LI>
<LI>the planned dosage of corticosteroid given per treatment (12 mg or less, more than 12 mg to 24 mg, more than 24 mg);</LI>
<LI>the planned dose of repeat dose of corticosteroid drug exposure/week (12 mg or less/week, more than 12 mg/week to 24 mg/week, more than 24 mg/week);</LI>

<P>The type of corticosteroid planned to be given as treatment was betamethasone for all the trials, although the gestational age at which treatment could begin or was continued until varied slightly between the trials.</P>
<P>In five trials a planned treatment course was two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone, intramuscularly, at weekly intervals (<LINK REF="STD-Aghajafari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aghajafari 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wapner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wapner 2006</LINK>). For <LINK REF="STD-Aghajafari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aghajafari 2002</LINK>, a weekly course of betamethasone was given (two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone (Celestone Soluspan; Schering Canada Inc.) intramuscularly, 24 hours apart) until 33 weeks or birth if the woman remained at increased risk of preterm birth. <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 2002</LINK> used a weekly course of betamethasone (two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone, intramuscularly 24 hours apart) until 34 weeks or birth, whichever came first. <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2008</LINK> used betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly, two doses, 24 hours apart until the end of the 33rd week of gestation. <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2002</LINK> used a weekly course of betamethasone (two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone (Celestone Soluspan; Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, New Jersey), intramuscularly, until 34 weeks or birth. <LINK REF="STD-Wapner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wapner 2006</LINK> used a weekly course of betamethasone (two doses of 12 mg betamethasone as 6 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate and 6 mg betamethasone acetate, intramuscularly in 24 hours) until birth or 33 weeks and six days, limited to four repeat courses after the first 67 women.</P>
<P>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK>, used a single intramuscular injection of 11.4 mg Celestone Chronodose (Schering-Plough, Sydney, Australia) containing 7.8 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate and 6 mg betamethasone acetate, repeated weekly if the woman remained undelivered and less than 32 weeks' gestation and the responsible clinician regarded her as at continued risk of preterm birth.</P>
<P>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK>, used a course of betamethasone (two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone (as 6 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate and 6 mg betamethasone acetate: Celestone Schering-Plough Corporation, Madison, New Jersey, USA), intramuscularly, 24 hours apart, every 14 days (if the woman remained at risk of preterm birth after their first course of study treatment) until 33 weeks' gestation or birth. For women with preterm premature rupture of membranes, it was recommended that treatment stop at 32 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Three trials planned only a single repeat course of treatment; <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2009</LINK> used a single course consisting of two doses of 12 mg betamethasone, intramuscularly, 24 hours apart (preparation not specified); <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2010</LINK> used a single course of two doses of 12 mg/dose betamethasone (Celestone Soluspan; Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, New Jersey), intramuscularly, 24 hours apart; and <LINK REF="STD-Peltoniemi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltoniemi 2007</LINK> used a single intramuscular injection of 12 mg intramuscular of betamethasone, preparation not specified.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-Aghajafari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aghajafari 2002</LINK> were the rate of recruitment over a 12-month period, risk of complications requiring discontinuation of study treatment, concentrations of plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone in cord blood and in maternal blood immediately following birth, perinatal or neonatal mortality or significant neonatal morbidity.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK>, the primary outcomes were occurrence of neonatal RDS, severity of any respiratory disease present, use and duration of oxygen therapy, use and duration of mechanical ventilation, and weight, length and head circumference at birth and at discharge from hospital.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Garite-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 2009</LINK> the primary outcome was a composite of neonatal mortality/morbidity in babies born before 34 weeks' gestation. The composite outcome was defined as one or more of: perinatal death (defined as stillbirth or death before neonatal discharge); RDS (oxygen requirement, clinical diagnosis and consistent chest radiograph); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as a requirement for oxygen at 30 days of age); severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grades 3 or 4); periventricular leukomalacia; blood culture-proven sepsis; or necrotising enterocolitis (not defined in the publication).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Guinn-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guinn 2002</LINK> trial had a composite neonatal morbidity primary outcome of any of the following: severe RDS, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, proven sepsis or death between randomisation and nursery discharge.</P>
<P>The primary outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2008</LINK> was severe RDS, defined as respiratory distress within six hours of birth in a preterm infant with either a negative gastric shake test or a typical chest radiograph. Severe RDS was defined as requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 12 hours. Mechanical ventilation was started in infants with hypoxaemia (Pa0<SUB>2</SUB> &lt; 50 mmHg) or hypercapnic acidosis (PaC0<SUB>2</SUB> &gt; 50 mmHg with pH &lt; 7.25) or worsening acidosis or clinically worsening respiratory fatigue/apnoea/work of breathing despite continuous positive airway pressure (maximum 8 cm water pressure).</P>
<P>The primary outcomes for <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2002" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2010</LINK> were functional residual capacity and respiratory compliance.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK> used a composite primary outcome consisting of one of the following: stillbirth or neonatal death (defined as death during the first 28 days of life or before hospital discharge); severe RDS (defined as needing assisted ventilation via endotracheal tube and supplemental oxygen within the first 24 hours of life and for 24 hours or more, and either a radiographic scan compatible with RDS or surfactant given between the two and 24 hours after birth); bronchopulmonary dysplasia (defined as needing oxygen at a postmenstrual age of 36 completed weeks and radiographic scan compatible with bronchopulmonary dysplasia); intraventricular haemorrhage grade 3 or 4; cystic periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Peltoniemi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltoniemi 2007</LINK> the primary outcome was survival without RDS or severe intraventricular haemorrhage during the first hospitalisation.</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Wapner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wapner 2006</LINK> the primary outcome was one of the following: severe RDS (defined as clinical features of RDS with the need for oxygen and respiratory support from six to 24 hours or more of age, an abnormal chest x-ray, and either administration of a full course of surfactant or a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB> of at least 60%); grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage; periventricular leukomalacia; chronic lung disease (defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' corrected age in infants born before 34 weeks' gestation); or stillbirth or neonatal death.</P>
<P>All the trials had a range of secondary outcomes of clinical relevance.</P>
<P>At early childhood follow-up, primary outcomes varied by trial. For <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK>, the pre-specified primary outcomes were survival at two years' corrected age free of major neurodisability (defined as survival free of moderate or severe disability); and body size (weight, height and head circumference). For <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK>, the primary outcome was death or the presence of neurologic impairment at 18 to 24 months of age, corrected for gestational age at birth. Neurologic impairment was defined as the presence of cerebral palsy or cognitive delay. For <LINK REF="STD-Peltoniemi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Peltoniemi 2007</LINK>, the power analysis at follow-up was based on survival without neurodevelopmental impairment. For <LINK REF="STD-Wapner-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wapner 2006</LINK>, the power analysis was based on the prespecified developmental outcome of the Bayley Mental Developmental Index score. Other prespecified outcomes for Wapner were the Bayley Psychomotor Developmental Index score: measurements of weight, height and head circumference and the occurrence of cerebral palsy.</P>

<P>Adequate sequence generation was clearly reported for eight trials. For <LINK REF="STD-Aghajafari-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Aghajafari 2002</LINK>, randomisation was computer-generated and was centrally controlled by one pharmacist at each hospital who kept the randomisation code with stratification by gestational age (24 to 27 weeks versus 28 to 30 weeks), and by hospital using block sizes of two. <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK> used a central telephone randomisation service for study number and then treatment pack allocation.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-29 12:21:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>A total of 4733 women (5700 babies) were randomised into trials comparing women given repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids seven or more days after an initial course with women not receiving repeat corticosteroids after an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids seven or more days earlier. The use of repeat dose(s) of corticosteroid for women at risk of preterm birth reduced the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) by 17% (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 17 (95% CI 11 to 32) women; 60 fewer babies with RDS per 1000 women treated) with a similar reduction, 16%, in the risk of serious infant outcome (NNTB 30 (95% CI 19 to 79) women; 33 fewer babies with a serious health outcome per 1000 women treated). These are clinically important neonatal benefits and there is clear evidence that repeat doses leads to a reduction in the use of mechanical ventilation, less need for oxygen supplementation, less inotropic support treatment, less use of surfactant and a reduced risk of a patent ductus arteriosus. No substantive effect was seen on fetal or neonatal mortality or for total mortality at early childhood follow-up.</P>
<P>The reduction in risk of RDS and/or composite serious neonatal outcomes was consistent across most of the planned subgroups providing data (timing of repeat corticosteroid treatment seven days or less, or 14 days or more; planned number of doses only one; dose per treatment 12 mg or less, or more than 12 mg to 24 mg or less betamethasone; or dose per week).</P>
<P>In contrast to these clinical benefits, at birth, infants exposed to repeat corticosteroids compared with infants not exposed to repeat corticosteroids had a reduction in some measures of growth (mean weight, mean length and mean head circumference, head circumference Z scores, length multiples of the mean), although not in Z scores for weight or length, or multiples of the median for weight, or in the risk of being small-for-gestational age. By the time of discharge from hospital after birth and at later childhood follow-up, no differences were seen between children exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids and those not exposed for weight, head circumference and height. Measures of body size are dependant on gestational age at birth and without adjustment for gestational age, as in Z scores or multiples of the mean/median, it is not possible to fully assess the effects repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment may have on fetal growth.</P>
<P>In the update of this review in 2011, data from early childhood follow-up were added from four trials. These data show no substantive differences in children exposed to repeat prenatal corticosteroids compared with unexposed children for survival or neurosensory disability at 18 months to two years' corrected age, childhood behaviour, or general health. Further information from one existing trial on outcome in early childhood is awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2008</LINK>). The evidence available provides some reassurance about the health of the infants into early childhood when repeat prenatal corticosteroids are used for women at risk of preterm birth. However, there are as yet no information on the health, neurodevelopmental, growth, cardiovascular and metabolic status in later childhood, adulthood to assess the long-term significance of the observed neonatal clinical benefits or the effects on anthropometric assessments observed at birth. Such information will be needed to assess overall benefits and risks of using repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth. Several trials have conducted later assessment of their children (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK> - early school-age follow-up at six to eight years' corrected age; and <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK> - childhood follow-up at five years of age) and publications arising will be included in the next update of this review.</P>
<P>For the women, there was no increase in infectious morbidity of chorioamnionitis or puerperal sepsis, and the likelihood of a caesarean birth was unchanged providing some reassurance about the safety of repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment for the mothers. There was significant heterogeneity for the trials reporting on side effects with no differences overall for women reporting any side effects. Although few women reported insomnia (2.3% in the repeat prenatal corticosteroid group, 0.8% in the non repeat corticosteroid group), this was more likely for women treated with repeat prenatal corticosteroids. Reduction in bruising at the injection site was reported in one trial for women given repeat corticosteroid injections compared with placebo.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:44:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Women in these trials have been recruited in a range of countries and settings. The trials were all conducted at either tertiary or provincial hospitals, but apart from one trial, they were conducted in high-income countries. The results are considered applicable to hospital settings worldwide. Betamethasone has been the only corticosteroid evaluated in randomised trials of repeat prenatal corticosteroids prior to preterm birth. Dexamethasone is often used because it is less expensive and often more easily available, particularly in low- to middle-income countries. It is uncertain whether the effects seen for betamethasone would be the same for dexamethasone. Appropriate trials are needed.</P>
<P>There has been no cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after initial corticosteroid treatment.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-04-13 20:53:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the studies included in this review ranged from moderate to excellent. Of the 10 included trials, all are recent publications of moderate to high methodological quality. All had adequate allocation concealment, all except one used a placebo, and losses to follow-up to the time of primary hospital discharge after birth were nil or minimal. At early childhood follow-up losses to follow-up in the three trials that have reported data ranged between 7.5% and 21.2%.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-04-13 20:54:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for this review is derived from studies identified from a detailed, systematic search process without language restriction. It is possible (but unlikely) that additional trials comparing the use of repeat corticosteroids prior to preterm birth versus placebo or no treatment have been published but not identified. It is also possible that there are other studies, additional to those of which we are aware, that have been conducted but are not yet published. Should any such studies be identified, we will include them in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>Two of the review authors (CAC, JEH) were investigators for the ACTORDS trial (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK>). Data extraction for this trial was performed by the other review authors (PM and CM).</P>

<P>Since the update of this review in 2011, further follow-up data from the <LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK> (two publications), <LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2010</LINK> (one publication) and <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK> (two publications) have been published adding to the evidence base assessing whether repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids improve fetal lung maturation, and thereby reduce infant morbidity and mortality. This systematic review presents strong evidence that repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroid for women at risk of preterm birth provides significant clinical benefits in the short term for the infant and is not associated with any evidence of any effect on benefit or harm for either the woman or the child at early childhood follow-up.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-26 11:45:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The short-term benefits seen for babies support the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women who have received an initial course of prenatal corticosteroids seven of more days previously and who remain at risk of preterm birth.</P>
<P>Repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of preterm birth, compared to no repeat treatment, reduce the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) by 17% and the risk of serious health problems in the first few weeks of life for the infant by 16%. For one baby to benefit by not developing RDS, 17 women (95% CI 11 to 32) would need to be treated with repeat prenatal corticosteroids. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for serious neonatal outcome is 30 women (95% CI 19 to 79). At birth the neonatal benefits are associated with a reduction in some measures of mean body size (mean weight, head circumference and length), although not for anthropometric assessments that adjusted for gestational age. These differences in body size measurements are no longer seen by hospital discharge in the two trials that report data. The limited evidence available from early childhood reassuringly shows no significant harm, although no benefit. No differences are seen in mortality, neurodisability or childhood weight, head circumference or height. There is insufficient evidence on the longer-term benefits and risks.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids should be available in all hospitals providing care for women at risk of preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). Repeat prenatal corticosteroids should be considered for women who have received a course of prenatal corticosteroids seven or more days previously, and who remain at risk of preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation. Women eligible for repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment should be informed of the known benefits and risks and counselled about the available but limited information about childhood health outcomes. Until clearer information is available on optimal dose of treatment, and frequency of administration it would seem prudent to use a treatment regimen of one of the trials reporting neonatal benefit.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-30 22:55:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further information is awaited from one existing trial on outcome in early childhood (<LINK REF="STD-Mazumder-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mazumder 2008</LINK>). There are still no data published for later childhood or adulthood on health, neurodevelopmental, growth, cardiovascular and metabolic status. Such information is needed to assess overall benefits and risks of using repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth. Several trials have completed later assessment of their children (<LINK REF="STD-Crowther-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Crowther 2006</LINK> - early school-age follow-up at six to eight years' corrected age; and <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008</LINK> - childhood follow-up at five years of age). Data from these later assessments will be included in the next planned update of this review.</P>
<P>We are aware of three other trials of repeat prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth. One trial from the UK stopped recruitment and publication is awaited (<LINK REF="STD-TEAMS-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TEAMS 1999</LINK>); one trial in women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes has only been published in abstract form with data not suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sobhrabvand-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sobhrabvand 2001</LINK>); and one trial from Iran is awaiting classification to establish its eligibility for inclusion. We are awaiting a response from the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Atarod-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Atarod 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Individual patient data meta-analysis using the existing trials is ongoing and may clarify how to maximise benefit and minimise harm using factors relating to the women (<I>reasons the woman was considered at risk of preterm birth</I>), her pregnancy (<I>number of babies in-utero, gestational age repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment was given, time prior to birth repeat prenatal corticosteroid treatment was given</I>), and <I>drug frequency and dosage (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further trials are difficult to justify until the results of the individual patient data meta-analysis are available. Any further trials of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women who remain at risk of preterm birth after a course of corticosteroids should be of high quality; be large enough to assess mortality and serious morbidity; consider comparing different corticosteroid preparations (all trials to date have used betamethasone for repeat treatment); provide further evaluation of the times between repeat courses; evaluate the optimal amount of corticosteroid given at each course; provide data on all relevant maternal and infant outcomes; ensure assessment of neurodevelopmental status of the child at follow-up and organise assessment of longer-term outcomes including behaviour, educational achievement, cardiovascular status, bone density, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, glucose intolerance and lung function.</P>
<P>Cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of repeat corticosteroids should be conducted.</P>

<P>As the authors of the Multiple courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for preterm birth Study (MACS), which is one of the trials included in this review, we have a few comments that need to be addressed.<BR/>
<BR/>1.      In MACS, we collected data on &#8216;severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)&#8217; rather than &#8216;RDS&#8217;. In this review, data from MACS for &#8216;severe RDS&#8217; are included in the meta-analysis for &#8216;severe lung disease&#8217; but not in the meta-analysis for &#8216;RDS&#8217;. As a result, the data from MACS are currently not able to contribute to answering the question as to the effect of multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids on RDS. Because RDS is defined differently in the various trials we believe it is reasonable that the outcome RDS should include both mild and severe disease.  Subgroup analyses could then look at mild RDS and severe RDS separately. Given that MACS is the largest trial included in the review, it is particularly important that its results should contribute to answering the question about the effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on RDS. <BR/>
<BR/>2.      The review authors have chosen to include data for &#8216;severe RDS&#8217; from the various trials in an outcome of &#8216;severe lung disease&#8217;. We find the labelling of severe RDS as &#8216;severe lung disease&#8217; ambiguous. Severe lung disease could theoretically include meconium aspiration, pneumothorax, group B streptococcal pneumonia and other conditions that are not thought to benefit from antenatal corticosteroids.<BR/>
<BR/>3.      In the Results text section &#8216;secondary outcomes for the child&#8217;, the review states that &#8220;Data were not able to be included in the meta-analysis for Murphy 2008 for anthropometric assessments expressed as means, as standard deviations were not available in the published report.&#8221;  In our report of the 18-24 month follow-up for MACS (Asztalos 2008<SUP>1</SUP>, not Murphy 2008 as stated in the review) the data are expressed as means, mean differences and confidence intervals.  The within-group standard deviations are actually not needed for the meta-analysis, as all that is required is the mean difference (which we reported) and its variance. The variance can be derived by squaring the width of the CI divided by 2*1.96.<BR/>
<BR/>That is: Variance of Mean Difference = [(UL &#8211; LL)/(2*1.96)]2. In any case, an estimate of the within-group standard deviations can be calculated from the confidence limits and the group sample sizes.</P>
<P>The table below shows the summary statistic for the mean difference in birth weight at early childhood follow-up with and without the MACS data. When MACS data are included, the difference in birth weight between the two groups is statistically significant..<BR/> <BR/>

<BR/>The long term impact of weighing less in early childhood is not known.  Nevertheless, that repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids have adverse effects on growth is worrisome in that it signifies the potential for repeated doses to cause harm.</P>
<P>Follow-up studies have thus far been reassuring, demonstrating no difference in death or neurologic impairment in early childhood. However, we should not be falsely reassured by these studies. The long-term follow-up studies have limited power to rule out the effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on infrequent adverse events. Thus, finding no difference in long-term outcome does not necessarily prove safety. We are reminded of the RCTs of postnatal corticosteroid treatment which initially demonstrated short term benefits and then over time, with the completion of long-term studies, demonstrated the potential for harm.<SUP>2</SUP>
<BR/>
</P>
<P>4.      We believe that the findings of short term neonatal benefits from repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids are important. However, given the adverse effect of antenatal corticosteroids on birth weight and weight at early childhood follow-up, and the uncertain effect on long term outcomes, we believe that the conclusions and recommendations for clinical practice in this review should be more cautious than they currently are. We would suggest the review authors consider a statement such as &#8220;Although the short term neonatal benefits of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids support their use, long-term benefits have not been demonstrated and long-term adverse effects have not been ruled out. The adverse effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on birth weight and weight at early childhood follow-up is a concern. Caution should therefore be exercised to ensure that only those women who are at particularly high risk of very early preterm birth are offered treatment with repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids.&#8221;<BR/>

<P>Many thanks to the authors of the Multiple courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for preterm birth Study (MACS).</P>
<P>1. The MACS trial reported on the outcome of 'severe respiratory distress syndrome'. The authors query why the data from MACS were only included in the outcome for 'severe lung disease' rather than RDS (any).</P>
<P>We do not feel that it would be appropriate to combine data from trials reporting respiratory distress syndrome (mild or severe) with severe RDS. This is likely to result in significant heterogeneity and therefore we chose to report data for RDS and severe lung disease as separate outcomes. If the authors of the MACS trial can provide data for RDS (any) we would certainly be willing to add it to the appropriate analysis.</P>
<P>2. The authors of the MACS trial query the labelling of the outcome 'severe lung disease'.</P>
<P>This outcome was selected by the review authors and is defined in the review protocol.</P>
<P>3. The authors of the MACS trial query why their data for anthropometric assessments at 18 to 24 months were not included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Data were not included as SD's were not available in the trial report. We acknowledge that the author of this report was Asztalos 2008, however Cochrane methodology requires that it is the primary trial that is cited in the text. The reference to Asztalos can be found in the reference section of this review. In order to enter data in to the statistical programme we require mean values for each group with the associated standard deviation or standard error. If the authors of the MACS trial can provide us with the mean and standard deviations for the treatment and the control groups with the numbers of children in each group we will certainly be willing to add these data to the appropriate analyses.</P>
<P>4. The authors of the MACS trial query the conclusions of the review.</P>
<P>The review authors consider the conclusions and both the clinical and research recommendations to be appropriate summaries of the available evidence.</P>
