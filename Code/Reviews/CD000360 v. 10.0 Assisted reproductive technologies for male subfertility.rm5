<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of different treatments for couples with male subfertility.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Intra-uterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are frequently-used fertility treatments for couples with low male fertility (subfertility). In IUI, the man's sperm is prepared and placed in the womb (uterus). Thus, the sperm is close to the place where the embryo is made (conception site). IUI can be performed with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). In an OH cycle, women receive drugs to stimulate the ovaries (the organs that produce the eggs (called oocytes)) to increase the number of available oocytes. The main side effects of these drugs are multiple pregnancy (production of two or more embryos (early stage in the development of a baby)) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; the ovaries produce too many eggs). In IVF and ICSI, the fertilisation (where the egg and sperm are together and produce an embryo) is outside the body. The oocytes are retrieved from the woman using an ultrasound-guided needle, piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle, follicular fluid, which contains the oocyte, can be aspirated. It is common to remove between 10 and 15 oocytes. In IVF, the eggs are mixed with the sperm in a culture dish. In ICSI, sperm are injected directly into the oocytes to cause fertilisation. The fertilised oocytes are treated for two to six days in a medium that contains nutrients and are then placed in the uterus.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) investigating male subfertility. We found 10 randomised controlled trials, all comparing different treatments for couples with male subfertility, with a total of 757 couples. The studies evaluated the following treatment options: timed intercourse (TI; where sex occurred at a recommended time in the menstrual cycle) (with or without OH), IUI (with or without OH), IVF and ICSI. The evidence was current to April 2015. We were mainly interested in how many women had live births and OHSS.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found no evidence of a difference in live birth or pregnancy rates between treatments. We also found no evidence of a difference between any of the groups in rates of adverse effects (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage). Available data on OHSS was too limited for us to draw any conclusions.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Most of the evidence was of low or very low quality. The main limitations were failure to describe study methods, small sample sizes and inconsistency in how trials were conducted. Evidence was available for only six of the 14 comparisons that we evaluated. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Intra-uterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are frequently used fertility treatments for couples with male subfertility. The use of these treatments has been subject of discussion. Knowledge on the effectiveness of fertility treatments for male subfertility with different grades of severity is limited. Possibly, couples are exposed to unnecessary or ineffective treatments on a large scale.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-01-20 14:06:24 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different fertility treatments (expectant management, timed intercourse (TI), IUI, IVF and ICSI) for couples whose subfertility appears to be due to abnormal sperm parameters.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-03 01:54:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We searched for all publications that described randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the treatment for male subfertility. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the National Research Register from inception to 14 April 2015, and web-based trial registers from January 1985 to April 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We checked all references in the identified trials and background papers and contacted authors to identify relevant published and unpublished data.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-02-03 01:56:47 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We included RCTs comparing different treatment options for male subfertility. These were expectant management, TI (with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH)), IUI (with or without OH), IVF and ICSI. We included only couples with abnormal sperm parameters.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-03 01:57:55 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. They resolved disagreements by discussion with the rest of the review authors. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE methods.

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-04 17:39:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-02-03 03:53:30 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Male subfertility is a common condition among subfertile couples. It has been estimated to be directly responsible for approximately 30% of problems with conception and to be a contributory factor in 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1985</LINK>). Over time, different definitions of male subfertility have been used. A normal quality semen sample was described as having a sperm concentration of 20 million/mL or greater, total motility 50% or greater, normal morphology in 50% or greater and no sperm antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1987</LINK>). In 1992, The World Health Organization (WHO) changed its criteria for normal sperm morphology from 50% to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1992</LINK>). When strict criteria for morphology were used, greater than 14% was considered normal (<LINK REF="REF-Kruger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kruger 1993</LINK>). Since 2010, the reference values for a normal quality semen sample have been revised and the most important changes to the reference limits were semen volume of 1.5 mL or greater, a sperm concentration of 15 million/mL or greater, total motility 40% or greater and normal morphology in 4% or greater (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>). Despite the worldwide use of the WHO criteria, these are unable to distinguish men who are likely to father a child from men who are not. However, the correlation that has been established is a continuous one between total motile sperm count (TMSC) and the probability of natural conception (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Steeg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Steeg 2011</LINK>). In couples undergoing intra-uterine insemination (IUI), the TMSC also appears to have a consistent, direct relationship with the pregnancy rate, but there is no definite predictive threshold for success (<LINK REF="REF-Tijani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tijani 2010</LINK>). The post-wash TMSC probably has the most predictive value because it reflects both sperm concentration and motility as well as the effects of sperm processing (<LINK REF="REF-van-Weert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weert 2004</LINK>). Because of the different definitions for male subfertility worldwide it is difficult to estimate what proportion of fertility treatments are associated with this indication, or how it affects the overall success rate.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-02-04 17:39:05 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>IUI is a frequently used fertility treatment for couples with male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>). In IUI, a small volume of prepared semen is injected trans-cervically into the uterine cavity around the expected time of ovulation. The rationale behind this procedure is to bypass the cervix and to bring the semen closer to the released oocyte. In addition, washing of semen and the selection of motile sperm (by semen preparation) might further increase the chances of fertilisation (<LINK REF="REF-Duran-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duran 2002a</LINK>). It has been argued that the method of sperm preparation might influence the probability of conception (<LINK REF="REF-Duran-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duran 2002b</LINK>), but there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific preparation technique (<LINK REF="REF-Boomsma-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boomsma 2007</LINK>). IUI can be used with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH), which increases the number of available oocytes at the site of conception. It has also been suggested that it would overcome subtle ovulation disorders that cannot be detected by routine investigations (<LINK REF="REF-Zikopoulos-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zikopoulos 2005</LINK>). OH is achieved by administering drugs such as anti-oestrogens (e.g. clomiphene citrate) or gonadotrophins, sometimes combined with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or, more recently, antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>In natural cycles, the pre-ovulatory luteinising hormone (LH) surge is the best indicator of the initiation of ovulation (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1980</LINK>). Ovulation occurs 35 to 38 hours after the onset of the LH rise in blood (<LINK REF="REF-Hoff-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoff 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Testart-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Testart 1982</LINK>). In stimulated cycles, the chances of adequate timing are increased by the administration of an ovulatory triggering injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). In order to time the hCG injection, the diameter of the largest follicle (mostly 16 to 18 mm) is determined with sonographic measurements. It has been determined that the largest follicle is the most probable to rupture and will do so approximately 38 hours after the hCG injection (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1991</LINK>). Therefore, it is most favourable to inseminate around 35 to 45 hours after hCG administration.</P>
<P>Other, more invasive and expensive, fertility treatments for couples with male subfertility are in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Both methods use controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), which pursues three main objectives: hypophyseal activity suppression, multiple follicle growth stimulation and ovulation induction. Hypophyseal activity suppression, by a GnRH agonist or antagonist, prevents premature ovulation and allows for the timed collection of mature oocytes. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), sometimes combined with LH, is used to stimulate the growth of multiple follicles. Ovulation is induced by hCG or a GnRH agonist and is indicated when multiple follicles of 16 mm or greater are present with sonographic measurements. The optimal timing for ovulation induction remains uncertain, and more studies are necessary to explore the optimal timing (<LINK REF="REF-Mochtar-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mochtar 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tarlatzis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarlatzis 2006</LINK>). Oocyte harvesting is performed approximately 36 hours after hCG or GnRH agonist administration. In IVF, the retrieved oocytes and spermatozoa are put together in a culture dish to achieve fertilisation; for ICSI, a single selected sperm is injected directly into the cytoplasm of the oocyte. The purpose of ICSI is to overcome a potential failure of the sperm to activate the oocyte to initiate fertilisation. After fertilisation, the fertilised oocytes are cultured in a growth medium for two to six days and monitored for embryonic development. Based on morphological criteria for quality, one or two embryos are transferred into the uterine cavity and supernumerary good-quality embryos are cryopreserved. Luteal phase supplementation with progesterone or hCG is necessary to sustain endometrial stimulation.</P>

</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-02-04 05:22:50 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The use of fertility treatments in male subfertility has been under debate. Some authors consider that IUI should be offered as first-line therapy before IVF and ICSI are offered (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattachary--2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattachary 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gregoriou-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Gregoriou 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nan 1994</LINK>). Other authors have questioned its effectiveness in male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1998</LINK>). It has also been suggested that IUI in male subfertility would be advantageous only when a certain threshold value of motile sperm count can be achieved (<LINK REF="REF-van-Voorhis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Voorhis 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Weert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weert 2004</LINK>). When OH is used to enhance the effectiveness of IUI, the prevalence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancy rates increases. The most recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline states that for mild male subfertility, routine use of IUI, either with or without OH is not appropriate. Instead, expectant management for two years is recommended, before considering IVF (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Other authors recommend expectant management (for at least six months) over IUI (or another fertility treatment) in couples with unexplained subfertility or moderate male factor (TMSC greater than three million) and a good or intermediate prognosis for natural conception (<LINK REF="REF-Hunault-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunault 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2006</LINK>). IVF, introduced in the late 1970s as a treatment for tubal infertility, was also proposed as a therapeutic option for male subfertility (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1984</LINK>). Direct and randomised comparisons between IVF and IUI are scarce and in favour of the latter in terms of cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tjon_x002d_Kon_x002d_Fat-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tjon-Kon-Fat 2015</LINK>). However, there is no clear cutoff value for semen quality to support the choice for IVF or IUI. ICSI provided the possibility of genetic offspring even to people with severely compromised semen parameters (<LINK REF="REF-Palermo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palermo 1992</LINK>). More recently, the use of ICSI has increased, also for men with borderline or even normal semen characteristics, without clear evidence of its benefits (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattachary-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattachary 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2007</LINK>) or even its possible harm (<LINK REF="REF-Boulet-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boulet 2015</LINK>). The cutoff values for semen parameters used to decide between conventional IVF and ICSI are generally experience-based (<LINK REF="REF-Tournaye-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tournaye 2012</LINK>), and vary per country/centre/laboratory. Performing a split IVF-ICSI cycle in which sibling oocytes are either inseminated conventionally or micro-injected, may prevent complete fertilisation failure in one out of four IVF cycles for moderate male factor subfertility (<LINK REF="STD-Kihaile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kihaile 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Westenlaken-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Westenlaken 2005</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-03 09:39:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The aim of this review was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of treatments for couples with male subfertility with regard to live birth rates. Because RCTs are considered to provide the best assessment of the effectiveness of treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>), we included only RCTs in this review. The meta-analyses could include 10 studies, see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>; and <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>. These studies reported data on six of the proposed comparisons and included 757 couples with male subfertility who underwent 4400 cycles. The trials in this review revealed that there is no evidence that one of the treatment options is superior to another. However, the available evidence is limited due to small sample size and lack of high quality trials.<BR/>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-04 05:53:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The primary outcome for this review was live birth rate per couple. Not all of the trials reported this outcome. Furthermore, evidence was available for only six of the 14 comparisons that we evaluated. We found RCTs to compare expectant management or TI with IUI, IUI with and without OH and IUI with IVF. Unfortunately, we found no RCTs comparing IVF and ICSI. Although these treatments are used on a large scale for male subfertility globally, we only found studies comparing IVF and ICSI in couples with male subfertility with random allocation of oocytes to fertilisation by insemination or injection only (<LINK REF="STD-Aboulghar-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Aboulghar 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aboulghar-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Aboulghar 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Fan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fishel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Fishel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kastrop-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kastrop 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kihaile-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kihaile 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pisarska-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pisarska 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tournaye-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tournaye 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Westerlaken-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van der Westerlaken 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Verheyen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Verheyen 1999</LINK>). Embryos, irrespective of mode of fertilisation, were transferred according to quality. Therefore, we could draw no conclusions on the effect of IVF or ICSI on pregnancy rate in these studies.</P>
<P>Only a few studies reported on adverse effects. Globally, OHSS and multiple pregnancy rates are considered to be an adverse outcome in subfertility practice (<LINK REF="REF-Dias-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Healy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2004</LINK>). The risk of perinatal mortality and maternal morbidity associated with multiple pregnancy has become increasingly unacceptable. Therefore, the aim in fertility treatment is shifting from focusing on pregnancy rates alone to the birth of healthy term singletons (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>). The use of OH, as part of the IUI treatment, increases the number of available oocytes at the site of conception and thereby might increase the prevalence of OHSS and multiple pregnancy rates. We could not establish on what scale IUI with OH influence OHSS and multiple pregnancy rates in this review. In the literature, only a few studies reported on the differences in multiple pregnancy rates between fertility treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mansour-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mansour 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Practice-Committee-of-the-ASRM-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Practice Committee of the ASRM 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK> found no difference in OHSS or multiple pregnancy rate between IUI with OH and IVF with single embryo transfer in couples experiencing male and unexplained subfertility. Unfortunately, other studies did not report on OHSS rates for couples with male subfertility separately and, therefore, we could draw no firm conclusion from this study for couples experiencing male subfertility, due to the lack of power.</P>
<P>WHO criteria are often applied when defining normal semen quality, but they have little prognostic value. Pregnancy has been achieved with IUI with semen that was below these thresholds (<LINK REF="REF-Dickey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickey 1999</LINK>), and also men whose sperm met these standards have been found infertile (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2015</LINK>). In addition, the distinction between male subfertility (semen parameters below the levels of normality defined by WHO) and unexplained subfertility (semen parameters above the levels of normality defined by WHO) is indefinite. Many trials have been performed to analyse the relationship between semen quality and parameters or the TMSC and natural fertility. For clinical practice, it would be useful to have a test that could distinguish subfertile men with good chances of conception from those with poor odds, rather than discriminating between fertile and subfertile men (<LINK REF="REF-Verhoeve-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhoeve 2006</LINK>). There is evidence for a continuous correlation between TMSC and the probability of natural conception (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Steeg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Steeg 2011</LINK>). The predictive capacity of threshold values for (post-wash) TMSC, progressive motility as well as the role of sperm morphology are yet to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Matorras-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matorras 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ombelet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ombelet 1997</LINK>). It appears that semen quality contributes to the effectiveness of IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Duran-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duran 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ombelet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ombelet 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tijani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tijani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wainer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wainer 2004</LINK>), and that there is a threshold below which IUI is no longer effective (<LINK REF="REF-Dickey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickey 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Weert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Weert 2004</LINK>). Furthermore, semen quality seems to play a role in predicting total fertilisation failure in IVF cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Repping-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Repping 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rhemrev-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rhemrev 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other screening tests have been proposed in male subfertility, such as sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity tests. There are several techniques to measure gross sperm DNA fragmentation (e.g. the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), the sperm chromatin dispersion test (SCD), the TUNEL (terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP-X Nick end-labelling) assay and the Comet assay). An association between the presence of DNA abnormalities in sperm and pregnancy outcome has been established (<LINK REF="REF-Avendano-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avendano 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bakos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bakos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duran-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duran 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simon-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2014</LINK>). In view of the debatable accuracy of these tests to predict pregnancy rates, they do not seem to be of use in practice (<LINK REF="REF-Practice-Committee-of-the-ASRM-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Practice Committee of the ASRM 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The quality of the evidence for most comparisons was low or very low. The method of randomisation and allocation concealment were unclear in some trials. Blinding could not be performed due to the nature of the interventions, but this was unlikely to affect the outcomes in this review. The trials included in the meta-analysis had several limitations, which were most prominent in the oldest studies. These studies had small sample sizes, used a cross-over design, had a limited duration of follow-up that was unequal between the studies and the definition of male subfertility and the clinical protocols used varied among the studies. Methodological quality within studies with a cross-over design in fertility trials have been under debate. A cross-over design could result in an overestimation of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2000</LINK>). Whether this overestimation could be statistically corrected for or whether it is clinically relevant remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>), therefore, we only used the pre-cross-over data. Furthermore, most studies have determined pregnancy rates as the endpoint, while live birth rate was our primary outcome. The latest updated Cochrane guidelines for analysing and presenting results emphasise the use of pregnancy and live birth per woman or couple in the meta-analysis. However, in practice such data are not always available.</P>

<P>Our searches aimed to identify all potentially eligible studies. Besides the potential biases discussed above, there might be some bias due to differential definitions of male subfertility. The trials used different definitions with respect to the numbers of semen samples required, how many and which parameters were assessed, and the thresholds that were subsequently applied for inclusion. Most of the trials used the WHO criteria, in accordance with the year of the study performed.</P>

This review also found a higher live birth rate in IUI with OH cycles versus IUI in natural cycles. There was no evidence of a difference in multiple pregnancy rates.

<P>The data outlined in this review demonstrated that for the treatment of couples with male subfertility, the evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient. No firm conclusions can be drawn about the relative effectiveness of expectant management, intra-uterine insemination (IUI), with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH), in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). More research is needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-02-03 21:54:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>There is need for large prospective multicentre trials with adequate concealment of allocation and comparing the effectiveness of different treatments for couples with male subfertility. In our opinion, priority should be to assess relative merits of ICSI versus IVF.</P>
<P>Data should be reported as the live birth rate per couple or at least as the ongoing pregnancy rate per couple. Adverse events should also be reported. Cut-off values of sperm characteristics such as total motile sperm count before and after preparation could be explored in future trials.</P>
