<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-13 14:17:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review summarizes trials evaluating the effects of reminder systems on attendance at tuberculosis (TB) clinics and completion of TB treatment. After searching for relevant trials up to 29 August 2014, we included nine trials, including 4654 people.</P>
<P>
<B>What are reminder systems and how might they help?</B>
</P>
<P>Effective treatment for TB requires people to take multiple drugs daily for at least six months. Consequently, once they start to feel well again, some patients stop attending clinics and stop taking their medication which can lead to the illness returning and the development of drug resistance. One strategy the World Health Organization recommends is that an appointed person (a health worker or volunteer) watches the person take their medication everyday (called direct observation). Other strategies include reminder systems to prompt patients to attend for appointments on time, or to re-engage people who have missed or defaulted on a scheduled appointment. These prompts may be in the form of telephone calls or letters before the next scheduled appointment ("pre-appointment reminders"), or phone calls, letters, or home visits after a missed appointment ("default reminders").</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says:</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>For people being treated for active TB:</I>
</P>
<P>- More people attended the clinic and completed TB treatment with pre-appointment reminder phone-calls (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>- More people attended the clinic and completed TB treatment with a policy of default reminders (<I>low and moderate quality evidence respectively</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>For people on TB prophylaxis:</I>
</P>
<P>- More people attended the clinic with pre-appointment phone-calls, and the number attending the final clinic was higher with three-monthly phone-calls or nurse home visits.</P>
<P>
<I>For people undergoing screening for TB:</I>
</P>
<P>- Similar numbers of people attended clinic for skin test reading with and without pre-appointment phone-calls (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>- Similar numbers of people attended clinic for skin test reading with and without take home reminder cards.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-30 10:44:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with active tuberculosis (TB) require six months of treatment. Some people find it difficult to complete treatment, and there are several approaches to help ensure completion. One such system relies on reminders, where the health system prompts patients to attend for appointments on time, or re-engages people who have missed or defaulted on a scheduled appointment.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>To assess the effects of reminder systems on improving attendance at TB diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment clinic appointments, and their effects on TB treatment outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, <I>m</I>RCT, and the <I>Indian Journal of Tuberculosis</I> without language restriction up to 29 August 2014. We also checked reference lists and contacted researchers working in the field.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster RCTs and quasi-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies comparing reminder systems with no reminders or an alternative reminder system for people with scheduled appointments for TB diagnosis, prophylaxis, or treatment.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-10-23 15:43:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials. We compared the effects of interventions by using risk ratios (RR) and presented RRs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Also we assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.<BR/>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-13 14:14:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nine trials, including 4654 participants, met our inclusion criteria. Five trials evaluated appointment reminders for people on treatment for active TB, two for people on prophylaxis for latent TB, and four for people undergoing TB screening using skin tests. We classified the interventions into 'pre-appointment' reminders (telephone calls or letters prior to a scheduled appointment) or 'default' reminders (telephone calls, letters, or home visits to people who had missed an appointment).</P>
<P>For people being treated for active TB, clinic attendance and TB treatment completion were higher in people receiving pre-appointment reminder phone-calls (clinic attendance: 66% versus 50%; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.59, one trial (USA), 615 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>; TB treatment completion: 100% versus 88%; RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27, one trial (Thailand), 92 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Clinic attendance and TB treatment completion were also higher with default reminders (letters or home visits) (clinic attendance: 52% versus 10%; RR 5.04, 95% CI 1.61 to 15.78, one trial (India), 52 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>; treatment completion: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.24, two trials (Iraq and India), 680 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For people on TB prophylaxis, clinic attendance was higher with a policy of pre-appointment phone-calls (63% versus 48%; RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59, one trial (USA), 536 participants); and attendance at the final clinic was higher with regular three-monthly phone-calls or nurse visits (93% versus 65%, one trial (Spain), 318 participants).</P>
<P>For people undergoing screening for TB, three trials of pre-appointment phone-calls found little or no effect on the proportion of people returning to clinic for the result of their skin test (three trials, 1189 participants, <I>low quality evidence</I>), and two trials found little or no effect with take home reminder cards (two trials, 711 participants). All four trials were conducted among healthy volunteers in the USA. <BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-30 10:44:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Policies of sending reminders to people pre-appointment, and contacting people who miss appointments, seem sensible additions to any TB programme, and the limited evidence available suggests they have small but potentially important benefits. Future studies of modern technologies such as short message service (SMS) reminders would be useful, particularly in low-resource settings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-22 14:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I>, and spreads from person to person through inhalation of droplets nuclei. As a cause of human suffering, death, and impoverishment, TB ranks among the leading infectious diseases. In 2012, there were an estimated 8.6 million incident cases of TB and 1.3 million TB-related deaths worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In some settings, groups of people considered to be at high risk may be screened for latent TB infection using Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) tests (also known as tuberculin skin tests), such as the Mantoux or Heaf tests, or the more recently developed interferon-gamma blood tests. PPD tests involve injecting a protein derivative of the <I>M. tuberculosis</I> bacillus into the skin, waiting 48 to 72 hours, and then measuring any localized swelling (or induration) of the skin around the injection site. People with positive results may then undergo further tests to detect or exclude active TB. Latent TB is treated for up to 12 months with antituberculous drugs to clear the latent infection and prevent the development of active disease; termed 'TB prophylaxis'.</P>
<P>The standard method for diagnosing active pulmonary TB (PTB) is sputum microscopy and culture, where people provide two or three sputum samples, including an early morning sample, collected on separate occasions. Patients are advised to return to the clinic to receive the results, and those with positive results are then referred for treatment. More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended the use of a rapid molecular diagnostic test, known as Xpert® MTB/RIF, which can provide results within two hours (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-Steingart-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steingart 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment for active TB requires patients to take multiple medications for at least six months. The standard regimen currently recommended by the WHO includes four drugs for two months (the intensive phase), followed by two drugs for four months (the consolidation phase) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Poor adherence to antituberculous treatment may lead to treatment failure and relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Ormerod-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormerod 1991</LINK>), drug resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Weis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weis 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchison 1998</LINK>), and prolonged and expensive therapy that is less likely to be successful than the treatment of drug-susceptible TB (<LINK REF="REF-Goble-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goble 1993</LINK>). Poor adherence also results in increased transmission rates of the tubercle bacilli, morbidity, and cost to the TB control programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-22 14:24:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adherence to a TB diagnosis and treatment programme requires accessible and appropriate health care, and a number of interventions have been used to promote adherence (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003b</LINK>). Directly observed therapy (DOT), where an appointed agent (health worker, community volunteer, or family member) watches the patient swallow their medication each day, has been the mainstay of adherence promotion since its introduction in the 1990s, and the randomized evidence of its effects is summarized in a previous systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reminder systems are policies implemented by the health service to improve or maintain attendance at appointments or adherence to treatment. The reminders may consist of home visits to patients, letters, telephone calls, e-mails or short message service (SMS) text messages (<LINK REF="REF-Thilakavathi-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thilakavathi 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2003</LINK>), and may be undertaken by health service staff, volunteers, or community members. They may sometimes include a health education component; explaining to the patient the benefits of attending appointments and taking medication. In this review we classify the reminder systems into:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Pre-appointment reminders; defined as any action to contact patients shortly before they are due to take their medication or attend a healthcare appointment, and remind them to take their medication or attend their appointment, and</LI>
<LI>Default reminders (sometimes called 'defaulter actions' or 'late patient tracers'); defined as actions undertaken when a patient fails to keep an appointment. They generally aim to re-establish contact with the patient, to find out why they did not attend, and to encourage re-engagement with services.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This Cochrane Review is one of several published, planned, or in progress to evaluate different strategies to promote adherence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Reminder systems to improve patient adherence to TB clinic appointments for diagnosis and treatment: reminding patients to keep an appointment and actions taken when patients fail to keep an appointment (this review).</LI>
<LI>DOT: an appointed agent (health worker, community volunteer, family member) directly monitors people swallowing their antituberculous drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2007</LINK>). (This is one of the five components of the wider strategy called 'DOTS' (the directly observed treatment, short course), which remains at the heart of global Stop TB Strategy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2006</LINK>)).</LI>
<LI>Patient education and counselling for promoting adherence to treatment for TB: provision of information or one-to-one or group counselling about TB and the need to complete treatment (<LINK REF="REF-M_x0027_Imunya-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">M'Imunya 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Material incentives and enablers in the management of TB: cash or vouchers for patients to promote their return for the results of tests or to take prescribed treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Lutge-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutge 2012</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Staff motivation and supervision: training and management processes that aim to improve how providers care for people with TB.</LI>
<LI>Peer assistance: people from the same social group helping someone with TB return to the health service by prompting or accompanying them.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Reminders are not newly developed interventions, and some national treatment programmes use one or both types of reminders as standard procedure. For example, in South Africa, the TB control programme uses a client-held card and a clinic card where the next appointment is recorded, which serve as a pre-appointment reminder to both the patients and the health workers (<LINK REF="REF-National-Department-of-Health-South-Africa-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">National Department of Health South Africa 2014</LINK>). In 1988 to 1989, the national treatment programme manuals in India recommended defaulter reminders to contact patients who did not return to the clinic for their fortnightly drug collection, on the first day after a missed appointment and then on the fourth day (<LINK REF="REF-Jagota-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagota 1996</LINK>). In Malaysia, where DOT is used, when patients have missed more than seven consecutive days of treatment, a specialist tracing team visits their home to find out why they have not attended the clinic for treatment. Another visit is made if the patient subsequently fails to attend (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Boyle-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Boyle 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to increasing MDR-TB prevalence in many countries, actions to remind patients about attending clinic appointments for diagnosis and treatment play an important role in preventing multi-drug resistance to anti-TB drugs. In this review, we look at the effects of reminders in two aspects: (1) whether a single reminder action has any potential efficacy on attendance at the next TB clinic appointment; and (2) whether a policy of regularly reminding patients who missed their appointments could improve their outcomes including TB cure or treatment completion.</P>

<P>QL undertook the analyses using <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK> in consultation with the other review authors. All trials reported only dichotomous data, so we have expressed trial results as risk ratio (RR) with its 95% CIs for each outcome. When significant statistical heterogeneity was present and it was appropriate to combine the data, we used the random-effects model. We stratified the analysis by the type of reminder (pre-appointment reminders, default reminders), and trial design. For future updates, we will use the methods outlined in the protocol to handle other types of data that may become available (for example, continuous data, or analysis of cluster trials, or controlled before-and-after studies).</P>
<P>We used the GRADE approach to assess and grade the quality of evidence of primary outcomes. The quality rating across studies has four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low. RCTs are initially categorized as high quality but can be downgraded after assessment of five criteria: risk of bias, consistency, directness, imprecision, and publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>In one small trial from a setting where DOTS was currently implemented, a policy of pre-appointment telephone reminders increased treatment completion from 88% to 100% (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27, one trial, 98 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). This trial provided few details on the process of randomization and is at unclear risk of selection bias.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Default reminder</HEADING>
<P>In one trial, with low rates of clinic attendance, reminder letters increased clinic attendance from 10% to 52% (RR 5.04, 95% CI 1.61 to 15.78, one trial, 52 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In this very small trial treatment was self-supervised with monthly pick-up of medications. The findings may not be applicable to situations where treatment is directly observed.</P>
<P>In two further trials, policies of default reminders increased treatment completion from 73% to 88% in a setting without DOTS, and from 83% to 96% in a setting where DOTS was implemented (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.24, two trials, 680 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). In the first trial, volunteers visited people who had missed an appointment at their own homes to motivate them to attend and provide health education (<LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003)</LINK>. In the second trial, letters were sent on the fourth day after a missed appointment (<LINK REF="STD-Paramasivan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Paramasivan 1993</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials, from the USA and Spain, evaluated reminders for people on TB prophylaxis. In the USA, pre-appointment telephone reminders increased attendance at a single clinic appointment from 48% to 62.5% (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59, one trial, 536 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In Spain, where children were given 12 months of isoniazid treatment to be supervised at home by their parents, attendance at the final clinic appointment was increased by a policy of routine phone calls every three months (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.72), routine home visits every three months by a specialist nurse (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.74), and by routine doctor clinic appointments every three months (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.47), although this third policy did not quite reach statistical significance (one trial, 318 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Forty-three participants withdrew from treatment; the reasons for their withdrawal and their group allocation were not clear.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>We included nine trials, reported in eight papers, in this review. Six trials assessed the use of pre-appointment reminders and three assessed default reminders.</P>
<P>For people being treated for active TB, clinic attendance and TB treatment completion were higher in people receiving pre-appointment reminder phone-calls (<I>low quality evidence</I>). Clinic attendance (<I>low quality evidence</I>) and TB treatment completion (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>) were also higher with default reminders (letters or home visits).</P>
<P>For people on TB prophylaxis, clinic attendance was higher with a policy of pre-appointment phone-calls, and attendance at the final clinic was higher with regular three-monthly phone-calls or nurse visits.</P>
<P>For people undergoing screening for TB, three trials of pre-appointment reminder letters or phone-calls found little or no effect on the proportion of people returning to clinic for the result of their skin test (<I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>There is inadequate evidence to show differences between different types of pre-appointment reminders (experts versus non-experts; take-home card, a postcard or a telephone call) as well as between different types of default reminders (home visit versus letter).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Almost all the included trials were conducted before or during the 1990s, when DOTS was not yet widely practised. Consequently, some of the findings, especially those from settings where attendance and treatment completion are very low, may be poorly applicable to settings where DOTS is being implemented and adherence is much higher. However, two of the more recent trials were conducted in areas with reasonable levels of treatment completion (<LINK REF="STD-Mohan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Mohan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kunawararak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kunawararak 2011</LINK>) and still found clinically important gains through appointment reminders.</P>
<P>There is much interest and enthusiasm in the use of mobile phones to improve patient adherence and attendance, but only one small trial met our inclusion criteria. Mobile telephone use could be used in various ways, for example, to remind patients to take their medicine and keep appointments, to provide knowledge on TB, and to support patients. There are quite a few pilot studies examining the use of mobile telephones in improving TB medication adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Visarutrat-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visarutrat 2009</LINK>), but robust evidence on mobile telephone reminders is still insufficient. Once completed, we may include a few ongoing trials evaluating SMS reminders in improving TB adherence in future review updates although not all of them may be relevant to our review (<LINK REF="REF-Bediang-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bediang 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is important to note that we excluded studies that used bundled interventions from this review (<LINK REF="STD-Thiam-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Thiam 2007</LINK>). Excluding studies that used packaged or multiple interventions implemented under programme conditions limits the generalizability of this review. This also highlights the difficulty of doing systematic reviews of trials that test multiple or combined interventions to improve adherence to long-term treatment regimens. Future reviews should consider the implementation of interventions under programme settings. Sustainability and duration of effectiveness of the interventions are other important factors to consider in assessing the effectiveness of healthcare interventions aimed at improving adherence. Strategies to improve patient adherence can be divided into patient-oriented, provider-oriented, and system interventions.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and presented the findings in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>For people undergoing treatment for active TB, we judged the quality of the evidence that pre-appointment reminder phone calls improve clinic attendance and TB treatment completion to be of low quality, meaning that further research is very likely to change these estimates of effect. The main reasons for downgrading quality were: 1) risk of bias: none of the trials adequately described methods to prevent selection bias; 2) indirectness: the single trial assessing clinic attendance was from the USA and may be poorly generalized to elsewhere; and 3) imprecision: the single trial reporting TB treatment completion was significantly underpowered to confidently detect this effect.</P>
<P>We also considered the evidence that default reminders improve clinic attendance to be of low quality because the single trial from India was underpowered to detect clinical important effects and the results are not be easily generalized to elsewhere. However, we have more confidence that default reminders improve TB treatment completion and judged this evidence to be of moderate quality. However, the evidence is still limited to just two trials implementing different default reminder systems and further trials would still be useful to improve confidence that the finding can be generalized to elsewhere.</P>

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>A systematic review was published recently to assess the evidence for the use of text messaging to promote adherence to TB treatment, although the four studies included were not on reminder systems for clinic appointments (<LINK REF="REF-Nglazi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nglazi 2013</LINK>). This review underscored the paucity of high-quality studies on the effectiveness of text messaging. Our review focused on interventions to remind patients to take their medicine or keep appointments. Hence, we also excluded a recent pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Iribarren-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Iribarren 2013</LINK>) that assessed a text messaging intervention to promote TB treatment adherence. In this study, the SMS intervention was not to remind patients about taking their medication or attend appointments but to remind patients to text the investigators about their intake of medications, to receive patients' questions, and to send educational texts.</P>
<P>A Cochrane Review of patient reminders and recall systems for improving immunization rates showed that all types of reminders were effective (postcards, letters, telephone, or autodialer calls), with telephone being the most effective but most costly (<LINK REF="REF-Vann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vann 2005</LINK>). However, all trials were from high-income countries.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Policies of sending reminders to people pre-appointment, and contacting people who miss appointments, seem like sensible additions to any TB program, and the limited evidence available suggests they may have potentially important effects.</P>
<P>Different types of reminders can be tailored to suit specific provider and practice needs. Based on current studies, there is insufficient evidence to assess the differences between different types of reminders. When choosing the type of reminders, some practical issues also need to be considered, such as staffing, transportation, health facilities, perceived accuracy of patient telephone numbers or addresses, availability of computer programmers, overall programme costs, and estimated patient responses to different types of reminders. Practitioners need to consider their own settings when interpreting the findings in this review since these factors vary widely across nations or geographical regions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>Due to the poor quality of evidence, more well-designed trials are needed to establish whether pre-appointment reminders are effective in different settings, and the best way of delivering reminders, especially in low-income countries. For default reminders, more high quality trials are needed to decide on the most effective reminder actions in different settings. Specifically, future trials should describe carefully the study design, setting, and the details of the intervention, and report primary/clinical health outcomes of the patients, as well as the resource implications. Future studies of modern technologies such as SMS reminders in addition to DOT, or even in replacement of DOT, would be useful, particularly for low-resource settings.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2014-10-21 09:51:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Qin Liu">
<P>We amended the original protocol title 'Reminder systems and late patient tracers in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis'. After publication of the original review, we found that the term 'late patient tracers' was unfamiliar to many readers, hence we used 'pre-appointment reminders' instead of 'reminder systems' to mean any action to remind patients before they take their medication or attend their appointment; and 'default reminders' instead of 'late patient tracers' to mean similar interventions undertaken when patients fail to keep an appointment. Consequently, we changed the title to 'Reminder systems to improve patient adherence to TB clinic appointments for diagnosis and treatment' and also amended the terminologies in the review.</P>
