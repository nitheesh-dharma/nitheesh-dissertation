<DESCRIPTION>
<P>An update search run on 29 November 2016 identified 267 new records of which 6 new eligible studies (<LINK REF="STD-Corli-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Corli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lux-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2014</LINK>), have been included in this review. The studies added a further 1258 participants to the review and examined four new comparisons with oxycodone, namely transdermal (TD) fentanyl (2 studies), TD buprenorphine, extended-release (ER) oxycodone, and ER hydromorphone, and also contained data to include in the original controlled-release (CR) oxycodone versus CR morphine comparison. The additional studies allowed us to meta-analyse the adverse event data (which were summarised narratively and in tables in the original review), to examine the robustness of our primary outcome pain intensity meta-analyses in sensitivity analyses, and to include an additional meta-analysis of pain intensity for the comparison of CR oxycodone and TD fentanyl. None of the meta-analyses of pain intensity and adverse events were significant with two exceptions: 1) Pain intensity was statistically significantly, but not clinically significantly, higher after treatment with CR oxycodone compared to CR morphine. Sensitivity analysis of this result however did not find a statistically significant difference in pain intensity between the two treatments, and 2) the risk ratio of experiencing hallucinations was significantly higher after treatment with CR morphine than CR oxycodone. Otherwise, the conclusions of the updated review remain the same as that of the original review. Previous readers of the review may enjoy re-reading this update.</P>

<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Many people with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with strong painkillers that are classified as opioids.</P>
<P>Oxycodone and morphine are examples of these opioids that are used for the relief of cancer pain. However, strong painkillers are not effective for pain in all people neither are they well-tolerated by all people. The aim of this review was to assess whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other strong painkillers for adults with cancer pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>For this update, in November 2016, we found six more relevant studies. In total, we included 23 studies with 2648 participants. These studies compared the painkilling ability (benefit) and side effects (harms) of different types of oxycodone to each other or to other strong painkillers.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Generally, the studies showed that oxycodone is an equally effective strong painkiller whether taken every six or every 12 hours, and equally effective as other strong pain killers, such as morphine.</P>
<P>All the strong painkillers examined in the studies were also associated with a number of unwanted effects, such as vomiting, constipation, and drowsiness. Overall, these do not differ between oxycodone and the other strong painkillers. Hallucinations (where people experience imaginary things, e.g. hearing voices) are much less common as a side effect but we found that they were less likely with oxycodone than within morphine.</P>
<P>Overall, we found that the current evidence is comprised of studies that contained small numbers of participants of which many (19%) did not complete the studies. However, since there was very little difference between oxycodone and morphine, more research in this area is unlikely. Studies looking at oxycodone compared to other strong pain killers may be useful.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. Overall the quality of the evidence was low or very low, downgraded because of issues with study quality and size.</P>

Strong opioids are, however, not effective for pain in all people, neither are they well-tolerated by all people. The aim of this review was to assess whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other analgesic options for adults with cancer pain.

<P>To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone by any route of administration for pain in adults with cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (ISI Web of Science), BIOSIS (ISI), and PsycINFO (Ovid) to November 2016. We also searched four trial registries, checked the bibliographic references of relevant studies, and contacted the authors of the included studies. We applied no language, date, or publication status restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (parallel group or cross-over) comparing oxycodone (any formulation or route of administration) with placebo or an active drug (including oxycodone) for cancer background pain in adults by examining pain intensity/relief, adverse events, quality of life, and participant preference.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the included studies using standard Cochrane methodology. We meta-analysed pain intensity data using the generic inverse variance method, and adverse events using the Mantel-Haenszel method, or summarised these data narratively along with the quality of life and participant preference data. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>For this update, we identified six new studies (1258 participants) for inclusion. In total, we included 23 studies which enrolled/randomised 2648 participants, with 2144 of these analysed for efficacy and 2363 for safety. The studies examined a number of different drug comparisons.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis of three of the four studies comparing controlled-release (CR) oxycodone to immediate-release (IR) oxycodone showed that the ability of CR and IR oxycodone to provide pain relief were similar (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.06 to 0.26; low quality evidence). Pooled analyses of adverse events showed no significant differences between CR and IR oxycodone for asthenia (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.68), confusion (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.02), constipation (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.13), dizziness/lightheadedness (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.37), drowsiness/somnolence (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.54), dry mouth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.75), insomnia (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.53), nausea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28), nervousness (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.2 to 1.64), pruritus (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.25), vomiting (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15), and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.22). The quality of the evidence was very low for all these adverse events. Three of the four studies found similar results for treatment acceptability.</P>
<P>Pooled analysis of seven of the nine studies comparing CR oxycodone to CR morphine indicated that pain relief was significantly better after treatment with CR morphine than CR oxycodone (SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27; low quality evidence). However, sensitivity analysis did not corroborate this result (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.26).</P>
<P>Pooled analyses of adverse events showed no significant differences between CR oxycodone and CR morphine for confusion (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.78 to 1.31), constipation (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16), dizziness/lightheadedness (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76), drowsiness/somnolence (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08), dry mouth (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.26), dysuria (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.26), nausea (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26), pruritus (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.29), vomiting (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.29), and discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.6). However, the RR for hallucinations was significantly lower after treatment with CR oxycodone compared to CR morphine (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.97). The quality of the evidence was very low for all these adverse events. There were no marked differences in treatment acceptability or quality of life ratings.</P>
<P>The remaining studies either compared oxycodone in various formulations or compared oxycodone to different alternative opioids. None found any clear superiority or inferiority of oxycodone for cancer pain, neither as an analgesic agent nor in terms of adverse event rates and treatment acceptability.</P>
<P>The quality of this evidence base was limited by the high or unclear risk of bias of the studies and by imprecision due to low or very low event rates or participant numbers for many outcomes.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>The conclusions have not changed since the previous version of this review. The data suggest that oxycodone offers similar levels of pain relief and overall adverse events to other strong opioids including morphine. Although we identified a clinically insignificant benefit on pain relief in favour of CR morphine over CR oxycodone, this did not persist following sensitivity analysis and so we do not consider this important. However, in this updated analysis, we found that hallucinations occurred less often with CR oxycodone than with CR morphine, but the quality of this evidence was very low so this finding should be treated with utmost caution. Our conclusions are consistent with other reviews and suggest that while the reliability of the evidence base is low, given the absence of important differences within this analysis it seems unlikely that larger head to head studies of oxycodone versus morphine are justified, although well-designed trials comparing oxycodone to other strong analgesics may well be useful. For clinical purposes, oxycodone or morphine can be used as first-line oral opioids for relief of cancer pain in adults.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2015, Issue 2 on oxycodone for cancer-related pain.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-08-15 10:58:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain from cancer can be caused by direct invasion of a tumour into soft tissue or bone and is often a presenting symptom at the time of diagnosis of cancer. One European survey published in 2009 found that, of 5000 people with cancer (including 617 community-based National Health Service (NHS) patients in the UK), 72% experienced pain (77% of UK patients) which was of moderate to severe intensity in 90% of this group (<LINK REF="REF-Breivik-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Breivik 2009</LINK>). This is consistent with a systematic review that demonstrated cancer pain prevalence of up to 75% in advanced disease, and that at least 30% of people with cancer are undertreated (<LINK REF="REF-Greco-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greco 2014</LINK>). Recent research has also shown that less than half of all people with cancer that die are prescribed a strong opioid, and that median treatment duration is only nine weeks before death (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 2016</LINK>). Pain in people with cancer may also be caused by cancer treatments and by comorbid conditions. In this review, we define cancer pain as pain arising as a direct consequence of the cancer, and not from other aetiologies.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-08-15 10:58:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Oxycodone is a strong opioid analgesic indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain, including cancer pain. It is available orally as immediate-release (IR) solution and tablets (for four-hourly dosing) and as sustained (controlled (CR)) release tablets (for 12-hourly dosing). It is also available as a parenteral injection. In some countries, oxycodone is available as a compound with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-08-16 16:03:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Oxycodone works primarily as an agonist of mu-opioid receptors in the spinal cord and brain. It has some activity at kappa-opioid receptors (which are also involved in nociception or analgesia) though the importance of this mechanism in the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone is unclear. Despite animal studies suggesting differences in pharmacodynamics, these have not been demonstrated in clinical studies to date. Therefore, the shared mechanism of action to other strong opioids (i.e. agonist activity at mu-opioid receptors) means that clinical benefits and adverse effects are likely to be similar. However, important differences exist in the pharmacokinetics of strong opioids (e.g. morphine undergoes second-phase elimination via glucuronidation, while oxycodone undergoes extensive first-phase metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 pathways) so clinical equivalence cannot be inferred (<LINK REF="REF-Gudin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gudin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leppert-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leppert 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-08-15 10:59:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) published the Method for Cancer Pain Relief (WHO analgesic ladder) in 1986 (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1986</LINK>), which advocates a stepwise approach to analgesia for cancer pain and revolutionised the use of oral opioids. It recommended that morphine be used first line for moderate to severe cancer pain. Observational studies have suggested that this approach results in pain control for 73% of people (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2008</LINK>) with a mean reduction in pain intensity of 65% (<LINK REF="REF-Ventafridda-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ventafridda 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many people with cancer experience moderate to severe pain that requires treatment with strong analgesics. Oxycodone and morphine are examples of strong opioids that are used for the relief of cancer pain. However, strong opioids are not effective for pain in all people, neither are they well tolerated by all people. Guidance by the European Association for Palliative Care on the use of opioids in cancer pain suggests that oxycodone could be used as first-line treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain as an alternative to morphine (<LINK REF="REF-Caraceni-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caraceni 2012</LINK>). The aim of this review is to assess whether oxycodone is associated with better pain relief and tolerability than other analgesic options for people with cancer pain. The protocol for this review was updated from <LINK REF="REF-Reid-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2010</LINK>.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-08-15 11:04:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (MSH and JSH or NB) independently assessed the methodological quality of each of the included studies by using the 'Risk of bias' assessment method outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). For each study, we assessed the risk of bias for the following domains: selection bias (study level; two items; random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (outcome level; two items; blinding of participants and blinding of treating personnel), detection bias (outcome level; one item; blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (outcome level; one item; incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (study level; one item; selective reporting). For the question on allocation concealment, in the absence of explicit explanation about allocation concealment, we accepted 'central randomisation' as sufficient indication of adequate allocation concealment and consequently rated such studies as low risk of bias for this item. We also included an item that assessed the adequacy of titration (with judgements made based on any available relevant information, including design features, inclusion criteria, and interim pain assessments) and another item that captured whether data were available for both time periods in cross-over trials. Each of the 'Risk of bias' items required a 'low risk,' 'high risk,' or 'unclear risk' response. We also documented the reasons for each response in accordance with <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>, and resolved any disagreements on the 'Risk of bias' ratings through discussion. For the item assessing whether data were available for both time periods in cross-over trials, we inputted 'unclear' and 'not applicable' as the rating and reason for parallel-group trials.</P>

<P>The participant was the unit of analysis, but in a number of cases the data reported in the included cross-over trials could not otherwise be incorporated into the analyses (see <LINK TAG="MISSING_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Dealing with missing data</LINK>), so we included them as if the design had been parallel-group. <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK> (in Chapter 16) pointed out that this approach, while giving rise to unit of analysis error, is nevertheless conservative as it results in an underweighting of the data. However, in order to assess the impact of this strategy, we also performed sensitivity analyses when we included cross-over trial data in this manner by excluding the cross-over trials from the meta-analyses.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2017-08-15 11:04:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In cases where data were missing, we contacted the authors to request the missing data. This strategy did not result in any additional data. We limited imputation of missing data to the imputation of missing SDs, either by calculating the SD if enough information was available or by using SDs from similar samples or studies, both according to the methods outlined by <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. We only imputed SDs for pain intensity for <LINK REF="STD-Lux-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2014</LINK>, which were not reported for the subgroup of participants with malignant pain, by using the reported SDs for the whole sample of participants with either malignant (n = 31) or non-malignant pain (n = 15), and for <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2014</LINK> for the primary outcome of the study "mean pain at its worst in the past 24 hours" by using the standard deviations for the same outcome measured at baseline in the full analysis set. We recorded the dropout/missing data rates in the 'Risk of bias' tables under the items on attrition bias and in the 'Participants' section of the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table, and we addressed the potential effect of the missing data on the results in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>.

<P>We entered the data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), which was used for data synthesis. We analysed pain intensity using the generic inverse variance method in accordance with <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. As the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was not above 50%, we used a fixed-effect model. However, given the limitations of this analysis strategy as outlined in the <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK> section, we also considered the results of the individual studies. We meta-analysed the adverse events data by using the Mantel-Haenszel method; however, as this method is not suitable for cross-over trial data, we only included the data from parallel-group trials in these analyses. In addition, we have also presented all reported adverse events from the included studies in tables.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>We used the GRADE system to rank the quality of the evidence using the GRADEprofiler Guideline Development Tool software (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT 2015</LINK>), and the guidelines provided in Chapter 12.2 of the <I>Cochrane</I> <I>Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grade of evidence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>high: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>moderate: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different;</LI>
<LI>low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect;</LI>
<LI>very low: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We decreased the grade rating by one (-1) or two (-2) if we identified:</P>
<UL>
<LI>serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality;</LI>
<LI>important inconsistency (-1);</LI>
<LI>some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness;</LI>

<P>For this update, we excluded five studies. Of the records identified by the original and the update search, altogether we excluded 63 studies. A number of the studies identified in the searches compared oxycodone in combination with another drug (e.g. naloxone or acetaminophen) against oxycodone alone or placebo. Such studies were not included as they would not answer our primary question, which concerned the effectiveness of oxycodone for cancer pain. The majority of the 63 studies were excluded because they did not include the population or comparison of interest (36 studies), while others were excluded because they were systematic (11) or narrative reviews (six), not RCTs/RCT-based analyses (seven), letters to the editor (two), or case reports (one).

<P>The problem of under-reporting was also an issue when assigning risk of bias estimates to the items assessing performance and detection bias, that is, blinding. In no instance was it directly and unequivocally reported who was blinded, so we had to infer, on the basis of supplementary information, whether we were reasonably certain that blinding had been adequately executed for a given individual (that is, participant, treating personnel, outcome assessors, or a combination of these, where not the participants themselves). On this basis, the risk of performance bias was considered to be low for the primary outcome of pain in 13 of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Beaver-1978a" TYPE="STUDY">Beaver 1978a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beaver-1978b" TYPE="STUDY">Beaver 1978b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruera-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bruera 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hagen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hagen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiskanen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiskanen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Imanaka-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Imanaka 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lauretti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lauretti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lux-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Lux 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mucci_x002d_LoRusso-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mucci-LoRusso 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parris-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Parris 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stambaugh-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Stambaugh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2014</LINK>), unclear in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gabrail-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gabrail 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kalso-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kalso 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2014</LINK>), and high in six of the studies that were all described as open-label (<LINK REF="STD-Corli-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Corli 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leow-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Leow 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercadante-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Mercadante 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riley-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Riley 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salzman-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Salzman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2016</LINK>).

The pattern of judgements was identical for detection bias, for both outcomes. This was the case for the primary outcome of pain because, according to our criteria, this outcome had to be participant reported. It was therefore at risk of detection bias to the same extent that it was at risk of performance bias since both depend on participant blinding. As is also evident from the bias judgements (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table), when a study was described as double-blind but did not describe who was blinded, additional information in the studies generally led us to the conclusion that at least the participants seemed to be blinded, although we did not feel able to gauge with sufficient confidence who else might have been blinded. Given that it was not always clear who assessed the adverse events, this accounts for the similar judgements for performance and detection bias for this outcome.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2017-10-25 13:12:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry L D Harding">
<P>For the current update, we identified six additional studies for inclusion, which allowed us to perform further meta-analyses, principally on the adverse event data. We were also able to examine four new treatment comparisons with oxycodone, and assess the robustness of our primary pain intensity meta-analyses by performing sensitivity analyses. Although these analyses found that CR oxycodone was associated with a higher pain intensity, and therefore less pain relief, and a lower risk of hallucinations compared to CR morphine, the updated results and conclusions are broadly speaking the same as the original review because the (current) finding of inferior pain relief by CR oxycodone compared to CR morphine was only statistically and not clinically significant as the effect size was very small. It was also not supported by sensitivity analyses, and the finding of a lower risk of hallucinations with treatment with CR oxycodone compared to CR morphine was based on very low event rates (see 'For clinicians' in <LINK TAG="IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE" TYPE="SECTION">Implications for practice</LINK>).</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-25 13:12:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kerry L D Harding">
<P>Overall, we included 23 studies which enrolled/randomised 2648 participants, with 2144 of these analysed for efficacy and 2363 for safety. The studies examined a number of different drug comparisons.</P>
<P>Four studies compared CR oxycodone to IR oxycodone, and pooled analysis of three of these studies showed that there was no difference in pain intensity after treatment with either CR or IR oxycodone (SMD 0.1, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.26). This is also in line with the finding that none of the included studies reported that the pain intensity differed between the treatment groups. Pooled analyses of the adverse event data from three of the studies found no differences between the treatments in RRs for any of the adverse events, and the fourth study, which could not be included in the pooled analyses, reported no differences in adverse events either. Three of the four studies also found no difference in treatment acceptability between the comparisons. We noted that IR oxycodone was given every six hours rather than every four hours in these studies. This might have biased the efficacy data in favour of CR oxycodone; however, the adverse effect data suggest that giving IR oxycodone every four hours (more frequently) would have resulted in greater adverse effects, which would have mitigated advantages in efficacy.</P>
<P>Nine studies compared CR oxycodone to CR morphine and pooled analysis of seven of these nine studies suggested that pain intensity did differ significantly between the treatments (SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27). However, this result was not corroborated by a sensitivity analysis that excluded the two cross-over trials included in the overall analysis (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.26). There were no marked differences in terms of treatment acceptability or quality of life ratings observed between the treatments. <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2014</LINK> also found no significant differences in pain relief rates between CR oxycodone, CR morphine and CR MS Contin. Pooled analyses of the adverse event rates also found no differences between the treatments for any of the adverse events, with the exception of hallucinations, which participants treated with CR morphine were at almost double the risk of experiencing compared to participants treated with CR oxycodone. However, these findings contrast somewhat with those reported in <LINK REF="STD-Lauretti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lauretti 2003</LINK>, which was different in design to the other four studies and examined IR morphine consumption during treatment with CR oxycodone and CR morphine while keeping the ratio of CR oxycodone and CR morphine constant. <LINK REF="STD-Lauretti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lauretti 2003</LINK> found that the participants consumed 38% more IR morphine during treatment with CR morphine than with CR oxycodone, and that CR and IR morphine was associated with more nausea and vomiting and a similar acceptance to the study drugs compared to the combination of CR oxycodone and IR morphine, and therefore concluded that CR oxycodone combined with IR morphine is associated with superior analgesia and lower or similar rates of adverse events than a combination of CR and IR morphine.</P>
<P>Two studies compared CR oxycodone to TD fentanyl and pooled analysis of them found that the pain intensity scores after treatment with CR oxycodone and TD fentanyl did not differ significantly (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.24). One of the studies also found that quality of life did not differ between the treatments, but there was some disagreement between the study results in terms of adverse events with one of the studies finding that the rates of nausea and vomiting, and constipation were significantly higher in the CR oxycodone group than in the TD fentanyl group, whereas the other study reported no treatment group differences in (these and other) adverse event rates.</P>
<P>The remaining studies all compared either oxycodone in different formulations or oxycodone to different alternative opioids and none of them found any clear superiority or inferiority of oxycodone for cancer pain, neither as an analgesic agent nor in terms of adverse event rates or treatment acceptability. </P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-15 12:33:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the findings of this review are applicable to the population and comparisons defined for this review, that is, adults with cancer who need treatment with strong opioids for cancer pain, they should be taken in the context that this review found 23 studies that were eligible for inclusion and these studies reported on 13 different comparisons involving oxycodone and included only 2648 participants. Moreover, for some of the outcomes (participant preference and quality of life) there were extremely few data available. To somewhat mitigate this shortfall, we reported treatment acceptability as a proxy. However, that does not change the fact that the evidence base for the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone (relative or absolute) for pain in adults with cancer was very limited and it did not allow us to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of oxycodone in detail through participant or treatment subgroup analyses. The current evidence base would therefore benefit from more well-designed, large RCTs.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-06 15:03:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>The quality of the evidence for all the outcomes was low or very low, meaning we have little confidence in the effect estimate and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. This is due to imprecision (low participant numbers) in some cases, and serious or very serious study limitations in all cases. In general, the assessment of the quality of the included studies was limited by a great extent of under-reporting in the studies, especially for the participant selection items (random sequence generation and allocation concealment), while blinding appeared to be reasonably well undertaken overall, both in terms of treatment performance and outcome assessment. However, as is not unusual for pain research, the results were substantially compromised by attrition, with data missing from just under 20% of the enrolled/randomised participants for efficacy, and from more than 10% for safety. These are substantial proportions and, while it did not appear to be selective attrition, the results must be interpreted with caution.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-08-15 12:33:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We undertook the review according to the methods specified in our protocol, which were all in line with the recommendations of Cochrane as outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), and included a thorough search strategy designed to maximise the chances of identifying all relevant studies. Contacting authors resulted in no additional studies being identified, that is, the review therefore only contains data from published studies, some of which have not reported all the outcome data despite having apparently collected these data. The review may therefore be at some risk of publication bias, although publication bias is usually associated with positive results, and the majority of the included studies did not find significant differences between their treatment groups in terms of efficacy and safety. Although, our meta-analyses of pain intensity included data from cross-over studies that were analysed as if they were parallel-group studies, which as outlined in <LINK TAG="UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS" TYPE="SECTION">Unit of analysis issues</LINK> results in unit of analysis error (although, in turn, this leads to an under-weighting rather than over-weighting of the data), the results were also subjected to sensitivity analyses that excluded the cross-over trials, and that needed to confirm the results in order for them to be accepted as true results.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For adults with cancer pain</HEADING>
<P>We found low quality evidence that oxycodone offers similar levels of pain relief and overall adverse effects as morphine for adults with cancer. Although we identified a clinically insignificant benefit on pain relief in favour of controlled-release (CR) morphine compared to CR oxycodone, this did not persist following sensitivity analysis and so we do not consider this important. We did find an increased frequency of hallucinations after treatment with CR morphine (7.8%) compared to CR oxycodone (4%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">For clinicians</HEADING>
<P>We found low quality evidence that oxycodone offers similar levels of cancer pain relief and adverse events to other strong opioids including morphine, which is commonly considered the gold standard strong opioid. Although we identified a clinically insignificant benefit on pain relief in favour of CR morphine compared to CR oxycodone, this did not persist following sensitivity analysis and so we do not consider this important. We found an increased risk of hallucinations with CR morphine but we also found a numerically higher frequency of myoclonus (another excitatory opioid adverse effect) with CR oxycodone and we did not find any differences in reported drowsiness or confusion. The interpretation of increased relative risk of hallucinations should therefore be treated with caution given the low quality of evidence.<BR/>
</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">General</HEADING>
<P>We found that the current evidence base is comprised of studies that contained small numbers of participants in which there was a significant (19%) dropout rate. For example, the direct comparison meta-analysis between oxycodone and morphine was based on fewer than 450 cancer participants in each treatment group; this was a very small evidence base. However, given the absence of important differences within this analysis, it seems unlikely that larger head to head studies of oxycodone versus morphine will be justified.<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Design</HEADING>
<P>There were no implications for the design of future clinical studies.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measurement (endpoints)</HEADING>
<P>For future cancer pain studies, developing a single outcome that combines good pain control (no more than mild on a verbal rating scale) with acceptable adverse effects (perhaps no more than mild severity on any adverse event) would enable a clearer comparison between any analgesics used in this context.<BR/>

<P>
<U>Inclusion criteria</U>: "The subjects were patients with a variety of malignant tumours on the wards of James Ewing Hospital. Each patient was first examined to ascertain the nature and location of his or her pain, the extent of disease, prior experience with narcotics and analgesic drugs and ability to communicate meaningful information about pain. At this time, the patient was also told how the studies were to be conducted and that, while all test medications might appear the same, they would actually include a number of different drugs, some probably more effective than others in relieving pain. Many of the patients had had some prior experience with oral or parenteral narcotics, and several had a history of sufficient recent narcotic use to warrant the assumption that they possessed some tolerance to narcotics. Patients were placed on a routine analgesic other than those included in the study during nonstudy hours, and, insofar as was possible, concomitant administration of psychoactive drugs was avoided."</P>

<U>Oxycodone arm</U>
</P>
<P>- Drug: oxycodone hydrochloride.</P>
<P>- Dose and dosing: previous opioid treatment was discontinued 12-24 hours before commencing the study, and during this time 1 mg/kg meperidine was given intramuscularly when requested. The participants titrated themselves free from pain in 48 hours using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. The concentration of both morphine hydrochloride and oxycodone hydrocloride was 10 mg/ml.This treatment was continued for another 48 hours with the use of the same drug, which was now taken orally. The oral dose was calculated from the IV consumption during the previous 24 hours. The daily oral dose was calculated in ml by assuming that the bioavailability of morphine was either 44% (first 10 participants, group 1) or 33% (last 10 participants, group 2) and that the bioavailability of oxycodone hydrocloride was 66% (group 1) and 50% (group 2). To overcome the differences in bioavailabilities of the two drugs, the concentrations of the oral solutions were 2.7 mg/ml for oxycodone hydrocloride and 4 mg/ml for morphine. The dosing interval was 4 hours and the dose was increased by 1 ml at a time if the participant was not pain free during the 4-hour period. If the participant was pain-free, but too sedated, the dose was decreased by 1 ml. PCA device: The bolus dose was 3 mg, which was given over a period of 60 seconds, followed by a tail dose of 2 mg over 1 hour. The lockout time, during which the participant was unable to initiate another dose, was 15 minutes. If the participant was not free from pain with this regimen, the tail dose was increased by 2 mg at a time</P>

Pre-study analgesics: Oxycodone and acetaminophen (71%), most lower-dose participants received a total daily pre-study oxycodone dosage of 30 to 45 mg with 2.0 to 2.9 g of acetaminophen; higher-dose participants received a daily oxycodone dosage of 50 to 60 mg with 3.2 to 3.9 g of acetaminophen; other prior opioids included codeine and acetaminophen (17%), hydrocodone and acetaminophen (10%), propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen (2%), and transdermal fentanyl (1%) (protocol violation). A total of 19 controlled-release and 18 immediate-release participants discontinued the study due to adverse events (4 controlled-release and 7 immediate-release participants), unrelated illness (1 in each group), ineffective treatment (10 controlled-release and 4 immediate-release participants), protocol violation (4 controlled-release and 5 immediate-release participants), and other (1 immediate-release participant)</P>
<P>
<U>Inclusion criteria</U>: "The study included adult patients recruited from 15 centers in the United States who were receiving 6 to 12 tablets or capsules per day of fixed-combination analgesics for cancer-related pain. Patients were of either gender and had stable coexistent disease."</P>
<P>
<U>Exclusion criteria</U>: "Patients were excluded if their pain was not already acceptably controlled; if they had surgery or radiotherapy within 10 days of prior to study or anticipated these procedures during study; of they had compromised function of a major organ system; or of they were receiving nonopioid analgesics (before the protocol was amended). Of course, concomitant nonanalgesic therapies were allowed during the study. To encourage participation and to lower the discontinuation rate, the protocol was modified during the study to include patients undergoing or recently given radiotherapy and those receiving stable doses of nonopioid analgesics or analgesic adjuvants. In addition, patients receiving ten to more tablets or capsules of fixed-combination analgesics were no longer permitted to enter the study, but could be enrolled in a companion study intended for patients with greater opioid requirements."</P>

<P>
<B>Background and aims:</B>It's important to arrange a correct and flexible therapy for the treatment of chronic malignant and non-malignant pain especially in fragile patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prolonged-release (PR) oxycodone 10 mg/morning and 20 mg/evening versus PR oxycodone 20 mg twice a day<BR/>
<B>Methods:</B>After local ethical committee approval and written informed consent 40 patients (13 men and 27 women), affected by severe chronic pain (mean NRS 8) were randomised in two groups: OD group: 20 patients receiving PR oxycodone 10 /morning and 20 /evening; OS Group: 20 patients who receiving PR oxycodone 20 mg every 12 hours. The observation period was 28 days with 5 visits, once a week (T0 to T5). NRS was the parameter of efficacy while the incidence and intensity of nausea, vomiting, somnolence, stipsis and itching were the parameters of safety. Any assumption of rescue medication (immediate-release oral morphine 10 mg) was registered<BR/>
<B>Results:</B>Both the groups presented a 50% reduction of pain T1, and kept a very good analgesia for all the observation period. In OD group there was a lower incidence of adverse events than in OS Group. In OS group there was a lower assumption of rescue medication than in OD Group<BR/>
<B>Conclusion:</B>Therapy using PR oxycodone at different dosages allows a pain reduction similar to therapy with PR oxycodone at same dosage. Moreover with this therapeutic scheme it's possible to reduce the incidence of adverse events</P>

<P>Abstract (this is all the information in the record)</P>
<P>TPS324</P>
<P>Background:Methadone is an opioid with many unique pharmacologic properties and it is much less expensive than other opioids commonly used in cancer pain management. It is a particularly attractive analgesic to use for opioid switching, with the goal of improving analgesia and/or decreasing opioid-related side effects. Prospective trials involving methadone for opioid switching are uncommon in publicly-funded, clinical cooperative groups. This trial in progress will help determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of two approaches to opioid switching. It will also provide useful information regarding the feasibility of opioid-related research conducted by oncologists in the outpatient community setting.</P>
<P>Methods:This NCI&#8211;funded, randomized, prospective, open-label trial intends to enroll 300 cancer patients in the outpatient community setting. Eligible patients have inadequate pain control and/or intolerable opioid-related side effects and are prescribed either sustained-release morphine or oxycodone, with an oral morphine equivalent daily dose between 40mg and 300mg. Patients are randomly assigned to be rotated to either oral methadone or oral sustained-release morphine or oxycodone, and the new opioid dose is determined using study-specific equianalgesic tables. Patients receive immediate-release opioids for breakthrough pain and supportive measures for side effects, and patients have their opioids titrated according to study protocol Evaluation occurs at enrollment and then weekly for a total of 4 weeks using validated tools that include: M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), Composite Drug Toxicity Score (CDTS), and Revised Edmonton Staging System (rESS) for Cancer Pain. We hypothesize that 60% of patients rotated to methadone will achieve a30% reduction in pain and/or opioid-related side effects; whereas 40% of patients rotated to either sustained-release morphine or oxycodone will achieve this response. We define primary success as a 3-point reduction in pain score&#8211;measured by MDASI&#8211;from baseline to completion of the study.</P>
