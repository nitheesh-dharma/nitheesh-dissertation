<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:50:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2012, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to June 2012), CINAHL (1982 to June 2012), EMBASE (1980 to June 2012), reference lists of identified trials and bibliographies of published reviews. The original search was performed in February 2004. We also contacted researchers in the field. We applied no language restriction.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:50:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomized or controlled clinical trials on the frequency of venous or arterial catheter administration set replacement in hospitalized participants.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:01:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors assessed all potentially relevant studies. We resolved disagreements between the two review authors by discussion with a third review author. We collected data for seven outcomes: catheter-related infection; infusate-related infection; infusate microbial colonization; catheter microbial colonization; all-cause bloodstream infection; mortality; and cost. We pooled results from studies that compared different frequencies of administration set replacement, for instance, we pooled studies that compared replacement &#8805; every 96 hours versus every 72 hours with studies that compared replacement &#8805; every 48 hours versus every 24 hours.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:51:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 26 studies for this updated review, 10 of which we excluded; six did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and four did not report usable data. We extracted data from the remaining 18 references (16 studies) with 5001 participants: study designs included neonate and adult populations, arterial and venous administration sets, parenteral nutrition, lipid emulsions and crystalloid infusions. Most studies were at moderate to high risk of bias or did not adequately describe the methods that they used to minimize bias. All included trials were unable to blind personnel because of the nature of the intervention.</P>
<P>No evidence was found for differences in catheter-related or infusate-related bacteraemia or fungaemia with more frequent administration set replacement overall or at any time interval comparison (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.69; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.70). Infrequent administration set replacement reduced the rate of bloodstream infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98). No evidence revealed differences in catheter colonization or infusate colonization with more frequent administration set replacement (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.86, respectively). Borderline evidence suggested that infrequent administration set replacement increased the mortality rate only within the neonatal population (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.36). No evidence revealed interactions between the (lack of) effects of frequency of administration set replacement and the subgroups analysed: parenteral nutrition and/or fat emulsions versus infusates not involving parenteral nutrition or fat emulsions; adult versus neonatal participants; and arterial versus venous catheters.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 05:39:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some evidence indicates that administration sets that do not contain lipids, blood or blood products may be left in place for intervals of up to 96 hours without increasing the risk of infection. Other evidence suggests that mortality increased within the neonatal population with infrequent administration set replacement. However, much the evidence obtained was derived from studies of low to moderate quality.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:00:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:52:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Intravascular catheters are plastic tubes inserted into a vein for the purpose of monitoring pressure, sampling blood or delivering fluid, nutrition and medication, or into an artery for the purpose of monitoring pressure or flow. Catheters are usually connected to an administration set that is an assembly of some or all of the following: tubing, fluid containers, pressure monitoring transducers, blood sampling ports, measuring burettes and extension tubing. Intravascular catheters break the skin and are the single most important cause of healthcare-acquired bloodstream infection. About 250,000 to 500,000 catheter-related infections occur each year in the United States alone, and 5000 cases are reported in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Collignon-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collignon 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 2006</LINK>). Bacteraemias and fungaemias are associated with increased mortality and substantially increased hospital stay by up to 20 days and costs by US$56,000 per episode (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Rawajfah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Rawajfah 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Renaud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renaud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soufir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soufir 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The type of catheter, infusate and patient may affect the rate and incidence of bloodstream infection. A systematic review of observational studies by <LINK REF="REF-Maki-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 2006</LINK> reported that rates and incidences of catheter-related infection were lowest with peripheral intravenous catheters (0.1%, 0.5 per 1000 catheter-days) and midline catheters (0.4%, 0.2 per 1000 catheter-days), and that higher rates were seen with short-term uncuffed and central venous catheters that do not have antimicrobial impregnation (4.4%, 2.7 per 1000 catheter-days). Arterial catheters used for haemodynamic monitoring (0.8%, 1.7 per 1000 catheter-days) and peripherally inserted central catheters (2.4%, 2.1 per 1000 catheter-days) posed similar risks for those with short-term conventional central catheters. Medicated, cuffed and tunnelled dual-lumen central catheters were associated with considerably lower rates of catheter-related infection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:00:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinicians traditionally schedule administration set replacement every three or four days. Each replacement costs nursing time and up to US$275 for equipment (<LINK REF="REF-Rickard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rickard 2001</LINK>). The frequency of set replacement has gradually fallen since 1971, as supporting research has been published.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:52:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scheduled replacement of administration sets, contaminated through clinical use, may prevent patient infection. Catheter-related bacteraemias (bacterial infections of the blood) are thought to stem from one of four sources: skin bacteria colonizing the catheter on or after insertion; administration fluid contaminated before connection to the patient; colonization of the hub connecting the catheter to the administration set; or bacteria contaminating the catheter (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2011</LINK>). Bacteraemias within seven days of catheter insertion probably arise from the patient's skin, after which time bacteraemias from hub contamination become more common (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2000</LINK>). Contaminated fluid and seeding via the blood are thought to be rare. Bacteria and fungi require time to reproduce and spread (<LINK REF="REF-Crump-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crump 2000</LINK>), thus more frequent scheduled administration set replacement may prevent infection. However, the contact of clinicians during the scheduled administration set replacement provides an opportunity for contamination, supporting a counter-argument for infrequent changes (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Malley-1994" TYPE="STUDY">O'Malley 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rate of infusate microbial colonization and the subsequent rate of bacteraemia or fungaemia (fungal infection of the blood) may be higher if the infusate supports microbial proliferation. Parenteral nutrition, with its high glucose content, has been associated with higher rates of catheter-related infection in retrospective and prospective cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ishizuka-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ishizuka 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moro-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moro 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulloy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulloy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perlman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perlman 2007</LINK>). The schedule for set replacement that minimizes infection might be different for lipid emulsion infusates (e.g. propofol, vitalipid), as they are particularly well suited to the growth of a wide range of micro-organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scott-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherertz-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherertz 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shiro-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shiro 1995</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:00:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravascular catheters are associated with infection, which in turn may cause death (<LINK REF="REF-Renaud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Renaud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soufir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soufir 1999</LINK>) and significant cost (<LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Rawajfah-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Rawajfah 2012</LINK>). Less frequent administration set replacement saves nursing time and money and may not affect the rates of infection and death, or it might even reduce them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that sets used to administer fluids (other than lipid, blood or blood products) should be routinely changed no more often than every 96 hours (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>An earlier version of this systematic review&#65293;'Timing of intravenous administration set changes: a systematic review'&#65293;was published in <I>Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2004</LINK>) and in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2005, Issue 4 (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>). This current update was done to evaluate more recent studies. The aim of this updated systematic review was to ascertain the optimal interval for replacement of administration sets, that is, the frequency with the lowest rate of infection.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:53:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>For this updated review, we developed and piloted a data extraction form, using the template provided by the Cochrane Anaesthesia Review Group (CARG). Two members of the 2012 review team (CMR, MLC) used the data extraction form to independently extract methodological and outcome data from each newly identified study (<LINK REF="STD-Covey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luskin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Luskin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McLane 1998</LINK>). As only newly identified studies required data extraction, CMR did not extract data for the study that she coauthored (<LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>). The pair then met to compare results. Differences were resolved by consensus or by referral to a third member of the review team.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-05 04:54:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Two review authors (CMR, MLC, or AD) independently used the Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) in all included studies. This tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues that may potentially bias the study. Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. CMR did not assess for risk of bias the study that she coauthored (<LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>). A risk of bias table was completed for each eligible study. Disagreements between review authors were resolved by consensus or by referral to a third review author. We attempted to contact investigators of included trials to resolve ambiguities. Assessment of risk of bias is discussed within the text and is presented as a 'Risk of bias summary figure' (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), which cross-tabulates judgements by study, and a 'Risk of bias summary graph' (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), which summarizes judgements by domain.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:01:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>We entered outcome data into <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 5.1</LINK> to generate meta-analytical data and graphs. To generate clinically informative comparisons, we pragmatically divided time periods of administration set change into three different frequencies of administration set replacement (24 hours vs &#8805; 48 hours; 48 hours vs &#8805; 72 hours; 72 hours vs &#8805; 96 hours). Event rates for binary outcomes (e.g. infection rates) were presented as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated differences in means with 95% CIs. For outcomes displaying incidence over a specified time period, we planned on calculating hazard ratios (HRs) with standard errors (SEs). We calculated pooled estimates for each outcome using a random-effects model, chosen because of the substantial clinical heterogeneity noted between trials.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:08:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Decreasing the frequency of administration set changes from 24 hours to intervals of &#8805; 48 hours, from 48 hours to &#8805; 72 hours, or from 72 hours to &#8805; 96 hours did not appear to increase the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia or catheter colonization (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). It should be noted however, that power might not have been adequate to identify a clinically significant difference in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection in the 24 to &#8805; 48 hour and 48 to &#8805; 72 hour comparisons. The incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia was 2% in the control group for the 24 to &#8805; 48 hour comparison and 5% for the 48 to &#8805; 72 hour and 72 to &#8805; 96 hour comparisons. For a power of 0.8, 435 participants per group would be required to show an absolute difference of 5% in the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection compared with the control group. The total number of participants was 143 for the 24 to &#8805; 48 hour comparison, 298 for the 48 to &#8805; 72 hour comparison and 1353 for the 72 to &#8805; 96 hour comparison. Therefore power was probably adequate only for detecting a difference of 5% or more in the 72 to &#8805; 96 hour comparison.</P>
<P>Although infusate colonization was identified in all cases where it was recorded as an outcome, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>), which reported data from neonates receiving parenteral nutrition in a neonatal intensive care unit, identified any cases of infusate-related bacteraemia. Therefore the infusate colonization identified in most of these studies did not seem to result in bacteraemia.</P>
<P>It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the risk of infection when administration sets contain parenteral nutrition and/or lipid emulsions. Although subgroup analyses of participants who received parenteral nutrition and/or lipid emulsions did not appear to differ from those of participants who were not given parenteral nutrition and/or lipid emulsions, or from the overall findings, few studies reported the incidence of bacteraemia in participants receiving parenteral nutrition or lipid emulsions (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitges_x002d_Serra-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sitges-Serra 1985</LINK>). In addition, the number of participants in these studies was small, with the largest study reporting data for 148 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence in relation to administration sets that contain fat emulsions is even weaker than for administration sets that contain parenteral nutrition. Apart from studies by <LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Matlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matlow 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>, which did include lipid emulsions, it was not clear whether the other studies included lipid emulsions in the parenteral nutrition administered to participants. It is notable that mortality risk was significantly increased when data from these two studies were pooled. However, at this stage, no evidence suggests that it is safe to extend the period of changing administration sets that contain lipids beyond an interval of 24 hours, which is generally accepted as best practice.</P>
<P>Although death was cited as a reason for a participant to be lost to follow-up in two of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blight-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blight 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorbea-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbea 1984</LINK>), the death rate per group was reported in only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matlow 1999</LINK>). Some evidence suggests that less frequent replacement of administration sets increased mortality rate within the critically ill neonate population. When the outcome of mortality was examined, the composite result was dominated by <LINK REF="STD-Matlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matlow 1999</LINK> (96% statistical weight), who used randomization techniques that may have been prone to bias. Investigators randomly assigned approximately 10% of neonates a second time, if a gap in administration set usage was noted. Mortality outcomes reported by <LINK REF="STD-Matlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matlow 1999</LINK> were the result of the first random assignment; however, interpretation of results is confounded by allocation to subsequent interventions. The possibility that mortality might be increased with infrequent replacements, despite less bloodstream infection, should be of interest to researchers, clinicians and patients; however, current research has been conducted only within the neonatal population. Researchers would need to control for increased frequency of attendance by clinicians, which accompanies increased frequency of administration set replacement.</P>

<P>Most of the studies included in this updated systematic review addressed either or both of the review's most important outcomes: catheter-related and infusate-related bacteraemia. However, some other outcomes, including mortality and costs, were poorly reported.</P>
<P>Of the 16 included studies, nine were conducted in an intensive care unit (<LINK REF="STD-Blight-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blight 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Covey-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Covey 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gorbea-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gorbea 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Luskin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Luskin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matlow-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matlow 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McLane-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McLane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Snydman-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Snydman 1987</LINK>). Two studies specifically included participants with cancer (<LINK REF="STD-deMoissac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">deMoissac 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raad-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Raad 2001</LINK>), and five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Buxton-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Buxton 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jakobsen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jakobsen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Josephson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Josephson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maki-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Maki 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sitges_x002d_Serra-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Sitges-Serra 1985</LINK>) collected data from participants in a variety of settings. A particularly high rate of catheter-related bacteraemia was reported in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Blight-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Blight 1998</LINK> and of infusate-related bacteraemia in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Fox-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 1999</LINK>. As both of these studies were performed in intensive care units, it is possible that the high rate of infection was result of the severity of illness in these participants. However, findings in these studies were the same as in the overall analysis. The mortality meta-analysis included only studies within the neonatal population.</P>

<P>Risk of bias was difficult to assess in most of the studies because of poor reporting. It was not possible to blind personnel to the duration of administration sets, and this is a potential source of bias. However, blinding of outcome assessors for the primary outcomes was feasible but was adequately achieved and reported by only two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Luskin-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Luskin 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>).

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:08:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>Clearly described procedures were followed to prevent potential bias in the review process. CMR was an author of one of the studies reviewed (<LINK REF="STD-Rickard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rickard 2004</LINK>) but did not partake in any critique or data extraction for that study. A careful literature search was conducted, and the methods used are transparent and reproducible. None of the review authors has reported any conflict of interest.</P>
<P>To provide clinically informative comparisons, time periods of administration set change were pragmatically divided into three different frequencies of administration set replacement (24 hours versus &#8805; 48 hours, 48 hours vs &#8805; 72 hours, 72 hours vs &#8805; 96 hours). An alternative technique would have been to use time ratios as the method of division of time periods, to highlight relative risks. Because bacteria and fungi require time for reproduction and spread, use of the time ratio technique would be in line with microbiological principles. However, investigators in the studies included in this review did not follow time ratios when choosing their interventional and control groups, thereby excluding this form of comparison.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:08:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Jane Cracknell">
<P>The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Gillies-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gillies 2005</LINK>) also cautiously advocated changing intravascular administration sets that do not contain lipid emulsions, blood or blood products at an interval of up to 96 hours, having concluded that this does not affect the risk of catheter-related or infusate-related bacteraemia in participants with central or peripheral catheters. We now cautiously extend this finding to peripheral arterial catheters. The CDC advocates that intravascular administration sets used to administer fluids other than lipid emulsions, blood or blood products should be routinely changed no more frequently than every 96 hours (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2011</LINK>), and our review agrees with these recommendations. No evidence suggests that administration sets containing lipid emulsions should be changed less frequently than every 24 hours, as recommended by the CDC (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Grady-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Grady 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Overall, some evidence shows that changing intravascular administration sets that do not contain lipids, blood or blood products at an interval of up to 96 hours, does not affect the risk of infusate-related or catheter-related bacteraemia in participants with central or peripheral, venous or arterial catheters. Infrequent set replacement reduces nursing time and costs. Some evidence shows that mortality increased within the neonatal population with infrequent administration set replacement. However, many individual studies included in the review were at risk of bias. More data are required regarding the rates and incidences of infusate-related and catheter-related bacteraemia in participants who receive parenteral nutrition, in particular lipid emulsions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-05 06:11:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We think that future research in this area should focus on administration sets that contain parenteral nutrition, with and without lipid emulsions, and intervals longer than 96 hours between administration set changes.</P>
<P>Research should also include economic and survival analyses. Researchers should report catheter-related and infusate-related outcomes as rates per 1000 patient-days. This facilitates comparisons between clinical settings.</P>
<P>Participants must be numerous enough to allow identification of clinically important differences in outcomes, with each participant being the unit of analysis, and with data presented separately when more than one type of administration set, infusate or frequency of replacement is studied. Researchers should plan their protocols so that the risk of bias in each domain is minimized and should report clearly in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>).</P>
