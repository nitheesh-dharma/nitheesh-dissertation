<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-11 16:17:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Liver transplantation is a major surgical procedure that has been practiced for more than forty years and has nowadays become a generally accepted treatment option in patients with end-stage liver disease. The most common cause for liver transplantation in adults is cirrhosis caused by various types of liver injuries such as infections (hepatitis B and C), alcohol, autoimmune liver diseases, early-stage liver cancer, metabolic and hereditary disorders, but also diseases of unknown aetiology. All transplant recipients need lifetime immunosuppressive therapy to prevent transplant rejection.</P>
<P>Bile acids are being used for a variety of chronic liver diseases, mainly primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, their mechanisms of action and beneficial and harmful effects are poorly understood. This has led to the idea of the potential use of bile acids to prevent rejection in liver-transplanted patients.</P>
<P>Results of the seven randomised clinical trials included in the review in which patients received standard immunosuppressive treatment (steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with or without bile acids after liver transplantation, did not show any significant effects of bile acids on all-cause mortality, mortality related to rejection, acute cellular rejection, steroid resistant rejection, or need for retransplantation. One analysis suggested that bile acids might beneficially influence number of patients with chronic rejection, but was contradicted by the analyses. The evidence that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid might have beneficial effects on chronic rejection and length of hospitalisation is weak as it is produced from trials with high risk of bias and insufficient number of included patients. That bile acids seemed well tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse events, is good knowledge, but much more research is needed before their use is acquitted. None of the randomised clinical trials assessed the effects of bile acids on quality of life or cost-effectiveness.</P>

<P>We performed searches of <I>The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register</I>, <I>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials </I>in<I> The Cochrane Library</I>, <I>MEDLINE</I>, <I>EMBASE</I>, and <I>Science Citation Expanded </I>to September, 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>

<P>Randomised clinical trials comparing any dose of bile acids or duration of treatment in liver-transplanted patients versus placebo, no intervention, or another intervention. We included randomised clinical trials irrespective of blinding, language, and publication status. </P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-02-11 15:58:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Two review authors extracted and checked data independently. We evaluated the risk of bias of the trials from the method of allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, outcome data analysis, outcome data reporting, and other potential sources of bias. We used the intention-to-treat principle to perform meta-analyses and presented the outcomes as relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-02-11 16:17:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The updated search resulted in no new trials meeting the inclusion criteria of this review, thus leaving it to the seven already included randomised trials (six evaluating ursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo or no intervention, and one evaluating tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid versus no intervention) enrolling a total of 335 participants. The administration of bile acids began one day or more after liver transplantation. All patients received the standard triple-drug immunosuppressive regimen (steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus) to suppress the allograft rejection response after liver transplantation. Bile acids compared with placebo or no intervention did not significantly change all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.36), mortality related to allograft rejection (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.12), retransplantation (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.86), acute cellular rejection, or number of patients with steroid-resistant rejection. Bile acids significantly reduced the number of patients who had chronic rejection in a fixed-effect model but not in a random-effects model meta-analysis. Bile acids were safe and well tolerated by liver-transplanted patients. However, this observation is based on data analysis from three trials with only 187 patients.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-02-17 11:45:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>Liver transplantation has become a widely accepted treatment for numerous end-stage liver diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Hussain-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussain 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thalheimer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thalheimer 2002</LINK>). Previous studies report an incidence of acute cellular rejection to range from 50% to 80% in adult recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Ascher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ascher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klintmalm-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klintmalm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Adams-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adams 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wiesner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiesner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-FK506-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">FK506 1994</LINK>). However, recent data suggest that the proportion of patients with rejection is currently down to 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Hirschfield-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirschfield 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knechtle-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knechtle 2009</LINK>). Despite advances in immunosuppressive treatment and care-quality of liver-transplanted patients, allograft rejection is still a major problem in the post-transplantation period.</P>
<P>Acute cellular rejection usually occurs within the first 15 to 30 days after transplantation even if immunosuppression is achieved with tacrolimus or cyclosporine (<LINK REF="REF-FK506-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">FK506 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haddad-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haddad 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbani 2008</LINK>). The cellular mechanisms of acute liver allograft rejection are not completely understood (<LINK REF="REF-Krams-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krams 1993</LINK>). Initiation of allograft rejection is thought to involve the recognition of donor class II major histocompatibility complex alloantigens by recipient CD4+ T cells (<LINK REF="REF-Vierling-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vierling 1992</LINK>). Activated CD4+ T cells produce cytokines that induce lymphocyte proliferation and the maturation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are specific for donor class I major histocompatibility complex antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>). Both the bile duct epithelium and central vein endothelium are rich in class I and class II major histocompatibility complex antigens during rejection, whereas hepatocytes display a relative paucity of class I antigens and virtually no class II antigen (<LINK REF="REF-Vierling-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vierling 1992</LINK>). Therefore, the bile duct epithelium and central vein endothelium are the primary targets attacked by cytotoxic T cells during rejection. Impairment of the bile flow in the grafted liver may also cause rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Ericzon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ericzon 1990</LINK>). Mild cholestasis is a common finding after liver transplantation, and its association with clinically significant pathology is unlikely. Nevertheless, severe cholestasis should be treated as a potential cause of allograft rejection (<LINK REF="REF-Corbani-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbani 2008</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="REF-Fusai-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fusai 2006</LINK> the development of cholestasis was significantly related to prolonged warm ischaemia of the liver transplant. Cholestasis can induce hyper-expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules by hepatocytes and, thereby, lymphocyte CD8+-dependent cytotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bile acids include chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (<LINK REF="REF-Fuchs-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fuchs 1999</LINK>). In the course of cholestasis, intrahepatic accumulation of chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid is thought to induce liver damage (<LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1972</LINK>). In fact, the direct damage of membrane phospholipids and cholesterol components caused by the detergent-like properties of hydrophobic bile acids results in hepatocyte necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sholmerich-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sholmerich 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). It is also suggested that oxidative stress induced by hydrophobic bile acids plays an important role in liver damage during cholestasis. These effects can be prevented by the addition of UDCA, which modifies the bile acid pool resulting in an increase of the hydrophilic fraction and stabilisation of the cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). Several studies on animal models showed evidence of potential immunomodulatory beneficial effects of UDCA and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) by suppressing cytokine and immunoglobulin production and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshikawa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshikawa 1998</LINK>). In the study by <LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK> it has been observed that UDCA down-regulates the expression of abnormal major histocompatibility complex class I molecules in periportal hepatocytes in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Treatment with UDCA has been reported to have potential beneficial effects in various cholestatic liver conditions including primary biliary cirrhosis (<LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>), primary sclerosing cholangitis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003a</LINK>), and cystic fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has previously been suggested that UDCA, and perhaps tauro-UDCA (TUDCA), may reduce the incidence of acute rejection and steroid-resistant rejection in liver-transplanted patients when administered with combination of immunosuppressive treatment. There are several potential mechanisms by which UDCA may inhibit allograft rejection in liver transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Okolicsanyi-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okolicsanyi 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merion-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merion 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terasaki-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terasaki 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heuman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Al_x002d_Quaiz-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al-Quaiz 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friman-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soderdahl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soderdahl 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yoshikawa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshikawa 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Assy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Assy 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). However, most of these studies included a relatively small number of patients, were not randomised, and often did not include histological information (<LINK REF="STD-Persson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Persson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Friman-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Friman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koneru-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Koneru 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharara-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharara 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous version of this review by <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003b</LINK> stated that there was no convincing beneficial effects from the use of bile acids in liver-transplanted patients; the risk of bias in the seven included trials was high. The review also found that there was a low occurrence of adverse events, and hence the use of bile acids could be considered safe. It should be noted, however, that this observation is based on reports from four trials with few patients. We have been unable to identify any other meta-analyses or systematic reviews either. This review represents an update of the <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003b</LINK> Cochrane hepato-Biliary Group review.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-02-11 16:11:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The primary outcome measures were:<BR/>1. All-cause mortality.<BR/>2. Death due to allograft rejection (acute cellular rejection or chronic rejection or liver retransplantation because of rejection).<BR/>Acute cellular rejection was diagnosed by the combination of abnormal liver biochemical variables (bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatases, and/or gammaglutamyl transpeptidase), clinical signs such as fever, and liver histological changes including mononuclear portal inflammation, bile duct damage, and subendothelial inflammation of portal or terminal hepatic veins (<LINK REF="REF-IWP-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">IWP 1995</LINK>). Chronic rejection was characterised by liver histological changes including the progressive loss of interlobular bile ducts and arteriopathy characterised by foam cell infiltration of the arterial intima.</P>
<P>The secondary outcome measures were:<BR/>3. Number of patients who experienced rejection - irrespective of the type: acute cellular rejection, chronic rejection, or both types of rejections.<BR/>4. Number of patients with acute cellular rejection.<BR/>5. Number of patients with chronic rejection.<BR/>6. Number of patients with steroid-resistant rejection.<BR/>7. Biochemical responses: serum activities of alkaline phosphatases, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase and serum bilirubin concentration and/or number of patients with abnormal liver biochemical variables mentioned above.<BR/>8. Adverse events. Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence not necessarily having a causal relationship with the treatment but resulting in a dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-ICH_x002d_GCP-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICH-GCP 1997</LINK>).<BR/>9.

We contacted the Chinese Cochrane Centre regarding the search of <I>The Chinese Biomedical Database </I>and received a reply that they are unable to help us with this search. Therefore, the latter database could not be included in the search strategy of this update.</P>
<P>Further trials were identified by reading the reference lists of the identified studies. We wrote to the principal authors of the reports of the identified randomised clinical trials in September 2009 and enquired about additional trials, which they might know of. The first team of authors had also written to pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of bile acids to obtain information on published or unpublished randomised clinical trials in 2002, but no information had been received at that time.</P>

<P>The update of this review was conducted according to the protocol, previously published in The Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003b</LINK>), and following the recommendations given by <I>the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) and the <I>Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Module</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2010</LINK>).</P>

<B>Trial identification</B>
<BR/>Identified trials were listed, and the two review authors evaluated whether the trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Excluded trials were listed with the reasons for exclusion.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>GP and VG extracted the data independently, and disagreements were resolved by discussion or by CG. We extracted the following characteristics from each trial: primary author, number of patients randomised, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, methodological quality, follow-up (number and reasons for withdrawal), sample size calculation, intention-to-treat analysis, intervention regimens, mean age, proportion of males and females, aetiology of liver disease, origin of allograft, matching criteria between donor and recipient, time to follow-up, number of outcomes, and number and type of adverse events in both the intervention and the control groups. Additional information was sought by correspondence with the principal investigator or co-investigators of the trial in cases where the relevant data were not published.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of risk of bias</B>
<BR/>Risk of bias was defined as the confidence that the study design and reporting restricted bias in the intervention comparison (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Due to the risk of overestimation of intervention effects in randomised trials with unclear or inadequate components, we assessed the risk of bias by separate domains.</P>

<P>Furthermore, we registered whether the randomised clinical trials had used an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Gluud-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gluud 2001</LINK>) and had calculated a sample size estimate.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical methods</B>
<BR/>We performed the analyses in RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). Analyses included all patients irrespective of compliance or follow-up, according to the intention-to-treat principle, and using the last reported observed response ('carry forward') . Regarding death, both a worst-best-case scenario analysis considering all dropped-out patients in the bile acid group as dead and the dropped-out patients in the control group as alive, and a best-worst-case scenario analysis considering all dropped-out patients in the bile acid group as alive and the dropped-out patients in the control group as dead were performed. Both a random-effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>) and a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="REF-DeMets-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">DeMets 1987</LINK>) were used. The results of the fixed-effect model were reported if there were no differences between the results produced by the two models; otherwise, we reported the results produced by both models. We presented binary outcome measures as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcome measures as mean differences (MD) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>The risk of type I errors increases in single trials with interim analyses. To avoid type I errors, group sequential monitoring boundaries (<LINK REF="REF-Lan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lan 1983</LINK>) can be performed when deciding to terminate the trial earlier than planned. This requires analyses at different time intervals to record when the P-value has become sufficiently small, that is, when the cumulative Z-curve will cross the monitoring boundaries. Sequential monitoring boundaries, the so called 'trial sequential monitoring boundaries' can also be applied to meta-analyses. In a trial sequential analysis (TSA), every trial that is added in a cumulative meta-analysis is regarded as an interim meta-analysis, and the information it adds on, helps on deciding if more trials need to be included.</P>
<P>The interpretation of the TSA is as follows; if the cumulative Z-curve has crossed the boundary, a sufficient level of evidence is reached and no further trials may be needed. If the Z-curve has not crossed the boundary, then the evidence is insufficient in order to reach a conclusion. To construct the trial sequential monitoring boundaries, information size is needed. It is calculated as the minimum number of participants needed in a well-powered single trial (<LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pogue-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pogue 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>). We applied TSA since it prevents an increase of the risk of type I error due to sparse and multiple updating in a cumulative meta-analysis and provides us with important information in order to estimate the level of evidence of the experimental intervention. Additionally, TSA provides us with important information regarding the need for additional trials and the required information size. We applied trial sequential monitoring boundaries according to an information size suggested by the trials with low risk of bias and a 50% relative risk reduction (RRR).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses</B>
<BR/>We planned to perform the following subgroup analyses on the main outcome measures (all-cause mortality and number of patients with acute rejection):<BR/>1. Risk of bias of the trials: comparing the intervention effect for trials with low risk of bias components to the intervention effect in trials with unclear or high risk of bias components.<BR/>2. Dose and duration of treatment with bile acids: comparing the intervention effect in trials administrating bile acid at or above the median dose multiplied by duration to the intervention effect of trials administrating bile acid at less than the median dose multiplied by duration.<BR/>3. Time between transplantation and the start of bile acids: comparing the intervention effect of trials having less than three days between transplantation and starting bile acid intake to the intervention effect of trials with a duration of three days or more between transplantation and the start of bile acid intake (<LINK REF="REF-Neuberger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuberger 1999</LINK>).<BR/>4. Co-interventions: comparing the intervention effect of trials with co-interventions to the intervention effect of trials without co-interventions.</P>
<P>
<B>Funnel plot analysis</B>
<BR/>We planned to explore bias by funnel plot analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>The performed electronic searches resulted in a total of 378 references. We excluded 362 duplicates or irrelevant references by reading abstracts. We excluded eight of the 16 further assessed references because they were observational studies, case series, or randomised clinical trials with a different reason for exclusion. They are listed under 'Characteristic of excluded studies' with reasons for exclusion. Seven references already included in the previous version of this review and one new reference, referring to an already included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>), were included in this review. We were not able to identify more trials by reading the reference lists of the identified studies, contacting the principle authors of the identified trials, or approaching pharmaceutical companies for unpublished trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Seven publications included in the review (five full publications and two abstracts) were randomised clinical trials that reported the random allocation of liver-transplanted patients into groups receiving bile acid, placebo, or no treatment. We listed these trials in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. All seven trials were published in English. Three randomised clinical trials were from the United States (<LINK REF="STD-Koneru-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Koneru 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>), two from Italy (<LINK REF="STD-Sama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sama 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>), one from France (<LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK>), and one from Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Patients</B>
<BR/>In the included trials, all patients received blood group-compatible grafts. The median size of the seven trials was 40 patients (range 29 to 102 patients). In total, 335 patients were randomised.</P>
<P>Five trials were published as full publications (<LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>) which allowed us to extract detailed information on 263 of the patients. The mean age of the patients ranged from 44 to 51 years. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>) also enrolled children, ranging in age from 0 to 13 years (median 1.5 years). The male to female ratio in these five trials was 159:104. The diseases that led to liver transplantation were alcoholic cirrhosis in 51 patients (19.4%), cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C in 40 patients (15.2%), primary biliary cirrhosis in 36 patients (13.7%), cryptogenic cirrhosis in 22 patients (8.4%), metabolic diseases in 19 patients (7.2%), primary sclerosing cholangitis in 17 patients (6.5%), non-specified post-hepatitis cirrhosis in 17 patients (6.5%), cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis B in 13 patients (4.9%), 9 with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis (3.4%), six with liver cancer (2.3%), five with biliary atresia (1.9%), and 28 with other diseases (10.6%). Only one trial reported the severity of liver function according to the Child-Pugh class (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>).</P>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>) compared TUDCA versus no intervention. Bile acid treatment began one day after transplantation in the <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK> trial, three days after transplantation in the <LINK REF="STD-Koneru-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Koneru 1993</LINK> trial, three or five days in the <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK> trials, five days after transplantation in the <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK> trials, and five or seven days after transplantation in the <LINK REF="STD-Sama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sama 1991</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>Patients received UCDA (10 to 15 mg/kg body weight/day) for two months in the <LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK> trial, for three months in the <LINK REF="STD-Koneru-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Koneru 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK> trials, and for six months in the <LINK REF="STD-Sama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sama 1991</LINK> trial. In the <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK> trial, patients were followed up for 18 months.

Patients received TUDCA (500 mg/day) for one year, and no follow-up was conducted in the <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK> trial.</P>
<P>In addition to the bile acids or control intervention, all patients in the seven trials received standard triple-drug regimens (steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus). The patients who had steroid-resistant rejection received treatment with immunosuppressive antibodies (OKT3).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Outcome measures</B>
<BR/>The outcome measures reported by most trials were all-cause mortality and acute cellular rejection. Three trials reported on death related to rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>), two trials reported the number of patients who received retransplantation due to rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>), three trials reported the number of patients with chronic rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>), and four trials reported the number of patients with steroid-resistant rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>).

<P>Two trials reported adequate allocation sequence generation by using computer-generated random tables (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>) reported adequate allocation concealment by using sealed, serially numbered envelopes. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>) reported adequate blinding by using placebo with an identical appearance and taste. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pageaux-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pageaux 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK>) reported adequate description of incomplete outcome data by the number of withdrawals, the reasons for withdrawal, or no patients dropped out. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK> is the only one free of selective reporting since all the pre-specified outcomes were fairly reported. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>) performed sample-size calculations. Only the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK> seemed to be free of baseline imbalance and it is the only trial achieving the calculated sample size and therefore probably the only that was not terminated early. Other trials did not perform sample size calculation or the authors did not report whether the calculated sample size was achieved. The lack of this information made it unclear for us to judge whether a trial was terminated early, that is before an adequate number of patients was included in the trial. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>) stated that intention-to-treat analyses were used (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2010-02-17 12:58:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>We were able to include seven randomised clinical trials in this review. Six trials with 306 liver-transplanted patients compared ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with placebo or no intervention, and one trial with 29 liver-transplanted patients compared tauro-UDCA (TUDCA) with no intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>All-cause mortality</B>
<BR/>Five trials including 257 liver-transplanted patients reported on all-cause mortality at the end of treatment or at maximum follow-up. Bile acids did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.36); there were 26 deaths among 132 patients treated with bile acids (19.7%) versus 29 deaths among 125 patients in the control groups (23.2%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 14.1%).</P>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sama 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Barnes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Barnes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keiding-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Keiding 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK>) showed that UDCA did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.30); 23 deaths among 116 patients treated with UCDA (19.8%) versus 27 deaths among 108 patients in the control groups (25.0%). The <LINK REF="STD-Angelico-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Angelico 1999</LINK> trial demonstrated that TUDCA was not able to reduce all-cause mortality (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 8.33); there were 3 deaths among 16 patients (18.8%) versus 2 deaths among 17 patients (11.8%).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Fleckenstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Fleckenstein 1998</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-Sama-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sama 1991</LINK> trial did not report the causes of deaths. In the three other trials, the deaths were considered to be caused by infections (n = 11), hepatic failure (n = 7), abdominal bleeding (n = 3), renal failure (n = 2), multiple organ failure (n = 2), hepatitis B virus fibrosis (n = 2), acute rejection (n = 1), hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 1), encephalitis (n = 1), lymphoproliferative disorder (n = 1), cerebral haemorrhage (n = 1), or other reasons (n = 6).</P>

<B>
<I>Worst-best case and best-worst case scenario analyses </I>

<BR/>In the worst-best case scenario analysis, bile acids did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality when compared with placebo or no intervention (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.96); 40 deaths among 132 patients on bile acids (30.3%) versus 29 deaths among 125 patients in the control groups (23.2%). However, all-cause mortality was significantly reduced by bile acids in the best-worst case scenario analysis (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.90); 26 deaths among 132 patients (19.7%) versus 42 deaths among 125 patients in the control groups (33.6%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-11 16:27:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>In the update of this review we included no new trials assessing the use of bile acids for liver-transplanted patients. The analyses of the seven previously included trials showed that bile acids did not significantly affect mortality, acute cellular rejection, steroid-resistant rejection, retransplantation, or serum bilirubin. Bile acids might significantly decrease the length of hospital stay and the number of patients with chronic rejection included in these trials, but more supportive evidence is needed. The number of patients with chronic rejection was not significantly influenced by bile acids when a random-effects model was used and length of stay was assessed in one single trial. Furthermore, none of the trials were considered to be of low risk of bias, and few patients were enrolled. Therefore, our positive findings may be due to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>) or random errors (<LINK REF="REF-Wetterslev-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wetterslev 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brok-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brok 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thorlund-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thorlund 2009</LINK>). On the other hand, we are not able to exclude type II errors (that is, finding no significant differences when in fact they exist) due to the low number of participants. Therefore, this topic could be of potential interest in future large randomised trials with adequate control of bias.</P>
<P>All-cause mortality at one year after liver transplantation is reported to be about 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Thuluvath-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thuluvath 2003</LINK>), which we also observed for the patients included in the present review. According to our subgroup analyses, neither UDCA nor TUDCA significantly decreased all-cause mortality. We also performed a subgroup analysis regarding treatment duration, but we were not able to find any difference between short (less than six months) and long treatment duration (six months or more). Thus, bile acids do not seem to have statistically significant effects in reducing all-cause mortality after liver transplantation. We performed both worst-best-case scenario and best-worst-case scenario analyses. In the worst-best-case scenario, bile acids did not differ significantly from placebo or no intervention regarding all-cause mortality. However, bile acids significantly decreased all-cause mortality in the best-worst-case scenario analysis. However, such an analysis is very extreme and may not be realistic. We have also found that UDCA may be able to decrease the risk of chronic rejection in liver-transplanted patients, but trial sequential analysis could not confirm this result. Due to a limited number of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ioannidis-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ioannidis 2001</LINK>), we are not able to exclude the possibility that it may be relevant to perform placebo-controlled trials with low risk of bias on the use of bile acids for liver-transplanted patients.</P>
<P>We looked into the causes of deaths that were reported by the trials, and only one trial reported one death related to rejection. At the same time, the number of retransplantations was 3 among 68 liver-transplanted patients who received treatment with UDCA and 4 among 64 liver-transplanted patients who received treatment with placebo. We noticed that all patients in the included trials received co-interventions of standard triple-drug regimens (steroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus), which were able to control the possible acute or chronic rejection and prevent deaths due to allograft rejection (<LINK REF="REF-FK506-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">FK506 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The assumption that UDCA might reduce the incidence of acute graft rejection came from the findings that UDCA could regulate major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in bile ducts and liver endothelia, and inhibit lymphocyte activity (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Terasaki-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Terasaki 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perez-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 2009</LINK>). However, in the present review, bile acids did not significantly reduce the risk of acute cellular rejection in liver-transplanted patients. Considering that acute cellular rejection is commonly found within a few days after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Vierling-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vierling 1992</LINK>), some might argue that the administration of bile acids was started too late to prevent acute cellular rejection. We performed subgroup analyses regarding the time bile acids were started, and no statistically significant difference was found. Furthermore, bile acids were not able to decrease the risk of steroid-resistant rejection. Therefore, the lack of effects of bile acids does not seem to be due to a delayed start to bile acid administration after liver transplantation. However, it is a possibility that one should start bile acids intake before liver transplantation. A retrospective study found that rejection rates differed significantly between patients with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with or without UDCA before liver transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Heathcote-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Heathcote 1999</LINK>). One could argue whether UDCA-induced delay in transplantation has an adverse effect on post-transplantation outcome. Since we did not find any prospective randomised clinical trials addressing this issue, further research might be needed. Furthermore, some studies may provide an explanation why UDCA was not able to prevent acute cellular rejection. These studies found that UDCA did not appear to change the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, but rather major histocompatibility complex class I antigens (<LINK REF="REF-Calmus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calmus 1990</LINK>). The initial mechanism of acute rejection is thought to be recognition of MHC class II antigens by CD4+ T cells (<LINK REF="REF-Vierling-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vierling 1992</LINK>). Moreover, the inhibition of the production of interleukin-2 by peripheral blood lymphocytes with UDCA (<LINK REF="REF-Heuman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuman 1993</LINK>) might be negated by the immunosuppressive treatment after liver transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 1998</LINK>), so that UDCA is unable to demonstrate effects on graft rejection. In a recent study by <LINK REF="STD-Assy-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Assy 2007</LINK> a significant reduction in the mean dose of immunosuppressive medications was achieved in stable liver graft recipients treated with UDCA, indicating a possible influence of UDCA on rejection mechanisms.</P>
<P>In accordance with previous systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gong-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gong 2008</LINK>), bile acids were not associated with the occurrence of serious adverse events or any major occurrence of adverse events.</P>
<P>In summary, our results do not support or refute the use of bile acids (UDCA and TUDCA) additional to standard immunosuppressive treatment in liver-transplanted patients.</P>

<P>We need more randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials with enough statistical power and low risk of bias to explore the potential effects of bile acids on chronic rejection and mortality in liver-transplanted patients. Such trials should also consider evaluation of quality of life and length of hospitalisation. Such trials may consider starting bile acid and placebo interventions before liver transplantation; we were not able to identify any randomised trials addressing this regimen. Such trials ought to be reported according to the CONSORT statement (www.consort-statement.org). However, before embarking on such trials, the effects of bile acids in other patient groups should be scrutinised as they may have small or negative effects.</P>

<P>A randomised controlled trial that included only recipients of liver transplantation with stable graft function and no episodes of rejection for at least 2 years, that were then offered total immunosuppression withdrawal. Fourteen patients received UDCA (15 mg/kg body weight/day) and 12 received placebo. Rejection occurred in 43% and 75% of patients, respectively (no significant difference).

<P>Trial sequential analysis for the number of patients with chronic rejection at maximum follow-up. We calculated the heterogeneity-corrected required information size (HCRIS) based on a proportion of 12% of the patients in the placebo group with chronic rejection at maximum follow-up; a 50% risk ratio reduction in the bile acid group; an alpha of 5%, a beta of 10%, and a heterogeneity of 0%. Only 184 patients have been randomised reporting this outcome, which is only 19% of the HCRIS of 957 patients. The cumulative Z-score crosses the conventional boundaries for P ? 0.05, but not the monitoring boundaries.</P>
