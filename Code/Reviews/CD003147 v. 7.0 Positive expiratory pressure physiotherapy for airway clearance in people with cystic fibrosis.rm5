<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-10 11:04:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence on the effect of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) physiotherapy to clear the airways of people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cystic fibrosis affects approximately one in 3000 Caucasians and causes frequent infection, as the airways get blocked with mucus. Chest physiotherapy is often used to try to clear the mucus out of the lungs. We wanted to discover whether using a PEP device, which is one form of chest physiotherapy, was better or worse than other other forms of chest physiotherapy for clearing the mucus out of the lungs in people with cystic fibrosis. A PEP device provides positive pressure behind the mucus to try to push it out of the lungs. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 02 December 2014<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review includes 26 studies with 733 people with cystic fibrosis ranging from six to 47 years of age and with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy with length of treatment varying from a single physiotherapy session to two years of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>In general, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and BiPaP which is a type of PEP system delivering both positive inspiratory and expiratory pressure. We found no difference in lung function; the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with cystic fibrosis between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy. However, there was a decrease in the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with cystic fibrosis may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in a study with infants, where infants performing either PEP or percussion performed in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food). This was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion.</P>
<P>In 10 of the 26 studies, the effects of PEP were only studied during a single treatment. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two studies, each lasting one year, compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups.</P>
<P>In conclusion, although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long-term outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:47:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation and by temporarily increasing functional residual capacity. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-05-20 13:47:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis. This included, postural drainage and percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, oscillating PEP devices, thoracic oscillating devices, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) and exercise. Studies also had to include one or more of the following outcomes: change in forced expiratory volume in one second; number of respiratory exacerbations; a direct measure of mucus clearance; weight of expectorated secretions; other pulmonary function parameters; a measure of exercise tolerance; ventilation scans; cost of intervention; and adherence to treatment.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-05-27 04:44:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:07:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 26 studies (involving 733 participants) were included in the review. Eighteen studies involving 296 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis. These studies compared PEP to active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and Bi level PEP devices (BiPaP) and exercise.</P>
<P>Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies. Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome. However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome. A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year. Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-level evidence. The only reported adverse event was in a study where infants performing either PEP or postural drainage with percussion experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux. This was more severe in the postural drainage with percussion group. Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-09 12:28:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane review demonstrated that there was a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations in people using PEP compared to those using HFCWO in the study where exacerbation rate was a primary outcome measure. It is important to note, however, that there may be individual preferences with respect to airway clearance techniques and that each patient needs to be considered individually for the selection of their optimal treatment regimen in the short and long term, throughout life, as circumstances including developmental stages, pulmonary symptoms and lung function change over time. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations.</P>
<P>However, meta-analysis in this Cochrane review has shown a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations in people using PEP in the few studies where exacerbation rate was a primary outcome measure.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:56:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-13 14:03:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a relatively common, inherited, life-limiting disorder. The genetic defect causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, potentially leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging (<LINK REF="REF-Zach-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1990</LINK>). This predisposes the airways to infection and inflammation, which in turn promote further mucus secretion. Persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs are the major contributory factors to airway damage and the progressive loss of respiratory function (<LINK REF="REF-Cantin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1997</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:25:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment methods which improve mucus clearance are considered essential in optimising respiratory status and reducing the progression of lung disease. A variety of methods are used, some physical, e.g. airway clearance techniques, and some chemical, e.g. inhaled medications.</P>
<P>Airway clearance techniques (also referred to as chest physiotherapy) are widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway mucus and usually commenced as soon as the diagnosis of CF is made. Traditionally, airway clearance consisted of postural drainage (gravity-assisted drainage positions) combined with percussion and vibration (performed by an assistant such as a physiotherapist or relative), and forced expirations (huffing and coughing). Some protocols included deep breathing exercises. This form of airway clearance is time-consuming and sometimes uncomfortable. It also requires assistance, which may have an adverse effect on adherence. Recently, several self-administered alternatives that are able to be used in upright sitting positions have been developed. Among these are a range of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices, which provide a back pressure to the airways during expiration.The most common method of using PEP was defined by the Danes and is known as the, "PEP technique" (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1984</LINK>). It consists of breathing through a flow-dependant PEP device attached to a face mask with a closed system creating a PEP of between 10 to 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>0 for 12 to 15 breaths. The PEP mask is then removed from the individual's face and he or she then performs two to three huffing manoeuvres (also known as a forced expiration). For the purposes of this paper we have included studies using pressures between 8 to 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Another method of using PEP devices is defined by Oberwaldner in Austria and is known as, "High Pressure PEP" (Hi-PEP). In Hi-PEP, the expiratory pressure may be reach 40 to 100 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>0. Hi-PEP also incorporates forced expiratory manoeuvres through the PEP device, which generates higher pressures and may stimulate coughing through the mask (<LINK REF="REF-Oberwaldner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberwaldner 1986</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:45:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A theory is that PEP devices are able to improve clearance by increasing gas pressure behind mucus via collateral ventilation and a temporary increase in functional residual capacity (FRC). The FRC level is gradually increased over the 12 to 15 breaths. The forced expiratory manoeuvres then assist the movement of mucus from the peripheral airways centrally to where they can be expectorated (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Groth-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Groth 1985</LINK>). It has also been hypothesised that Hi-PEP may stabilise airways by splinting them open during expiration, which may facilitate airway clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Oberwaldner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberwaldner 1986</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-20 14:56:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane systematic review comparing any form of chest physiotherapy with no chest physiotherapy found evidence to demonstrate the benefit of chest physiotherapy for increasing mucus transport, but did not find evidence for any long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Warnock-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warnock 2013</LINK>). Several narrative reviews have compared different types of chest physiotherapy, including PEP, with conflicting conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-McIlwaine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIlwaine 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prasad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zach-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1987</LINK>). This review will examine the effect and acceptability of PEP compared to other techniques used for secretion clearance.</P>
<P>The most effective technique for secretion clearance during an infective exacerbation of CF may differ from that which is most effective for maintenance therapy. The PEP technique is also used in combination with various other interventions (e.g. pharmacological therapies, other physical therapy techniques, or a modification to the PEP technique.). It is therefore important to establish the effect of PEP in each stage of CF lung disease with and without co-interventions. This review is an update of previously published versions of the Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elkins 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>In the existing literature, variation occurs in the application of each individual airway clearance technique. For example; when using PEP as an airway clearance technique, some people perform 12 breaths through the device, whereas others perform 15 breaths. This may be followed by two or three forced expiratory manoeuvres. As separate analyses of variations within each technique would render this review unmanageable, it has been necessary to group these variations within broad definitions of the established treatment modalities.</P>
<P>One of the interventions used in the studies will be required to meet one of the two following descriptions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>PEP mask, or mouthpiece as described by the authors, with or without additional techniques. Originally, PEP was defined as breathing with a positive expiratory pressure of 10 to 20 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1984</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>High pressure PEP (Hi-PEP) mask therapy as described by the authors, with or without additional techniques. Hi-PEP includes a full forced expiration against a fixed mechanical resistance which usually generates pressures ranging from 40 to 100 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O (<LINK REF="REF-Oberwaldner-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oberwaldner 1986</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>At least one comparator intervention used in the studies will be required to meet one of the following descriptions.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Postural drainage with percussion and vibration (PDPV) - in other reviews this has been described as conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT).</LI>
<LI>Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) - this comprises relaxation or breathing control, forced expiration technique (FET), thoracic expansion exercises and may include postural drainage or percussion.</LI>
<LI>Autogenic drainage (AD) - this breathing technique uses high expiratory flow rates at varying lung volumes to enhance mucous clearance while avoiding airway closure.</LI>
<LI>Oral oscillatory devices - include flutter, cornet, acapella and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. The flutter, cornet and acapella devices produce an oral oscillatory PEP effect within the airways. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation provides continuous oscillation of the air pressure in the airways via the mouth.</LI>
<LI>Thoracic oscillating devices - these include Thairapy Vest<SUP>®</SUP>, InCourage system, Smart vest, and the Hiyak Oscillator which provide external chest wall oscillation.</LI>
<LI>BiPaP - a bilevel PEP system which delivers both inspiratory and expiratory positive pressure.</LI>
<LI>Exercise - prescribed for the purpose of airway clearance either independently or as an adjunct to other techniques.</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>In three studies the allocation was concealed (i.e., the person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the study was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated) and these three studies were therefore deemed at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>).

<P>In eight of the studies the person assessing at least one outcome measure did not know which group the participants had been allocated to and they were therefore deemed to be at a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Fainardi-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fainardi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>).

<P>In five studies, all participants, for whom outcome measures were available, received the treatment or control condition as allocated or, where this was not the case, data for at least one key outcome was analysed by "intention-to-treat" (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gaskin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gaskin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagerkvist-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerkvist 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>). This criterion is satisfied (even if there is no mention of analysis by intention-to-treat) if the report explicitly states that all participants received treatment or control conditions as allocated. Intention-to-treat analysis was explicitly mentioned in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>); however, 13 participants in the Pryor study withdrew as they did not like the intervention they had been randomised to; it is unclear if these participants were included in the intention-to-treat group (<LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>). In the 2013 McIlwaine study, 16 participants withdrew after randomisation but prior to initiation of study therapy regimens, these participants were not included in the intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>).

It is unclear whether these participants were included in the analysis. In the Tyrrell study, three out of 19 participants were excluded due to non-adherence (<LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1986</LINK>).

In the remaining 25 studies, the groups were similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators (i.e. based on at least one measure of the severity of CF and one outcome measure at baseline, the groups' outcomes would not be expected to differ by a clinically significant amount), which indicates a low risk of bias. </P>
<P>There were 18 studies of cross-over design which has the potential to increase the risk of bias.

The cross-over study comparing two months of PEP, conventional PDPV, and AD recorded five subjective measures which may influence participant preference: treatment duration; treatment comfort; flexibility of treatment times; control in performing own treatment; and how interruptive treatment was to daily living. It was reported that PEP had a significantly shorter treatment time than PDPV or AD; also, PEP was rated significantly better than PDPV and not significantly different to AD on each of the other four measures (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1991" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1991</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-21 14:28:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 26 studies involving 733 participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) (infants, children, adolescents and adults) met the review's inclusion criteria. Sample sizes in individual studies ranged from five to 107 participants; 19 studies were reported in full articles and seven were published in abstract form only.</P>
<P>There was a wide range of therapies to which positive expiratory pressure (PEP) was compared. The duration of the intervention period varied from single treatments to two years. These factors together with the frequent use and poor reporting of cross-over design, the small number of studies, and the limited information provided by some authors restricted the number of meta-analyses that could be performed.</P>
<P>A one-year study in children and adolescents reported a significantly reduced rate of hospital admission with PEP as opposed to flutter (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>). A similar study in adults showed similar results (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). A large (107 participants) well-designed one-year multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing PEP with high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) found that the PEP group experienced significantly fewer pulmonary exacerbations requiring oral, inhaled or intravenous (IV) antibiotics during the 12 months and a longer time to the first pulmonary exacerbation compared to the HFCWO group (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The measurement of lung function forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) is important in CF because of its correlation with survival and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Liou-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liou 2001</LINK>). Six studies did not report FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>as an outcome measure. Four of these studies examined mucus clearance using a radio-labelled isotope (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Falk-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lannefors-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lannefors 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mortensen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mortensen 1991</LINK>). One study measured FEV<SUB>0.75</SUB> (<LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1986</LINK> ), and another study was on infants where FEV<SUB>1</SUB> could not be measured (<LINK REF="STD-Costantini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Costantini 2001</LINK>). Five studies measured FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and compared PEP with postural drainage with percussion and vibration (PDPV); one was a study of less than seven days and four studies lasted more than seven days. Two studies lasted at least one year. In a 12-month study in children with CF, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> increased in the PEP group and decreased in the PDPV group with the difference recorded being statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>). However, in a two-year study (predominantly in adults) comparing PEP with PDPV, there was no difference in the rates of decline in FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. Both groups experienced rates of annual decline greater than 2% (<LINK REF="STD-Gaskin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gaskin 1998</LINK>). When PEP was compared with oscillating PEP using the flutter there were six studies that measured FEV<SUB>1</SUB>. Two short-term studies (less than seven days) found no difference between techniques. Five studies measured FEV<SUB>1</SUB> after a series of treatments over more than seven days. No differences were seen between these techniques in the two-week study and there were mixed results in the four studies lasting one year. In one study of children and adolescents, FEV<SUB>1</SUB> declined more in the flutter group than the PEP group (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>); while in a 13-month study in adults both groups declined similarly (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). No significant difference was found in two further one-year studies comparing these and other techniques including active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT), autogenic drainage (AD) and oscillating PEP using the cornet device (<LINK REF="STD-Tannenbaum-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Tannenbaum 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A small number of studies found significant differences in expectorated sputum measures when other types of chest physiotherapy were compared to PEP in single treatment and short-term studies up to seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Falk-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Falk 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hofmeyr-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hofmeyr 1986</LINK>) or Hi-PEP (<LINK REF="STD-Pfleger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pfleger 1992</LINK>). However, these measures may be confounded by expectorated saliva, swallowed secretions and regurgitated contents and are generally regarded as less useful outcomes than measurement of mucociliary clearance. One cross-over study measured radio-labelled aerosol clearance after a single treatment of PEP versus PDPV; no significant difference in clearance was found (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many other outcomes did not show a significant difference between PEP and other compared therapies. In the year-long study in infants, blinded examination of chest radiographs showed no significant difference in the incidence of increased bronchial markings between the PEP and PDPV groups (<LINK REF="STD-Costantini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Costantini 2001</LINK>). When compared to flutter in children and adolescents, similar results occurred in FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB> and total lung capacity (TLC) (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was recorded that there were no adverse events in the PEP group or in the PDPV group in the year long study of 40 children (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>). Nor were adverse events recorded in the PEP or the flutter groups in the year-long study of 40 children (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>). In a year-long study of 26 infants, which was published in abstract form only, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of reflux between the PEP and PDPV groups; gastro-oesophageal reflux severe enough to cause withdrawal from the study occurred in three participants in the PDPV group and in no participants in the PEP group (<LINK REF="STD-Costantini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Costantini 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the majority of studies included in this Cochrane review, there were no significant differences in outcomes when PEP was compared to other techniques. However, three long-term trials undertaken in Canada using PEP have found that outcomes in the PEP group were significantly better than PDPV in children and adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-1997" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 1997</LINK>), oscillating PEP using the flutter (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>) and HFCWO in a multicentre trial across all age groups (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). These studies provide evidence that PEP may be more effective in limiting exacerbations and potentially preserving lung function in the longer term. Of note, these three studies all employed PEP via the mask set-up.</P>
<P>In the study comparing PEP with HFCWO, treatment time was significantly shorter in the PEP group (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). Limited evidence was identified in support of the hypothesis that PEP is more acceptable to people with CF than other forms of airway clearance therapy. In studies with an intervention period of at least one month, any measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The tools used to record patient preference were generally not well-described or validated.</P>
<P>There were a large number of cross-over studies in the sample included in the review. Elbourne discusses methods for meta-analysing cross-over studies which rely on the data that are reported within the primary papers (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). The method that has been adopted within this review uses the data from the first period only, ignoring any data from the second period that was available if a carryover effect was identified. In this review 3 studies of one month duration were identified as having no washout period and thus may have had a carryover effect (<LINK REF="STD-Steen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Steen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyrrell-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyrrell 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Asperen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">van Asperen 1987</LINK>). A limitation of this study was that data from the first period of cross-over studies was only available in three out of the 18 cross over studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-21 14:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a large body of evidence to support the use of PEP as a stand-alone airway clearance technique in CF. Numerous studies found PEP to be equal to other compared techniques, however, a few long-term studies suggest that PEP may be superior to other techniques. In these studies PEP was administered using a facemask in order to obtain a seal during the cycles of PEP which resulted in a temporary increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) during the cycles; this in turn allowed air to accumulate behind secretions and move them proximally. Where PEP was found to be superior to other techniques, the way in which it was applied may have contributed to these superior findings. Thus the applicability of the evidence is highly based on these studies which have demonstrated fewer exacerbations and decreased need for treatment with antibiotics.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-21 14:29:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence varied between studies carried out over a few days to well-designed year-long randomised controlled trials. Small sample sizes and drop outs in some studies were likely to have impacted on the precision of the results and the quality of the evidence. As stated below, cross-over designs are not really appropriate for CF studies and results from studies of this design are likely to be of low quality. Blinding of participants and researchers in these studies is not possible, however, blinded assessors have been utilised in a number of the studies increases the quality of the evidence and reduced the risk of biased results. Some unclear information regarding methodology (randomisation sequences and allocation concealments) increased the risk of bias.</P>

<P>The search process was rigorous and undertaken according to the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. It is possible that studies have been undertaken that have not been identified with this online review process or that omissions have inadvertently occurred in the search of conference publications because they have not emerged using the recommended search process. Three authors were involved in the selection of studies to be included in the review and disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. When a study that included one of the authors of this report was being considered for inclusion, the author recused themselves from the selection process in relation to that article.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-06-09 12:28:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>There was some evidence to recommend PEP as a more acceptable intervention long term than other forms of physiotherapy for people with CF. However, the evidence that PEP was preferred over other techniques came from studies which were generally of low quality.</P>
<P>The evidence suggests that all techniques and devices described in this Cochrane review have a place in the clinical treatment of people with cystic fibrosis. The use of PEP via a mask should be high on the list for trial by individuals, especially if they experience a higher than usual or higher than expected exacerbation rate.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-21 14:31:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The abstract format frequently prevents evaluation of the scientific methodology of a study. Abstracts should be structured to contain essential information about methods and results. The large proportion of studies which were published only as abstracts highlights the need for full publication of studies in this area.</P>
<P>Cross-over studies are not a good design for clinical studies in CF due to the unstable nature of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Southern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Southern 2003</LINK>). They are potentially influenced by carry-over effects. More parallel, randomised clinical studies comparing PEP with other airway clearance modalities are needed. These studies should be adequately powered and a multicentre approach may facilitate this. Such studies should, in particular, examine the influence of PEP and other therapies on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> and quality of life. Other important areas, which have not been assessed or reported in detail, include survival, exercise tolerance, and cost.</P>
<P>Twelve studies with 188 participants were conducted using short-term interventions on stable participants, which may be of little value given the nature of CF-lung disease, a chronic course with acute exacerbations. Future studies should be planned to reflect clinical practice by focusing on short-term interventions during an exacerbation or long-term studies on initially stable patients.</P>
<P>The studies in this review frequently found no significant difference in efficacy between treatments. Future studies should include validated measures of participant preference, including treatment time (potential barriers to adherence) as this may help to determine a suitable treatment when measures of efficacy are equivocal. Similarly, cost and adverse effect outcome data would assist consumers in decision-making.</P>
<P>Further studies are required to broaden the knowledge of the effects of different techniques on different aspects of the pathophysiology of CF. As CF is a long-term disease, research that spans at least 12 months tends to be more useful in determining the best evidence-based practice. Sputum rheology differs between individuals with CF and between different organisms and combinations of organisms in CF. Research to determine the best technique for situations where sputum is thin and liquid versus thick and viscous may be a new frontier for more targeted research and application of the different techniques in different patients.</P>

<P>The protocol for this review was based on the previous review of 2006. A new team undertook the 2014 review and we amended the primary outcomes to include direct measures of mucus clearance. The number of respiratory exacerbations was kept as a primary outcome, however the number of days of intravenous antibiotic use was removed. This was because, between 2006 and 2014, respiratory exacerbations had further been defined to include both oral and IV antibiotics. Well-being, adverse effects, exercise tolerance and patient preference were moved to secondary outcomes as none of the studies reviewed had reported any of them as a primary outcome.</P>

<P>Mucus clearance was measured by delivering a radioaerosol (99mTc-labelled colloidal albumin) to the airways and measuring the distribution of radiolabeled secretions in the lung fields. Anterior and posterior planar gamma camera images of the thorax were collected for 2 minutes at baseline, after 15 minutes rest in sitting, after the 20-minute intervention, and after another 15 minutes rest in sitting. Clearance was calculated as a reduction in count rate between successive images. Whole lung clearance was calculated. In addition, the planar images were divided into a central 'hilar' region and peripheral region, and clearance from these regions was calculated.</P>

<P>FEV 0.75, FVC, PEFR were recorded before, 20 minutes after, and 90 minutes after a single supervised treatment at the beginning of the randomisation month. Wet weight of sputum expectorated during the therapy was also measured. The same measures were repeated over a single treatment at the end of the randomisation month.<BR/>In addition, during each treatment month, diary card records were kept regarding the following symptoms: sleep, cough, wheeze, activity, sputum production.
