<TITLE MODIFIED="2015-09-30 08:54:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Can nicotine receptor partial agonists, including cytisine and varenicline, help people to stop smoking?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-04-29 09:54:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>When people stop smoking they experience cravings to smoke and unpleasant mood changes. Nicotine receptor partial agonists aim to reduce these withdrawal symptoms and the pleasure people usually experience when they smoke. The most widely-available treatment in this drug type is varenicline, which is available world-wide as an aid for quitting smoking. Cytisine is a similar medication, but is only available in Central and Eastern European countries and through internet sales.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisine or dianicline. We found 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. We also found four trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. We include one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a quitting aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at least six months from the start of treatment. We preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids.We conducted full searches up to May 2015, although we have also included several key trials published after that date.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings</B>
</P>
<P>From the information we found (27 trials, 12,625 people), varenicline at standard dose more than doubled the chances of quitting compared with placebo. Low-dose varenicline (four trials, 1266 people) roughly doubled the chances of quitting, and reduced the number and severity of side effects. The number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion (five trials, 5877 people) or with NRT (eight trials, 6264 people). Based on the evidence so far, we can calculate that varenicline delivers one extra successful quitter for every 11 people treated, compared with smokers trying to quit without varenicline.</P>
<P>The most common side effect of varenicline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild or moderate levels and usually clears over time. People taking varenicline appear to have about a 25% increased chance of a serious adverse event, although these include many which are unrelated to the treatment. We also note that more people were lost from the control groups than from the varenicline groups by the end of the trials, which may mean that the count of events in the control groups is lower than it should be. After varenicline became available to use, there were concerns that it could be linked with an increase in depressed mood, agitation, or suicidal thinking and behaviour in some smokers. However, the latest evidence does not support a link between varenicline and these disorders, although people with past or current psychiatric illness may be at slightly higher risk. There have also been concerns that varenicline may slightly increase heart and circulatory problems in people already at increased risk of these illnesses. The evidence is currently unclear whether or not they are caused or made worse by varenicline, but we should have clearer answers to these questions when a further study is published later this year.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The varenicline studies were generally of high quality, providing evidence that we consider to be reliable and robust. We rate the quality of the evidence comparing varenicline with NRT as moderate quality (we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), since in some of them the participants knew which treatment they were receiving (i.e. non-blinded open-label trials). We judge the evidence from the cytsine trials to be of low quality (we have limited confidence in the evidence), as there are only two trials, with relatively low numbers included.<BR/>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-04-25 14:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'dianicline' or 'varenicline' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') in the title or abstract, or as keywords. The register is compiled from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO using MeSH terms and free text to identify controlled trials of interventions for smoking cessation and prevention. We contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The latest update of the specialised register was in May 2015, although we have included a few key trials published after this date. We also searched online clinical trials registers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-01-26 16:08:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and nicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-01-26 16:08:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomisation procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow-up.</P>
<P>The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking at longest follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we pooled risk ratios (RRs), using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 09:51:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two trials of cytisine (937 people) found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at longest follow-up, with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.01 to 7.87; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). One recent trial comparing cytisine with NRT in 1310 people found a benefit for cytisine at six months (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.80).<BR/>
</P>
<P>One trial of dianicline (602 people) failed to find evidence that it was effective (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.75). This drug is no longer in development.</P>
<P>We identified 39 trials that tested varenicline, 27 of which contributed to the primary analysis (varenicline versus placebo). Five of these trials also included a bupropion treatment arm. Eight trials compared varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Nine studies tested variations in varenicline dosage, and 13 tested usage in disease-specific subgroups of patients. The included studies covered 25,290 participants, 11,801 of whom used varenicline.</P>
<P>The pooled RR for continuous or sustained abstinence at six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.24 (95% CI 2.06 to 2.43; 27 trials, 12,625 people; <I>high-quality evidence</I>). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be effective, with an RR of 2.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 trials, 1266 people). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at six months was 1.39 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.54; 5 trials, 5877 people; <I>high-quality evidence</I>). The RR for varenicline versus NRT for abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.25 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.37; 8 trials, 6264 people; <I>moderate-quality evidence</I>). Four trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The number needed to treat with varenicline for an additional beneficial outcome, based on the weighted mean control rate, is 11 (95% CI 9 to 13). The most commonly reported adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Our analysis of reported serious adverse events occurring during or after active treatment suggests there may be a 25% increase in the chance of SAEs among people using varenicline (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.49; 29 trials, 15,370 people; <I>high-quality evidence</I>). These events include comorbidities such as infections, cancers and injuries, and most were considered by the trialists to be unrelated to the treatments. There is also evidence of higher losses to follow-up in the control groups compared with the intervention groups, leading to a likely underascertainment of the true rate of SAEs among the controls. Early concerns about a possible association between varenicline and depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation led to the addition of a boxed warning to the labelling in 2008. However, subsequent observational cohort studies and meta-analyses have not confirmed these fears, and the findings of the EAGLES trial do not support a causal link between varenicline and neuropsychiatric disorders, including suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour. The evidence is not conclusive, however, in people with past or current psychiatric disorders. Concerns have also been raised that varenicline may slightly increase cardiovascular events in people already at increased risk of those illnesses. Current evidence neither supports nor refutes such an association, but we await the findings of the CATS trial, which should establish whether or not this is a valid concern.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-29 09:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and three-fold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion or with NRT. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The most frequently recorded adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Early reports of possible links to suicidal ideation and behaviour have not been confirmed by current research.</P>
<P>Future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-26 16:09:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Smoking is the main preventable cause worldwide of morbidity and premature death. Based on data from 2004, 12% of all deaths globally among adults aged 30 years and over were attributable to tobacco, with 5 million adults dying due directly to tobacco use (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>). The list of illnesses known to be linked to smoking includes cancers of the cervix, pancreas, kidneys and stomach, aortic aneurysms, acute myeloid leukaemia, cataracts, pneumonia, and gum disease. These are in addition to the long-established links between tobacco use and such illnesses as lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and emphysema, and with prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome and low birth weight in the babies of maternal smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Surgeon-General-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Surgeon General 2004</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>There is a growing understanding of the neurochemical basis of nicotine addiction (<LINK REF="REF-Fagerstr_x00f6_m-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagerström 2006</LINK>). There is strong evidence that dependence upon nicotine reflects the effects of the drug at neuronal nicotinic receptors in the brain (<LINK REF="REF-Benowitz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benowitz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Picciotto-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Picciotto 1999</LINK>). More recent studies have explored the potential of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as targets for a variety of therapeutic interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hogg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogg 2007</LINK>). It is thought that the addictive properties of nicotine are mediated mainly through its action as an agonist at &#945;4&#946;2nAChRs, which stimulates the release of dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Coe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coe 2005</LINK>). Pharmacotherapies to aid smoking cessation have been developed which exploit this mechanism, by acting as nicotine receptor partial agonists.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cytisine</HEADING>
<P>Cytisine was developed as a treatment for tobacco dependence in Bulgaria in the 1960s, and is available in some eastern and central European countries and through internet sales, under the trade name of Tabex (<LINK REF="REF-Foulds-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foulds 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutka 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutka 2006</LINK>). Its manufacturers, Sopharma Pharmaceuticals, developed their phytoproduct from the plant Cytisus Laburnum L. (Golden Rain). Although cytisine (Tabex) is not licensed for use as a smoking cessation aid across most countries outside Eastern Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK>), studies by <LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK> have highlighted the potential of this drug, especially in countries with lower average incomes and where smoking cessation programmes are not supported by insurance plans or by a national health service. In many regions, it may be considerably cheaper to continue smoking than to embark upon a course of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK> reports that a pack of cigarettes in China costs between 15¢ and 73¢, compared with a course of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (USD 230), bupropion (USD 123), or varenicline (USD 327). Similarly, a pack of 20 cigarettes in India costs around USD 1.10, or 5¢ for a pack of bidis, compared with USD 150 for a course of NRT, USD 100 for bupropion and USD 200 for varenicline. Tabex is currently available in Poland for the equivalent of USD 15 for a course of treatment, and in Russia for the equivalent of USD 6 as an over-the-counter medication. There is also heightened interest and activity in cytisine in New Zealand, where it is found in the seeds of the native Kowhai tree, widely used in traditional M&#257;ori healing (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson_x002d_Evans-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson-Evans 2011</LINK>). The current update adds a large single-blind randomised non-inferiority trial comparing cytisine with NRT, conducted in New Zealand between 2011 and 2013 (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dianicline</HEADING>
<P>In 2006, Sanofi-Aventis registered two trials of dianicline, their version of a nicotine receptor partial agonist (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ameridian-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ameridian 2007</LINK>). However, unfavourable results have led to the withdrawal of this drug from further development (<LINK REF="REF-Kirchhoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirchhoff 2009</LINK>). We have been unable to locate results for the AMERIDIAN trial, and present only the EURODIAN trial report in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Varenicline</HEADING>
<P>Varenicline was developed by Pfizer Inc to counteract the effects of nicotine on the nAChRs. The drug was based on the naturally-occurring alkaloid compound cytisine described above, which had been shown to be an effective partial agonist for &#945;4&#946;2 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Papke-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papke 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slater-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slater 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Varenicline was developed in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Coe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coe 2005</LINK>), and is described as a selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist. It was designed to selectively activate the &#945;4&#946;2nAChR, mimicking the action of nicotine and causing a moderate and sustained release of mesolimbic dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Sands-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sands 2005</LINK>). This, it was suggested, should counteract withdrawal symptoms consequent upon low dopamine release during smoking cessation attempts. However, because it is a partial agonist at these receptors, it elicits some dopamine overflow, but not the substantial increases evoked by nicotine. Perhaps more importantly, it blocks the effects of a subsequent nicotine challenge on dopamine release from the mesolimbic neurones thought pivotal to the development of nicotine dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Coe-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coe 2005</LINK>). Although varenicline has been shown to be a partial agonist at heteromeric neuronal nicotine receptors, there is now evidence that it may also be a full agonist at the homomeric &#945;7 receptor (<LINK REF="REF-Mihalak-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihalak 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Multicentre trials of varenicline have been conducted or are currently underway in the USA, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East and the Far East. There have also been studies in specific patient groups, including the following conditions: cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, drug or alcohol dependence, head and neck cancers, HIV infection, bipolar disorders, depression, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders.</P>
<P>Varenicline was approved as a prescription-only aid to smoking cessation in 2006 by the American Food and Drug Administration under the trade name Chantix, and by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency under the trade name Champix. In July 2007 it was approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for prescribing by the UK National Heath Service (<LINK REF="REF-ASH-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASH 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). Post-marketing surveillance has raised subsequent concerns about possible links between varenicline and major health risks, including suicidal ideation and behaviour, depression, and serious adverse cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2008</LINK>). We consider these findings in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section of this review, and in our meta-analyses.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-04-23 14:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialised register for trials, using the terms ('cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'dianicline' or 'varenicline' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') in the title or abstract, or as keywords. This register has been developed from electronic searching of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, together with handsearching of specialist journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of previous trials and overviews. The most recent search of the Register was in May 2015, and included reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), issue 5, 2015; MEDLINE (via OVID) to update 20150501; EMBASE (via OVID) to week 201519; PsycINFO (via OVID) to update 20150506. See the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/TOBACCO/frame.html">Tobacco Addiction Group Module</A> for details of the search strategies for these databases.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We also searched UK and US online clinical trials registers for ongoing and recently completed trials. Trials which may be candidates for inclusion (i.e. RCTs of smoking cessation interventions using a nicotine receptor partial agonist with a minimum follow-up of six months), and for which results are not yet available, are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.<BR/>We contacted the authors of ongoing studies of varenicline and cytisine where necessary.</P>
<P>We made a strategic decision to delay publication of this update until we could access the findings of the Pfizer <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK> trial (NCT014569360) in April 2016. Although we did not conduct full-scale top-up searches during this waiting period, we checked the status of all ongoing studies known to us, and identified published results for six of them: two were journal articles (<LINK REF="STD-Baker-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2016</LINK>), now included studies, and four had posted their results on the <A HREF="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</A> database; we have added two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00828113" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00828113</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01347112" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01347112</LINK>) to the included studies, and the other two (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01308736" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01308736</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01806779" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01806779</LINK>) to the excluded studies.<BR/>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-04-29 09:55:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We checked the abstracts of studies generated by the search strategy for relevance, and acquired full reports of any trials that might be suitable for the review. One author (KC) extracted the data, and a second author (NLH) checked them. We resolved any discrepancies by mutual consent, or by recourse to a third author (TL). Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria are listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, with reasons for their exclusion.</P>
<P>Studies were evaluated on the basis of the quality of the randomisation procedure and allocation concealment, as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following information about each trial, where it is available, is reported in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>:</P>

<LI>Country and setting (e.g. primary care, community, hospital outpatient/inpatient)</LI>
<LI>Method of selection of participants</LI>
<LI>Definition of smoker used</LI>
<LI>Methods of randomisation and allocation, and blinding of trialists, participants and assessors</LI>
<LI>Demographic characteristics of participants (e.g. average age, sex, average cigarettes/day)</LI>

</UL>
<P>Studies in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table are grouped by the type of treatment being tested (cytisine, dianicline, varenicline).<BR/>Quit rates are calculated based on the numbers of people randomised to an intervention, and excluding any deaths or untraceable moves, in accordance with the Russell Standard (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>). We regard those who drop out or are lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. We have noted any deaths and adverse events in the results section. Effects are expressed as risk ratios ((number of events in intervention condition/intervention denominator)/(number of events in control condition/control denominator)). For cessation a risk ratio greater than 1 indicates that more people are quitting in the intervention condition. For adverse events, a risk ratio greater than 1 indicates that more people experience adverse events in the intervention condition.</P>
<P>
<BR/>Where appropriate, we have conducted meta-analyses of the included studies, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model, provided that there was no significant heterogeneity. We assessed statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic which describes the percentage of total variation between studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). Values over 50% suggest moderate heterogeneity, and values over 75% substantial heterogeneity.</P>
<P>For studies of disease-specific patients (section III) and for patients in different settings (section IV), we have conducted and reported sensitivity analyses, treating them as subgroups of the main analyses and testing for subgroup differences.</P>
<P>For this update, we have produced 'Summary of findings' tables covering the main outcomes of smoking abstinence for varenicline versus placebo, varenicline versus bupropion, varenicline versus NRT (all in <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), and cytisine versus placebo (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>); and incidence of serious adverse events for the comparison of varenicline versus placebo. Our grading decisions are based on the five GRADE considerations: study limitations in design or execution (risks of bias), inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and publication bias. Evidence from studies is rated as high quality (i.e. we are very confident of the findings), through moderate, low, and very low quality (i.e. the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect).</P>

One trial of 602 smokers, 300 of whom took the active treatment, tested the Sanofi-Aventis drug dianicline for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 2011</LINK>). The remaining 39 trials tested varenicline in a variety of populations and settings, and against various comparators. Two trials, formerly classified as 'Ongoing studies' have now posted their findings on the <A HREF="http://http//:www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</A> website, and we now treat them as included studies (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00828113" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00828113</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01347112" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01347112</LINK>), albeit with limited information on design and findings.

We rated <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK> at high risk of bias for a lack of blinding of participants and personnel. This study may also have been at risk of bias for providing cytisine free of charge but NRT at a cost of NZD 3 per item. Although <LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK> invokes the Russell Standard criteria (<LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>) in support of the conduct of their trial, they excluded 26 participants who took no medication from the denominator; we have reinstated them for our meta-analyses, in order to present an intention-to-treat estimate, i.e. all people randomised, excluding only those who died or who moved away.<BR/>
<BR/>Of the 39 varenicline trials, 23 reported randomisation and allocation procedures in sufficient detail to be assessed as being at minimal risk in their attempts to control selection bias.

A sensitivity analysis removing these trials made no difference to the findings. None of the trials reported any assessment of the integrity of the double-blinding procedure.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aubin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aubin 2008</LINK> was an unblinded open-label trial, which may have led to the differential drop-out rates after randomisation, with nine participants assigned to nicotine patch declining to take part compared with two in the varenicline group.

<P>Two trials which posted their results on the <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</A> website are rated at high risk of bias for attrition and losses to follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-NCT00828113" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00828113</LINK>, comparing long-term and standard doses of varenicline, lost 60% from each of the groups by twelve-month follow-up, while <LINK REF="STD-NCT01347112" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01347112</LINK>, a small study of alcohol-dependent smokers using varenicline to quit, lost 25% from the varenicline group and 71% from the placebo group at 24 weeks.

<P>We pooled the findings of two cytisine trials, covering 937 participants, 470 of whom took the active drug. Both trials reported continuous abstinence rates at longest follow-up (24 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK> and 52 weeks in <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>), delivering an RR of 3.98 (95% CI 2.01 to 7.87; low-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We have not combined these recent trials with <LINK REF="STD-Scharfenberg-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Scharfenberg 1971</LINK>, as the design and conduct of the latter is of indeterminate quality, using self-reported point prevalence abstinence and without biochemical verification of its results. A sensitivity analysis combining the three trials increased the I² statistic from 0% to 68%, indicating substantial heterogeneity between the older study and the recent ones. The RR for <LINK REF="STD-Scharfenberg-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Scharfenberg 1971</LINK> at two-year follow-up was 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), and at six months 1.91 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.37; <I>analysis not shown</I>).</P>
<P>The largest cytisine trial (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK>) compared it with NRT, and reported non-verified continuous abstinence at six months.

<P>The pooled risk ratio (RR) for validated continuous abstinence six months or more from the start of the intervention (longest follow-up) is 2.24 (95% CI 2.06 to 2.43; 27 trials, 12,625 participants, I² = 60%; high-quality evidence; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). This finding is consistent with that reported in the previous version of this review, which included 14 trials and 6166 participants. The current RR is based on 27 cessation trials of varenicline (26 versus placebo, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK>) versus counselling only). Although the control group did not receive placebo medication, we have included <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK> in the main meta-analysis; a sensitivity analysis excluding it made no appreciable difference to the estimate. All the trials in this analysis delivered varenicline at the standard dosage (1 mg twice a day) for 12 weeks, apart from <LINK REF="STD-Heydari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Heydari 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nides 2006</LINK> (eight weeks).

Participants maintained that dosage for three weeks, but could reduce it if side effects became intolerable. Participants could take up to 3 mg a day in addition to the standard daily dose of 2 mg.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-T_x00f8_nnesen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tønnesen 2013</LINK> aimed to wean 139 ex-smokers off long-term use of NRT. All had been consuming an average of 16 NRT units a day for approximately six years. Participants were randomly allocated to varenicline or placebo for the standard 12-week treatment phase, and were followed up to 52 weeks. The trial did not find a difference between the varenicline and placebo arms for participants, either for having smoked (10% in the varenicline group and 11.6% in the placebo group between weeks 36 and 52) or for not using NRT, with a RR of 1.31 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.08; <LINK REF="CMP-008.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.8</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Three trials currently address this population of smokers. <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK> targeted adult smokers admitted to hospital for smoking-related acute illnesses, <LINK REF="STD-Steinberg-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Steinberg 2011</LINK> adult smokers admitted with any diagnosis, and <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012</LINK> adult smokers admitted for non-cardiac elective surgery.

Treating the trials as a subgroup of the main analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>) and testing for subgroup differences demonstrated a significant difference between the hospital group and the remaining trials (Chi² = 15.87, P &lt; 0.0001, I² = 93.7%; analysis not shown).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Craving and withdrawal</HEADING>
<P>The results of the trials included in our review lend support to the theoretical basis for the development of varenicline. Its properties as a partial agonist, causing moderate activation of the &#945;4&#946;2nAChR, may be expected to mitigate craving and withdrawal symptoms, while its antagonist properties in blocking nicotine binding may lead to reduced smoking satisfaction and reduced psychological reward in those who continue to smoke while taking the drug. The varenicline trials which tested withdrawal and craving all reported its superiority over placebo in reducing withdrawal symptoms, as measured on the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale or the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale; craving, as measured on the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking urges; and enjoyment of concurrent smoking, as measured on the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire.Those trials (<LINK REF="STD-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nides 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oncken-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oncken 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Niaura-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Niaura 2008</LINK>) which measured the effects of varying dosage detected greater reductions in craving and withdrawal symptoms in the standard dose groups (1.0 mg twice a day) than in the reduced dose groups. <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2015</LINK> noted similar disparities in enjoyment of smoking when participants moderated their own dosage up to the TQD.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Adverse events (AEs)</HEADING>
<P>The predominant adverse event for varenicline was mild to moderate nausea, subsiding over time, at rates between 6% (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2013</LINK>) and 51% (<LINK REF="STD-Nahvi-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Nahvi 2014a</LINK>), but with almost half the studies reporting levels between 24% and 29%. The trials testing non-standard regimens found a dose-response relationship for the incidence of nausea: rates ranged from 17.5% (0.3 mg daily) to 52% (1.0 mg twice daily) in <LINK REF="STD-Nides-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Nides 2006</LINK>, and from 7.2% (0.25 mg twice daily) to 24.4% (1.0 mg twice daily) in <LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2007</LINK>. Self regulation of treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Niaura-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Niaura 2008</LINK> appeared to reduce rates of nausea, with 13.4% of varenicline users reporting it compared with 5.2% of the placebo group. Both titration and dosage levels affected the incidence and severity of nausea in <LINK REF="STD-Oncken-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oncken 2006</LINK>, with the lower dose resulting in rates of 16.3% (titrated) and 22.6% (non-titrated), compared with 34.9% (titrated) and 41.9% (non-titrated) in the standard dosage groups. <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2015</LINK> allowed participants to increase their dosage up to 5 mg a day by the TQD, and reported nausea rates of 80% in the varenicline group compared with 18% among the placebo participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Gonzales-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzales 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jorenby-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Jorenby 2006</LINK>, an average of 9.5% in the varenicline groups discontinued treatment but remained in the trial for follow-up, compared with an average of 14% in the bupropion groups and 8% in the placebo groups. Discontinuation rates for any adverse event were highest in <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2007</LINK>, where participants took the trial medication for a year, at 28.3% in the varenicline group and 10.3% in the control group. In the 12-week open-label phase of <LINK REF="STD-Evins-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Evins 2014</LINK>, 31.8% of participants taking varenicline discontinued the study because of adverse events, or for non-adherence to the protocol, or because they no longer wished to stop smoking. In Phase 1 of <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2013</LINK>, 62 of 112 (55%) non-responders to NRT assigned to varenicline withdrew or were lost to follow-up, but this was a comparable attrition rate to those lost from the NRT group (60%) and from the bupropion group (58%), and appeared not to be associated with adverse events. The study also noted that 25% of participants across all three conditions reduced their dosage at some point during treatment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</HEADING>
<P>A serious adverse event (SAE) may be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect (<LINK REF="STD-Nakamura-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nakamura 2007</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK> reported no SAEs in their cytisine trial, while <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK> reported seven, none of which was deemed to be related to the medication, and <LINK REF="STD-Scharfenberg-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Scharfenberg 1971</LINK> gave no information about the incidence of SAEs in either group. <LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK>, comparing cytisine with NRT (no placebo group), reported 56 SAEs in 45 participants taking cytisine (eight of the SAEs occurring in one person), and 45 SAEs in 39 participants taking NRT. One person died in each group, but neither death (one alcohol-related asphyxiation and one heart attack) was deemed to be treatment-related.</P>
<P>Among the varenicline studies, there were no treatment-related deaths in any of the intervention groups during treatment or follow-up phases. However, <LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK> reported 13 fatalities during the first 12 months of the study period, in a population of inpatients admitted for acute episodes of smoking-related illnesses. All the deaths (six in the varenicline + counselling group and seven in the counselling-only group) were in people with known underlying comorbidities, including COPD, bradycardia, arrhythmia, lung cancer, stroke and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The authors do not attribute any of the deaths to study medication (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-fatal SAEs occurred in 29 of the varenicline trials. We discounted from this analysis four trials which did not report any SAEs (<LINK REF="STD-De-Dios-2012" TYPE="STUDY">De Dios 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heydari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Heydari 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westergaard-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Westergaard 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wong-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wong 2012</LINK>) and a further four which had no placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Aubin-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aubin 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsukahara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tsukahara 2010</LINK>). Event counts for <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK> are of individuals reporting one or more SAEs. <LINK REF="CMP-011.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.1</LINK> demonstrates an RR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.49; 15,370 participants, I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), indicating an increased risk of SAEs in the varenicline groups compared with the placebo groups. A secondary analysis restricted to SAEs occurring within or immediately after the treatment phase demonstrated a similar effect (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52; 15,000 participants, I² = 0%). A sensitivity analysis using a Peto odds ratio (appropriate for the analysis of rare events) made no difference to the findings. Details of the SAEs among 32 of the included studies are given in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>We also include a meta-analysis of cardiac SAEs including deaths (<LINK REF="CMP-011.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.4</LINK>). There were 92 events in 8587 participants from 21 studies. There were more events in the varenicline groups and the confidence intervals are wide and do not rule out an increase (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.04; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).</P>
<P>For this update. we have conducted new meta-analyses of neuropsychiatric adverse events, using any study included in the efficacy findings which reported the incidence of these events, plus nine studies (flagged with an asterisk in the study ID) excluded from the efficacy analyses, but offering data on safety. The RR for depression is 0.94 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; 36 studies; 16,189 participants, I² = 0%; <LINK REF="CMP-010.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.5</LINK>), with non-significantly lower rates in the varenicline groups. The RR for suicidal ideation is 0.68 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; 24 studies; 11,193 participants, I² = 0; <LINK REF="CMP-010.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.6</LINK>), with border-line non-significantly lower rates in the varenicline groups. It should be noted that all five events in the varenicline group for suicidal ideation occurred in the psychiatric cohort, with none reported in the non-psychiatric group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">The EAGLES Study</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK>, a double-blind triple-dummy RCT, is the largest trial to have been conducted with varenicline, and was stratified by the presence (n = 4074) or absence (n = 3984) of a history of psychiatric disorders. The authors estimate that at least one-third of the psychiatric cohort participants were stably taking psychotropic medications throughout the course of the study. The primary safety endpoint was a composite measure of 16 neuropsychiatric adverse events, including anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, and hostility (all rated as severe), and agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, paranoia, psychosis, suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, and completed suicide (all rated as moderate or severe). Outcomes were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), the Suicide Behavior Questionnaire - Revised (SBQ-R), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at visits throughout the treatment and follow-up phases of the study.</P>
<P>Rates of neuropsychiatric AEs were similar across all four treatment groups, with more AEs in the psychiatric than in the non-psychiatric cohort. Event rates in the psychiatric cohort during treatment and up to 30 days after were varenicline 6.5%, bupropion 6.7%, NRT 5.2% and placebo 4.9%; the corresponding rates in the non-psychiatric cohort were 1.3%, 2.2%, 2.5% and 2.4% respectively. The risk difference between groups was significantly lower for the varenicline group compared with placebo in the non-psychiatric cohort (RD -1.28, 95% CI -2.40 to -0.15); all other differences in the remaining comparisons (varenicline, bupropion, NRT, all versus placebo) in both cohorts were statistically non-significant. The study authors interpret this as indicating that none of the first-line smoking cessation treatments compared with placebo significantly increases the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events in smokers with or without psychiatric disorders.</P>
<P>An analysis by treatment group in the psychiatric cohort, assessing the incidence of AEs categorised by severity (severe or serious), discontinuation and corrective intervention (including medication, psychotherapy, counselling and hospitalisation), found few differences between the groups: counts of severe AEs were identical across the active treatment groups (14 in each), with the placebo group reporting 13. Serious AEs were similar: varenicline six, bupropion five, NRT and placebo three each. AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were varenicline 16, bupropion and placebo 15 each, and NRT 12, while AEs requiring intervention were varenicline and NRT seven each, bupropion 12, and placebo 11. Based on the upper limits of the confidence intervals, the authors conclude that it is highly unlikely that varenicline and buporpion contribute to neuropsychiatric adverse events of moderate to severe intensity at a rate above 1.5% in smokers without a psychiatric disorder, and above 4% in smokers with such disorders. These estimates are also consistent with no increase in neuropsychiatric event rates in either population of smokers.</P>
<P>The authors report the limitations of their findings, confirming that the results may not be generalisable to smokers with untreated or unstable psychiatric disorders. For the psychiatric cohort, they confined recruitment to smokers with any of four major disease categories (mood, anxiety, psychosis and borderline personality disorder), and did not include smokers with current substance use disorders or imminent risk of suicide. They also point out that light smokers (fewer than 10 cigarettes a day) were excluded from the study population, and that the trial has low power to detect rare neuropsychiatric events.</P>
<P>The evidence currently presented demonstrates an inconsistent pattern between the two cohorts in AE event rates, with the psychiatric cohort reporting higher rates in the active treatment groups compared with placebo, and the reverse pattern in the non-psychiatric cohort. This difference is in line with current SPC warnings that care should be taken in people with a history of psychiatric illness, and with the <LINK REF="REF-FDA-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2015</LINK> Drug Safety Communication advising that they were unable to draw reliable conclusions on these issues. The reliance in this study on a composite safety endpoint, covering a mix of adverse and serious adverse events, also precludes firm conclusions about the risk levels for individual disorders, which may be elevated for some components and reduced for others. We await further details of the findings to explore the robustness of the risk profile.</P>

<P>This update now covers four trials of cytisine, and 39 trials of varenicline. Full searches were conducted to May 2015, although we have included key trials which we obtained after this date.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-04-25 14:49:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cytisine</HEADING>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>) have demonstrated a benefit for cytisine over placebo. However, absolute quit rates were relatively low, with <LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK> reporting 9% for cytisine and 1% for placebo at 24 weeks, and <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK> 8.4% and 2.4% respectively at 52 weeks. The authors note that their deliberately parsimonious intervention for the Polish trial, with a 25-day regimen (in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines; <LINK REF="REF-Tabex-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tabex 2011</LINK>) and minimal behavioural support, may have limited the achievable cessation rates. Further trials with modified regimens may need to be conducted to explore the balance between the positives of affordability and availability within lower- and middle-income economies and the modest efficacy demonstrated to date. A recent non-inferiority trial comparing cytisine with NRT (<LINK REF="STD-Walker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Walker 2014</LINK>) demonstrated a benefit for cytisine at six months, with continuous abstinence rates of 21.8% and 15.3% respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Varenicline</HEADING>
<P>The evidence from 27 trials in 12,625 participants indicates that varenicline increases the chances of successful smoking cessation between two- and three-fold compared with placebo. This estimate has remained stable, despite the growing inclusion of pragmatic trials in real-world settings and in particular groups of smokers normally excluded from clinical trials, e.g. in lower- and middle-income countries, and in disease-specific populations. Long-term use of varenicline (two trials of 24 weeks, two trials of 52 weeks) delivered an unequivocal advantage for varenicline over placebo, without a concomitant increase in adverse or serious adverse events.</P>
<P>In five trials (5877 participants), varenicline was shown to increase the probability of quitting more than bupropion. Eight trials (three of them open-label) in 6264 people compared varenicline with nicotine patches, and found a modest but clear benefit for varenicline. One trial found no differences between any of the three tested treatments (varenicline, nicotine patch, and nicotine patch plus lozenge).</P>
<P>More smokers quit successfully with varenicline than with a placebo or an alternative intervention in all the populations and subgroups that we reviewed, including variations in usage (flexible versus fixed quit dates, different dosages, reducing to quit, relapse prevention therapy), in disease-specific groups of patients (cardiovascular, COPD, schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders, depression), and in various subgroups or settings (hospital inpatients, smokers who failed to quit on other therapies). The exceptions to these findings were standard versus high-dose varenicline, and varenicline versus placebo in young adults with asthma, in Latino light smokers, in methadone-maintained substance abusers, and in long-term users of NRT. In these instances the results favoured varenicline, but did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) can be derived from the pooled difference between placebo and treatment quit rates. However, absolute quit rates vary considerably between trials, according to the definition of cessation, length of follow-up, the population treated and the extent of the counselling and follow-up support given. The risk ratio should be independent of these factors and can be used to derive NNTBs for the assumed placebo rates that will apply in each local setting. We estimated a control quit rate with behavioural support at six months of 7.5%, derived from the weighted mean of the control event rates in the first few varenicline trials conducted in the USA. Based on this rate, the NNTB for varenicline is 11 (95% CI 9 to 13). For comparison we can estimate NNTBs from recent meta-analyses of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.68, <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>) and bupropion (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.76, <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2014</LINK>). Assuming the same 7.5% rate in the behavioural support-only conditions, the NNTB for all types of NRT is 23 (95% CI 20 to 25), and the NNTB for bupropion is 22 (95% CI 18 to 28).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was generally mild to moderate, diminished over time, and was associated with low discontinuation rates. Those trials which tested levels of dosage and the presence or absence of titration found an increase in adverse events (apart from headache) with increasing dosage, and also found that titration appeared to reduce the incidence of nausea. The transitory nature of this adverse event may find further support in the relapse prevention study (<LINK REF="STD-Tonstad-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Tonstad 2006</LINK>), which reported nausea in 33.5% of varenicline users in the open-label phase; once the successful quitters were randomised to varenicline or placebo, rates of nausea fell to 1.2% in the varenicline group and 0.7% in the placebo group. This virtual elimination of nausea as an adverse event may suggest that habituation over 12 weeks of treatment had resolved the condition. However, it is also plausible that those who suffered most with adverse events during the open-label phase may not have successfully completed treatment or, having quit, would be less likely to accept the invitation to take part during the double-blind phase. It would therefore be unwise to draw too strong an inference from the difference in rates between the two phases of the study.</P>
<P>New for this update are analyses of neuropsychiatric events (depression and suicidal ideation). In both cases, the event rates were higher in the placebo groups than in the varenicline groups, although neither point estimate reached statistical significance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Our meta-analysis of serious adverse event (SAE) data from 29 trials suggests there may be a 25% increased risk of such events among the varenicline groups compared with the controls. While this finding (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.49; 15,370 participants; I² = 0%) reaches statistical significance, it must be noted that it is based on simple counts across the trials of participants reporting one or more such events, and does not distinguish between events attributed and those unrelated to treatment. A sensitivity analysis removing events known to have occurred after the treatment phase made a negligible difference to the point estimate (see <LINK REF="CMP-011.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 11.2</LINK>). This finding should also be considered in the light of the higher losses to follow-up in the control arm (mean of 28.4%) of most of the studies (25/29) compared with the varenicline arm (mean of 23.8%) (see <LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>), making it likely that the event rate in the intervention groups was consistently underestimated. A calculation of the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), based on a typical control rate of 2%, returned a figure of 143 (95% CI 74 to 556), i.e. one additional SAE for every 143 people treated with varenicline.</P>
<P>
<I>Neuropsychiatric SAEs</I>
</P>
<P>Post-marketing surveillance has raised continuing safety issues concerning varenicline. In February 2008 the US Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2008</LINK>) issued a public health advisory, reporting that an association between varenicline and an increased risk of behaviour change, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and behaviour "appears increasingly likely". Three months later, the FDA approved changes to the product labelling, including a boxed warning, and a Medication Guide produced by Pfizer Inc.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Tonstad-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonstad 2010a</LINK> points out the complexities of separating treatment-related events during the cessation process from those associated with nicotine withdrawal, with normalisation of monoamine oxidase levels, and possibly with increased caffeine levels. Any causal relationship between varenicline and serious neuropsychiatric events must be convincingly disentangled from possible confounding factors. A review of the ten trials completed up to the end of 2008 (<LINK REF="REF-Tonstad-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonstad 2010b</LINK>) found no significant excess incidence of disorders in varenicline users compared with control groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22), apart from sleep disorders (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.92). However, although the absolute risk of depressed mood disorders and disturbances appears to be low in these study populations (varenicline 2.8% vs placebo 1.9%), the RR of 1.42 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.08), while not statistically significant, suggests an increased likelihood of such disorders for varenicline users. It must also be noted that these trials excluded participants with current or recent depression, panic disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder or alcohol/drug abuse or dependence, and represent an atypically 'healthy' population of smokers. The findings may not be readily generalisable to a mixed real-world population of smokers.</P>
<P>Recent studies have explored possible links between varenicline use and suicidal ideation and behaviour. Any such evaluation is complicated by the fact that people who smoke have a two- to three-fold increased risk of suicide (<LINK REF="REF-Hemmingsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hemmingsson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2000</LINK>). A UK cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 2009</LINK>) evaluating rates of fatal and non-fatal self harm, suicidal thoughts and depression in users of varenicline compared with NRT and bupropion found no clear evidence of an association. The hazard ratio for self harm among people using varenicline compared with NRT was 1.12 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.88), and compared with bupropion was 1.17 (95% CI 0.59 to 2.32). Similarly, current evidence did not detect an effect for an increase in risks of depression or suicidal thoughts associated with varenicline compared with the other two medications. Although the upper level of the confidence interval for the self-harm estimate does not preclude the possibility of a two-fold increase for varenicline users, the data broadly confirm that the absolute incidence was low. The <LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 2009</LINK> analysis has subsequently been updated by <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK>, using validated outcomes, and deploying instrumental variable analysis to counter residual confounding. The updated analyses confirmed that people taking varenicline were no more likely than those taking NRT to suffer fatal or non-fatal self harm (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.49) or treated depression (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87). The interim report by the UK-based Drug Safety Research Unit of their cohort study of prescription event monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Kasliwal-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasliwal 2009</LINK>) has found no evidence of an excess of suicidal thoughts or behaviours; both of the reported suicide attempts in the cohort of 2682 patients occurred in people with a previous history of psychiatric illness and with precipitating factors for the event. A similar study conducted in New Zealand by the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme identified one suicide (0.03%, 95% CI 0.007% to 0.16%) in a cohort of 3415 recipients of dispensed varenicline prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison_x002d_Woolrych-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison-Woolrych 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2014</LINK> used MHRA yellow card data to review the incidence of depression and suicidal behaviour spontaneously reported for 110 different drugs, including varenicline. Varenicline was ranked first for the number of reports per million prescriptions for depression (248, 95% CI 233 to 264), second behind paroxetine for non-fatal suicidal behaviour (172 per million, 95% CI 159 to 185), and sixth for completed suicide behind clozapine, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine (10 per million, 95% CI 8 to 14).</P>
<P>Three recent retrospective cohort studies have reported on the incidence of psychiatric events, criminal offending and traffic accidents and offences (<LINK REF="REF-Molero-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molero 2015</LINK>), on cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric events in users of varenicline (<LINK REF="REF-Kotz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotz 2015</LINK>), and on neuropsychiatric events in varenicline compared with NRT users in the Military Health System (<LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2013</LINK>). The Swedish study (<LINK REF="REF-Molero-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molero 2015</LINK>) reviewed a cohort of 7,917,436 adults, of whom 69,757 had been treated with varenicline between 2006 and 2009. They found that varenicline use was not associated with suicidal behaviour, with criminal offending, with traffic accidents or offences, or with psychoses. There were, however, marginally increased risks of anxiety (hazard ratio (HR) 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.51) and of mood conditions (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.63) in people with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder. In those without an existing psychiatric disorder, the risks were elevated but not statistically significantly different. In the English study (<LINK REF="REF-Kotz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotz 2015</LINK>), data from 753 NHS general practices were reviewed to compare recipients of NRT (106,759; the reference group) with users of varenicline (51,450) and bupropion (6557), for the incidence of neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular events. Varenicline was not associated with an increased risk for any neuropsychiatric conditions, compared with NRT users. The hazard ratio for depression was 0.66 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.69), and for self harm 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68), compared with rates in NRT users. However, note comments below on this study and the <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK> data. <LINK REF="REF-Meyer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meyer 2013</LINK> compared propensity-matched cohorts of people prescribed varenicline or NRT (10,814 in each group) within the American military system for rates of hospitalisation for neuropsychiatric events within 30 days of prescription. The adjusted HR at 30 days was 1.14 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34), and at 60 days 1.11 (0.59 to 2.10), indicating no evidence for an elevated risk of hospitalisation among varenicline users compared with those taking NRT (reference group).</P>
<P>In contrast with these broadly reassuring findings, <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK> used the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) to assess the occurence of suicidal behaviour or depression in 9575 case reports of varenicline use, and in 1751 case reports of bupropion use for smoking cessation. They concluded that varenicline was linked to a steep increase in depression or self-injurious behaviours (OR 8.4, 95% CI 6.8 to 10.4) compared with NRT. While this report highlights continuing concerns about safety, it must be noted that inferences drawn from spontaneous reporting systems should be treated with caution. Because of heightened media coverage and FDA warnings, suicidal ideation or behaviour during varenicline use may be more likely to be reported to the AERS than if the patient exhibited the same features while on NRT, for example. The FDA caution against ascribing a causal connection between a drug and the event, pointing out that there is often insufficient information on the report forms to evaluate the event, and that not all adverse events will be reported to them: "Therefore, AERS cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event in the U.S. population" (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2012</LINK>). The limitations of this class of data include potential confounding by indication (i.e. the patient's condition may predispose to higher rates of adverse event); under-reporting; double-counting from multiple sources; the use of concomitant medications; and lack of representativeness which limits generalisability (<LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2011</LINK>). The Institute for Safe Medication Practice (ISMP) has questioned whether a spike in routine reports of serious adverse events for varenicline submitted to the AERS in the third quarter of 2010 is associated with a delay in passing the information from Pfizer to the FDA, and with classifying such events as "expected" rather than fast-tracking them (<LINK REF="REF-ISMP-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISMP 2011</LINK>). In light of the constraints of spontaneous reporting systems, Moore and colleagues compared reports submitted for NRT use (to estimate baseline risks for smokers) with those submitted for antibiotic use (as a proxy for population-based risks), which indicated that smokers may already be at a fourfold-increased risk of suicidal behaviour or depression, regardless of which cessation aids they use. The authors recommended that varenicline should not be offered as a first-line treatment for smoking cessation, and noted that the Veterans Affairs Center for Medication Safety shared this precautionary approach (<LINK REF="REF-VA-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">VA 2011</LINK>). It is notable, however, that a matched observational study of more than 28,000 participants commissioned by the FDA and conducted by the VA Center found no difference in rates of hospitalisation for psychiatric events between users of NRT and users of varenicline; the hazard ratio for varenicline versus NRT was 0.76; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.46 (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011a</LINK>). A recent FDA Drug Safety Communication (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011a</LINK>, October 2011) concludes that "Based on FDA&#8217;s assessment of currently available data, the Agency continues to believe that the drug&#8217;s benefits outweigh the risks and the current warnings in the Chantix drug label are appropriate".</P>
<P>
<I>Cardiovascular SAEs</I>
</P>
<P>Following the publication of <LINK REF="STD-Rigotti-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Rigotti 2010</LINK> (testing varenicline in people with stable cardiovascular disease (CVD)), the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2011b</LINK>) advising that varenicline may be associated with a small increased risk of certain cardiovascular adverse events in people with CVD. A systematic review of 14 trials (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2011</LINK>) claims that varenicline may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events among tobacco users, with a meta-analysis yielding a Peto odds ratio of 1.72 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.71). While the authors describe this as "a 72% increased risk", it should be noted that the incidence of such events was low, at 1.06% in varenicline users and 0.82% in the placebo group, returning an absolute difference of 0.24%, i.e. about 1 in 400. The review has some acknowledged limitations, including the validity of the classification of the cardiac events (unadjudicated, other than those derived from the Rigotti trial); higher losses to follow-up in the placebo groups, which may underestimate the true rate of control events; and the choice of a Peto rather than a Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (the latter just missing statistical significance [M-H OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.44]). The choice of a random-effects rather than a fixed-effect model would also lower the point estimate (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.34). The assumption of a baseline risk rate of 5.57% for cardiac adverse events in their calculation of a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) may also be questionable, since it is based on the Rigotti study population of smokers with established cardiac disease, while the event counts used to derive the odds ratio come from trials which were mostly in unusually 'healthy' trial participants.</P>
<P>These concerns were echoed by an observational prospective cohort study of dispensed prescriptions for varenicline in New Zealand between April 2007 and November 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison_x002d_Woolrych-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison-Woolrych 2012</LINK>). The study, conducted by the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme, covered all patients who received varenicline, and has so far identified 172 cardiovascular adverse events within that cohort. Forty-eight of these were classified as myocardial ischaemia (including 12 reports of myocardial infarction and eight of angina), and 50 were classified as hypotensive events. Within each of these two subgroups, the investigators considered that two key cases may have been triggered by the use of varenicline. Twenty-seven episodes of dysrythmia were also reported, two of which culminated in sudden death; one was attributed to pre-existing heart disease, while the other displayed no definitive underlying cause. Although this cohort was subject to raised baseline risks because of their smoking and to multiple confounding factors, the authors speculate on possible mechanisms of dysregulation of blood pressure, which could have contributed to the events.</P>
<P>A Danish cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Svanstr_x00f6_m-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svanström 2012</LINK>) compared propensity-matched cohorts of people prescribed varenicline or bupropion (17,926 in each group) from 2007 to 2010 for rates of acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic stroke, and cardiovascular death six months from the start of treatment. The study found no excess of events in the varenicline group (6.9 cases per 1000 person-years) compared with the bupropion group (7.1 cases per 1000 person-years). The hazard ratio (varenicline versus bupropion) for acute coronary syndrome was 1.20 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.91), for ischaemic stroke 0.77 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.48), and for cardiovascular death 0.51 (95% CI 0.13 to 2.02). The presence or absence of a history of cardiovascular disease did not affect the overall findings.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-Kotz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotz 2015</LINK> cohort study, briefly reported above, found significantly reduced risks of ischaemic heart disease (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87), of cerebral infarction (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.73), of heart failure (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83) and of arrhythmia (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) in varenicline users compared to NRT users.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Sterling-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterling 2016</LINK>) of varenicline and cardiovascular serious adverse events included 38 RCTs (12,706 participants) published up to 2015, and found no evidence of an association, in people with (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.89) or without (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.64) cardiovascular illness. This study also analysed all-cause mortality, and found no difference between the varenicline and placebo groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.52).</P>
<P>We await results from the CATS study (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01574703" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01574703</LINK>), conducted among participants in the <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK> study, and designed to monitor the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACEs) for 28 weeks after the completion of the <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK> trial. The CATS study was completed in July 2015, and is expected to report later this year.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 08:22:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have followed standard Cochrane methodology to perform this update. <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK> (a funnel plot of the main analysis) appears to identify a lack of smaller trials with negative findings. However, the earliest studies in this review were reported in 2006, and we are reasonably confident that the licensing and subsequent trials have been routinely registered online in clinical trials registries. The absence of negative studies may be more a marker of sustained efficacy than of the suppression or selective management of data.</P>
<P>Varenicline's efficacy for smoking cessation is now well established, with the point estimate remaining unchanged as more studies (including non-Pfizer trials) accumulate. Trials are now being conducted and reported in patient groups originally excluded from the earlier studies, and more flexible regimens appear not to compromise levels of efficacy. However, concerns about possible adverse events in vulnerable individuals mean that varenicline is unlikely to be made available as an over-the-counter option, or outside the supervision of a health professional. The costs of treatment have hitherto restricted usage to high-income countries, although trials are increasingly being conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Cytisine, an unlicensed treatment in the European Union and the USA, is an affordable alternative available in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia, and for online purchase worldwide, and may have the potential to meet the needs of smokers wishing to quit in areas of economic constraint.</P>

<P>We judge the current evidence from the cytsine trials to be of low quality, meaning that we have limited confidence in the evidence; only two trials contribute to the meta-analysis, with relatively small numbers taking part. We rated the evidence from studies comparing varenicline with placebo and bupropion as comparators as being of high quality, i.e. reliable and robust. We rate the evidence from studies that compared varenicline with NRT as moderate quality (i.e. we are reasonably confident of the stability of the evidence), since three of them were non-blinded open-label trials.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-05-03 09:50:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have delayed publication of this update in order to be able to report on the <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK> trial. Our information on that trial has been drawn from the trial registry summary (NCT01456936) with results posted on May 3rd 2016, from Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) conference abstracts, from a presentation made at the SRNT conference in Chicago (March 3rd 2016), from correspondence with the Pfizer Medical Information Department, and from the in-press release of the initial findings in <I>The Lancet</I>. Further results as they become available may moderate our findings in this update.</P>
<P>The comprehensive searches for this update are current to May 2015. Since May 2015 we have checked the status of all ongoing studies, and have generated monthly routine searches of PubMed (keywords 'varenicline' and 'cytisine') to identify any additional relevant research. Studies collected in this way include <LINK REF="STD-Baker-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Baker 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eisenberg-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Eisenberg 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Westergaard-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Westergaard 2015</LINK>. However, we cannot vouch for the completeness of the evidence base beyond the May 2015 search date, and may have missed some relevant reports or developments.</P>
<P>All the varenicline trials reported in this review apart from seven (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Dios-2012" TYPE="STUDY">De Dios 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heydari-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Heydari 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nahvi-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Nahvi 2014a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rose-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tsukahara-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tsukahara 2010</LINK>) were funded and/or supported by Pfizer Inc, the manufacturers of varenicline. Evidence from systematic reviews suggests that industry-funded trials, although conducted to a high standard, are more likely to have outcomes favourable to the product sponsor than studies with other sponsors (<LINK REF="REF-Etter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etter 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2011</LINK>). However, a sensitivity analysis removing them from the main analysis made no difference to the result. Future updates of this review are increasingly likely to cover findings from community-based independently-conducted trials.</P>
<P>Although we have reported information from studies other than RCTs for the incidence and likelihood of adverse events and serious adverse events, it is important to acknowledge the risks of relying upon evidence from cohort studies, surveys, and prescription event-monitoring data. There is, for example, evidence from observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kotz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotz 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2013</LINK>) of residual confounding contributing to the observed reductions in the hazard ratios for depression and death. The lower rates in the varenicline users are attributable not to a protective effect conferred by the treatment but to baseline differences between the varenicline and NRT cohorts; the former were healthier, wealthier and younger (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2015</LINK>). The <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2015</LINK> study (see below), based on 39 RCTs, found no significant reductions in depression, self harm or death rates, compared with placebo.</P>

<P>Reviews of controlled studies of cytisine (<LINK REF="REF-Etter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etter 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Etter-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etter 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutka 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutka-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutka 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tutka-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tutka 2008</LINK>) have focused upon its potential as an established and affordable aid to smoking cessation. Many of the early cytisine studies excluded from this review are discussed and evaluated in <LINK REF="REF-Etter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Etter 2006</LINK>. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Leaviss-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leaviss 2014</LINK>) has compared the efficacy and cost effectiveness of cytisine (two trials: <LINK REF="STD-Vinnikov-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Vinnikov 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2011" TYPE="STUDY">West 2011</LINK>) versus varenicline (21 trials). While the analysis found both treatments to be effective for smoking cessation, cytisine delivered more quality-adjusted life-years at a lower cost than varenicline. Cytisine was also associated with lower rates of headache and nausea than varenicline.</P>
<P>A Cochrane overview and network meta-analysis of a number of pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2013</LINK>) assessed 12 Cochrane reviews published to November 2012, and therefore drew on the previous version of this review. Comparisons between varenicline, bupropion and single-treatment NRT found varenicline to be superior to both treatments (OR 1.59; 95% credible interval 1.29 to 1.96, and OR 1.57, 95% credible interval 1.29 to 1.91 respectively). Varenicline demonstrated comparable efficacy to combination NRT (OR 1.06, 95% credible interval 0.75 to 1.48), but the number of NRT trials informing this comparison was low (nine trials). The direct comparisons between varenicline and placebo, varenicline and bupropion and varenicline and NRT reported in the <LINK REF="STD-EAGLES-2016" TYPE="STUDY">EAGLES 2016</LINK> trial confirmed in all cases the network results of the same comparisons in <LINK REF="REF-Cahill-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cahill 2013</LINK>. A 2012 network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2012</LINK>), comparing high-dose and combination NRT versus varenicline and versus bupropion across 146 RCTs, found varenicline (11 trials) to be superior to placebo and to bupropion at all time points, and similar in efficacy to standard and to high-dose NRT.</P>
<P>Attention in recent years has tended to shift from efficacy (now clearly established) to adverse and serious adverse events. A meta-analysis of gastrointestinal adverse events associated with varenicline use in 12 RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-Leung-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leung 2011</LINK>) found that the drug produced higher rates of nausea (NNTH of 5), constipation (NNTH of 24), and flatulence (NNTH of 35). Another meta-analysis in 12 RCTs of adverse effects during varenicline use (<LINK REF="REF-Drovandi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drovandi 2015</LINK>) found elevated rates of discontinuation attributable to adverse effects (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81) among the varenicline users compared to placebo, and higher rates of nausea, insomnia and headache. Since publication of the <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2011</LINK> systematic review, a number of other meta-analyses and commentaries have addressed the risks of cardiovascular adverse events associated with varenicline usage. Two reviews which covered largely the same research as the Singh review did not demonstrate a statistically significantly raised event rate for cardiovascular disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Prochaska-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prochaska 2012</LINK>, 22 studies; <LINK REF="REF-Ware-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 2013</LINK>, 15 studies); the discrepancies were attributed by the Singh team to differences in interpretation of the outcomes and to modifications to the statistical computations. <LINK REF="REF-Mills-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2013</LINK>, a network meta-analysis of 63 RCTs of NRT, bupropion and varenicline, found no elevated risk of serious cardiovascular events associated with any of the treatments, although trials of NRT demonstrated an increased risk for less serious events. The RR for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in varenicline compared with placebo was 1.34 (95% credible interval 0.66 to 2.66; 18 trials).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2015</LINK> is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 RCTs (10,761 participants), assessing the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events among users of varenicline. The authors found no evidence of an increased risk of suicide or attempted suicide (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.67, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.57), suicidal ideation (Peto OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.20), depression (Peto OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.22) or death (Peto OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.38) associated with varenicline. There was no evidence that the risk of depression and suicidal ideation differed by age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, the presence or absence of psychiatric illness, or study sponsorship. This analysis included varenicline prescribed for any indication; our own analyses of depression (<LINK REF="CMP-010.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.5</LINK>) and suicidal ideation (<LINK REF="CMP-010.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.6</LINK>) use most of the same studies (including nine trials which did not contribute to our efficacy analyses), but we have dropped six trials which did not target smoking cessation, and have included four studies not then available to the Thomas team (<LINK REF="STD-Carson-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Carson 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hajek-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Hajek 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nahvi-2014a" TYPE="STUDY">Nahvi 2014a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because they are relatively rare, the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric events associated with varenicline has tended to be examined through retrospective cohort studies and prescription event monitoring studies, rather than through randomised trials, and has been considered in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> section above. <LINK REF="REF-Gibbons-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibbons 2013</LINK> is a re-analysis of SAE neuropsychiatric data from 17 RCTs of varenicline, stratifying by the presence or absence of psychiatric disorders. The analysis found no excess of suicidal thoughts or behaviour in the varenicline group without psychiatric disorders (0.47 events per 1000, compared with 1.46 per 1000 in the placebo group), nor in the varenicline group with a history of psychiatric disorders (14.57 events per 1000, compared with 15.39 per 1000 in the placebo group). No suicides were reported in any of the groups. The same study also analysed a Department of Defence data set comparing events in a varenicline cohort (19,933 people) versus a cohort of NRT users (15,867 people) between August 2006 and August 2007 (i.e. before the FDA issued a black-box warning). Rates of neuropsychiatric events in this cohort were 2.28% for varenicline and 3.1% for nicotine patch.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Varenicline at standard dosage (1.0 mg twice a day) increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation by more than two-fold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts.</LI>
<LI>Varenicline at reduced dosage remained an effective aid to smoking cessation, delivering success rates similar to those achieved with nicotine replacement and bupropion, and appearing to reduce the impact of adverse events in the early weeks of treatment.</LI>
<LI>More people quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion.</LI>
<LI>Eight trials of varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy indicate a modest but unequivocal benefit for varenicline.</LI>
<LI>Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention.</LI>
<LI>The most commonly reported adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time.</LI>
<LI>Users of varenicline may have an elevated risk of any serious adverse event, with rates about 25% higher than in those not using the drug.</LI>
<LI>Evidence from randomised controlled studies does not confirm a causal link between varenicline and psychiatric adverse events in people without a history of psychiatric disorders.</LI>
<LI>The evidence is less clearcut for the relationship between varenicline and neuropsychiatric events in people with past or current psychiatric disorders. The largest RCT suggests there may be up to a 4% increased risk of moderate-to-severe neuropsychiatric events in smokers with psychiatric disorders taking varenicline, compared with a 1.5% increased risk in smokers without these disorders. These estimates are also consistent with no increased risk in either cohort.</LI>
<LI>The imminent publication of data from a large recent trial should provide more definitive data on how varenicline may impact on major cardiovascular events.</LI>
<LI>Cytisine was shown to be effective and affordable, although absolute quit rates were modest.</LI>
<LI>Dianicline was no more effective than placebo in helping smokers to quit. Development of the drug has been suspended by the manufacturers.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Further varenicline trials may be useful in disorder-specific groups of patients, excluded from the earlier trials.</LI>
<LI>Future trials should continue to investigate the long-term success of extended treatment compared with standard 12-week treatment.</LI>
<LI>The incidence of serious adverse events should continue to be monitored through controlled trials, and described with greater precision than is currently reported.</LI>
<LI>Further exploration of safety issues in people with past or current psychiatric disorders may still be warranted.</LI>
<LI>Additional trials of cytisine are needed to explore variations in the drug regimen and in the level of behavioural support needed to boost quit rates.</LI>

Looks includable, if we can get enough info?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction Smoking has increased risk of morbidity and mortality. World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, disease caused by smoking will result in the deaths of around 8.4 million people in the world and half of these deaths from Asia. Varenicline, a partial agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, has the potential to aid smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms and reducing the rewarding properties of nicotine. Method A randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled trial conducted between July 2012 and December 2012 with a 12 week treatment period and 12 week follow-up of smoking status. 80 adult smokers who volunteered for the study divide into Varenicline and placebo group. Varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice daily (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 12 weeks, plus weekly smoking cessation counseling. Result During 4 weeks (weeks 1-4) after 12 weeks of treatment, 55% of participants in the Vernicline group were continuously abstinent from smoking compared with 27.5% in the placebo group (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 2.0). For weeks 5 through 8, 52.5% of participants in the Varenicline group were continuously abstinent compared with 20% in the placebo group (PR, 2.6). For weeks 9-12, 47.5% of participants in the Varenicline group were continuously abstinent compared with 17.5% in the placebo group (PR, 2.7). Mean of first day free of smoking used Varenicline for smoking cessation was 40.63 days and mean of first day free of smoking used placebo was 56.43 days. The most adverse event with varenicline was nausea, which occurred in 9 Participants (22.5%). Mean of CO level was 18.46 ppm, mean of Fagerstrom score for nicotine dependence was 6.4. Conclusion Varenicline is an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated smoking cessation pharmacotherapy&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-27 09:42:09 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" YEAR="2013">

Methods: Eligible smoking patients in hospital, with CAD undergoing PCI were consecutively included. All patients received aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (loading dose 300mg, followed by 75 mg/day). On 3 day after received clopidogrel 75mg/day, patients will be randomized to receive either associated varenicline or without varenicline for 14 days. Blood samples will be collected before rendered clopidogrel, on day 1 before associated varenicline, and on 14 day after associated varenicline. Clopidogrel effect will be tested by measuring platelet phosphorylated- VASP expressed as a platelet reactivity index (PRI). All patients were followed 6 months and they were documented smoking ceased rates, concomitant medication and adverse events. Results: The statistic comparison of the baseline data at admission in two groups showed no significant differences. In the conventional therapy group, PRI was 80.08+5.60%, 55.21+14.87% and 43.01+13.59% respectively at the three time. In varenicline group, PRI was 79.94+5.18%, 53.74+14.47% and 42.18+11.27% respectively at the three time. There was no significant difference between the two groups. The comparison of smoking ceased rates of two groups after 6 months: The smoking cessation rate was 64.91% in the varenicline group. The smoking cessation rate was 34.48%. The smoking cessation rate of the varenicline group was higher than the control group (P0.010). The data of eGFR were similar in the 2 groups. The adverse events in varenicline group were higher than in conventional therapy group. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. The serious adverse events were identical between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The rate of smoking cessation of varenicline was significantly improved in patients with CAD in periprocedure of PCI. Clopidogrel can be safely administrated with varenicline without the need for dose adjustment&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2015-05-27 09:46:59 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" YEAR="2014">

<P>Study began as nortriptyline vs bupropion; 3 months later, 19 people had been recruited to bupropion and 18 to placebo; nortriptyline was replaced as the target treatment by varenicline. The nortriptyline phase group (cohort 1) had 19 days of medication and 3 counselling sessions before TQD, whereas varenicline phase group (cohort 2) had 12 days of medication and 2 counselling sessions before TQD. No differences were found between the 2 cohorts, nor between overall findings and cohort 2 findings. Authors therefore combined both groups into a single study cohort for analysis.</P>

<P>Biochemical verification</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'biochemical validation' or 'biochemical confirmation':<BR/>A procedure for checking a tobacco user's report that he or she has not smoked or used tobacco. It can be measured by testing levels of nicotine or cotinine or other chemicals in blood, urine, or saliva, or by measuring levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath or in blood.<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Bupropion</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A pharmaceutical drug originally developed as an antidepressant, but now also licensed for smoking cessation; trade names Zyban, Wellbutrin (when prescribed as an antidepressant)</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Carbon monoxide (CO)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A colourless, odourless highly poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and in the lungs of people who have recently smoked, or (in smaller amounts) in people who have been exposed to tobacco smoke. May be used for biochemical verification of abstinence.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Cessation</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'quitting'<BR/>The goal of treatment to help people achieve abstinence from smoking or other tobacco use, also used to describe the process of changing the behaviour<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Continuous abstinence</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Also called 'sustained abstinence'<BR/>A measure of cessation often used in clinical trials involving avoidance of all tobacco use since the quit day until the time the assessment is made. The definition occasionally allows for lapses. This is the most rigorous measure of abstinence<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>'Cold Turkey'</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Quitting abruptly, and/or quitting without behavioural or pharmaceutical support.</P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>Craving</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A very intense urge or desire [to smoke].<BR/>See: Shiffman et al 'Recommendations for the assessment of tobacco craving and withdrawal in smoking cessation trials'<BR/>Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research 2004: 6(4): 599-614<BR/>
</P>

</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Lapse/slip</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Terms sometimes used for a return to tobacco use after a period of abstinence. A lapse or slip might be defined as a puff or two on a cigarette. This may proceed to relapse, or abstinence may be regained. Some definitions of continuous, sustained or prolonged abstinence require complete abstinence, but some allow for a limited number or duration of slips. People who lapse are very likely to relapse, but some treatments may have their effect by helping people recover from a lapse.</P>

</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Outcome</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Often used to describe the result being measured in trials that is of relevance to the review. For example smoking cessation is the outcome used in reviews of ways to help smokers quit. The exact outcome in terms of the definition of abstinence and the length of time that has elapsed since the quit attempt was made may vary from trial to trial.</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Pharmacotherapy</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A treatment using pharmaceutical drugs, e.g. NRT, bupropion</P>
