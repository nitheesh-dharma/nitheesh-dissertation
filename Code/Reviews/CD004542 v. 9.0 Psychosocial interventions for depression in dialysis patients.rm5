<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-15 08:48:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Depression is the most common psychological problem in patients undergoing dialysis (<LINK REF="REF-Finkelstien-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finkelstien 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levenson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levenson 1991</LINK>). Studies have shown that at least 25% of patients on haemodialysis and 30% of patients on peritoneal dialysis are depressed (<LINK REF="REF-Juergenson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juergenson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Diagnosis of depression in the dialysis population presents considerable difficulties. Symptoms of uraemia may be mistaken for the somatic features of depression and renal unit staff are unlikely to receive training in the detection and diagnosis of depression in a medically ill population (<LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Streltzer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streltzer 1983</LINK>). There are lack of epidemiological studies of depression in this population using standardised diagnostic measures. One cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1985</LINK>) assessing depression in a randomly selected population of 60 dialysis patients using two screening tools found that 47% were depressed according to the Beck Depression Inventory and 17% according to the Multiple Affective Adjective Checklist compared to only 5% according to the diagnostic DSM-III criteria. </P>
<P>Depression can adversely affect the well-being of patients on chronic dialysis in several ways. The quality of life of patients on chronic dialysis has been shown to correlate more strongly with depression than with dialysis adequacy measures (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steele-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steele 1996</LINK>). Depressed patients on chronic dialysis have been shown to have poor compliance with dialysis prescriptions (<LINK REF="REF-Kaveh-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaveh 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1995</LINK>) and fluid restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Everett-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everett 1993</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>) found a significant association between depression and intolerance to antihypertensive drugs due to nonspecific adverse effects in the general population. This may be of relevance to patients on chronic dialysis as around 80% of haemodialysis and 50% of peritoneal dialysis patients are hypertensive (<LINK REF="REF-Levey-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levey 1998</LINK>) and hypertension significantly contributes to the burden of cardiovascular disease in the dialysis population. Depressed patients on peritoneal dialysis have been shown to have higher rates of peritonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Juergenson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juergenson 1996</LINK>). Depression has been associated with increased mortality in dialysis patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziarnik-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziarnik 1977</LINK>). Some have found the effect of depression on chronic haemodialysis patient survival to be of the same order of magnitude as medical risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 2000</LINK>). The risk of hospitalisation is increased in patients with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2002</LINK>). Among patients aged 65 and over, rates of hospitalisation for depression as a primary diagnosis in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population were significantly greater than in patients with ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peptic ulcer disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kimmel-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimmel 1998</LINK>). Chronic dialysis treatment requires regular attendance at a dialysis unit or constant maintenance of peritoneal exchanges. Such intrusive therapy may be difficult for patients with co-existent psychiatric disorders. </P>
<P>Depression in patients on chronic dialysis has important consequences for health care system planning. The treatment of complications as a result of depression in the dialysis population has cost implications in terms of drugs, hospitalisation, and where needed, additional dialysis sessions. In addition to the above mentioned factors, increased rates of hospitalisation places considerable strain on a scarce resource - hospital beds. </P>
<P>Depression can be treated by both physical (drugs and electro-convulsive therapy (ECT)) and psychosocial interventions. Psychosocial interventions can be defined as those interventions that do not have a widely accepted physical basis of action, for example cognitive-behavioural therapy or problem-solving therapy. Several meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions have found them to be effective treatments for depression (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dobson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dobson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scoggin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scoggin 1994</LINK>). These studies have not yet been conducted in patients with renal disease. Such patients have a considerable burden of self-care and psychological issues related to their physical disease. These may require adaptation of standard psychosocial interventions to achieve the same treatment gains or patient acceptability. Psychosocial interventions may be especially appropriate for patients on dialysis, since they avoid potential drug interactions of antidepressant medication. Psychosocial interventions are also known to be widely requested by many patients and form a key recommendation in current guidelines for the treatment of depression (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The specialised, intensive treatment required by dialysis patients means that non-physical treatments for depression need assessing for efficacy and feasibility in renal settings. The resolution of depression with treatment may result in improvement in medical outcomes and may also reduce costs for the health care system.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-15 08:48:42 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We failed to identify a single RCT assessing psychosocial interventions in depressed dialysis patients. One of the problems may be that since we did not search by using specific therapy terms such as exercise or cognitive-behaviour therapies, we may have not picked up studies using these interventions not indexed in the electronic databases under the MESH term of depression. Studies with negative results may have also not been published and may have been missed. We have however tried to avoid publication bias in our review by contacting authors of studies mentioned below and the trials search coordinator of the Cochrane Renal Group to identify unpublished studies, including non-English language studies.</P>
<P>Although we did not identify any trials of interventions to treat depression, we identified five trials of psychosocial interventions in patients on dialysis which reported measurement of depressive symptoms as secondary outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Beder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kouidi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kouidi 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leake-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leake 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2001</LINK>). None standardised diagnostic criteria for depression. We report these trials in some detail since they indicate potential interventions for therapeutic trials and they may be of use in improving mood in general in patients on dialysis, although their efficacy in treating a depressive illness has not been tested. Furthermore the studies illustrate some of the difficulties in perusing studies in this area and since these are the only studies we found, they suggest methodological issues that need to be more widely understood. The studies are not reported as a Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions to improve the general mood of dialysis patients since our search strategy was not designed to identify all such studies. Given the widespread use of interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy or problem solving therapy in depressed patients without physical illness we were surprised not to find such studies in the dialysis population.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Carney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kouidi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kouidi 1997</LINK> compared exercise therapy against no intervention; <LINK REF="STD-Beder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beder 1999</LINK> compared additional psychosocial components in the social work services offered to dialysis patients against routine social work services involvement; <LINK REF="STD-Leake-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leake 1999</LINK> compared the techniques strategic self-presentation and problem disclosure with no intervention; and <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2001</LINK> compared the interventions, intercessory prayer and positive visualisation against no intervention. The duration was six months for <LINK REF="STD-Carney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Carney 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kouidi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kouidi 1997</LINK>, three months for <LINK REF="STD-Beder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beder 1999</LINK>, one month for <LINK REF="STD-Leake-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leake 1999</LINK> and six weeks for <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2001</LINK>. The results and trial characteristics are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> (<I>RCTs - psychosocial interventions offered to the whole dialysis population).</I>
</P>
<P>Although studies offering exercise therapy individually showed significantly fewer depressed patients at the end of study period, a meta-analysis of both the studies' results did not show a significant difference between treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.32). Exercise therapy in <LINK REF="STD-Kouidi-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Kouidi 1997</LINK> improved Quality of Life Index scores (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>: MD 3.40, 95% CI 2.32 to 4.48) but not mental state using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Score (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction in BDI Scores (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>: MD -3.96, 95% CI -5.31 to -2.31) in <LINK REF="STD-Beder-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Beder 1999</LINK> from the USA, which offered additional counselling components as part of social work services. The main problem with this paper was that the additional social work components offered as treatment intervention were not well defined thereby making it difficult to say if it can be applied to renal units in a different country.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Leake-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Leake 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2001</LINK> used psychosocial interventions that are not widely accepted for the treatment of depression. The interventions considered in these studies did not produce significant reductions in the depression scores assessed (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). There was also no improvement in the quality of life measures assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Matthews-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Matthews 2001</LINK> study using the Short Form-36 scores (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of these five studies show that there may be an improvement in measures of depressive symptoms by offering additional psychosocial components to routine work with dialysis patients and exercise therapy may have a beneficial effect on quality of life indices. However the results of this review need to be interpreted with caution due to its methodological limitations, and also because it offered the interventions to all dialysis patients, not just to depressed dialysis patients and hence was not designed as a proper therapeutic trial.</P>
<P>The enthusiasm for exercise as a treatment option for depression has to be tempered with the rate of compliance. 'Exercise on prescription' schemes among patients with any referral criteria has been found to vary from only 20% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Biddle-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biddle 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1997</LINK>). It is very likely that the compliance rates with an exercise regime in the depressed dialysis population is likely to be similar or even worse than the figures quoted above.</P>
<P>Whilst conducting this review we identified the lack of use of standardised diagnostic measures for depression when this is reported to have been assessed in the dialysis population. A wide variety of screening measures have been used despite many measures including somatic features of depression when these are known to be less reliable diagnostic markers in physically ill patients. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Lopes-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopes 2002</LINK>) however produced an interesting finding by comparing the response to two questions relating to self-reported mood by patients on haemodialysis to mortality and hospitalisation. Poorer outcomes were reported for patients responding positively to being asked whether, over the past four weeks, they had felt either 'so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer you up' or 'down-hearted and blue'. The study also reported that physician-diagnosed depression correlated poorly with positive responses to the self-report questions. The methodology does not enable readers to conclude whether this related to the physicians being poor at diagnosing depression, or whether the self-report questions detect something other than depression. However the study results do suggest that simple questions relating to mood may be predictive of important physical health-related outcomes.</P>
<P>Our findings regarding the measurement of depressive symptoms in trials of patients on dialysis, indicates that more studies are needed using standardised diagnostic criteria, validation of screening tools in the dialysis population, control for physical illness, severity in studies of physical health-related outcomes and better clarity between improvement in depressive symptoms and treatment of depressive illness.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Data are not available to draw conclusion about the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the treatment of depression in the chronic dialysis population. Psychosocial interventions have however been found to be effective in the treatment of depression in the general population.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a great need for undertaking further RCTs that assess the effectiveness of psychosocial treatment interventions for depression in dialysis patients. Trials should use diagnostic instruments rather than screening tools. It is also important that the RCTs have sufficiently large patient numbers and are of longer duration, and are conducted by researchers who have experience in the conduct of trials using psychosocial interventions, to address this question adequately. The trials should assess hard clinical end-points such as mortality, number of depressed patients at end of study period, and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The effect of improvement of depressive mental state on outcomes such as patient functioning and quality of life should also be explored.</P>
<P>Studies should also compare different types of psychosocial interventions against one another and with drugs. This would help to identify the most efficacious and safe treatment option for depression in dialysis patients. Benefits of exercise therapy on mental state and quality of life of patients on chronic dialysis should be investigated. </P>

The experimental group also received a clinical component in their social works package. This involved the social worker exploring the patients subjective reactions and responses to beginning dialysis, normalizing their reactions when appropriate, while stressing the aspect of hopefulness. The clinical component also included he social worker following stated concerns of the patient, explore their fears and essentially establish a counselling relationship.<BR/>The intervention was administered by renal social workers who had average of 6-12 years of practice in a renal unit who had done a Master's in Social works.
