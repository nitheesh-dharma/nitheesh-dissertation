<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Food products derived from cereal grains as wheat, rice, corn, rye, oat, and barley constitute a major part of the daily diet in many countries. In refined-grain products, the bran and germ of the grain, which contain the major amount of nutrients and dietary fibre, have been removed and only the starchy inner part of the grain (ca. 80% of the whole grain) is used. Whole grain foods contain either intact, flaked or broken grain kernels, coarsely ground kernels or flour that is made from whole grains (whole-meal flour). In this review the effect of whole grain foods and cereal fibre (as a marker of whole-grain food intake) on the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was assessed using all available prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. Only one randomised controlled trial was found which was of low methodological quality. This study investigated in 12 overweight persons during six weeks the effect of the consumption of refined grain foods versus that of whole grain foods on insulin sensitivity (risk factor for the development of T2DM). Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity, increased bowel movements and no adverse effects. No information was given about patient satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity. In addition eleven prospective cohort studies were found. One study was conducted in Finland and the rest in the United States of America of which seven were done in health care workers. Some of the studies were of limited quality. They consistently showed that a high intake of whole grain foods or cereal fibre is associated with a lower risk of the development of T2DM. However, evidence for a protective effect coming from prospective cohort studies only has to be considered as weak as with this design no cause and effect relationship can be established. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to be able to draw definite conclusions about the preventive effects of whole grain consumption on development of T2DM. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diet as one aspect of lifestyle is thought to be one of the modifiable risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Information is needed as to which components of the diet could be protective for this disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To asses the effects of whole-grain foods for the prevention of T2DM. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We selected cohort studies with a minimum duration of five years that assessed the association between intake of whole-grain foods or cereal fibre and incidence of T2DM. Randomised controlled trials lasting at least six weeks were selected that assessed the effect of a diet rich in whole-grain foods compared to a diet rich in refined grain foods on T2DM and its major risk factors.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed study quality and extracted data. Data of studies were not pooled because of methodological diversity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>One randomised controlled trial and eleven prospective cohort studies were identified. The randomised controlled trial, which was of low methodological quality, reported the change in insulin sensitivity in 12 obese hyperinsulinemic participants after six-week long interventions. Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity and no adverse effects. Patient satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity was not reported.<BR/>Four of the eleven cohort studies measured cereal fibre intake, three studies whole grain intake and two studies both. Two studies measured the change in whole grain food intake and one of them also change in cereal fibre intake. The incidence of T2DM was assessed in nine studies and changes in weight gain in two studies. The prospective studies consistently showed a reduced risk for high intake of whole grain foods (27% to 30%) or cereal fibre (28% to 37%) on the development of T2DM. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from only prospective cohort trials is considered to be too weak to be able to draw a definite conclusion about the preventive effect of whole grain foods on the development of T2DM. Properly designed long-term randomised controlled trials are needed. To facilitate this, further mechanistic research should focus on finding a set of relevant intermediate endpoints for T2DM and on identifying genetic subgroups of the population at risk that are most susceptible to dietary intervention.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-01 17:00:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose) with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please see under 'Additional information' in the information on the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (see 'About the Cochrane Collaboration', 'Collaborative review groups - CRGs'). For an explanation of methodological terms, see the main glossary in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-01 17:01:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes worldwide and develops as a consequence of two defects. In an early stage target tissues are unable to respond to normal circulating concentrations of insulin (insulin resistance). As a consequence the output of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cells is increased (hyperinsulinemia) to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In a later stage insulin secretion may decline as a result of beta-cell dysfunction. This leads to impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glycaemia (glucose values above the normal range but below those defined as diagnostic of diabetes) or both which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Unwin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unwin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). Excessive weight gain and central obesity are other well established risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO 2003</LINK>). The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing rapidly worldwide and pose enormous economic as well as social costs to societies, urging for preventive measures. Although genetic elements are involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, the rapid changes in incidence rates suggest a particularly important role for environmental factors. Besides physical activity, diet is thought to play a key role as a modifiable risk factor. Characteristics of a diet favouring the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes are currently defined as high in saturated fat and energy-dense foods as well as low in fruit and vegetables (<LINK REF="REF-FAO_x002f_WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO/WHO 2003</LINK>). The contribution of the type of starchy food - an important component of the diet worldwide - however, has not been established well. Starchy foods are derived mainly from cereal grains which undergo a refining process or will be used entirely (whole grain foods).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:32:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Food products derived from cereals as wheat, rice, corn, rye, oat, and barley constitute a major part of the daily diet in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-FAO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">FAO 1998</LINK>). In refined-grain products, the bran and germ of the grain which contain the major amount of micronutrients, phytochemicals and dietary fibre (non-digestible carbohydrates and lignin), have been removed and only the starchy endosperm (ca. 80% of the whole grain) is used. Whole grain foods contain either intact, flaked or broken grain kernels, coarsely ground kernels or flour that is made from whole grains (whole-meal flour). In epidemiological studies foods commonly are classified as whole grain as they contain more than 25% by weight whole-grain or bran (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 1998</LINK>). The Food and Drug Administration (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2005</LINK>) has approved a health claim for whole-grain foods with a whole-grain content of more than 51% by weight per reference amount customarily consumed and more recently has announced in a FDA guidance document (draft guidelines) that it "considers 'whole grain' to include cereal grains that consist of the intact, ground, cracked or flaked fruit of the grains whose principal components -- the starchy endosperm, germ and bran -- are present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact grain" (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Changes in food patterns such as a decrease of consumption of whole grain foods which occurred simultaneously with the increase of prevalence of chronic disease over the last decades have lead to the hypothesis that constituting whole grain food by highly refined grain foods is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Burkitt-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burkitt 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trowell-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trowell 1975</LINK>). There are several hypotheses as to how whole grain foods might prevent type 2 diabetes. Beneficial effects on weight gain, for example, could be explained by the larger volume and relatively low energy density of whole grain food which is due to the presence of cereal fibre. This promotes satiation and satiety thus leading to decreased energy intake (<LINK REF="REF-Koh_x002d_Banerjee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koh-Banerjee 2003</LINK>). Consumption of whole grain foods containing intact, broken or coarsely ground kernels or viscous soluble fibre, results in a lower postprandial plasma glucose and insulin response as compared to refined grain foods (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 2003</LINK>). In view of the proposed aggravating effects of high postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations on insulin sensitivity and beta-cell failure, their suppression is considered to be beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Ludwig-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ludwig 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willett-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willett 2002</LINK>). Also, the high content of antioxidants such as vitamin E, phytic acid and selenium might be advantageous (<LINK REF="REF-Slavin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slavin 2003</LINK>) since there is emerging evidence that the pathogenesis of diabetes is associated with increased oxidative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sjoholm-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sjoholm 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>From observational studies there is evidence for a protective effect of whole-grain foods with regard to the development of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Fung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeown-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeown 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>). More recently, higher intake of whole grains was also associated with decreases in insulin resistance - a risk factor related to the development of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Liese-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liese 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKeown-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKeown 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steffen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steffen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, the protective effect of whole-grain foods on the development of type 2 diabetes would ideally be evaluated by randomised control trials because of their optimal control of confounding factors. To be able to observe differences in incidence of type 2 diabetes the duration of the dietary intervention would need to be very long. Alternatively, persons with at least one major risk factors for type 2 diabetes could be chosen. Amelioration of the risk factor could then be used as an indication of decreased risk of development of type 2 diabetes. Still, it is likely that compliance with the whole-grain diet decreases with time, especially in persons who regard the diet as less palatable or might experience adverse effects of the intervention. The relatively high content of cereal fibre and resistant starch in the whole-grain diet might cause increased bloating, flatulence or both in sensitive persons. Due to these limitations with regard to trial duration and compliance randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of whole-grain foods on the development of type 2 diabetes are likely to be scarce.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:32:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Some reviews have been published addressing the relation between whole grain foods and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murtaugh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murtaugh 2003</LINK>). However, they were not systematically performed with respect to literature search and did not include quality assessment. Summarizing and evaluating the available evidence -derived from prospective cohort studies and intervention trials - concerning the possible protective effect of whole grain foods could aid in identifying further research need and assist in defining recommendations with regard to the intake of starchy foods for the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials</HEADING>
<P>The quality of reporting of each trial was assessed based largely on the quality criteria specified by Schulz and by Jadad (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In particular, the following factors were studied:<BR/>(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation procedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?<BR/>(2) Minimisation of performance bias - were the participants and people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?<BR/>(3) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and dropouts completely described? was analysis by intention-to-treat?<BR/>(4) Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind to the intervention?</P>
<P>Ad 2) As the treatment was a dietary intervention in which blinding participants and people administering the food is not possible, these criteria were not rated.</P>
<P>Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the following three categories (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>):<BR/>A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.<BR/>B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate risk of bias.<BR/>C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.</P>
<P>This classification was intended to be used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cohort studies</HEADING>
<P>The quality of cohort studies was assessed using the following criteria (derived from Form III for the assessment of a cohort study, version February 2003, www.cochrane.nl):<BR/>- number of appropriate confounders investigated and adjusted for;<BR/>- same method of measurement of outcome in exposed and unexposed group;<BR/>- quality of method used to assess outcome measures: self report without validation, self report with validation, direct measurement/medical records;<BR/>- quality of method used to assess whole-grain intake: food frequency questionnaire without validation, food frequency questionnaire with validation; single measurement, repeated measurement;<BR/>- duration and completeness of follow-up.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-11-01 17:17:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Publication bias was to be assessed by preparation of a 'funnel plot' and examined statistically for signs of asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</BIAS_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-11-01 17:15:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>Data were intended to be summarized statistically if they were sufficiently similar, and of sufficient quality.<BR/>For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences were to be used to analyse the size of the effects of the interventions. The effect sizes for dichotomous data were to be expressed in terms of relative risks, odds ratios or hazard ratios.</P>
<P>In RCTs intention-to-treat analysis was planned to be used when the information was provided.</P>
<P>All data were to be initially analysed with a fixed-effect model. Heterogeneity between trial results were to be tested by using a standard chi-squared test. To quantify inconsistency the I-squared statistic was to be used (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>) which describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. A value greater than 50% was to be considered substantial heterogeneity. Possible causes of heterogeneity were to be explored by conducting subgroup and sensitivity analyses. If significant heterogeneity is found, it is unreasonable to assume that there is one 'true' effect underlying the data, that is constant across different populations and therefore a random effects model was to be used.</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2008-11-01 17:15:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">

Whole-grain breakfast cereals were classified as whole grain as they contained more than 25% whole grain or bran. Montonen et al (<LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>) modified this classification and did not include wheat germ and bran.

<P>In all studies in all participants the same method of outcome measurement was used regardless of the level of whole grain or cereal fibre intake.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of method used to assess outcome measures: self report without validation, self report with validation, direct measurement/medical records</HEADING>
<P>In nine studies the outcome was self-reported. In one study it was directly measured (serum glucose concentrations) (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>) a central register of patients receiving drug reimbursement was used. All studies using self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes validated the outcome in subgroups by comparing it with medical records. Studies with weight gain as an outcome measure validated the self-reported weight in subgroups by measuring weight directly (<LINK REF="STD-Koh_x002d_Banerjee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koh-Banerjee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>). The validation studies showed over all a high agreement between self report and control assessment (see <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>). The number of participants in the validation studies lay between 59 and 184. No information was given on what ground the subgroup size was chosen.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quality of method used to assess whole-grain intake</HEADING>
<P>Dietary intake over the previous year was assessed with mailed semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in nine studies, in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) it was interviewer administered and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>) a dietary history interview was taken. The FFQ mostly assessed the intake of 100 to 134 items, two studies assessed intake of less than 100 items (68 items (<LINK REF="STD-van-Dam-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Dam 2006</LINK>); 66 items (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>)). Dietary assessment was repeated one to three times in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fung-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Fung 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koh_x002d_Banerjee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koh-Banerjee 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schulze-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schulze 2004</LINK>); the other studies did not repeat the assessment. In all studies results of the dietary assessment were validated against results of detailed diet records in subgroups. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Schulze-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schulze 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) an FFQ was used that was not validated in a subgroup of the same population. Examples of relevant correlation coefficients are listed in <LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>' and showed variable agreement.

<P>The duration of the studies lay between six and twelve years and was considered to be long enough. Loss to follow-up (from sample to study population) was only described in one study. Stevens et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) reported an initial response rate of 67% in whites and of 42% in African-American. Four studies reported response rates to the repeated assessments of outcome. More than 80% responded to biennial questionnaires send to the study population in the study of van Dam et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Dam-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Dam 2006</LINK>) and 94% in that of Fung et al.

The response rate to the questionnaires in the study of Meyer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2000</LINK>) declined during the study period (91%, 86%, 79%). Stevens et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) reported that a total of approximately 80% of the study population that remained alive at the end of the study period was examined at all four visits.</P>

<P>Intake of whole grain was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in all five studies (comparison 01.01) which, however, was not statistically significant in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>). The discrepancy of this result with that of the other studies could be caused by the relatively low number of participants (4.316) in this study compared to mostly far more than 10.000 participants in the other studies, which is also reflected by the width of the confidential interval (0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.38).</P>
<P>The relative risks (RR) varied between 0.67 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.38) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.96).

<P>Stevens et al (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) also compared the hazard ratios of diabetes in two subpopulations: cereal fibre intake was inversely associated with risk of diabetes in whites and African-Americans (0.86,95% CI 0.65 to 1.15) but statistically different only in whites (0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92).</P>

Similar results were observed when change in cereal fibre intake was considered (0.4 kg less weight gain in eight years) (<LINK REF="STD-Koh_x002d_Banerjee-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koh-Banerjee 2004</LINK>). The odds of developing obesity (0.81, 95%CI 0.73 to 0.91) or having a major weight gain (0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.01) tended to be lower with increased intake of whole grain foods, as reported in the study of Liu et al (<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:39:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>This review identified 12 studies examining the relation between whole grain intake and the development of type 2 diabetes. Only one study was a randomised controlled trial, the other 11 prospective cohort studies. The RCT had a cross-over design and showed slight improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese hyperinsulinaemic participants after the whole grain intervention of six weeks. However, the risk of bias in this study is considered to be high since allocation concealment was not stated and the randomisation procedure was not described. The trial was of short duration (minimum time period needed for inclusion) with a small sample size. Whether the small elevation of the insulin sensitivity has any clinical relevance is doubtful. However, from a theoretical perspective it could add to the delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes.</P>
<P>The results of the cohort studies were homogenous. None of the studies showed the opposite effect; in one study the effect was not significant. Significantly decreased risk of development of type 2 diabetes was associated in four cohort studies with high whole grain intake (range: 21% to 30%) and in six studies with high cereal fibre intake, (range: 21% to 63%) which can be considered to be a marker of whole grain consumption. Two studies investigated the effect of whole grain consumption on overweight, an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Increased whole grain consumption was associated with only a very slight reduction (0.3 to 0.5 kg) in weight gain and a reduced risk of becoming obese during the follow-up period. The slight reductions in weight gain can not be regarded as clinical relevant considering the long time periods (eight and twelve years) in which they were observed.<BR/>The methodological quality varied between studies mainly with regard to the food intake assessment and the numbers of confounders considered. Food intake was in most studies assessed with food frequency questionnaires. One limitation of this approach is the small number of food items listed (66 to 134 items) which restricts extensive assessment of the food products of interest. None of the food frequency questionnaires was designed especially for assessment of whole grain foods. Measurement error of food intake due to inter-individual variation during the course of the years can be reduced by repeated collection of dietary information. Only five studies repeated the measurement to obtain a better reflection of the long-term intake. Measurement errors in dietary intake may thus have limited the ability to obtain accurate risk estimates. Residual confounding is a problem in prospective cohort studies. As observed in these studies, higher intake of whole grain food tends to be associated with healthier lifestyle and incomplete adjustment of lifestyle factors may result in an overestimation of the effect.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2008-11-03 11:39:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gudrun Paletta">
<P>The main limitation of this review is that evidence of a possible protective effect of a diet rich in whole grain foods on the development of type 2 diabetes is retrieved only from prospective cohort studies of which some were of limited quality. As prospective cohort studies are more prone to bias and confounding than randomised controlled trials results have to be interpreted with caution.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Generalisability and applicability of results</HEADING>
<P>All but one study were conducted in the United States. Most American studies were done in health care workers but the results of three different populations (Iowa women Health study (<LINK REF="STD-Meyer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Meyer 2000</LINK>), Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (<LINK REF="STD-Stevens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stevens 2002</LINK>) and U.S. black women study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Dam-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Dam 2006</LINK>)) were comparable as were those of the study conducted in Finland (<LINK REF="STD-Montonen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Montonen 2003</LINK>). As the majority of studies was conducted in only one part of the world generalisability of results is uncertain.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence from the prospective cohort trials is considered to be too weak to be able to draw a definite conclusion about the preventive effect of whole grain foods on the development of type 2 diabetes. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Properly designed long-term randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether whole grain foods are protective for the development of type 2 diabetes. To facilitate this, further mechanistic research should focus on finding a set of relevant intermediate endpoints for type 2 diabetes and on identifying genetic subgroups of the population at risk that are most susceptible to dietary intervention.</P>
