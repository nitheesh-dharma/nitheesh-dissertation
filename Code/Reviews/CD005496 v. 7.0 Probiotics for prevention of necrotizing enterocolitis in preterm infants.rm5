<P>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease that affects the bowel of premature infants in the first few weeks of life. Although the cause of NEC is not entirely known, milk feeding and bacterial growth play a role. Probiotics (dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast) have been used to prevent NEC. Our review of studies found that the use of probiotics reduces the occurrence of NEC and death in premature infants born weighing less than 1500 grams. There is insufficient data with regard to the benefits and potential adverse effects in the most at risk infants weighing less than 1000 grams at birth.</P>

<P>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and nosocomial sepsis are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.

<P>Twenty-four eligible trials were included. Included trials were highly variable with regard to enrolment criteria (that is birth weight and gestational age), baseline risk of NEC in the control groups, timing, dose, formulation of the probiotics, and feeding regimens. In a meta-analysis of trial data, enteral probiotics supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of severe NEC (stage II or more) (typical relative risk (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.56; 20 studies, 5529 infants) and mortality (typical RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; 17 studies, 5112 infants). There was no evidence of significant reduction of nosocomial sepsis (typical RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; 19 studies, 5338 infants). The included trials reported no systemic infection with the supplemental probiotics organism. Probiotics preparations containing either lactobacillus alone or in combination with bifidobacterium were found to be effective.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-29 22:01:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common serious acquired disease of the gastrointestinal tract in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>). It is characterized by bowel wall necrosis, of various length and depth. Bowel perforation occurs in one third of the affected infants (<LINK REF="REF-Kafetzis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kafetzis 2003</LINK>). Although 5% to 25% of cases occur in term infants, it is primarily a disease of preterm infants with the majority of cases occurring in very low birth weight infants (infants with birth weight &lt; 1500 g) (<LINK REF="REF-Kosloske-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosloske 1994</LINK>). The incidence of NEC varies across countries and neonatal centers. It has been reported to affect up to 10% of very low birth weight infants (VLBW) (<LINK REF="REF-Kosloske-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosloske 1994</LINK>). In a recent report of the Vermont Oxford Network for VLBW infants the incidence of NEC has risen slightly between 2000 to 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-Horbar-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horbar 2012</LINK>). NEC is categorized into three different stages, with clinical symptoms varying from feeding intolerance to severe cardiovascular compromise, coagulopathy, and peritonitis with or without pneumoperitoneum (<LINK REF="REF-Bell-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bell 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathogenesis of NEC remains incompletely understood. NEC most likely represents a complex interaction of factors causing mucosal injury (<LINK REF="REF-Neu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neu 1996</LINK>). It is speculated that NEC occurs with the coincidence of two of the three pathologic events of intestinal ischemia, colonization of the intestine by pathologic bacteria, and excess protein substrate in the intestinal lumen (<LINK REF="REF-Kosloske-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosloske 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-La--Gamma-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Gamma 1994</LINK>). Bacterial colonization is necessary for the development of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Kosloske-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosloske 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musemeche-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musemeche 1986</LINK>). When compared to term infants, VLBW infants at risk of NEC have abnormal fecal colonization, demonstrate a paucity of normal enteric bacterial species, and have delayed onset of bacterial colonization (<LINK REF="REF-Gewolb-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gewolb 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goldmann-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldmann 1978</LINK>). Nosocomial infection is also a frequent complication in VLBW infants. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Network demonstrated that as many as 25% of these infants have at least one or more positive blood cultures, and 5% have positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures over the course of their hospitalization (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>). Late onset sepsis is associated with an increased risk of death, neonatal morbidity, and prolonged hospitalization (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2002b</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-02-10 05:04:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Probiotic bacteria are live microbial supplements that colonize the gastrointestinal tract and potentially provide benefit to the host (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 2003</LINK>). The most frequently used probiotics are lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. There is increasing interest in the potential health benefits of proactive colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Millar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-03-29 22:02:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential mechanisms by which probiotics may protect high risk infants from developing NEC or sepsis, or both, include an increased barrier to migration bacteria and their products across the mucosa (<LINK REF="REF-Mattar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mattar 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orrhage-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orrhage 1999</LINK>), competitive exclusion of potential pathogens (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2001</LINK>), modification of host response to microbial products (<LINK REF="REF-Duffy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duffy 2000</LINK>), augmentation of immunoglobulin A (IGA) mucosal responses, enhancement of enteral nutrition that inhibits the growth of pathogens, and up-regulation of immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-Link_x002d_Amster-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Link-Amster 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-29 22:02:03 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>VLBW infants with NEC have a mortality rate of up to 20% (<LINK REF="REF-Caplan-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caplan 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 1997</LINK>). Approximately 27% to 63% of affected infants require surgical intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>). Strictures, primarily in the colon, occur in more than one third of affected infants (<LINK REF="REF-Ricketts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ricketts 1994</LINK>). An increased rate of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) related complications and extended hospitalization have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Bisquera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisquera 2002</LINK>). Recent data from the NICHD Network suggest an increase in neurodevelopmental impairment rates among infants with NEC and sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>). There is a theoretical risk of bacteremia secondary to enterally administered probiotics strains, though few data support this concern. Bacillus species administered as probiotics were reported to be associated with invasive disease in target populations (<LINK REF="REF-Richard-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richard 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>Standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of the trials. For each trial, information was sought regarding the method of randomization, and the blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all the infants enrolled in the trial. Each criterion was assessed as yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. In addition, for the updates in 2010 and 2013, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the risk of bias table.<BR/>
</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomization; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomized participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data);</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? </P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as: </P>
<UL>
<LI>yes;</LI>
<LI>no;</LI>
<LI>unclear.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-03-30 18:30:23 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our updated review summarizes the evidence on probiotics efficacy in preterm infants. Twenty-four randomized trials and more than 5000 preterm infants are included. Since the publication of our first review, we note a tremendous increase in published studies, reviews, and editorials addressing the efficacy and safety of probiotics utilization in the preterm host. Probiotics are one of the most studied interventions in neonatal medicine.</P>
<P>Our update with more robust data shows that enteral administration of probiotics reduces the incidence of severe NEC, mortality, and NEC related mortality. In addition, the administration of probiotic organisms resulted in a shorter time to full feeds. Our data shows a trend toward a benefit in reduction of sepsis, however this didn't reach statistical significance. Although only two studies limited their inclusion criteria to ELBW infants, included studies had a large number of ELBW infants to assure sceptics of the value of this intervention in a high risk population. Based on the available evidence for probiotics efficacy and safety in preterm infants, the number of infants enrolled, the narrow confidence intervals, and the probiotics safety profile, a change in practice is warranted at this stage. More studies to address the optimal preparation, dosing, and duration of therapy are still needed in head to head comparative studies rather than placebo controlled trials.</P>
<P>Eleven of our included trials were classified as high quality trials based on adequacy of allocation concealment procedures and blinding of the intervention. Although all included trials evaluated probiotics use in preterm infants, the trials were highly variable with regard to enrolment criteria (that is birth weight and gestational age), baseline risk of NEC in the control groups, timing, dose, formulation of probiotic used, and feeding regimens.</P>
<P>Case reports of systemic infections caused by probiotic organisms are found in the biomedical literature. None of our included studies reported this adverse effect. The use of probiotics was described as safe and well tolerated. Our update provides more robust safety data of probiotics utilization in the preterm host.</P>
<P>This review utilized a very thorough and comprehensive search strategy. All attempts were made to minimize potential publication bias. Only randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were included. To minimize the reviewer bias, all steps of this review were conducted independently by the review authors. The validity of our review's results is potentially compromised as the included trials utilized different preparations and dosing regimens of the intervention under study; and data on the highest risk population (ELBW infants) could not be retrieved.</P>
<P>The issue of whether it is time to change practice and adopt the use of probiotics as a standard of care in preterm infants has been widely discussed in the medical literature over the last few years. While some advocate a change in practice based on significant reduction in severe NEC and all cause mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Tarnow_x002d_Mordi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tarnow-Mordi 2010</LINK>), others suggest to wait until precise data on efficacy and safety in ELBW infants are available, in addition to the determination of the most effective preparation and dosing to be utilized (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>). The evidence on probiotics efficacy and safety is substantial compared to other innovative interventions in neonatal medicine such as surfactant, hypothermia, and room air resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-Janvier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janvier 2013</LINK>). We believe that based on the available evidence and in comparison to other effective interventions in neonatal medicine, a change in practice is warranted. Recently, experts and scientific bodies have started to endorse probiotics utilization in the management of preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Downard-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downard 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Janvier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janvier 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Probiotics are not licensed by regulatory authorities in many countries including the United States, and hence the wide availability of these products to the public, ethical questions and concerns could be raised in the adoption of this intervention or in the conduct of more placebo controlled trials. We believe that parents' choice to give or withhold probiotics in the management of preterm infants should be respected. Consent forms of planned or ongoing randomized trials should describe the positive effects of probiotics on severe NEC and mortality and the lack of significant side effects prior to enrolling infants in such trials. Enrolment into a randomized trial should not be a condition to receive probiotics in the

 institutions undertaking these trials (<LINK REF="REF-Janvier-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janvier 2013</LINK>).</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2014-03-29 23:45:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>I read with interest the review by AlFaleh and Bassler. It was a well conducted systematic review that revealed that the use of probiotics in preterm infants significantly reduces the incidence of NEC and death in preterm infants. I am not sure why the authors have concluded that probiotics should only be used for preterm infants with a birth weight greater than 1000 grams. If we assume that the data on birth weight from individual studies are normally distributed, we can surmise from the mean birth weight and standard deviations that approximately 25% of babies included in the studies that contribute to the two main meta-analyses (for the outcomes of severe NEC and mortality) had a birth weight of less than 1000 grams. Only about 3% or less had a birth weight of greater than 1500 grams. The authors conclusions imply that the use of probiotics is supported for infants who are preterm (born at &lt; 37 weeks gestational age) and who had a birth weight of &gt; 1500 grams (less than ~3% of the study population), but is not supported for infants who had a birth weight of &lt;1000 grams (~25% of the study population). The results of the review and its meta-analysis are highly significant, both statistically and clinically. They should be applicable to the population of infants that contributed to the pooled data, i.e., preterm babies who were (almost all) &lt;1500 grams at birth.</P>
<P>The authors should provide justification for their recommendation that extremely low birth weight infants should not be given this intervention that provides a 57% reduction in the risk of death. Also, if further large randomized controlled trial[s] are done they must include assessment of long-term<BR/>neurodevelopmental outcomes, not just important intermediate neonatal outcomes.</P>

<P>We first would like to thank you for your thoughtful comments on our recently published systematic review. Your question/comment was a one that we have thought of and discussed quite extensively prior to the publication of the review.<BR/>
<BR/>Although we agree that the efficacy of the probiotics in prevention of NEC or mortality holds true for the ELBW infant, we could not ensure the safety of this new intervention in a highly vulnerable group with the number of infants enrolled; especially with few cases of probiotics species sepsis reported in the literature.</P>
