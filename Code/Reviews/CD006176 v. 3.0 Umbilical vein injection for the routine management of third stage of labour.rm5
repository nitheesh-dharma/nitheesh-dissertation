<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-10 21:25:02 +0900" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Almost all maternal deaths occur in the developing world. Bleeding during labour is responsible for at least a quarter of these deaths, with the majority due to postpartum haemorrhage. Failure of the muscles of the uterus to contract properly with separation of the placenta is the most common cause of postpartum haemorrhage. One of the leading causes of maternal deaths and prevention of this includes routine use of uterotonic drugs after childbirth before delivery of the placenta. Umbilical vein injection of the drug has been suggested as it provides the treatment directly to the placenta and uterine wall. Higher doses could be used with reduced side-effects. Therapeutic use of the umbilical route of delivering uterotonics has been assessed showing the effectiveness of its use depending upon the amount and content of the infusion. This review included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1118 women and assessed six of these studies (involving 394 women) comparing umbilical vein injection of normal saline with or without oxytocin. Other comparisons did not provide the required information. With umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin versus umbilical vein injection of saline solution there was no evidence of a difference in the amount of blood lost, duration of the third stage of labour or need for manual removal of a retained placenta. routine use of umbilical injection after childbirth to deliver any infusion, though the combined results of the small number of relevant studies showed no evidence of effect and further research is needed to make a conclusion. There is a need for training in the technique and a possible higher cost of materials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-02-10 23:46:37 +0900" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-02-10 23:46:37 +0900" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Global estimates of maternal mortality rates (MMR) show that around 530,000 women die annually across the world because of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The true figure is, however, likely to lie somewhere between 227,000 and 817,000. More dramatic than MMR is the assessment of the risk of dying due to obstetric factors manifested by the lifetime risk of death. This is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with as many as one woman in 16 facing the risk of maternal death in the course of her lifetime, compared with one in 2800 in developed regions (that is, a 175-fold difference), with a worldwide estimate of one in 74. Almost all of these maternal deaths (99%) occur in the developing world, showing one of the greatest differences between poor and rich countries of any health indicator (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among the different causes of maternal death, haemorrhage alone is responsible for at least 25% of these deaths, with the majority due to postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). PPH is therefore the most important maternal complication in labour and puerperium (<LINK REF="REF-AbouZahr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AbouZahr 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, PPH following a vaginal delivery is defined as bleeding from the genital tract of 500 mL or more in the first 24 hours<I>
<B> </B>
</I>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>), although alternative cut-off levels for moderate and severe PPH have also been suggested elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waterstone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterstone 2001</LINK>). Underestimation of blood loss following delivery is a common problem. The diagnosis is usually made subjectively and many cases remain undetected (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 1998</LINK>). When blood loss after delivery is objectively measured, actively managed third stages following vaginal deliveries are associated with 3% to 5% prevalence of severe PPH (loss greater than 1000 mL) (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magann 2005</LINK>) and 14% of moderate PPH (loss greater than 500 mL) (<LINK REF="REF-Gulmezoglu-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulmezoglu 2001</LINK>).<B> </B>Without oxytocics, incidences as high as 51% for moderate PPH and 17% for severe PPH were found in a randomised double-blind controlled trial in Guinea Bissau (compared with 45% and 11% respectively in those given prophylactic misoprostol) (<LINK REF="REF-Hoj-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoj 2005</LINK>). Caesarean deliveries are associated with a prevalence of around 6% of severe PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991b</LINK>). Moderate blood loss is physiological and unlikely to lead to later problems except for women who are already anaemic. The most important consequences include hypovolaemic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathies, renal failure, hepatic failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Bonnar-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonnar 2000</LINK>). In developing countries, poor nutritional status, lack of easy access to treatment, and inadequate intensive care and blood bank facilities are additional contributing factors that lead to the high morbidity and mortality rates in these countries. The lack of a universally accepted definition of PPH means that its exact incidence and the incidence of its complications are unknown.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Aetiology of PPH</HEADING>
<P>Uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH. Other important causes are retained placental fragments, abnormal placentation (including placenta previa, abruptio placentae, placenta accreta, etc), trauma (that is, episiotomy, vulvar/vaginal/cervical lacerations, caesarean section extensions and uterine rupture) and coagulation defects (<LINK REF="REF-Ural-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ural 2000</LINK>). Several predictors (risk factors) of PPH have been identified. Prolonged labour and oxytocin augmentation, prolonged third stage, prior history of PPH, manual removal of placenta, large baby, multiple gestations, maternal obesity, nulliparity, age greater than 35 years, social exclusion and emergency caesarean section, have been found to be associated with an increased risk of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mousa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mousa 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waterstone-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waterstone 2001</LINK>). However, primary PPH still occurs unpredictably in low-risk women.</P>
<P>Although, traditionally, the length of the third stage of labour was not considered a risk factor until it exceeds at least 30 minutes (<LINK REF="REF-Combs-1991c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Combs 1991c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dombrowski-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dombrowski 1995</LINK>), a recent study using objective quantification of blood loss showed a statistically significant increase in PPH when the placenta was not delivered after 18 minutes of the delivery of the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Magann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magann 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Prevention of PPH</HEADING>
<P>Uterotonic drugs are those that increase the uterine tone or contractility, or both. Different agents have been evaluated in several randomised controlled trials and some of them are the subject of published Cochrane systematic reviews (oxytocin, ergometrine-oxytocin, ergot alkaloids, oxytocin agonists and prostaglandins) (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-G_x00fc_lmezoglu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gülmezoglu 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liabsuetrakul-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liabsuetrakul 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Su-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2007</LINK>). Other systematic reviews focused on different interventions for the management of PPH (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Mart_x00ed_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Martí 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2011</LINK>). However, many of the results of this high-quality evidence have not been incorporated into practice (<LINK REF="REF-Festin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festin 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combined effects of uterotonics, and controlled cord traction with countertraction of the uterus, are sometimes summarised by the term 'active management of the third stage'. Early cord clamping is usually included in this definition (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2010</LINK>) but some suggest that it should be considered separately due to its effects on neonatal haematocrit levels (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>).<I>
<B> </B>
</I>It is widely used in clinical practice in the UK, Australia, and several other developed and developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Winter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 2007</LINK>). Expectant management (also known as conservative or physiological management), on the other hand, involves waiting for signs of separation of the placenta and allowing the placenta to deliver spontaneously or aided by gravity or nipple stimulation. It is popular in some northern European countries and in some units in the USA and Canada. It is also the usual practice in domiciliary attendance in the developing world. According to a survey of the WHO in 2003, in 15 countries (<LINK REF="REF-Festin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festin 2003</LINK>) the overall use of the active management is low (25%), and there is a wide variation in the use of the components of the package recommended by WHO and described elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Begley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1996</LINK>), with a range of 0% to 100% in the use of prophylactic oxytocics (overall usage 44%) and 13% to 100% in the practice of controlled cord traction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Umbilical vein injection</HEADING>
<P>Umbilical (or intraumbilical) vein injection (UVI, IUVI) for the <I>treatment</I> of retained placenta was first described by Mojon and Asdrubali in 1826 (<LINK REF="REF-Koerting-1926" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koerting 1926</LINK>). This technique allows the treatment to be directed specifically at the area with the contractile failure. In the early twentieth century, various authors reported on the use of umbilical vein injection of saline solution 0.9% with volumes that have varied widely between 200 mL and 400 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Gabaston-1914" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gabaston 1914</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jarcho-1928" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jarcho 1928</LINK>). Recent studies have concentrated on smaller volumes of umbilical vein injection of 0.9% saline solution plus oxytocin, although most of these were uncontrolled (<LINK REF="REF-Golan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Golan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauksson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauksson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinonen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinonen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neri-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri 1966</LINK>). A Cochrane review of UVI of saline solution plus oxytocin concludes that the use of oxytocin via umbilical vein has little or no effect (<LINK REF="REF-Nardin-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nardin 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Routine umbilical vein injection has been suggested as an alternative way of managing the third stage of labour, as it directs the treatment to the placental bed and uterine wall, resulting in an earlier uterine contraction and placental separation (<LINK REF="REF-Neri-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neri 1966</LINK>). The hydraulic effect of injected solution was considered also to contribute to placental separation by mechanical pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Dahiya-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Dahiya 1995</LINK>). It also allows higher doses to be used, and a reduction of systemic side-effects. Balanced against this is a need for training in the technique and a possible higher cost of materials. There is a wide variety of UVI methods. The efficacy of any method will depend on the volume of fluid injected and the concentration of drug within that fluid as well as the rapidity of transfer of drugs across the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Pipingas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pipingas 1993</LINK>). A pharmacokinetic study showed that oxytocin seems to cross the placenta in both directions by simple diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Malek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malek 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Umbilical vein injection allows the treatment to be directed specifically at the area with the contractile failure, whilst sparing the remainder. The objective is to deliver a solution (with or without the addition of uterotonic agents) directly to the retro-placental myometrium by injecting it into the placental bed via the umbilical vein. Various methods of intraumbilical vein injection have been proposed. Injection of oxytocin diluted in saline solution and injected directly into the umbilical vein is the method most commonly used in clinical trials. Another proposed method suggests that the oxytocin should be diluted in saline solution and injected through a catheter (infant naso-gastric feeding tube) passed along the umbilical vein deep into the placental bed. This has been shown to improve delivery of the dye to the placental bed (<LINK REF="REF-Pipingas-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pipingas 1993</LINK>).The total volume administered was assumed to be varied largely between studies, as was the volume of the uterotonic drug (when used). Finally, different groups of uterotonic agents could be added to either saline solution or plasma expanders to be administered together through the umbilical vein.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to evaluate the available evidence about the possible benefits and risks of this approach. The benefits and risks of different fluids and uterotonic drugs for umbilical vein injection are also evaluated.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and we judged that the trials&#8217; populations and methods were sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was considered as the average range of possible treatment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-02-06 00:30:31 +0900" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the included trials was not good. The available evidence shows that there is no evidence of difference in relevant outcomes in umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin compared with both umbilical vein injection of saline solution and active management of intravenous oxytocin injection.The evidence on umbilical injection of oxytocin injection compared with water after intravenous administration of oxytocin and ergometrine from one trial in Pakistan showed both positive (reduced blood loss and shorter duration of third stage) and negative (increased vomiting and nausea), and it was not able to make a conclusion for clinical practice.</P>
<P>Given the fact that introducing new techniques require further training, which means additional resources required, little evidence found means that routine use of intraumbilical injection of oxytocin or any other solution as a part of third stage management cannot be recommended. However, prophylactic umbilical vein injection of solution with/without oxytocin seems to be assessed in a good number of trials with no major adverse events, and further study on this intervention may be beneficial given the potentially lower systemic effect by the oxytocin.</P>
