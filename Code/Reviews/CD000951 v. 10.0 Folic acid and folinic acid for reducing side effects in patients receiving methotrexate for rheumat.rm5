<TITLE MODIFIED="2013-01-29 15:10:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Folic acid or folinic acid for reducing side effects of methotrexate for people with rheumatoid arthritis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-03-25 15:25:34 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of folic acid or folinic acid for people taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. After searching for all relevant studies, six studies with up to 624 people were included in the review. Their findings are summarized below.</P>
<P>
<B>In people with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate (MTX): </B>
</P>
<P>- Taking either folic or folinic acid probably improves some side effects of MTX such as nausea and abdominal pain</P>
<P>- Taking either folic or folinic acid probably reduces the chance of developing abnormal liver blood tests</P>
<P>- Taking either folic or folinic acid probably helps people continue on their MTX treatment</P>
<P>- Taking either folic or folinic acid may improve some side effects of MTX such as mouth sores</P>
<P>- We are unable to ascertain whether or not taking folic or folinic acid with MTX prevents neutropenia (problems with producing white blood cells)</P>
<P>- Taking folic or folinic acid with MTX probably has no effect on how well MTX is able to treat rheumatoid arthritis.</P>
<P>
<B>What are folic acid and folinic acids and why do people take them with MTX? </B>
</P>
<P>Folic acid and folinic acid are forms of vitamin B9. The human body needs folate to perform many functions, including cell division, growth, and the production of new red blood cells. Folinic acid is chemically different to folic acid but both work in a similar way. If a person does not have enough folic acid or folinic acid, it is called a folate deficiency. MTX (a medication that is commonly prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis) works by blocking some of the effects of folic acid. A folate deficiency may cause side effects such as mouth sores, stomach problems such as nausea or abdominal pain, liver problems or problems with producing blood cells. These side effects are sometimes bad enough that they cause people to stop taking MTX (discontinue treatment).</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimate of what happens to people who take folic acid or folinic acid while on MTX<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>Stomach problems such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain:</P>
<P>- 9 fewer people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea up to 6 to 12 months after starting folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX (9.0% absolute improvement);</P>
<P>- 35 people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea when they took MTX alone for their rheumatoid arthritis;</P>
<P>- 26 people out of 100 experienced stomach problems such as nausea when they took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX.</P>
<P>Liver problems (as measured by abnormal liver blood tests):</P>
<P>- 16 fewer people out of 100 had liver problems up to 6 to 12 months after they starting folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX (16.0% absolute improvement);</P>
<P>- 21 people out of 100 experienced abnormal liver blood tests when they took MTX alone for their rheumatoid arthritis;</P>
<P>- 5 people out of 100 experienced abnormal liver blood tests when they took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX.</P>
<P>Ability to continue on MTX treatment:</P>
<P>- 15 fewer people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid dropped out of the studies for any reason (15.2% absolute improvement);</P>
<P>- 25 people out of 100 who took a placebo (fake folic acid or folinic acid) with their MTX dropped out of the studies for any reason;</P>
<P>- 10 people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX dropped out of the studies for any reason.</P>
<P>Mouth sores or ulcers:</P>
<P>- 6 fewer people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX developed mouth sores (6.2% absolute improvement);</P>
<P>- 22 people out of 100 who took a placebo (fake folic acid) with their MTX developed mouth sores or ulcers;</P>
<P>- 16 people out of 100 who took folic acid or folinic acid with their MTX developed mouth sores or ulcers.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-06-11 11:17:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-17 12:27:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-03-25 15:17:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-03-26 14:16:25 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-03-15 06:39:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We selected all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of &#8804; 7 mg weekly).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-03-25 15:20:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-03-25 15:24:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled.</P>
<P>For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P &lt; 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR<B> </B>0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P &lt; 0.00001).</P>
<P>We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis / mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06)</P>
<P>It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials.</P>
<P>It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-06-11 11:17:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX.</P>
<P>There was a clincally important significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a clincally important significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance.</P>
<P>This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-03-25 16:17:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that can affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks synovial joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can produce diffuse inflammation in the lungs, pericardium, pleura and sclera, and also nodular lesions, which are most common in subcutaneous tissue. Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, autoimmunity plays a pivotal role in both its chronicity and progression, and as such it is considered a systemic autoimmune disease. About 1% of the world's population is afflicted by rheumatoid arthritis, women three times more often than men. Onset is most frequent between the ages of 40 and 50 years, but people of any age can be affected. It can be a disabling and painful condition, which can lead to substantial loss of functioning and mobility if not adequately treated (<LINK REF="REF-Majithia-V-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majithia V 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Methotrexate (MTX) is classified pharmacologically as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Although its exact mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is uncertain, it has become many rheumatologists' first line drug of choice (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 1995</LINK>). The evidence for its efficacy is well documented at least over the short term. MTX has been shown to be efficacious in observational studies, showing short term clinical improvement in 48% to 90% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 1989</LINK>), and in 10% to 70% of participants in placebo-controlled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinblatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinblatt 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1985</LINK>). Three meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suarez_x002d_Almazor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suarez-Almazor 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tugwell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tugwell 1987</LINK>) estimate that a third of the patients show a major improvement. Methotrexate is often used in combination with other disease modifying drugs and biologics (<LINK REF="REF-Katchamart-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katchamart 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maxwell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maxwell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-Sarabia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro Sarabia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2009</LINK>). Felson also compared the benefit-toxicity trade offs of various second line drugs and ranked MTX ahead of azathioprine, sulfasalazine, gold salts and penicillamine (<LINK REF="REF-Felson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felson 1992</LINK>). However, toxicity does prevent many patients from obtaining benefit from the drug. It has been reported that mild toxicity occurs in about 60% of patients, and roughly 7% to 30% of patients discontinue MTX therapy within the first year of treatment due to toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnabel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnabel 1994</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-03-15 06:43:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Folic acid (also known as vitamin B9) has demonstrated health benefits in a variety of areas. Folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolate) is one active form in the group of vitamins known as folates. In contrast to folic acid (which is a synthetic form of folate) folinic acid is one of the forms of folate found naturally in foods. In the body folinic acid can be converted into any of the other active forms of folate.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-03-15 06:41:03 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both MTX dose and length of exposure influence toxicity relating to MTX treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 1995</LINK>). Other predisposing factors include existing folate deficiency, advanced age, cumulative dose, renal insufficiency and concomitant use of other antifolates (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1984</LINK>). Depleted intracellular folate levels have been documented in hepatocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes of MTX treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leeb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeb 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stenger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenger 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stewart-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Stewart 1991</LINK>). Folate deficiency occurs frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and folate stores are further decreased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who receive MTX (<LINK REF="REF-Leeb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leeb 1995</LINK>). Gastrointestinal and haematologic side effects have been related to folate deficiency. Therefore, it could be expected that folate supplementation may reduce side effects associated with MTX therapy.</P>
<P>There has been concern that folate supplementation may reduce the efficacy of, and therefore benefit seen with, MTX if the antirheumatic effects are also mediated through folate antagonism. It has been suggested that since the mechanism of action of MTX in rheumatoid arthritis is not fully known, the beneficial effect of folate supplementation could be the result of a relative reduction of the dose of MTX (<LINK REF="REF-Stenger-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stenger 1992</LINK>). Several open prospective studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine if folate supplementation, with folic acid or folinic acid, has a beneficial effect in reducing the frequency and severity of MTX side effects, and to investigate potential changes to the therapeutic benefit. It is thought folate supplementation could therefore help 'rescue' or reverse the toxic effects of MTX.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-01-17 13:44:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These studies have produced varying estimates of the reduction in adverse effects, ranging from 0% to 50%. Clinicians and patients need to have a 'best estimate' to make informed decisions on whether to use folate supplementation; therefore, a meta-analysis was undertaken.</P>

<P>In the first version of the review, to identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis we performed MEDLINE searches from January 1966 to June 1999. We also searched the Controlled Clinical Trials Register (CCTR) Issue 2, 1999 and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's specialized register. We used the strategy developed by The Cochrane Collaboration as well as the search adopted and modified for the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>This computer search was complemented by the following handsearches: (i) bibliographic references, (ii) Current Contents from June to December 1996, (iii) abstracts of rheumatology meetings from 1993 to 1996: American College of Rheumatology, International League Against Rheumatism, British College of Rheumatologists, Canadian College of Rheumatologists and European League Against Rheumatism, (iv) all issues of the four journals: Journal of Rheumatology, Arthritis and Rheumatism, Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology, and British Journal of Rheumatology from January 1992 to April 1996.</P>
<P>As part of the update of this review, a sensitive search strategy was designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 to March 2012. We did not limit the search by language. We searched the following databases: </P>
<P>1. <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2012, Issue 2<I>,</I> Wiley InterScience (www.thecochranelibrary.com) including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Database of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), HTA database, NHS EED, and the Methods Studies database;</P>
<P>2. MEDLINE (via Ovid), 1999 to February week 4, 2012;</P>
<P>3. MEDLINE® In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (via Ovid), 2 March 2012;</P>
<P>4. EMBASE, 1999 to Week 9 -2012;</P>
<P>5. NIH clinical trials registry Clinical Trials.gov.</P>
<P>The search strategy was devised on Ovid MEDLINE (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) and then adapted for the other databases (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). In all cases the databases were searched from 1999 to 2 March 2012. All references were imported into an EndNote library and tagged with the name of the database. </P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-17 14:01:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Following an a priori protocol, at least two review authors (BS, ZO, WK, MS, TR) independently reviewed the eligibility criteria for abstracts for inclusion in this review. We screened all titles or abstracts generated by the searches for potentially relevant studies based on the following criteria: the type of study; type of participants; type of intervention; and type of outcome measurements. We assessed the full-length articles of the selected titles or abstracts for eligibility (for a full description see 'Criteria for considering studies for this review'). We resolved disagreements by consensus or third-party adjudication.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2013-06-12 10:24:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data were independently extracted by four authors (ZO, BS, WK, MS). Folate supplementation was considered as 'the administration of folic or folinic acid in any dose, and at any time with respect to MTX'. The following gastrointestinal effects were combined (where possible) because of lack of consistency in the reporting and to obtain sufficient events for analysis: abdominal pain, anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting. The incidence of stomatitis as well as the incidence of abnormal serum liver enzymes were analysed independently. The included studies had defined 'abnormal liver function test' differently, and for data extraction purposes we defined 'abnormal' as either aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at least equal to or greater than two times baseline values, or at least two times the upper limit of the reference range used in the study. The following haematologic side effects were included, if reported: cytopenia, macrocytosis, or pancytopenia.</P>
<P>To assess changes in disease activity, the following measurements were considered a priori: swollen joint count, tender joint count, pain, disability score, grip strength, patient's global assessment, and physician's global assessment. Most trials reported swollen and tender joint counts, or indices, and patient global assessments. These were the outcomes finally included for the MTX efficacy analysis. Joint counts included the number of swollen and tender joints, if reported. Alternatively, when the number of involved joints was not reported indices (for example Ritchie index) were included.</P>
<P>A starting dose of &#8804; 7 mg/wk folic or folinic acid was used as a cut off value for studies to be included in the analysis. The aim of this was to exclude studies which gave very high doses of folic or folinic acid. It was felt by the authors that by doing so, it would allow the results of the updated review to provide a better estimate of the effects of folate supplementation at doses currently prescribed in practice. Worldwide guidelines currently support co-administration of folic acid with MTX, and where a dose value is suggested it usually falls in the range of 0.5 to 2 mg daily (<LINK REF="REF-Chakravarty-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chakravarty 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dutch-Society-of-Rheumatology-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch Society of Rheumatology 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GUIPCAR-group-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">GUIPCAR group 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2012</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-03-27 15:10:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assessment of risk of bias was undertaken for each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following seven key domains were assessed by two review authors: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and 'other issues' (comparability of treatment and control group at entry, and appropriateness of duration of surveillance). Pairs of review authors judged the key domains as either 'high risk', 'low risk' or 'unclear' rsk of bias. In cases of disagreement between the review authors, the decision was made by consensus. </P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2013-03-27 15:12:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For each trial, risk ratio and the 95% confidence interval were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. Data analysis employed a standard meta-analysis using methods for continuous data developed by Hedges and Olkin (<LINK REF="REF-Hedges-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hedges 1982</LINK>) and described by Petitti (<LINK REF="REF-Petitti-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petitti 1994</LINK>). Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous outcomes (reporting mean and standard deviation or standard error of the mean). If the scale for each assessment varied among the studies and the mean and standard deviation of the change was provided for the folic and folinic acid arm and control arm, we calculated a standardised mean difference. If the standard deviations of the change scores were not available we used the standard deviation of the baseline score for each group. This provides a conservative estimate of the significance of differences between groups.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-21 10:12:12 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results support the protective effect of folic or folinic supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX. There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of abnormal transaminase elevation as well as a statistically significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason in the population studied. A trend towards a reduction in gastrointestinal side effects and stomatitis was demonstrated and although this did not reach statistical significance the concurrent statistically significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason may indicate that the decrease in these side effects was greatest where the side effects were severe enough to result in MTX withdrawal.</P>
<P>Although the analysis of haematologic side effects was made difficult by small numbers of events and the outcome being poorly reported in included studies, pooled trials reported no statistically significant differences between rheumatoid arthritis patients who received folate supplementation or placebo. The incidence of clinically important cytopenia in patients treated with low dose MTX is estimated to be less than 1% (<A HREF="http://Canadian Pharmaceuticals Association 1996">Canadian Pharmaceuticals Association 1996</A>), and therefore the size of a trial designed to detect any differences would be enormous.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-01-21 10:12:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sample size could potentially be a confounding variable since only one folinic acid study entered more than 40 patients per group. Interestingly, it appears that the benefit shown was greater for trials with higher numbers of patients and overall higher quality. Several authors (<LINK REF="REF-Dijkmans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkmans 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furst 1994</LINK>) have reported that the inverse is usually true with lower quality studies showing greater benefits, suggesting biases from poor design. The finding of a trend in the opposite direction in this meta-analysis is reassuring and indicates the likely validity of the reduction of side effects from folate co-administration.</P>
<P>A concern with meta-analysis is the potential existence of publication bias. It is possible that some trials have been completed that found no benefit of folic or folinic acid supplementation. It is difficult to be more definitive about publication bias in this review but we feel it is unlikely that we would be unaware of negative studies of sufficient size to eliminate the benefit seen in this meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Three studies (excluded from our analysis) have suggested that high dose folinic acid supplementation may reduce the beneficial effects of MTX on rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="STD-Griffith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Griffith 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tishler-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Tishler 1988</LINK>). In a previous version of this review (where these trials were included) there was a difference observed for high dose folinic acid which may have suggested a decrease in benefit of the MTX on the arthritis (an isolated increase in the number of tender joints but not in other clinical variables such as patient global assessment). These results were mostly driven by the study by Joyce et al and in our view are still non-conclusive. We analysed the effect of adding these studies back into our meta-analysis, and even when these studies were added back the overall results did not show a statistically significant decrease in MTX efficacy.</P>
<P>There are no studies that suggest folic acid may alter the efficacy of MTX, despite a folic acid to MTX ratio in some trials higher than the folinic acid to MTX ratio used in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 1991</LINK> which suggested a decrease in MTX efficacy. We did not find any major differences in disease activity between placebo and folic acid at low dosages.</P>
<P>It is possible that the timing of administration of folinic acid and MTX, as well as the folinic acid to MTX ratio, may alter the efficacy of MTX and it should be noted that this question was not possible to include in the design of this review.</P>
<P>Our results support the protective effects of low dose folate supplementation in reducing GI and hepatic side effects of MTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This is consistent with the recommendations by some authors (<LINK REF="REF-Drummond-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drummond 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shiroky-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Shiroky 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1993</LINK>), as well as current prescribing guidelines.</P>
<P>Deciding which of the two forms of folate supplementation should be recommended is more difficult. Experts have differing recommendations, often acknowledging that there is insufficient evidence for advising the use of one compound over the other (<A HREF="http://Borigini 1995">Borigini 1995</A>; <LINK REF="REF-Dijkmans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dijkmans 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furst-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furst 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salach-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salach 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schnabel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schnabel 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinblatt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Weinblatt 1993</LINK>). There is no evidence to date of a significant difference between folic or folinic acid. The results in this meta-analysis were less impressive for folinic acid, but four of the five studies had small sample sizes and the larger study by Shiroky et al did show a benefit.</P>
<P>Given both the efficacy of folic acid in reducing MTX side effects and its low cost compared to folinic acid, the use of folic acid is likely to be the more cost-effective therapy. For folinic acid to be considered cost-effective it must be proven more effective than folic acid at reducing MTX side effects. One study (<LINK REF="REF-Hartman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartman 2004</LINK>) examined the economics of folate supplementation in rheumatoid arthritis patients in detail and concluded that, aside from the differences in cost between folic and folinic acid, potentially the largest impact on overall treatment costs relates to the increased drug survival seen with either agent. If folate supplements can help patients tolerate MTX for longer, it may delay or prevent a change in treatment to a far more expensive biologic agent.</P>
<P>It is unclear whether all patients on MTX, or only those with side effects, should receive folate supplementation. This systematic review cannot address this issue. Most guidelines and texts recommend folate be given to all patients receiving methotrexate. Yet the effects of folic or folinic acid on the development of liver disease are unknown. It has been suggested that supplementation may have a protective effect on the development of liver disease, in which case universal administration could perhaps be considered.<BR/>
</P>
<P>In summary, supplementation with folic or folinic acid in MTX treated rheumatoid arthritis patients provides a reduction in the incidence of abnormal liver function tests and a reduction in overall withdrawal from treatment. There is also a trend towards a reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects and stomatitis. The results of our review do not suggest any clear clinical advantage of one form of folate over the other.</P>

<P>A major problem in synthesising evidence is the lack of uniformity in outcome measures. In 1994, during the Conference on Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT), it was determined that a core set of toxicity measures needed to be established for antirheumatic drugs. This set will allow researchers to compare data across all trials with accurate meta-analyses of toxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Brooks-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brooks 1995</LINK>). Published guidelines also urge investigators to provide simple tabulation of the incidence of adverse events per patient even where indices are used to allow the reader to understand how the index was computed and the extent to which more patients had single or multiple adverse experiences. We also encourage investigators to describe fully the numbers and flow of patients by treatment group throughout the trial and to clearly report the reasons for dropouts for each group. This meta-analysis was hampered by lack of uniformity in the way these items were reported.</P>

<P>In the update of this review, trials that gave high doses of folic or folinic acid (that had been included in previous versions of this review) were excluded from the analysis. This decision was made based on the authors' view that excluding these studies would increase the clinical relevance of the findings by more accurately estimating the effects of folic or folinic acid at doses currently prescribed in practice. Since the last published version of this review, several groups have published guidelines recommending the administration of folate supplements at dosages around 5 to 10 mg/week. Studies examining doses of folic or folinic acid that were significantly higher than this were therefore excluded.</P>

<P>The reduction of MTX toxicity (gastrointestinal, hepatic and haematologic side effects) and the reduction of MTX efficacy (swelling joint count, tenderness joint count, patient global assessment, physician assessment of disease activity, the duration of morning stiffness, grip strength, 50 foot walking time, morning stiffness and HAQ). Side effects relating to toxicity were reported in terms of number of clinic visits at which the side effect occurred, not by number of patients. The number of patients suffering particular side effects were reported when severe enough to result in withdrawal from the study protocol. We used the latter data in the review. We extracted liver enzyme elevation data defined in the study as 'moderate' or 'severe' derangement, which was AST or ALT greater than or equal to 2x the upper limit of the normal range.</P>

<SUP>1</SUP>In 2011 this review was assessed as suitable for a 'streamlined' update search procedure. A Boolean serach of intervention and condition terms was combined with a Randomised Controlled Trial filter from 1999 until June 2011. A Pubmed 'related items' search was also carried out of the 3 largest and 3 most recent included studies from the original review.</P>
<P>During the 2012 review, the search was re-run, and back-dated to follow on from the original search (1999).</P>

<P>Submitted by Joan Chung Yan Ng, B.Sc.(Pharm); Karin Ng, B.Sc.(Pharm); Li-Ching Alice Wang, B.Sc.(Pharm); Elaine Wong, B.Sc.(Pharm).</P>
<P>We certify that we have no affiliations with or involvement in any organisation or entity with a direct financial interest in the subject matter of my criticisms.</P>
<P>***</P>
<P>Dear Editors,</P>
<P>We read with interest the review by Shea et al. regarding folic acid and folinic acid (FA/FNA) for reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis.(1) The authors of this review should be commended for their efforts in compiling the evidence on the effects of folic or folinic acid use in reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis. Withdrawals from methotrexate therapy due to toxicity are very common, so we appreciate the efforts of the authors in compiling the evidence into a review that is very relevant to practice.</P>
<P>After analyzing the review in depth, we identified some issues that we would like to bring to your attention. Our main concern pertains to the outcome of liver toxicity. We understand that the conclusion that FA/FNA decreases methotrexate-induced liver side effects is based on meta-analysis of 4 out of 6 trials included in this review using the surrogate marker of liver transaminases. However, a retrospective analysis found that alterations of liver transaminase levels were not predictive of progressive hepatic changes (confirmed with percutaneous liver biopsy) with long-term methotrexate therapy.(2) Therefore, we do not believe that liver transaminase levels are an appropriate surrogate marker for acute or chronic liver toxicity induced by methotrexate. Given the available evidence, we feel that it cannot be concluded that &#8220;liver side effects&#8221; are decreased; we can only definitively conclude that FA/FNA reduced liver transaminase increase compared to no treatment, and it should be made clear to the reader that it is uncertain whether there is any clinical significance in liver transaminase reduction. Further, we noticed that the study Buckley 1990, which was not included in this liver toxicity analysis, initially outlined a liver transaminase toxicity outcome, but did not report their results.(3) We wonder if you were able to contact the investigators for their unpublished results to include in your meta-analysis. Although the study was very small (n = 20) and would likely have minimal impact on the overall effect, we feel it is still important to include for completeness.</P>
<P>Our next issue pertains to missing data from the trials included. We noted that in the methods of your review, it was described that a sensitivity analysis would be done to deal with missing data; however, there was no further mention of it in the results or discussion sections. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the methodologies of each study were very unclear, and we are generally unsure of the risk of bias in terms of missing data as details were often not reported. For the study that carried the most weight, Van Ede 2001, it was outlined that 18 patients (equally distributed between the three groups) were excluded from analysis after it was discovered that they did not actually meet inclusion criteria. This is concerning to us as we feel that all patients randomized should be included, and it is unclear whether these excluded patients experienced events during the investigation period or how it was dealt with. Using RevMan, we considered a worst-case scenario for the GI upset/nausea outcome in comparing FA/FNA with placebo (Analysis 3.1) by adding back in the 18 patients who were excluded to assess the impact of the missing data. The current forest plot shows a risk ratio of 0.74 (0.59 to 0.92) favouring treatment. Assuming that the 18 patients were distributed evenly between the 3 groups (FA, FNA, and placebo) as described in the report, we added 12 events /12 to the FA/FNA group and 0 events /6 to the placebo group, which changes the risk ratio to 0.81 (0.65 to 1.01). This decreases the benefit that FA/FNA appears to have in improving GI upset/nausea and shifts the overall effect to cross 1. This may be a statistical difference when compared to the initial outcome analysis, but there is likely no clinical significance as GI upset/nausea is extremely subjective, and it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion based on studies with varying designs. The same data manipulation for liver toxicity (Analysis 3.3) and total withdrawal (Analysis 3.4), which both have clear benefit for treatment in the current Cochrane review, has close to no effect on the final overall effect. Therefore, although including this missing data appears to have little impact in the overall analysis, we feel it is important that it still be addressed, and we would encourage you to consider including your sensitivity analyses into the review. </P>
<P>Lastly, we would also would like to request clarification on the rationale for limiting FA/FNA to less than or equal to 7 mg per week. We are aware that guidelines typically recommend folate supplementation of 5 to 10 mg per week (or 0.5 to 2 mg per day) but we are unsure how this threshold of 7 mg was decided for this review. </P>
<P>Thank you again for your work, and we look forward to hearing back from you.</P>

<P>Dear Ms Chung Yan Ng, Ms Ng, MsAlice Wang, Ms Elaine Wong,</P>
<P>Thank you for your letter.</P>
<P>We will respond to each of the issues you raise.</P>
<P>1. <I>We understand that the conclusion that FA/FNA decreases methotrexate-induced liver side effects is based on meta-analysis of 4 out of 6 trials included in this review using the surrogate marker of liver transaminases. However, a retrospective analysis found that alterations of liver transaminase levels were not predictive of progressive hepatic changes (confirmed with percutaneous liver biopsy) with long-term methotrexate therapy.(2) Therefore, we do not believe that liver transaminase levels are an appropriate surrogate marker for acute or chronic liver toxicity induced by methotrexate.

</P>
<P>You are correct that the liver transaminase is a surrogate outcome. Despite some conflicting papers such as the one you mention, the assessment of the American College of Rheumatology is that transaiminases do indeed predict clinical liver damage [<A HREF="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatotoxicity-associated-with-chronic-oral-methotrexate-for-nonmalignant-disease/abstract/25">Saag KG, Teng GG, Patkar NM, et al.

<P>We did attempt to contact the authors of this paper but received no reply. As you point out this will likely have minimal impact on the overall effect.<BR/>

Using RevMan, we considered a worst-case scenario for the GI upset/nausea outcome in comparing FA/FNA with placebo (Analysis 3.1) by adding back in the 18 patients who were excluded to assess the impact of the missing data. The current forest plot shows a risk ratio of 0.74 (0.59 to 0.92) favouring treatment. Assuming that the 18 patients were <BR/>distributed evenly between the 3 groups (FA, FNA, and placebo) as described in the report, we added 12 events /12 to the FA/FNA group and 0 events /6 to the placebo group, which changes the risk ratio to 0.81 <BR/>(0.65 to 1.01). This decreases the benefit that FA/FNA appears to have in improving GI upset/nausea and shifts the overall effect to cross 1. This may be a statistical difference when compared to the initial outcome <BR/>analysis, but there is likely no clinical significance as GI upset/nausea is extremely subjective, and it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion based on studies with varying designs. The same data manipulation for liver toxicity (Analysis 3.3) and total withdrawal (Analysis 3.4), which both have clear benefit for treatment in the current Cochrane review, has close to no effect on the final overall effect. Therefore, although including this missing data appears to have little impact in the overall analysis, we feel it is important that it still be addressed, and we would encourage you to consider including your sensitivity analyses into the review.</I>
</P>
<P>We disagree with this approach. The patients that did not meet the inclusion criteria are by definition inappropriate patients for this study so it would be clinically misleading to include them since it is inappropriate to use data from them for any clinically relevant conclusion. Furthermore there were 6 in each group so it does not introduce an imbalance between groups.<BR/>
<BR/>4. <I>Lastly, we would also would like to request clarification on the rationale for limiting FA/FNA to less than or equal to 7 mg per week. We are aware that guidelines typically recommend folate supplementation of 5 to 10 mg per week (or 0.5 to 2 mg per day) but we are unsure how this threshold of 7 mg was decided for this review.</I>
</P>
<P>We chose this as it reflects the most frequent clinical practice of 1 mg per day.<BR/>
<BR/>Best wishes</P>
