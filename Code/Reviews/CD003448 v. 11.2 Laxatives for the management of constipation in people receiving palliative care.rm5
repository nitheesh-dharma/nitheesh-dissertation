<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with an incurable illness may receive palliative care, which involves making the person as comfortable as possible by controlling pain and other distressing symptoms. People receiving palliative care commonly experience constipation. This is as a result of the use of medicines (e.g. morphine) for pain control, as well as disease, dietary and mobility factors. There is a wide range of laxatives available. The aim of this review was to determine what we know about the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched medical databases for clinical trials of the use of laxatives for constipation in people receiving palliative care. Two review authors assessed study quality and extracted data.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results and quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We identified five studies involving 370 people. The laxatives evaluated were lactulose, senna, co-danthramer combined with poloxamer, docusate and magnesium hydroxide combined with liquid paraffin. Misrakasneham was also evaluated; this is a traditional Indian medicine and is used as a laxative, containing castor oil, ghee, milk and 21 types of herbs.</P>
<P>There was no evidence on which laxative provided the best treatment. However, the review was limited as the evidence was from only five small trials and patient preference and cost were under evaluated. Further rigorous, independent trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of laxatives.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:25:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>This article describes the second update of a Cochrane review on the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. Previous versions were published in 2006 and 2010 where we also evaluated trials of methylnaltrexone; these trials have been removed as they are included in another review in press. In these earlier versions, we drew no conclusions on individual effectiveness of different laxatives because of the limited number of evaluations. This is despite constipation being common in palliative care, generating considerable suffering due to the unpleasant physical symptoms and the availability of a wide range of laxatives with known differences in effect in other populations.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:33:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">

<P>Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. The appropriateness of combining data from the studies depended upon clinical and outcome measure homogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:28:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We identified five studies involving the laxatives lactulose, senna, co-danthramer, misrakasneham, docusate and magnesium hydroxide with liquid paraffin. Overall, the study findings were at an unclear risk of bias. As all five studies compared different laxatives or combinations of laxatives, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. There was no evidence on whether individual laxatives were more effective than others or caused fewer adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:28:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>This second update found that laxatives were of similar effectiveness but the evidence remains limited due to insufficient data from a few small RCTs. None of the studies evaluated polyethylene glycol or any intervention given rectally. There is a need for more trials to evaluate the effectiveness of laxatives in palliative care populations. Extrapolating findings on the effectiveness of laxatives evaluated in other populations should proceed with caution. This is because of the differences inherent in people receiving palliative care that may impact, in a likely negative way, on the effect of a laxative.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Miles-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miles 2006</LINK>), and subsequently in 2010 where trials of methylnaltrexone were also evaluated; these trials have been removed as they are included in another review in press (<LINK REF="REF-Candy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Candy 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are many definitions of constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2011</LINK>). In part, this reflects differences in what is normal; for instance in healthy people the range of bowel evacuations can be from three times a day to three times a week (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>). However, in general, definitions of constipation, including the Rome III Criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Longstreth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Longstreth 2006</LINK>), make reference to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>infrequent, difficult or incomplete bowel evacuation that may lead to pain and discomfort;</LI>
<LI>stools that can range from small, hard 'rocks', to a large bulky mass;</LI>
<LI>a sensation of incomplete evacuation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Constipation can generate considerable suffering, including abdominal pain and distension, anorexia, nausea, general malaise and in faecal impaction, an overflow of diarrhoea. It can also cause headaches, halitosis, restlessness and confusion. There are significant psychological and social consequences that can contribute to a reduction in a person's quality of life. The suffering can be so severe that some people with opioid-induced constipation choose to decrease or even discontinue opioids, thereby preferring to experience inadequate pain control rather than the symptoms of constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The causes of constipation can be classified as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Lifestyle-related, such as having a low-fibre diet, and a poor fluid intake. Physical inactivity can bring about a reduction in abdominal muscle activity and stimulation producing a 'sluggish bowel' (<LINK REF="REF-Winney-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winney 1998</LINK>). In people who are being treated in a healthcare setting, a lack of privacy or environmental factors, or both, such as having to use a bedpan or a commode in a communal area can inhibit bowel function and predispose to constipation in people who are already debilitated.</LI>
<LI>Disease-related for mechanical-anatomical reasons, such as an anal fissure, colitis, diverticular disease, haemorrhoids, hernia and rectocoele. In the common cancers, particularly bowel and ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal symptoms are a frequent complication (<LINK REF="REF-Droney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droney 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dunlop-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunlop 1989</LINK>). There are also metabolic and physiological consequences of various conditions that increase the tendency for constipation, including paraneoplastic hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, obstructed venous outflow with right heart failure and intestinal lymphoedema.</LI>
<LI>Drug-induced, there is a wide range of drugs that have constipation as an adverse effect. These drugs include neurotoxic chemotherapy agents, antiemetics, anticholinergics and diuretics. Good palliative care is predicated on a need to achieve optimal pain control; many of the drugs used to achieve this, such as opioids, cause constipation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Constipation is a common problem in palliative care, where the overall estimated incidence ranges, depending on the definition of constipation used, from 18% to 90% of people (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laugsand-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laugsand 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1998</LINK>). The causes in this population are often multifactorial relating to poor dietary intake, physical inactivity, disease and treatment related. For people receiving palliative care receiving opioid treatments, the estimates of the incidence of constipation are even higher: from 72% (<LINK REF="REF-Droney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droney 2008</LINK>) to 87% of people (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Prevention and management of constipation relates to cause. People receiving palliative care are at risk of developing constipation as a result of changes in their lifestyle. These are attributable to disease progression and are unlikely to be readily resolved. However, given that constipation for the majority of people receiving palliative care has the potential to be drug-induced, management to promote satisfactory bowel movements commonly involves some form of pharmaceutical administration, of which the first line of recommended treatment is commonly a laxative (<LINK REF="REF-Caraceni-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caraceni 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scottish-Palliative-Care-Guidelines-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a wide range of laxatives that work by softening faecal matter or through direct stimulation of peristalsis, or both. Laxatives are generally classified according to their mode of action: bulk-forming laxatives, osmotic laxatives, stimulant laxatives, and faecal softeners and lubricants. Widely used laxatives are the stimulant preparations: these include senna, bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate and wheat bran. In a survey in Spain, the most commonly prescribed was lactulose (<LINK REF="REF-Noguera-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noguera 2010</LINK>). The authors suggest this is because of ease of dosing, its sweet taste and that it is often freely available through prescription, thereby requiring less financial burden to the person.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Laxatives work in various ways. Bulk-forming laxatives involve the absorption of large amounts of fluids. This incurs a stretch reflex on the intestinal wall, which results in reflexive, propulsive activity, leading to bowel movement. These types of laxatives are not ordinarily recommended in palliative care, as people may not maintain a necessary adequate fluid intake to avoid intestinal obstruction or faecal impaction. Osmotic laxatives increase water content and thereby the softness and volume of the stool. Besides lactulose, osmotic laxatives include polyethylene glycol, sorbitol and magnesium citrate. Stimulant laxatives induce propulsive motility. Individually, within these mode of action groups, laxatives work in different ways.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bisacodyl works after bacterial hydrolysis in the intestines.</LI>
<LI>Sodium picosulfate and senna only after hydrolysis in the large intestine (colon).</LI>
<LI>Lactulose is fermented in the intestine producing carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which results in acidification of the stool. Due to irritation of the colon wall this promotes peristalsis (<LINK REF="REF-Droney-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Droney 2008</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Laxatives are an accepted treatment in constipation. Reviewing the evidence base to support their use is necessary to compare and assess individual laxatives in terms of effect and harm, as well as a person's preference and cost. There are published clinical practice recommendations in palliative care that have been informed by earlier versions of this review including those from the European Palliative Care Association (<LINK REF="REF-Caraceni-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caraceni 2012</LINK>). It is timely to update this review as the last search was undertaken in 2010.</P>
<P>It is important to highlight that there are other reviews on laxatives in other populations that have identified multiple trials, of note is one Cochrane review on lactulose in comparison with polyethylene glycol for chronic constipation (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Robichaud-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Robichaud 2010</LINK>). This review concluded on the basis of evidence from 10 trials that polyethylene glycol should be used in preference to lactulose. In extrapolating them to a palliative care population, these results must be treated with care as they came from studies whose populations are different. Moreover, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of laxatives in palliative care populations, because of the differences inherent in this group that may impact, in a likely negative way, on the effect of a laxative. In particular, the multifactorial pathophysiology of constipation in people with advanced disease. This includes but is not limited to the impact of disease progression, that certain terminal illnesses have a rapid course, that people may have from co-morbidities, have multiple organ failure, have increasing frailty, reduced liquid and food intake, and may be receiving various treatments including multiple different drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 2014</LINK>). People receiving palliative care may also have a higher risk than other populations of experiencing adverse effects from the laxatives used.</P>
<P>Sincethe mid-2000s, mu-opioid antagonists, such as methylnaltrexone have been developed and have been recommended as an alternative to laxatives. These drugs are generally only recommended when traditional laxatives have failed (<LINK REF="REF-Caraceni-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caraceni 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scottish-Palliative-Care-Guidelines-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines 2014</LINK>). A separate Cochrane review on mu-opioids antagonists in people receiving palliative care is in press.</P>

The studies were undertaken in Canadian, British, Spanish and Indian populations. All participants were at an advanced stage of disease and were cared for within a palliative care setting. All participants had a cancer diagnosis, apart from four participants (5% of sample) in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tarumi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tarumi 2013</LINK>).

Another study used an active control of placebo and senna (<LINK REF="STD-Tarumi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tarumi 2013</LINK>). All studies measured laxation response and adverse effects.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Co-danthramer plus poloxamer versus senna plus lactulose</HEADING>
<P>One cross-over study of 51 participants evaluated the effectiveness of co-danthramer plus poloxamer versus senna plus lactulose (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991a</LINK>). Both laxatives were in a liquid format. Neither dosage nor details of the data analyses were reported in full. The study analysed laxation response according to opioid use. <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> details findings reported.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laxation response</HEADING>
<P>The trialists report that the 17 participants receiving 80 mg or more of a strong opioid analgesia (either diamorphine or morphine) "had a significantly higher stool frequency when taking lactulose plus senna than while receiving co-danthramer, P &lt; 0.01". The study reported no statistical difference for the other participants receiving either a lower dose of opioid or no opioid. For participants' assessments of bowel function, they reported no statistical difference between laxatives.</P>

<P>The study did not evaluate constipation-associated symptoms.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acceptability and tolerability</HEADING>
<P>Diarrhoea resulted in suspension of laxative therapy for 24 hours for 15 participants while taking senna plus lactulose and for five participants while taking co-danthramer plus poloxamer. The trialists reported that six instances of diarrhoea occurred at opioid doses of at least 80 mg/day while taking senna plus lactulose and none occurred while taking co-danthramer plus poloxamer. Two participants reported perianal soreness and burning while taking co-danthramer plus poloxamer. Participant preference was similar between the trial arms (15 for senna plus lactulose and 14 for co-danthramer plus poloxamer), although they reported more participants disliked the flavour of co-danthramer plus poloxamer compared with senna plus lactulose.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin versus senna plus lactulose</HEADING>
<P>One unpublished cross-over trial involved 118 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991b)</LINK>. It evaluated the effectiveness of</P>
<UL>
<LI>one week of magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin (mean dose per cross-over group 45 mL if taken in first week and 49 mL daily if taken in second week), versus</LI>
<LI>one week of senna plus lactulose (mean dose per cross-over group of 34 mL if taken in the first week and 38 mL daily if taken in the second week).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Forty-two of the 118 participants completed the trial. Results were not analysed in terms of whether different opioid doses influenced laxative results. <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> details findings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laxation response</HEADING>
<P>No difference was reported in laxation response between the cross-over groups. The findings did not change by dose of opioid or by the order given in the cross-over of senna plus lactulose with magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin. They reported that the dosage of magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin required to achieve the same frequency of bowel movements was significantly higher than the dosage required with senna plus lactulose. Using data from the pre-cross-over week, there was no significant difference in participants' perception of being constipated, or normality of bowel function. At the end of the trial, 54% of participants considered their bowel movements were normal.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Need for additional laxatives</HEADING>
<P>Participants in both groups required rescue laxatives. They reported that a significantly greater proportion of participants needed rescue laxatives while taking senna plus lactulose compared with magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Acceptability and tolerability</HEADING>
<P>There was no significant difference between treatments in participants reporting diarrhoea. In both groups, one participant found the treatment intolerably nauseating. One participant, while taking senna plus lactulose, experienced gripping abdominal pain. More participants preferred senna plus lactulose rather than magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Misrakasneham versus senna</HEADING>
<P>One small study of 36 participants evaluated the effectiveness of up to 10 mL of misrakasneham versus senna 24 to 72 mg (both in liquid format) over two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ramesh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ramesh 1998</LINK>). Participants in the trial were taking various doses of morphine but results were not analysed in terms of whether different opioid dose influenced laxative results. <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK> details the findings.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laxation response</HEADING>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Senna versus lactulose</HEADING>
<P>One study of 75 participants evaluated the effectiveness of lactulose 10 mg to 40 mg versus senna 12 mg to 48 mg (both laxatives were in liquid format) over four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Agra-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Agra 1998</LINK>). Doses of the laxatives were increased according to clinical response; the study authors do not provide details on mean doses.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laxation response</HEADING>
<P>There was no statistical difference between the senna and the lactulose groups in laxation response, in defecation-free periods and in the mean number of defecation days (senna: mean 8.9 days, SD 6.6; lactulose: mean 10.6 days, SD 7.3).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Docusate plus senna versus placebo plus senna</HEADING>
<P>One study of 74 participants evaluated docusate plus senna (sennosides) versus an active control of placebo plus senna over 10 days (<LINK REF="STD-Tarumi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Tarumi 2013</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Laxation response</HEADING>
<P>The study reported no statistical difference in laxation between docusate plus senna and placebo plus senna. This was in volume, difficulty and completeness of defecation, and having a bowel movement on 50% of the study days (where for instance the OR was 0.52 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.57)). Using the Bristol Stool chart, there was a significant difference (P value = 0.001) in stool consistency between the trial arms; with more participants in the placebo plus senna group having Type 4 (smooth and soft) or Type 5 (soft blobs) stools, and more participants in the docusate plus senna group having Type 3 (sausage like) or Type 6 (mushy) stools.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Need for additional laxatives</HEADING>
<P>At least one type of additional laxative was given to 74% of participants in the placebo plus senna group and 68.6% of participants in the docusate plus senna group. The difference was not significant (P value = 0.77).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>This review is the second update of a Cochrane review on the effectiveness of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. Previous versions were published in 2006 and 2010 where we also evaluated trials of methylnaltrexone; we have removed these trials as they are included in another review in press. This current review sought to determine the effectiveness of the administration of laxatives for the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. We included five studies, four of which were identified in the earlier review. Studies either compared the effectiveness of two different laxatives, or compared the laxative with an active control.</P>
<P>No differences in effectiveness were demonstrated in:</P>
<UL>
<LI>lactulose compared with senna;</LI>
<LI>senna plus lactulose compared with magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin;</LI>
<LI>misrakasneham compared with senna;</LI>
<LI>docusate plus senna compared with placebo plus senna.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In one study, there were mixed findings on senna plus lactulose compared with co-danthramer plus poloxamer (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991a</LINK>). There was a significant difference (P value &lt;0.01) in the subgroup of 17 participants receiving strong opioid analgesia that favoured senna plus lactulose compared with co-danthramer plus poloxamer in stool frequency and overall participants took fewer rescue medications (9/51 in senna plus lactulose group compared with 19/51 in co-danthramer plus poloxamer group). However, there was no difference between the laxatives in participants' overall assessment of their bowel function.</P>
<P>Four studies report that a few (one to three) participants experienced adverse effects. The most common adverse effects were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. In the study comparing senna plus lactulose with magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin, one participant from each group withdrew because of intolerable nausea and gripping abdominal pain.</P>
<P>Participant preferences were reported in two studies; one study showed a preference for senna plus lactulose over magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991b</LINK>). The other study found no difference in preference between misrakasneham and senna (<LINK REF="STD-Ramesh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ramesh 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all included studies, a number of participants remained constipated and were given rescue laxatives. None of the studies explored differences between responders and non-responders in follow-up characteristics, such as disease progression or drug use (in particular opioids).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Our review findings are limited. The studies were few, and were overall of unclear risk of biased findings. The studies involved small sample sizes and the two cross-over trials did not involve a washout period between testing the effect of the different treatments. There was limited overlap in which laxative was evaluated, this prevented their results being combined in an analysis. Participant preference was under-explored. Only one new trial was completed since the last search in 2010. However, there is perhaps little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to sponsor evaluations in established treatments such as laxatives and in the relatively small group of people in palliative medicine (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2012</LINK>). Laxatives are extensively used in this patient group but there remains little known about the differences in effect and adverse events between the laxatives available. It is unknown whether some laxatives may be more suitable for certain people receiving palliative care than other people.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>There were issues in the quality of the evidence. Sample sizes of most studies (four of five) were likely to be under-powered to find a true effect as they involved fewer than 100 participants. Studies also had some methodological limitations; in three studies, double-blinding was not possible because the drugs differed in presentation (<LINK REF="STD-Ramesh-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ramesh 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991b</LINK>); in two studies, there was a high attrition rate of over 50% (<LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sykes-1991b" TYPE="STUDY">Sykes 1991b</LINK>). However, given this was a palliative care population, attrition of this magnitude is not unusual.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>We limited inclusion to studies that specified that their participants were in palliative care or at an advanced stage of a disease. This is likely to have led to a loss of data, as studies we excluded may have included people with advanced disease but the authors did not provide details on disease stage.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>There is one larger Cochrane review on laxatives, which is within the general adult population (<LINK REF="REF-Lee_x002d_Robichaud-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee-Robichaud 2010</LINK>). It sought to determine whether lactulose or polyethylene glycol is more effective at treating chronic constipation and faecal impaction. The authors were able to combine the findings of some of the 10 eligible trials in various meta-analyses. They found that polyethylene glycol was better than lactulose in outcomes of stool frequency and form, and the need for rescue laxatives.</P>
<P>No trials of polyethylene glycol were identified in people receiving palliative care. The findings from reviews in non-palliative care populations are informative. However, it is important to evaluate laxatives in palliative care populations because of the differences inherent in this group that will impact, in a likely negative way, on the effect of a laxative. In particular, people receiving palliative care may differ from other populations in regards to the multifactorial pathophysiology of constipation, the rapid course of their illness, the presence of multiple organ failure, increased frailty, reduced food intake and higher rates of polypharmacy. People receiving palliative care may also have a higher risk of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2012</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>In this second update, the conclusions on the effectiveness of laxatives remain unchanged.</P>
<P>The review cannot provide any information on what may be the optimal laxative management for constipation in people receiving palliative care. The randomised controlled trials included in this review did not show any differences in effectiveness of three commonly used laxatives; senna, docusate and lactulose. However, these studies are subject to bias and low power. None of the studies evaluated the effectiveness of polyethylene glycol in this population.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-05-10 07:31:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="bridget Candy">
<P>Rigorous and independent randomised controlled trials measuring standardised and clinically relevant outcomes in a clearly defined population are needed to establish the effectiveness of laxatives in the management of constipation in people receiving palliative care. To help distinguish between different laxatives there is a need to include measures on tolerability, quality of life, participant preference and costs.</P>
<P>High attrition rates in the included studies and the relatively small numbers of eligible participants in any one palliative care unit suggest that any trial of laxative efficacy should be multicentred.</P>
