<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-10-20 17:23:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We summarized trials that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of mefloquine when used to prevent malaria in people travelling to areas where the disease is widespread. We searched for relevant studies up to 22 June 2017 and included 20 randomized trials that involved 11,470 participants, 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants) and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants).</P>
<P>
<B>What are the concerns about mefloquine and what are the alternatives?</B>
</P>
<P>Mefloquine is often prescribed to prevent malaria during travel to areas where the disease is widespread. However, there is controversy about the safety of mefloquine, especially when prescribed for military personnel in stressful situations, and there have been reports of depression and suicide.</P>
<P>The only commonly-used alternative drugs are doxycycline (which can cause skin problems and indigestion) and atovaquone-proguanil (which is often more expensive).</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says </B>
</P>
<P>Mefloquine appears to be a highly effective drug to reduce the risk of malaria (<I>low-certainty evidence</I>), however, evidence did not come from short-term international travellers.</P>
<P>Mefloquine has not been shown to have more frequent serious side effects than either atovaquone-proguanil (<I>low-certainty evidence</I>) or doxycycline (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>People who take mefloquine are more likely to stop taking the drug due to side effects than people who take atovaquone-proguanil (<I>high-certainty evidence),</I> but may be equally as likely to stop as people who take doxycyline (<I>low-certainty evidence).</I>
</P>
<P>People taking mefloquine are more likely to have abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety and depressed mood during travel than people who take atovaquone-proguanil (<I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>) or doxycyline (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>). Doxycycline users are more likely to have dyspepsia, photosensitivity, vomiting, and vaginal thrush (<I>very</I> <I>low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-10-20 17:34:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (<A HREF="https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm">https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm</A>); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; <A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</A>) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home</A>) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-10-24 12:34:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-10-24 12:35:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-10-20 17:35:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses.</P>
<P>
<I>Mefloquine efficacy</I>
</P>
<P>Of 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).</P>
<P>In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants).</P>
<P>
<I>Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil </I>
</P>
<P>Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; <I>high-certainty evidence</I>). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).</P>
<P>One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, <I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, <I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, <I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, <I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (<I>high-certainty evidence</I>) and dizziness (<I>high-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood.</P>
<P>
<I>Mefloquine safety versus doxycycline</I>
</P>
<P>No difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (<I>low-certainty evidence</I>) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; <I>low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, <I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, <I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, <I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, <I>very low-certainty evidence</I>). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.</P>
<P>Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, <I>low certainty-evidence</I>), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, <I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, <I>very</I> <I>low-certainty evidence</I>), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, <I>very</I> <I>low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.</P>
<P>Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-10-24 14:48:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).</P>
<P>The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 09:39:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Maya Tickell-Painter">
<P>Malaria is a parasitic protozoal infection which is usually transmitted through the bite of female <I>Anopheles</I> mosquitoes (<LINK REF="REF-Warrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warrell 2002</LINK>). It is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. Clinical disease is caused by infection of red blood cells by one of four <I>Plasmodium </I>species: <I>P. falciparum</I>, <I>P. vivax</I>,<I> P. ovale</I>, and<I> P. malariae </I>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>)<I>. </I>Humans can also become infected by forms of malaria that usually infect animals, such as<I> P. knowlesi </I>(<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>). Clinical presentation is nonspecific and varied; symptoms include fever, chills, headache, diarrhoea, muscle cramps, and abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). Severe disease is usually caused by infection with <I>P. falciparum</I>, but can also occur following infection with <I>P. vivax </I>and <I>P. knowlesi.</I> Host factors determining severity include genetics, host immune status, and age (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The true global incidence and prevalence of malaria is difficult to determine; the highest disease burden occurs in sub-Saharan Africa where vital registration and disease notification systems are weak (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 2014</LINK>). However, the latest World Health Organization (WHO) figures estimate 212 million new cases of malaria in 2015 leading to 429,000 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2016</LINK>). Around 125 million travellers visit malaria-endemic areas annually, and all need to take steps to prevent infection with malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Croft-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croft 2005</LINK>). Each year there are between 10,000 and 30,000 known cases of malaria in returned travellers, but the real figure is likely to be higher due to under-reporting (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>The individual risk of acquiring malaria is determined by the host immune status, the area travelled to, the duration of travel and season, and the use of prevention measures. Pregnant women, young children and non-immune travellers are particularly vulnerable to severe disease if they become infected (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2015</LINK>). In Europe, the incidence of malaria is higher in people who travel to their country of origin to visit friends and relatives than in tourists (<LINK REF="REF-Behrens-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrens 2015</LINK>). However, mortality is higher in tourists (<LINK REF="REF-Behrens-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behrens 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The natural life cycle of malaria involves the consecutive infection of two hosts: female <I>Anopheles</I> mosquitoes and humans (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2015a</LINK>). The female mosquito acquires the disease when taking a blood meal from an infected human host. It will then become infectious over a period of 10 to 14 days depending on the region. Sporozoites are injected into the human host the next time the mosquito feeds. These travel via the blood stream to the liver and develop into schizonts which then rupture releasing merozoites. Merozoites invade erythrocytes and undergo asexual replication. Some of these develop through ring stage trophozoites into schizonts which rupture releasing further merozoites and thus perpetuate the infection. Others will develop into female and male gametocytes which are ingested by <I>Anopheles</I> mosquitoes during a blood meal leading to the spread of disease.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-10-16 09:39:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Maya Tickell-Painter">
<P>Mefloquine has been available for use in Europe since 1985 and the USA since 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 1999</LINK>). Alongside atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline, it is considered standard chemoprophylaxis by many international health guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PHAC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHAC 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PHE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mefloquine belongs to the aryl amino acid group of antimalarial agents. Mefloquine has a long half life and is given as a weekly dose of 250 mg when used for prophylaxis in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>). Mefloquine is effective against all five strains of malaria known to affect humans. Although guidelines vary, many state that mefloquine should be taken for two to three weeks before travel and continued for four weeks following return (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are several situations in which mefloquine is potentially advantageous. All guidelines recommend that where avoidable pregnant women should not travel to areas where malaria is endemic (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>). However, where travel is essential, mefloquine is often the preferred option. Mefloquine is widely considered to be safe within the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and guidelines increasingly recommend its use in the first trimester (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>). Mefloquine is suitable for both children who weigh more than 5 kg and breastfeeding mothers (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Doxycycline has restrictions on its use during pregnancy due to effects on skeletal development found in animal studies. The use of atovaquone-proguanil is limited by a lack of evidence for safety (<LINK REF="REF-PHE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHE 2015</LINK>). Chloroquine-proguanil is considered safe for pregnant women, but its use is limited by widespread resistance (<LINK REF="REF-PHAC-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHAC 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The main side effects of mefloquine are gastrointestinal, neurological and psychological. Psychological side effects vary from those considered to be very common (including insomnia and abnormal dreaming) to those with unknown frequency (including psychosis and suicidal ideation) (<LINK REF="REF-eMC-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">eMC 2015a</LINK>). Existing drug labels suggest that these side effects are both prodromal and dose related (<LINK REF="REF-eMC-2015a" TYPE="REFERENCE">eMC 2015a</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-10-16 09:39:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Maya Tickell-Painter">
<P>Malaria chemoprophylaxis is defined as the use of antimalarial medication to prevent the clinical symptoms of malaria (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>). This is because no drugs are able to prevent the introduction of infection by destroying the sporozoites injected by the female <I>Anopheles </I>mosquito. Chemoprophylaxis is one of several tools used to prevent malaria; other recommended measures include sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, wearing insecticide-treated clothing, and applying chemical repellent sprays to the skin surface (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>). None of these methods provide complete protection and a combination of approaches is advised.</P>
<P>Chemoprophylaxis works by blocking the development or reproduction of the malaria parasite at various stages in its life cycle:</P>
<UL>
<LI>doxycycline and mefloquine are examples of suppressive prophylactics and act in the blood stream as the schizonts invade erythrocytes. Doxycycline therefore needs to be taken for at least one month after returning from endemic areas (<LINK REF="REF-Shanks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shanks 2005</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>atovaquone-proguanil and primaquine have effects on the early liver stages of <I>Plasmodium</I> spp and prevent the progression to blood stage parasites which cause clinical illness. These agents therefore only need to be taken for one week after leaving the malaria-endemic area (<LINK REF="REF-Shanks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shanks 2005</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Currently, the baseline efficacy of doxycycline, atovaquone-proguanil and mefloquine when used as prophylaxis to prevent malaria is thought to be similar. Most guidelines therefore recommend selecting appropriate antimalarial prophylaxis based on individual choice, pre-existing conditions, side effect profile, and drug resistance patterns in the destination country (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2015b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PHE-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">PHE 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2017</LINK>). Drug resistance to all antimalarial agents is a growing concern, and mefloquine resistance has been reported in some areas of north-western Thailand (<LINK REF="REF-Treiber-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treiber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treiber-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treiber 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the efficacy of all forms of malaria prevention is impeded by adherence. Nearly all cases of fatal malaria in travellers occur due to non-adherence with prophylactic measures (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>). However, this needs to be balanced against the tolerability and safety of chemoprophylaxis; the frequency of mild to moderate adverse drug reactions varies from 32% to 45% (<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf--2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2003</LINK>). Both policy makers and individual travellers need to balance carefully the risk benefit profile of contracting malaria against using chemoprophylaxis.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-10-20 17:31:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mefloquine has long been associated with neurological and psychological side effects which range from mild headaches and dizziness to reports of suicide and psychosis. The frequency and severity of these outcomes has been debated. In 2013 the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a safety communication regarding potential long-term and significant neurological and psychiatric side effects of mefloquine (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2013</LINK>). This included the addition of a boxed warning to the drug label, the most serious form of warning that can be issued. Similarly in Europe in 2014 the European Medicine Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) required a change to the summary of product characteristics noting that "...in a small number of patients it has been reported that neuropsychiatric reactions (for example, depression, dizziness or vertigo and loss of balance) may persist for months or longer, even after discontinuation of the drug" (<LINK REF="REF-EMA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMA 2014</LINK>). This has been incorporated into summaries of product characteristics throughout Europe. Most recently the UK Defence Committee has suggested mefloquine should only be used as a drug of last resort (<LINK REF="REF-UK-Parliament-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">UK Parliament 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>Previous reviews on this topic have limited analyses to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (<LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2015</LINK>). However, RCTs are not always the optimal study design to determine the type, prevalence or nature of adverse events and adverse effects, and many set inclusion criteria which exclude groups of people who are likely to be affected (<LINK REF="REF-Loke-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2007</LINK>). In addition, adverse effects are often the primary outcome measure of non-randomized trials, meaning that researchers may attempt to capture and define adverse events in a more rigorous manner than when they are a tertiary measure (<LINK REF="REF-Loke-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loke 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review update broadened study inclusion criteria to include non-randomized studies that provide useful information regarding the side effect profile of mefloquine.</P>

<P>This new edition replaces the Cochrane Review on mefloquine for preventing malaria in non-immune adult travellers (<LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2015</LINK>). Malaria prophylaxis in children living in endemic areas, chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women, and malaria prevention in people with sickle cell disease have been assessed in other Cochrane Reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Meremikwu-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meremikwu 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oniyangi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oniyangi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radeva_x002d_Petrova-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radeva-Petrova 2014</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized and pre-piloted data collection form. When available we extracted data on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>details of study: start and end dates, setting (country of recruitment and country of malaria exposure), study design, method of participant recruitment and selection, number of participants enrolled, number of participants for whom data was available, mean duration of exposure to malaria, antimalarial resistance pattern of mefloquine and the comparator;</LI>

</UL>
<P>We resolved any disagreements through discussion, and where necessary we consulted a third review author<I>. </I>If clarification was necessary, we attempted to contact the trial authors for further information.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number analysed in each group. For continuous outcome data, we extracted arithmetic means and standard deviations for each group together with the numbers analysed in each group. We also extract medians and ranges where provided.</P>
<P>We extracted details of all serious adverse events and effects. For non-serious adverse events and effects we sought information on the following specific symptoms and groups of symptoms which are frequently associated with mefloquine, doxycycline or atovaquone-proguanil:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ear and labyrinth disorders: vertigo;</LI>
<LI>eye disorders: visual impairment;</LI>

<LI>psychiatric disorders: abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, depression, psychosis; and</LI>
<LI>skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritis, photosensitivity, vaginal candida.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We also reported data on all other very common (&gt; 1/10) and common (&gt; 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) adverse events and adverse effects, as defined by the electronic Medicines Compendium (<LINK REF="REF-eMC-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">eMC 2015b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where possible we attempted to derive absolute estimates of adverse outcomes (events or effects). For all adverse outcomes, we included only the denominator trials that actively reported the presence or absence of each specific adverse event or effect.</P>
<P>Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms rather than formal medical diagnoses. Therefore, we reported outcomes as symptoms. For example, we reported on 'depressed mood' rather than 'depression'.</P>
<P>When deciding which relative effect measure to present in 'Summary of findings' tables, we considered which meta-analysis most closely answered our PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome/s) question. We created a decision tree in advance to assess the directness of a group of studies in relation to: the population studied (short-term international travellers versus other populations), outcomes measured (adverse effects versus adverse events), and study design (RCTs versus cohort studies). The intervention and comparator were fixed in each drug-pair comparison. Other less direct meta-analyses were used in our appraisal of the certainty of the evidence. The decision tree used is provided in <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>.</P>
<P>Conventionally, 'Summary of findings' tables include up to seven outcomes. However, the key questions for clinical decision making relate to adverse effects, and therefore limiting the number of outcomes a priori was problematic, as we could not know in advance which adverse effects mefloquine would have. To constrain the number of outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' tables to seven would mean only reporting outcomes where effects were shown, which would lead to selective reporting.</P>
<P>We included 'Summary of findings' tables for comparisons of mefloquine with doxycycline and atovaquone-proguanil. This decision was made because chloroquine is used less frequently than mefloquine, doxycyline and atovaquone-proguanil. As reported in <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>, the adverse effect profile of mefloquine in comparison to chloroquine was consistent with comparisons with doxycycline and atovaquone-proguanil.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study. For randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials we used Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We followed the guidance for making judgements on the risk of bias in five domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding (of participants, personnel and outcome assessors); incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting and other risk of bias. We categorized these judgements as low risk of bias, high risk of bias, or unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>For non-randomized (cohort) studies we assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (now referred to as ROBINS-I) (<LINK REF="REF-ACROBAT_x002d_NSRI-tool" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACROBAT-NSRI tool</LINK>). We followed the guidance for making judgements on the risk of bias in eight domains: confounding, selection of participants into the study, measurement of interventions, departures from intended interventions, missing data, selection of the reported result and other risk of bias. We categorized these judgements as low risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, serious risk of bias and critical risk of bias. Where no information was provided on a category, this was stated. The criteria we used to make specific judgements are provided in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>For adverse events and adverse effects, we assessed the risk of bias in the conduct of the study by examining whether harms were predefined using standardized or precise definitions, ascertainment methods were adequately described, monitoring was active or passive and data collection was prospective or retrospective (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).

<P>We included 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (11,470 participants), 35 cohort studies (190,286 participants) and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants).</P>
<P>Efficacy outcomes were reported in 14 RCTs conducted between 1977 and 2003 in Thailand (four trials), Brazil, Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Nigeria, Kenya and two studies which included travellers to various destinations (10,710 participants). Two were conducted in short-term international travellers (<LINK REF="STD-Overbosch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Overbosch 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schlagenhauf-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schlagenhauf 2003</LINK>); nine involved general populations living in endemic areas who are likely to have some immunity to malaria (<LINK REF="STD-Boudreau-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boudreau 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bunnag-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bunnag 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salako-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Salako 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sossouhounto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sossouhounto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steketee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steketee 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1995</LINK>), two recruited non-immune military personnel (<LINK REF="STD-Arthur-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arthur 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohrt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohrt 1997</LINK>), and one recruited a mixed military and civilian semi-immune population (<LINK REF="STD-Santos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>All 20 included RCTs and 35 cohort studies reported safety outcomes. Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed 'symptoms', rather than formal medical diagnoses. Consequently, when describing these data we used non-medical descriptions such as 'depressed mood' rather than 'depression', even where the trial authors described the symptom as depression. However, four retrospective cohort studies analysed healthcare records (<LINK REF="STD-Eick_x002d_Cost-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Eick-Cost 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meier-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Meier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wells-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wells 2006</LINK>) and looked for people with formal mental health diagnoses. Where outcomes were presented grouped by organ system, we approached study authors for additional data and received full data sets for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korhonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Korhonen 2007</LINK>) and additional information from another two (<LINK REF="STD-Kato-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Kato 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonmez-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Sonmez 2005</LINK>).</P>

Five cohort studies included long-term occupational travellers (UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office Staff and Peace Corps volunteers) (13,211 participants); four RCTs (961 participants) and six cohort studies (6588 participants) included military personnel (including 1 study with a mixed military and civilian population).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>Mefloquine is highly efficacious in reducing clinical cases of malaria compared to placebo, although there were important differences among trials, particularly regarding the dose of mefloquine used, populations studied and the risk of malaria in the control group (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). The risk of malaria was highest in the trial in military personnel travelling to Indonesia, described as "largely non-immune", where 53/65 (81%) of those in the placebo group had an episode of malaria compared to 0/67 (0%) with mefloquine (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16; <LINK REF="STD-Ohrt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ohrt 1997</LINK>, 126 participants). In the remaining trials the risk of malaria with placebo ranged from 1% to 59% (<LINK REF="STD-Bunnag-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bunnag 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salako-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Salako 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Santos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sossouhounto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sossouhounto 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although quantitative heterogeneity was high, the direction of the effect was consistent across all trials. We performed a series of subgroup analyses by dose and immune status of participants, but this did not explain the heterogeneity or provide a reliable point estimate of efficacy with subgroups.</P>

The serious event in the mefloquine user was the death of a pregnant woman who received mefloquine (septic shock after an emergency caesarean section for obstructed labour) (<LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1994</LINK>). For serious pregnancy-related outcomes, <LINK REF="STD-Nosten-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Nosten 1994</LINK> reported four congenital malformations in the mefloquine group: limb dysplasia (1 case), ventricular septal defect (2 cases), amniotic bands (1 case) and one in the placebo group: anencephaly.

<P>We included five RCTs comparing mefloquine with chloroquine that reported on efficacy and six on safety (<LINK REF="TBL-12" TYPE="TABLE">Table 12</LINK>). Trials were conducted in immune or semi-immune adult populations in the Ivory Coast (<LINK REF="STD-Sossouhounto-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sossouhounto 1995</LINK>), Malawi (<LINK REF="STD-Steketee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steketee 1996</LINK>), Nigeria (<LINK REF="STD-Salako-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Salako 1992</LINK>) Thailand (<LINK REF="STD-Boudreau-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Boudreau 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bunnag-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bunnag 1992</LINK>) and the USA.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Serious adverse events or effects</HEADING>
<P>Across four RCTs, two serious adverse events were reported in 529 mefloquine users and none in 471 chloroquine users; the difference between groups was not significant (RR 2.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 23.85; 5 RCTs, 1000 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Both events were psychiatric admissions due to depression and suicidal thoughts; both study participants had previous psychiatric histories. In one case, the participant's psychiatrist did not think the event was drug-related, and in the other "felt this individual's current depression was not drug related, unless it was aggravated by inability to sleep". Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Steketee-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steketee 1996</LINK> described one withdrawal due to a "neuropsychiatric side effect" (disorientation to time and place) but did not provide enough detail to meet our definition of serious adverse event or effect.</P>
<P>Four cohort studies reported a total of 29 serious adverse effects (attributed by users to the study drug) in 56,674 mefloquine users, and 13 serious adverse effects in 22,583 chloroquine users.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mefloquine efficacy</HEADING>
<P>We included 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared mefloquine with placebo; none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and in the mefloquine group 0% to 13% (median 1%).</P>
<P>In four other RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (<I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mefloquine safety versus currently used alternatives</HEADING>
<P>Serious adverse effects have been reported for mefloquine and doxycyline, but not for atovaquone-proguanil. Serious adverse effects are uncommon, and on statistical testing, no difference was detected between mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil (<I>low-certainty evidence</I>), or between mefloquine and doxycycline (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Participants who received mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than participants who received atovaquone-proguanil (<I>high-certainty evidence</I>), but there was no difference in comparisons with doxycycline (<I>low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We included one RCT and six cohort studies that reported our prespecified adverse effects that compared mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil. In the RCT in short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (<I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), insomnia (<I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), anxiety (<I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>), and depressed mood during travel (<I>moderate-certainty evidence</I>). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with these findings but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (<I>high-certainty evidence</I>) and dizziness (<I>high-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>We included six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers that compared mefloquine with doxycycline which reported our prespecified adverse effects. We also included one RCT in military personnel and one cohort in short-term travellers that reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), insomnia (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), anxiety (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>) and depressed mood (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with these findings but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in the frequency of abnormal dreams or insomnia. Doxycycline users were more likely to report dyspepsia (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), photosensitivity (<I>very low-certainty evidence</I>), vomiting (<I>very low-certainty evidence)</I> and vaginal thrush (<I>very</I> <I>low-certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Comparisons with chloroquine showed a broadly consistent pattern with these results.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-10-24 12:16:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mefloquine has been licensed for prevention of malaria in travellers since the late 1980s, and as such, it is perhaps surprising how few well-conducted RCTs were available. However, because we were mainly interested in the adverse effect profiles of different antimalarial agents, cohort studies (of which there are many) are probably the most appropriate study design despite their inherent limitations. Most RCTs excluded people with a previous history of mental health problems, precluding an analysis of whether psychological side effects are more common in this group. Conversely, many of the cohort studies explicitly stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was influenced by both past medical history and personal preference. While this undoubtedly introduces some confounding between study groups, we consider this confounding to be appropriate and directly applicable to clinical practice. Similarly, we would normally be cautious about interpreting unblinded self-reported assessments of adverse effects and causality. In this scenario, self-reported adverse effects provide useful and relevant information for travellers, who would also be unblinded. It should be noted that the reported adverse effects are largely self-reported psychiatric symptoms and not formal psychiatric diagnoses.</P>
<P>Given the heterogeneity in trial design, mefloquine doses used, and the study population, we were unable to derive a reliable estimate for mefloquine efficacy. However, the evidence suggests that mefloquine is likely to be highly effective in reducing clinical episodes of malaria. Comparative trials found no difference in efficacy between mefloquine and atovaquone-proguanil or doxycycline for preventing clinical malaria, but the number of malaria episodes was very low, and consequently, much larger trials would be needed to exclude clinically important differences. As a consequence, knowledge about antimalarial resistance patterns in the country of travel seems an appropriate approach to decision making rather than further RCTs.</P>
<P>The choice between antimalarial agents will therefore depend on how individual travellers rate the relative importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden and cost. Prophylactic mefloquine is widely acknowledged to cause abnormal dreams and psychological adverse effects and we found consistent evidence for these effects across comparisons with atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline and chloroquine (the most commonly used alternatives). Doxycycline does not have the same risk of psychological adverse effects, but is associated with increased risk of photosensitivity, dyspepsia, and vaginal thrush, which some travellers will undoubtedly consider important. In line with this, participants who received mefloquine were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse effects than participants who received atovaquone-proguanil, but there was no difference in comparisons with doxycycline.</P>
<P>We found estimating the risk of serious psychological adverse effects from the studies was not straightforward. Study authors used the term 'serious' loosely, and often did not provide us with the detail required to determine whether these events met standardized definitions. Furthermore, the estimates of the absolute risk in both mefloquine and comparator arm varied considerably between trials, which may be related to data collection methods and the cut-offs used rather than true differences among populations. Overall, we did not identify large differences in the risk of serious adverse effects among antimalarial agents; but what we did find was that the nature of these serious adverse effects corresponded with the known side effect profile of each drug.</P>
<P>The findings of our related systematic review which analysed deaths and parasuicides associated with mefloquine prophylaxis, and included case reports, had findings consistent with this (<LINK REF="REF-Tickell_x002d_Painter-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tickell-Painter 2017</LINK>). This systematic review reports that there were no suicides we could reliably attribute to mefloquine prophylaxis, and one para-suicide with a possible causal association. In the analysed reports, we identified two deaths with a probable association that appeared to be idiosyncratic drug reactions; the remaining eight deaths we categorised as &#8220;unlikely&#8221; to be related to mefloquine, or &#8220;unclassifiable&#8221;.</P>
<P>We believe it is important that the large retrospective healthcare record analyses did not demonstrate a clear quantitative association between mefloquine use and formal mental health disorders. This may reflect the inadequacy of the study methods to detect this outcome, but may also reflect the transient nature of the mood disturbance, with resolution once mefloquine is discontinued. We were unable to comment on the severity or duration of the reported adverse effects based on the available data.</P>
<P>The data on mefloquine at a prophylactic dose during pregnancy were limited (2 RCTs; no comparative cohort studies). Both RCTs included semi-immune populations who did not travel.</P>
<P>Mefloquine has an advantage as the only malaria prophylaxis with a once weekly regimen. Many have cited this as a mechanism to improve adherence, which is notoriously low in all users of antimalarial prophylaxis. However, the evidence base for this assertion is weak, with almost all data originating from cohort studies which reported a variety of measures of self-reported complete adherence.</P>
<P>We were unable to perform some prespecified subgroup analyses including children versus adults, female versus male travellers and pregnant versus non-pregnant women. This meant we were unable to test whether women were more likely to experience adverse effects from mefloquine use (which has been widely reported in the literature).</P>
<P>We appreciate that the distinction between adverse events (all events regardless of relationship to the study drug) and adverse effects (events attributed by study authors or participants to the study drug) can seem arbitrary and cause confusion. However, we consulted extensively with methodologists who advised that both outcomes are useful to decision makers, and there is no overall gold standard. For example, reporting only the adverse effects (for example, hospitalizations, psychiatric side effects) thought to be attributed to the drug regimen can introduce selective bias by the study authors. For controversial or pharmaceutical company-funded studies this can distort the outcomes. By comparing all events across both groups any difference in the relative risk can be compared without the potential for selective bias. However, this does have its own limitations, such as if the two groups were not comparable at baseline or if the sample size is not big enough to exclude differences due to chance. We therefore chose to include both options (events and effects) to give readers and decision makers the complete picture.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-10-16 09:13:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Maya Tickell-Painter">
<P>In the 'Summary of findings' tables we present what we consider to be the best estimate of effect for each outcome, within each comparison. Where possible we chose the estimate from RCTs reporting adverse effects, but where this was not available we used estimates from cohort studies. However, when making judgements about the certainty of evidence we considered all the evidence available, as well as the consistency of the effect across different population groups and study designs.</P>
<P>For the comparison of mefloquine with atovaquone-proguanil, the best estimates of effect came from a single, well-conducted RCT in short-term travellers, recording participant-reported adverse effects. The findings of this study were supported by seven cohort studies in long-term occupational travellers and military personnel. We considered the evidence of increased risk of abnormal dreams and insomnia to be high certainty because the effects were consistent across all population groups. However, we downgraded the effect estimate on anxiety and depressed mood for inconsistency to moderate certainty because there was substantial variation in the effect size across populations, with much larger effects in long-term travellers and military personnel.</P>
<P>For the comparison of mefloquine with doxycycline, the only available RCT was very small, and reported adverse events rather than adverse effects. Consequently, we considered the effect estimates from cohort studies to be more reliable. Evidence from cohort studies was automatically downgraded to low based on the inherent bias in the study design. We further downgraded almost all estimates of effect for indirectness, because most data were from long-term travellers and military personnel, and may therefore over estimate the effect in short-term travel. The evidence is therefore considered to be very low-certainty with little confidence in the size of the effect. It is important to note however, that the pattern of adverse effects with mefloquine in these cohort studies is entirely consistent with the pattern seen in comparisons of mefloquine with atovaquone-proguanil and chloroquine.</P>

<P>During the course of this review we made changes to the protocol. Two changes were made to shorten the overall length of the review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>we excluded comparisons of mefloquine with primaquine and tafenoquine because these are planned for assessment in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Rodrigo-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodrigo 2016</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>we excluded single-arm cohort studies because there were sufficient data from comparative studies to reach reasonable conclusions. These studies have been analysed for the very rare outcomes of death or attempted suicide in another systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Tickell_x002d_Painter-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tickell-Painter 2017</LINK>).</LI>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-10-24 12:02:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several recently published reviews regarding the safety of mefloquine have been narrative, and included little or no description of methods applied and a lack of clearly defined and prespecified outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nevin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevin 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McCarthy-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCarthy 2015</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Nevin-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nevin 2015</LINK> discuss the policy implications of mefloquine use by the military which was beyond the scope of this Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Schlagenhauf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlagenhauf 2010</LINK> highlighted several areas in which mefloquine prophylaxis may be considered advantageous (during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, in long-term travellers, travellers who are visiting friends and relatives and families with small children). The main disagreement with our review was in regard to safety in long-term travellers, in whom the review authors refer to mefloquine as "a good option if well tolerated". This is based on a narrative analysis of a single cohort study which compared mefloquine users with users of chloroquine-proguanil, which was not included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lobel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lobel 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our review added data from several additional studies evaluating longer-term use (<LINK REF="STD-Andersson-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Andersson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cunningham-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Cunningham 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Korhonen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Korhonen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landman-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Landman 2015</LINK>), and we found some observational evidence that risk of adverse effects was higher than with short-term travel.</P>
<P>Our findings are broadly consistent with the previous version of this Cochrane Review, which was withdrawn (<LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2015</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2015</LINK> found higher rates of neuropsychiatric adverse events in mefloquine users compared with users of both atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline. We expanded on this finding by providing estimated risks for specific neurological and psychiatric symptoms, and by including additional data from cohort studies. <LINK REF="REF-Jacquerioz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacquerioz 2015</LINK> included a brief analysis of case reports of deaths associated with mefloquine in the Discussion. We excluded this analysis from this update, but this aspect has been addressed in a separate review of single-arm cohort studies and case reports (<LINK REF="REF-Tickell_x002d_Painter-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tickell-Painter 2017</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two recent reviews included evaluations of mefloquine efficacy and safety during pregnancy. <LINK REF="REF-Gonz_x00e1_lez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzlez 2014</LINK> concluded there were no indications that mefloquine use during pregnancy carries an increased risk for the foetus. <LINK REF="REF-Gonz_x00e1_lez-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzlez 2014</LINK> included additional studies to those we included in this Cochrane Review, including mefloquine when used at treatment dose, or as intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy. <LINK REF="REF-Muanda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muanda 2015</LINK> also included mefloquine when used as intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy. <LINK REF="REF-Muanda-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muanda 2015</LINK> reported findings from two trials in which the number of adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Briand-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Briand 2009</LINK>), and number of serious adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Gonz_x00e1_lez-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzlez 2014a</LINK>) was higher in participants who received mefloquine as intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy than in those who received sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine.</P>

<P>The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears to be very low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline and atovaquone-proguanil).</P>
<P>The choice of antimalarial agent will therefore depend on how individual travellers rate the relative importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden and cost. Some will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood during travel.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-10-16 09:11:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Maya Tickell-Painter">
<P>Given the low absolute risk of malaria in travellers, very large trials would be necessary to exclude clinically important differences among antimalarial agents. As a consequence, knowledge about antimalarial resistance patterns in the country of travel seems an appropriate approach to decision making rather than further RCTs.</P>
<P>Although a large number of RCTs evaluating mefloquine prophylaxis have been performed, very few could be included in our analyses. Many RCTs chose to report proxy measures of psychiatric outcomes, such as Profile of Mood States questionnaires and Environmental Symptoms Questionnaires, which are difficult for clinicians and participants to interpret. Furthermore, many studies grouped symptoms together when reporting outcomes. 'Neuropsychiatric' or 'neuropsychologic' were commonly used terms, although the symptoms included varied from headaches to psychosis, making them of limited value in clinical decision making.</P>
<P>Even though we found moderate- and high-certainty evidence that mefloquine use is associated with a range of psychological adverse effects, further RCTs could increase confidence in the size of the effect. The relative risk of psychological side effects was higher with long-term use of mefloquine, although this finding was only statistically significant in one comparison. An alternative explanation is the possibility of an interaction between mefloquine and level of psychological stress given the occupation of participants surveyed (Foreign and Commonwealth Office workers, Peace Corps volunteers and military personnel). Further research should examine these potential interactions.</P>
<P>Furthermore, well-designed trials could test hypotheses regarding male versus female users, whether mefloquine users with a previous history of mental health problems are more likely to experience psychological adverse effects, and the severity or duration of the reported adverse effects.</P>

<P>Communications with study authors:</P>
<P>The study authors provided us with access to the disaggregated study data for the specific symptoms mentioned above. The questionnaire in the paper allowed participants to describe side effects from the antimalarial they were currently taking, and any regimen they had previously used. For non-serious side effects, in line with the original paper, we only included side effects for the subject's original regimen. Where subjects had previously taken more than one regimen, we only include side effects for whichever regimen to which the participant attributed the greater number of side effects; this affected 70/2701 participants. This analysis resulted in a decrease in the effect size for side effects attributed to mefloquine. For serious side effects (hospitalizations) and discontinuations we included all participants entries for all regimens. In addition, our denominator differed from the original paper because we did not exclude participants who had been in post for fewer than six months</P>

However, the study authors confirmed that for table 1: "The comparisons of the number of side effects of both regimes" the number of side effects for specific symptoms e.g. nausea was equivalent to the number of soldiers reporting that side effect. In addition, the authors were able to clarify a discrepancy in the original text: the paper states "27 mefloquine takers (41.2%) reported 43 side effects at the 2nd week of prophylaxis". The total number of mefloquine participants was 228; 41.2% equates to 94 participants. The authors confirmed that the correct figure was 27 mefloquine users (11%).</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>No serious risk of bias: the RCTs were generally at low risk of bias but two of three were sponsored by the manufacturer of one of the study drugs. All cohort studies had methodological problems which could introduce confounding or bias. However, as the GRADE approach automatically downgrades certainty by two levels for non-randomized studies, we did not downgrade further.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious indirectness: the RCTs were conducted in short-term international travellers to malaria-endemic areas in Africa or South America for less than 28 days. The cohort studies were from a variety of populations including short-term travellers (8 studies), longer-term occupational travellers (3 studies) and military personnel (1 study).<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Downgraded by two levels for serious imprecision: no episodes of malaria were recorded in either trial.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>No serious inconsistency: the findings of the cohort studies were consistent with the effects seen in the RCTs.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>No serious imprecision: serious adverse effects were rare in all studies.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>No serious imprecision. The effect was statistically significant and the overall data (RCTs and cohort studies) were adequately powered to detect this effect.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Downgraded by one level for serious imprecision: although the direction of the effect was consistent across all trials, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgraded by one level for serious imprecision: the 95% CI is wide and includes important effects and no effect.<BR/>

<SUP>1</SUP>No serious risk of bias: none of the RCTs adequately described methods of random sequence generation or allocation concealment, However, given that so few events occurred in these trials, it is unlikely to have introduced bias.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>No serious inconsistency: the direction of the effect is consistent across study designs, or there in consistency in the finding of no effect.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>No serious indirectness: the primary analysis included studies in short-term international travellers, longer-term occupational travellers, and military personnel.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by two levels for imprecision: only seven episodes of clinical malaria occurred in the four trials, and consequently, the analysis was substantially underpowered to exclude important differences.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>For serious adverse outcomes we expressed the control group risk as the overall risk in the control group.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>No serious risk of bias: all cohort studies had methodological problems which could introduce confounding or bias. However, as the GRADE approach automatically downgrades certainty by two levels for non-randomized studies, we did not downgrade further.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Downgraded by one level for serious imprecision: the 95% confidence interval includes both clinically important effects and no effect.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Downgrade by one level for serious inconsistency: although there was no substantial difference between drugs in the cohort studies, the proportion of discontinuations was higher with both drugs: 14% for mefloquine and 9% for doxycycline.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by one level for indirectness: the primary analysis included only cohort studies in longer-term occupation travellers (USA Peace Corps volunteers) and military personnel. Adverse effects in shorter-term international travellers may be lower.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>No serious imprecision: the effect was statistically significant and the overall data (RCTs and cohort studies) were adequately powered to detect this effect.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Downgraded by one level for serious inconsistency: there was heterogeneity between trials in the direction of effect.<BR/>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Symbol digit modalities test: a test of information processing speed.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Digit span backwards and forwards: Participants are presented a series of numbers (for example, 2, 7, 4 at a rate of one digit per second), and asked to repeat them in the same (digit span forwards) or reverse (digit span backwards) sequence. These are usually viewed as simple short-term memory tasks.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Profile of Mood States (POMS): a validated questionnaire designed to measure feelings in five domains: tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and vigor. Answers are graded ranging from 'not at all (0)' to 'extremely (4)'. The total mood disturbance (TMD) is a composite overall score which is calculated by adding the scores across the four categories of tension, anger, fatigue and depression and subtracting the score for vigour. The total ranges from 20 to 108. An increased TMD score indicates a deterioration of mood.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ): a standardized form containing 68 questions relating to all body systems. Responses consist of six graded answers ranging from 'not at all' to 'extreme'.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Neurobehavioral evaluation system (NES): a series of computerized tests designed to provide quantitative neurobehavioral outcomes which measures performance, such as sustained attention (response latency), coding speed, and visuomotor accuracy.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Instrument co-ordination analyser (ICA): This is a tool used in the selection of trainee pilots, and measures multiple task abilities. It It simulates simplified cockpit tasks with controls for<BR/>the altitude, direction, and speed. It is used to test for coordination, psychomotor function, spatial discrimination, fine coordination, and stress resistance.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Critical flicker/fusion frequency: this tests measures the frequency at which a flickering light is perceived as a steady light source. Changes are thought to be indicative of alterations in central nervous system activation, or fatigue.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Critical instability tracking tests: this test is used to measure the ability of the participant to control a displayed error signal using a joystick. It is a first-order, compensatory tracking task.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Santos-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Santos 1993</LINK> (RCT) reported only on adverse effects, which the study authors attributed to the drug regime used. They report 1 case of "nervosismo" (anxiety) and discomfort in a participant who took 500 mg of mefloquine every 4 weeks (31 participants in this study arm).</P>
<P>Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Weiss-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weiss 1995</LINK> reported on mean number of symptoms reported per participant. This includes all spontaneously reported symptoms, and included diarrhoea, stomach pains, nausea, fever and headache. No significant differences were found between the multivitamin (placebo) group and the mefloquine groups. <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1980</LINK> reported that "there was no clinical evidence of drug toxicity in the 990 study participants, nor were there significant changes in the measured biochemical parameters". However, they did not actively seek out adverse events, and did not describe how causality was assessed (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1996</LINK> reports on events occurring in the first week of the study (when both groups had received 1 placebo tablet) and the relative risk of those symptoms worsening over time, for symptoms including headache, lethargy, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough and nausea. Diarrhoea increased transiently with mefloquine compared to placebo, there was no difference in the other symptoms. <LINK REF="STD-Schlagenhauf-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Schlagenhauf 1997</LINK> was a cross-over randomized controlled trial including 23 participants. They report one withdrawal due to dizziness, diarrhoea, and flu-like symptoms and three volunteers spontaneously reported minor sleep-related adverse events, including insomnia, unpleasant dreams, superficial sleep, and early awakening. These events all occurred in the mefloquine loading dose phase.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 2000</LINK> had important differences in the numbers of exposed/non-exposed participants and was at high risk of bias. Sensitivity analysis removing this trial did not alter the overall results.</P>
