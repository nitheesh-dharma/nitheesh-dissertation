<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Benperidol is a relatively old drug that is used for the treatment of schizophrenia in several European countries. We identified only one small, poorly reported, unpublished, randomised trial comparing benperidol with another antipsychotic. Unfortunately the quality of reporting is so poor that the results cannot be considered reliable. Although benperidol was first marketed in 1966, more trials on this drug are justified as with the advent of new compounds there is a danger that inexpensive drugs such as benperidol remain under-researched and overlooked.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-14 12:59:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benperidol is a relatively old antipsychotic drug that has been marketed since 1966. It has been used in Germany for 30 years but is also available in Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. Benperidol is a butyrophenone antipsychotic, with the highest neuroleptic potency in terms of D2 receptor blockade. Those taking it are therefore reputed to be at high risk of extrapyramidal side-effects, but benperidol's unusual profile may render it valuable to certain subgroups of people with schizophrenia.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the clinical effects and safety of benperidol for those with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-05-22 16:21:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (March 2009) for this update.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included all randomised controlled trials that compared benperidol with other treatments for people with schizophrenia, or schizophrenia-like psychoses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and extracted data. We independently extracted data but excluded data if loss to follow up was greater than 50%. For dichotomous data, we estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and used intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The update yielded no further studies for inclusion in the review. We identified only one unpublished poorly randomised controlled trial (N=40, duration 30 days, comparison perphenazine). Although benperidol was inferior to perphenazine (1 RCT, N=40, global state no better or worse RR 8.0 CI 2.1 to 30, NNH 1.4 CI 1 to 2) poor reporting suggests that an overestimate of effect is likely. It was not possible to report other outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Currently, there are insufficient data from randomised trials to assess the clinical effects of benperidol. This compound merits further research interest.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:03:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:01:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is usually a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder which afflicts approximately one per cent of the population worldwide with little gender differences. Its typical manifestations are 'positive' symptoms such as fixed, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptions without cause (hallucinations), 'negative' symptoms such as apathy and lack of drive, disorganisation of behaviour and thought, and catatonic symptoms such as mannerisms and bizarre posturing (<LINK REF="REF-Carpenter-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carpenter 1994</LINK>). The degree of suffering and disability is considerable with 80% to 90% not working (<LINK REF="REF-Marvaha-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marvaha 2004</LINK>) and up to 10% dying (<LINK REF="REF-Tsuang-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsuang 1978</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:02:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benperidol is a relatively old antipsychotic drug that was formulated in the 1960s and has been marketed since 1966. It is usually taken orally but can also be given by intramuscular injection for rapid treatment of acutely disturbed psychotic people. Early uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="REF-Fluegel-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fluegel 1967</LINK>) suggest that benperidol is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, especially for those with recent onset delusions (fixed, false beliefs out of keeping with the person's education or cultural background) and hallucinations (perceptions with no cause). Benperidol has been associated with a high risk of adverse effects such as rigidity, mask-like appearance, tremor, stooped shuffling gait and other so called extrapyramidal effects such as inner feeling of restlessness (akathisia), acute spinal and ocular rigidity (the acute dystonias) and the slow onset of repetitive movements of the face and body (tardive dyskinesia) (<LINK REF="REF-Nedopil-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nedopil 1979</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:03:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benperidol is a butyrophenone derivative and a specific dopamine-antagonist, selective for the D2 receptor. It also binds to serotonin receptors but to a lesser extent. In high doses it has antihistaminergic and alpha-adrenergic properties but its anticholinergic effects are small (<LINK REF="REF-Fachinformation-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fachinformation 1999</LINK>). Benperidol's potency in terms of dopamine receptor antagonism is assumed to be a hundred times higher than that of chlorpromazine. Haloperidol is only supposed to reach 60% of benperidol's potency (<LINK REF="REF-Langer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langer 1983</LINK>), suggesting a high risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects. Benperidol is absorbed easily and has a high first pass effect. Only one per cent of the original benperidol can be found in the urine, but little is known about the metabolites of this compound (<LINK REF="REF-Fachinformation-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fachinformation 1999</LINK>). The recommended initial dose is 2 to 6 mg/day; the maximum dose is 40 mg/day. Due to a short half-life of eight hours, benperidol should be administered three times per day (<LINK REF="REF-Fachinformation-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fachinformation 1999</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:03:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although benperidol has been used as an antipsychotic in Germany for 30 years, as far as we can ascertain, its current use is limited to only a few other countries (Belgium, Great Britain, Greece, Italy and the Netherlands) and its market share is unclear. In the UK it is also used as a sexual suppressant. However, its relative effects compared to other antipsychotic drugs based on randomised evidence are largely unknown.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effects of benperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses, in comparison with placebo, no treatment or other antipsychotic medication.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently inspected all citations of studies identified by the search.

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-08-17 17:53:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Data Extraction<BR/>CS and SL independently extracted data from included studies. Any disagreement was discussed, decisions documented and, if necessary, authors of studies were contacted for clarification. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, we did not enter data and added the trial to the list of those awaiting assessment.<BR/>2. Management<BR/>We extracted the data onto standard, simple forms. Where possible, data were entered into RevMan in such a way that the area to the left of the 'line of no effect' indicates a 'favourable' outcome for benperidol. Where this was not possible, for example for scales that calculate higher scores = improvement, graphs in RevMan analyses were labelled accordingly so that the direction of effects were clear.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:11:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Again working independently, two authors assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias and where allocation was clearly not concealed.</P>
<P>If disputes arise as to which category a trial has to be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-17 18:08:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Data types<BR/>Outcomes are assessed using continuous (for example, average changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such as 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a person's behaviour). Currently RevMan software does not support categorical data so we only presented these in the text of the review.</P>
<P>2. Dichotomous/binary data<BR/>2.1 Defining cut-offs<BR/>Where the original authors of the studies gave outcomes such as 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved', based on their clinical judgement, predetermined criteria, or any scale, we recorded this in RevMan. If data were from a rater not clearly stated to be independent, then we included it provided it did not change the results, otherwise it was presented separately with a label 'prone to bias'. Where possible, we converted relevant categorical or continuous outcome measures to dichotomous data by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing subjects into groups accordingly. This was with the cut-off points 'moderate or severe impairment' for end of study data or 'no better or worse' for change data.</P>
<P>For example the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS - <LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>) are frequently used as a measure of change of symptoms in studies. We defined a 50% change on these particular scales as clinically important, although we recognised that for many people, especially those with chronic or severe illnesses, a less rigorous definition of important improvement (for example 25% on the BPRS/PANSS) would be equally valid (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Leucht-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 2005b</LINK>). Where individual patient data were available, we used the 50% cut-off for the definition in the case of non-chronically ill people, and 25% for those with chronic illness.</P>
<P>2.2 Intention-to-treat analysis<BR/>The review presents an intention-to-treat analysis. Provided that more than 50% of people in short and medium-term studies and 40% in long-term studies completed the trial, we counted everyone allocated to the intervention, whether or not they completed follow up. We assumed that those who left the study early had no change in their outcome.</P>
<P>2.3 Effect size<BR/>The review uses the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). It has been shown that RR is more intuitive (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1999</LINK>) and that odds ratios tend to be interpreted as RR by clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2000</LINK>). This misinterpretation then leads to an overestimate of the impression of the effect. We did inspect data, however, to see if analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio made a substantive difference. Where possible, we estimated the number needed to treat (NNT) using an on-line calculator (http://www.mango3d.cwc.net/vsx.htm).</P>
<P>3. Continuous data<BR/>3.1 Intention-to-treat versus completer analyses<BR/>In the case of continuous data we assumed that in many cases an intention-to-treat analysis would not be available and presented a completer analysis.</P>
<P>3.2 Rating scales<BR/>A wide range of instruments is available to measure mental health outcomes. These instruments vary in quality and many are not valid, or even ad hoc. For outcome instruments it is necessary to set minimum standards. We only included continuous data from rating scales if the measuring instrument had been described in a peer-reviewed journal (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>), the instrument was either a self report or completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist), and the instrument could be considered a global assessment of an area of functioning. However, as it was expected that therapists would frequently also be the rater, we commented on such data as 'prone to bias'.</P>
<P>3.3 Skewed data<BR/>Mental health continuous data is often not "normally" distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to all data before inclusion: (i) standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtained from the authors; (ii) if the data were finite number zero, for example 0-100, when the standard deviation was multiplied by two, the result should be less than the mean, otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). (III)<BR/>if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
<P>3.4 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>Endpoint scale-derived data are finite, ranging from one score to another. Change data are more problematic and for it the rule described above does not hold. Although most change scores are likely to be skewed, this cannot be proven so they were presented in MetaView. Where possible we presented endpoint data, and if both endpoint and change data were available for the same outcomes, then we reported only the former.</P>
<P>3.5 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes, we estimated a weighted mean difference (MD) between groups.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-08-17 18:09:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This can cause type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients of their clustered data and to adjust for these using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering has been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we will also present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+ (m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies had been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficients and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over trials<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, randomised cross-over studies were eligible but only data up to the point of first cross-over.</P>
<P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>

<P>2.2 Employing the I-squared statistic<BR/>The I-squared statistic provides an estimate of the percentage of variability due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone.

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:20:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible we employed a random-effects model for analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Der_x002d_Simonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Der-Simonian 1986</LINK>). We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us and the random-effects model takes into account differences between studies even if there is no statistically significant heterogeneity. Therefore, the random-effects model is usually more conservative in terms of statistical significance, although as a disadvantage it puts added weight onto smaller studies which can either inflate or deflate the effect size. We examined in a secondary analysis whether using a fixed-model markedly changed the results.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 11:56:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. The searches<BR/>Although benperidol has been used for decades by European psychiatrists, our search only identified one unpublished manuscript that inadequately reported a small randomised controlled trial. The original search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group controlled trials register yielded 35 studies, all of which were ordered and inspected. Hand searching of the included trials and contacting the manufacturers of benperidol led to the identification of further publications, but despite this, only one unpublished study met the inclusion criteria. The update search in November 2004 yielded another 39 references, but only one study was relevant which we added to the <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>. The update search in March 2009 yielded 241 additional references, but none of them were relevant.</P>
<P>It is sobering that apparently there are almost no randomised data about this antipsychotic drug which has been frequently used in some countries such as Germany. As the only available trial reported only on leaving the study early and global state, results for all other prespecified outcomes of interest are completely missing.</P>
<P>2. COMPARISON 1. BENPERIDOL versus PLACEBO<BR/>The search did not identify any placebo-controlled trials. We excluded two randomised studies that compared different doses of benperidol (<LINK REF="STD-Nedopil-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nedopil 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Seiler-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Seiler 1994</LINK>) as they are not the focus of this review, and are uninformative when the absolute efficacy of the drug is unknown.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON 2. BENPERIDOL versus OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTICS<BR/>The suggestion that benperidol may be significantly inferior to perphenazine in terms of 'global state' must be viewed with great caution. In the one relevant study, the methodology was such that the results are likely to be unreliable. It is therefore impossible to judge the true clinical efficacy and safety of benperidol based on randomised controlled trials.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-05-22 18:07:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As there was only one small (n=40) trial comparing benperidol with perphenazine the evidence is clearly incomplete. Many more randomised controlled-trials are needed to investigate the effects of benperidol compared to placebo or other antipsychotic drugs.</P>

<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>People being offered benperidol as a treatment for schizophrenia should also be aware of this lack of data. They may wish to ask if there are other evidence-based treatments, or to engage in treatment in the context of objective evaluation.</P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>Clinicians should be aware that there is only one, small, unpublished, uninformative, randomised controlled trial examining the effects of benperidol versus another antipsychotic for schizophrenia. In view of this lack of evidence, possible benefits and harms of prescribing benperidol must be weighed against alternative, better-researched treatments. For clinicians instigating a treatment change, and considering the use or change from benperidol, treatment within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial would be both informative and ethical.</P>
<P>3. For managers or policy makers<BR/>Funders should consider supporting trials to assess the effects of benperidol. This drug is used quite frequently and is inexpensive compared to new antipsychotic drugs.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-14 13:41:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>Had there been superior reporting of the one included study, this review would have been much more informative. Important outcomes such as adverse effects and behaviour were rendered useless by poor reporting. The whole study was devalued by complete lack of description of the means of randomisation (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>). Although this may be seen as judging an old study by today's standards (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1996</LINK>), there is some evidence that quality of reporting was better in early mental health studies (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 1999</LINK>) and that the CONSORT statement has made little difference (<LINK REF="REF-Milton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milton 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>Given the absence of data from randomised trials, and the limited but widespread use of benperidol, well designed, conducted and reported studies are urgently needed. Benperidol has an interesting receptor binding profile. It is reputed to be the antipsychotic drug with the strongest blockade of central dopamine receptors. It is perfectly feasible that subgroups of people with schizophrenia, for example those with treatment-resistant illness, might benefit from such a profile. This compound, which is likely to be a potent antipsychotic, should not be under-evaluated simply because it is old and inexpensive. There is a danger that truly valuable compounds are discarded as research becomes dictated by pecuniary interests.</P>

<P>In the first version we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (January 2001) with the phrase:</P>
<P>[benperidol or benperidolo or benperidolum or benzperidol or CB-8089 or "cb 8089" or "8089 CB" or McN-JR-4584 or "mcn jr 4584" or R-4584 or "r 4584" or benperidone or benzoperidol or frenactyl or glianimon or phenactil or frenactil or anquil or Psichoben or "1-[1-[3-(p-Fluorobenzoyl)propyl]-4-piperidyl]-2-benzimidazolinone" or "4'-Fluor-4-[4-(2-oxo-1-benzimidazolinyl)piperidino]butyrophenon]" or "1 [1 [3 (para fluorobenzoyl)propyl]piperid 4 yl] 2 benzimidazolinone" or "1 [1 [4 (para fluorophenyl) 4 oxobutyl]piperidin 4 yl] 2 benzimidazolinone" or "4' fluoro 4 [4 (2 oxobenzimidazolin 1 yl"]</P>
<P>In the update search in november 2004 we used a slightly different phrase to search the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register:</P>
<P>[benperido* or benzperidol* or benzoperidol* or frenactyl* or glianimon* or phenactil* or frenactil* or anquil* or Psichoben* or CB-8089* or cb 8089* or 8089 CB* or McN-JR-4584* or mcn jr 4584* or R-4584* or r 4584* in title or *benperido* or *benzperidol* or *benzoperidol* or *frenactyl* or *glianimon* or *phenactil* or *frenactil* or *anquil* or *Psichoben* or *CB-8089* or *cb 8089* or *8089 CB* or *McN-JR-4584* or *mcn jr 4584* or *R-4584* or *r 4584 in title, abstract, index terms of REFERENCE] or [benperidol* in interventions of STUDY]}</P>
