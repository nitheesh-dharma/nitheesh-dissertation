<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 14:21:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>People with cystic fibrosis produce mucus in their lungs and airways (passages to the lungs) which is hard to clear. This leads to infections and damage to the airways. Chest physiotherapy or drugs (e.g. deoxyribonuclease) or both are used to try and clear this mucus. Nebulised hypertonic saline is water (with a concentration of 3% or more salt) inhaled as a fine mist through a mask or mouthpiece. The review includes twelve trials with a total of 442 people. We found that 10 ml of saline at 3% to 7% concentration, twice-a-day, helped clear mucus without major adverse effects. Treatment after 48 weeks with hypertonic saline at 7% inhaled twice per day reduces episodes of chest infection and is linked to improved lung function, improved quality of life and better attendance at school or work. However, it had a limited effect on improving lung function. At this stage the authors believe there is enough evidence to recommend the use of hypertonic saline in cystic fibrosis. However we would like to point out that the only long term trial did not determine its primary outcome (lung function) and saw improvements only in secondary outcomes.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 13:08:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Twelve trials (442 participants, aged 6 to 46 years) were included; five excluded and two await classification.</P>
<P>In two placebo-controlled trials, HS (3% to 7%, 10 ml twice-a-day) significantly increased forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) at four weeks, mean difference (MD) 4.15 (95% CI 1.14 to 7.16); but not significantly after 48 weeks, MD 2.31 (95% CI -2.72 to 7.34). Two trials compared a similar dose of HS to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (RhDNAse). One three-week trial showed a non-significant difference, MD 1.60 (95% CI -7.96 to 11.16). However, in the second trial, after 12 weeks, RhDNAse led to a greater increase in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> than HS (5 ml twice-daily), in participants with moderate to severe lung disease, MD 8.00 (95% CI 2.00 to 14.00).</P>
<P>One 48-week placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in frequency of antibiotic use and quality of life; also that HS did not increase the concentration of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> or <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:25:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Treatment with 7% HS for 48 weeks showed a small improvement in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> at four weeks; however, this was not sustained at 48 weeks (primary outcome measure of the only long-term trial). Unlike RhDNAse, HS can't, in the long term, be said to improve lung function. However, it did improve quality of life and reduce pulmonary exacerbations. Delivered following a bronchodilator, HS appears inexpensive and safe with no increased infection risk.</P>
<P>We believe there is sufficient evidence to recommend using HS in CF; qualifying this we highlight that the only long-term trial failed to demonstrate a significant difference in its primary outcome (lung function) with improvements only in secondary outcomes.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:30:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:30:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disorder in Caucasians. In 1989 the gene responsible was identified on the long arm of chromosome 7. This gene encodes for a protein named the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which functions as a chloride channel on the surface of epithelial cells. The altered CFTR is thought to result in defects of electrolyte transport which then cause increased water reabsorption across respiratory epithelia. This may lead to dehydration of the airway surface liquid which may prevent normal clearance of mucus (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1996</LINK>), although the precise mechanism by which CFTR causes abnormal mucus is still unknown. Treatments to improve sputum clearance, such as chest physiotherapy, are a major therapeutic aim in CF. Treatment with nebulised recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) has been widely accepted to be of benefit in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>) and is thought to exert its major effect by enhancing sputum clearance. However treatment with rhDNase is relatively expensive and its use in most countries is restricted by the need to demonstrate an improvement in lung function. Hypertonic saline may represent a potential alternative or supplementary therapy to improve mucociliary clearance in the context of long term maintenance therapy or during times of acute worsening of lung disease in CF.</P>
<P>In vitro deposition of hypertonic saline onto the airway surface improves mucus clearance. Dasgupta demonstrated that the addition of 3% hypertonic saline improved measures of sputum clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Dasgupta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasgupta 1995</LINK>). Hypertonic saline had a greater effect on mucus clearability in vitro than DNase (<LINK REF="REF-Dasgupta-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dasgupta 1995</LINK>). The postulated molecular mechanism of this effect is as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>hypertonic saline breaks the ionic bonds within the mucus gel, which could reduce the degree of cross linking and entanglements and lower viscosity and elasticity (<LINK REF="REF-Ziment-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziment 1978</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>with chronic infection the mucin macromolecules develop fixed negative charges, causing increased repulsion. The addition of hypertonic saline increases the ionic concentration of the mucus and cause a conformational change by shielding the negative charges and thereby reducing repulsion. This would result in a more compact mucus macromolecule that would allow more effective clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>in addition hypertonic saline induces an osmotic flow of water into the mucus layer, rehydrating secretions and thereby improving mucus rheology (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>In the long term this improvement in mucociliary function may reduce bacterial load and chronic inflammation within the airways and therefore reduce the decline in lung function that is consequent to this. Hypertonic saline is easy and inexpensive to produce. Therefore, it is important to determine if nebulised hypertonic saline improves outcomes in CF and to determine the frequency of adverse effects.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To investigate the effects of treatment with nebulised hypertonic saline on people with CF compared to placebo and or other treatments that enhance mucociliary clearance.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:25:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two authors (PW and VMM) independently selected the trials to be included in the review. If disagreement arose on the suitability of a trial for inclusion in the review or on its quality, they reached a consensus by discussion. Two authors assessed the methodological quality of each trial. In particular, they examined details of the generation of allocation sequence, the concealment of treatment allocation schedule, whether the trial was blinded, whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible from available data and if the number lost to follow up or subsequently excluded from the trial was recorded. Two authors (PW and VM) independently extracted data using standard data acquisition forms.</P>
<P>For binary outcome measures, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the authors sought data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. They calculated a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across the studies, (the risk of an outcome among treatment allocated participants to corresponding risk among controls). For continuous outcomes, the authors recorded either a mean change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or post-intervention values and standard deviation for each group. They calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference (MD) where appropriate.</P>
<P>Where trials measured data longitudinally, the authors based the analysis on the final time point results. Methods are not yet available to carry out a meta-analysis of aggregate longitudinal data, where individual patient data (IPD) is not available. If trials had a cross-over design, the analysis that the authors planned to carry out was the one recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>), using the results from a paired analyses. This was only possible in one trial conducted by Suri (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). For the remaining cross-over trials, the data that were provided in the trial report were not sufficient to carry out this type of analysis. For these trials the only option available was to ignore the cross-over design and treat the results from the two periods as if they were independent (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). Elbourne reports that using this approach is conservative, due to the fact that it ignores the within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors tested for heterogeneity between trial results using a standard chi-squared test. For future updates of the review, when appropriate, where between-trial variability is not statistically significant they will carry out a fixed-effect analysis; and if the between-trial heterogeneity is statistically significant, they will perform a random-effects analysis. Where possible they plan to investigate heterogeneity using subgroup analysis, where they will consider the following subgroups:</P>
<P>Strength of hypertonic saline</P>
<OL>
<LI>hypertonic saline 3% to 7%</LI>
<LI>hypertonic saline greater than 7%</LI>

<P>Volume of hypertonic saline</P>

<LI>less than 5 ml</LI>
<LI>5 ml to 10 ml</LI>
<LI>greater than 10 ml</LI>
</OL>
<P>For a future update, when possible, the authors plan to perform a sensitivity analysis based on methodological quality of the trials, including and excluding quasi-randomised trials.</P>

<P>Twelve trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 442 participants, the age range was 6 years to 46 years (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardinale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cardinale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>).

<BR/>The diagnostic criteria for CF in the participants was stated by Eng and this was on the basis of known positive sweat chloride tests (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>); also by Elkins and Suri on the basis of a positive sweat chloride test or the presence of two common genetic mutations (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). In all the other trials it was only stated that the participants had CF. </P>
<P>In the Ballmann trial, 3 out of the 14 participants were chronically colonised with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>(<I>P. aeruginosa</I>). Exclusion criteria were the prior use of either rhDNase or hypertonic saline, a respiratory tract infection requiring intravenous antibiotics in the past three weeks, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or colonisation with <I>Burkolderia cepacia</I> (<I>B. cepacia</I>) (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>). Participants in the Elkins trial required a confirmed diagnosis of CF, that was clinically stable and they must have not used hypertonic saline or non-routine antibiotic therapy in the previous 14 days. Participants were excluded if they were less than six years old, pregnant or breast feeding, cigarette smokers or colonised with <I>B. cepacia</I>. Additionally, participants who demonstrated bronchial reactivity following hypertonic saline defined by a fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 15% following tolerability testing were also excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). In the Eng trial, participants had to be able to perform spirometry, have cough and daily sputum production, agree to do regular chest physiotherapy at home, have an FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>greater than 20% predicted at baseline and be on stable medications for the previous 14 days (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). In the Suri trial, the inclusion criteria were: aged 5 years to 18 years; ability to perform spirometry; currently on rhDNase or have an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> less than 70% predicted and be clinically stable with no exacerbations or change in medications in the last 14 days. Suri included people with CF with at least moderate lung disease, to compare hypertonic saline to rhDNase in a population that would be prescribed rhDNase in clinical practice (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Consequently, their participants have more severe lung disease at baseline, mean FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>per cent predicted 48% (range 14 to 77%). Suri excluded participants if they were colonised with <I>B. cepacia </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). In two trials by Robinson, participants needed a stable clinical condition without any change to their medications (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). Only the 1997 Robinson trial included a participant with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> percent predicted of less than 30% (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). In the third Robinson trial it was clearly stated that they excluded people with CF who were clinically unstable, defined as an exacerbation in the previous four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>).The Riedler trial was unique in that they selected 10 consecutive adolescents admitted with an exacerbation of their lung disease, all had productive coughs (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). Weller stated that all participants received routine treatment for five years (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). The remaining trials used mean FEV<SUB>1</SUB> as a per cent predicted or FVC as a per cent predicted to assess disease severity (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cardinale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cardinale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Baseline sputum microbiology was stated in six trials. All of the 10 participants in the 1997 Robinson trial had <I>P. aeruginosa </I>in their sputum, 5 out of 10 had <I>Staphylococcus aureus </I>(<I>S. aureus</I>) and none had <I>B. cepacia </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). All 10 participants in the Riedler trial were colonised with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> in their sputum, but no <I>B. cepacia</I> and the presence of other organisms was not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). In the 1999 Robinson trial, 10 of 12 participants were colonised with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, seven had <I>S. aureus </I>(including two who also had <I>P. aeruginosa</I>) and four had <I>Aspergillus fumigatus </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). In the Suri trial, 48% had <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, 39% <I>S. aureus </I>and 2% <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Elkins performed quantitative microbiological analysis and reported the presence of <I>P. aeruginosa </I>in 78 of the 81 control participants and 79 of the 83 in the hypertonic saline group. <I>S. aureus </I>was present in 47 and 44 participants respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). Weller mentioned bacterial growth but no details were given (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In the trials by Eng, Suri, Cardinale and Robinson an ultrasonic nebuliser was used to deliver hypertonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Cardinale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cardinale 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>); while Ballmann, Elkins and Riedler used a high output jet nebuliser (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). Different concentrations of hypertonic saline were used and this is outlined in detail in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table. Five of these trials used isotonic (0.9%) saline as a control (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). The 1996 trial by Robinson compared a single administration of nebulised hypertonic saline (7%), amiloride (0.3% in 0.12% NaCl) (AML) and a combination of AML and HS to Isotonic saline (0.9%) (IS) as the control solution, (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>), while the 1997 trial compared differing concentrations of nebulised hypertonic saline (3%, 7%, and 12%) with isotonic saline and voluntary cough (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). Ballmann compared the efficacy of three weeks of nebulised 5.75% saline (10 ml) to 2.5 mg rhDNase (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>). In the 1999 trial, Robinson compared hypertonic saline 6% to 0.9% saline with matched voluntary cough, mannitol 300 mg, and placebo capsules with matched voluntary cough (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). Weller compared hypertonic saline 7% (5 ml) to Mistabron® 20% (a mucolytic agent) (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). Suri compared hypertonic saline 7% (5 ml) twice-daily to rhDNase 2.5 mg daily or to rhDNase 2.5 mg alternate daily (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Elkins compared hypertonic saline 7% with isotonic saline 0.09%, quinine sulphate (0.25mg per millilitre) was added to both solutions to mask the taste (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Additional treatments were also used in association with the hypertonic saline. All the trials with the exception of Weller and Chadwick pre-treated participants with short-acting beta-agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). In the Suri trial, the only pre-treated participants were those who were already using bronchodilators or whose FEV<SUB>1</SUB> fell by more than 15% after the test dose of hypertonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Riedler used the hypertonic saline as an adjunct to physiotherapy and an exercise programme and all participants had intravenous antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). In the Eng trial participants performed physiotherapy at home and received hypertonic saline prior to their regular physiotherapy session (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). The place of chest physiotherapy is likely to be an important contributor to mucolytic therapy, but its role as a confounder was not addressed in any of the trials.</P>

<P>The Elkins trial used a randomised, double blind, parallel group controlled trial design. A clear description of withdrawals and adverse events was given. The method of allocation was described and involved concealed, computer generated randomisation by independent assessors not involved in the trial. A minimisation algorithm was used to balance the two groups. Participants and trial personnel remained unaware of treatment allocation for the duration of the trial. Participant blinding was achieved by masking the taste of the solutions with quinine sulphate. An intention to treat approach was employed (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The Weller trial was described as being randomised, but the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were not discussed (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). Adverse events were described. It was reported to be single blinded but the issue of taste of hypertonic saline was not addressed. There was a clear description of dropouts and withdrawals but it was not stated if an intention-to-treat analysis had been performed. Methods of statistical analysis were described.<BR/>
<BR/>The Eng trial used a randomised open labelled parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). Random number tables were used to randomise participants to treatments, but there was no method to describe the allocation concealment, therefore this is been graded as unclear. A clear description of adverse effects was given and withdrawals accounted for (there was a total of six withdrawals, which are described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table), although there was no specific mention of whether an intention-to-treat analysis had been performed.<BR/>
<BR/>The Riedler trial reported that participants were randomised using a coin toss, but there was no discussion of the method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). Allocation was not blinded. The methods of statistical analysis were described. The methods used to measure adverse effects were not mentioned and there was no description of withdrawals and no exclusion criteria were cited. The trial did not discuss whether an intention-to-treat approach had been used.<BR/>
<BR/>The 1996 Robinson trial was a prospective cross-over trial with random allocation. Although there was no description of the method of allocation concealment, it was stated that participants were blinded to the treatment. The methods of analysis were described, as were adverse effects, but no exclusion criteria were stated (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The Chadwick trial was a single-blind randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>). This was reported as an abstract and no details were given concerning inclusion criteria, withdrawals, randomisation method or statistical analysis. The issue of taste of hypertonic saline was not addressed.<BR/>
<BR/>The 1997 Robinson trial had a randomised prospective design (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). The method used to randomise participants was not described. Inclusion criteria were diagnosed CF, stability of disease (not defined except there could be no change in participants medications). The randomisation process was not defined, nor was allocation blinded. There was no discussion of whether an intention-to-treat analysis had been used, or of any methods describing allocation concealment. There was no mention of withdrawals and no measure of adverse effects was given.<BR/>
<BR/>The Ballmann trial was described as randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>). Participants were randomised in groups of four and the primary author stated that they drew lots to start with either hypertonic saline or rhDNase. The authors described how blinding was not possible due to the taste of hypertonic saline and the different volumes used. A clear list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was also present. However, there was no description of the method of allocation concealment or whether an intention-to-treat analysis had been used (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The 1999 Robinson trial was a randomised controlled cross-over design, but the method used to randomise participants was not described and neither was the method of allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). The authors described how "studies were coded such that the investigators were blinded to the identity of the interventions at the time of data analysis". Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of CF and clinically stable disease, defined by an absence of an exacerbation in the previous four weeks. There was no mention of withdrawals or whether an intention-to-treat approach had been used. The methods of analysis were described and a clear description of adverse events given.<BR/>
<BR/>The Suri trial followed a randomised cross-over design, with a clear description of adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Allocation was randomised and was carried out by telephone to an independent trials co-ordinating unit (stratified by hospital). Allocation concealment was therefore graded as adequate. The trial was not blinded due to the taste of the hypertonic saline. An intention-to-treat approach was used within this trial. This trial compared rhDNase both daily and alternate daily to hypertonic saline 7%, but did not have a placebo arm. In the additional report of airway inflammatory changes following treatment, only 28 of the 48 participants were able to perform induced sputum and be included (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Cardinale followed a randomised placebo controlled open label design. This was reported in abstract form. The randomisation method, inclusion and exclusion criteria, withdrawals or statistical analysis was not described. Whilst it was mentioned that no adverse events were reported with hypertonic saline no further description was given (<LINK REF="STD-Cardinale-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cardinale 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Adde was of open-label randomised cross-over design. This trial was also reported in abstract form only and did not report randomisation method, inclusion and exclusion criteria, withdrawals or adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Adde-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Adde 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the exception of Elkins, in all the trials in which the interventions were described as "blinded", it was further stated by the investigators that this was not possible due to the discernible taste of hypertonic saline. Elkins however added quinine sulphate to the solutions to mask the taste (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>The Robinson trials looked at radiolabelled aerosol clearance to assess mucociliary clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). In this method the participant was given the radiolabelled aerosol from an ultrasonic nebuliser and serial lung scans were performed. Two of the Robinson trials showed that hypertonic saline increased radioisotope clearance compared to isotonic saline controls, P &lt; 0.05 (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>) and P &lt; 0.01 (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). The 1997 Robinson trial showed that increasing concentrations of hypertonic saline also had an effect, with a significant difference between hypertonic saline 3% and hypertonic saline 12%, favouring the higher concentration; but no significant difference between hypertonic saline 7% and hypertonic saline 12% was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). A comparison was made between the two trials for isotope clearance at 60 to 120 minutes. This favoured treatment with hypertonic saline, MD 7.65 (95% CI 3.51 to 11.78). In the Robinson trials mucociliary clearance was then measured as 'area under the curve' (AUC), the lower the value of AUC the faster the clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). Robinson showed that hypertonic saline 7% and hypertonic saline 12% were significantly different from isotonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>). In the 1996 Robinson trial the results for AUC showed hypertonic saline, hypertonic saline and amiloride were significantly different from cough, isotonic saline and amiloride alone (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>). Combined analysis of the two trials favoured treatment with an MD of -212.06 (95% CI -271.64 to -152.48) (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials assessed symptoms using visual analogue scales, both used 10 cm scales ranging from -5 cm to +5 cm. One trial found significant improvements in symptoms for quality of sleep and feeling of cleared chest measured after one and two weeks of treatment with hypertonic saline 6% (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). The Riedler trial looked at a similar visual analogue scale (VAS) for feeling of cleared chest alone measured four days after treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>). They demonstrated a significant difference in their first block of 10 participants between hypertonic saline 6% and isotonic saline. The results of the two studies were pooled. This demonstrated a result favouring treatment with a MD of 0.97 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.60).</P>
<P>The Elkins trial measured quality of life using the SF-36 questionnaire and the Cystic Fibrosis questionnaire (CFQ) for Adults and for Parents. They reported a significantly higher (better) score in the mental health domain of the SF-36 in participants over 14 years (P = 0.02), however the overall score for the CFQ and SF-36 was not significantly different in those less than 14 years. There were significantly better results in the domains of role (P = 0.04), emotion (P = 0.03) and health (P = 0.01) in the CFQ Adult compared to the control group. In participants under the age of 14 the digestion domain was significantly better (P = 0.02) in the control group compared to the hypertonic saline group using the CFQ for parents. This trial also measured absenteeism from work and school. Participants in the hypertonic saline group experienced fewer days of work, school or days they were unable to participate in usual activity; 7 days in the hypertonic saline group as compared to 24 days in the control group (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). The meta-analysis of the data demonstrated a significant improvement in CFQ 14+, MD 7.77 (95% CI 1.86 to 13.68) in hypertonic saline group compared to the control group but no difference was seen in the CFQ parent and overall SF-36 score.<BR/>

<P>Elkins reported pulmonary exacerbations as a secondary outcome and found there were fewer exacerbations requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy in the hypertonic saline group than in the control group. The mean number of exacerbations per participant in the control group was 0.89, as compared with 0.39 in the hypertonic saline group (difference, 0.50 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.86); P = 0.02). The mean number of days on which participants met this exacerbation definition was 17 days in the control group and six days in the hypertonic saline group (difference, 11 days (95% CI 3 to 19); P = 0.02). The interval during which participants remained free of exacerbations was also significantly longer in the hypertonic saline group than in the control group (P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Exacerbations defined according to signs and symptoms alone, regardless of treatment, were also less frequent in the hypertonic saline group compared to control (1.32 per participant and 2.74 per participant respectively (difference, 1.42 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.99); P &lt; 0.001). The mean number of days during which participants met criteria for a symptom-defined exacerbation was 69 days in the control group and 22 days in the hypertonic saline group (difference, 47 days (95% CI 30 to 63); P &lt; 0.001). The time participants remained free of exacerbations was significantly longer in the hypertonic saline group (P &lt; 0.001), with a 48-week exacerbation free survival rate of 41% in the hypertonic saline group and 16% in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).

<P>The Chadwick trial demonstrated that participants with an FEV<SUB>1</SUB> of 40% to 70% at baseline had a significant fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> following isotonic saline, while none of the participants fell significantly with hypertonic saline (<LINK REF="STD-Chadwick-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Chadwick 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Eng trial there were similar reports of increased cough and haemoptysis, one participant in the hypertonic saline group had to withdraw because of haemoptysis though it was not clear if this was directly related to treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). In the hypertonic saline group, one complained of chest tightness and one of throat irritation, with none in the isotonic saline group complaining of these symptoms.</P>
<P>In the 1999 Robinson trial, despite participants being pre-treated with terbutaline, there was a tendency for those who received hypertonic saline to have a larger fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> within five minutes of receiving hypertonic saline, although the difference was not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). Participants who received hypertonic saline described higher scores for throat irritation on a VAS compared to isotonic saline control, though the number describing throat irritation was not stated. Frequency of cough in those treated with hypertonic saline could not be directly compared to the days when they received the isotonic saline control as to they were encouraged to cough on the control days to match the active day's cough so as not to confound the results of the mucociliary clearance data.</P>
<P>The Elkins trial reported adverse events as pulmonary exacerbations, chest pain, gastro-intestinal symptoms, headache, joint pain, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. These were significantly fewer in the hypertonic saline group. Adverse drug reactions were also reported, these were events that in the opinion of the investigator related directly to the trial medication. These were significantly higher in the hypertonic saline (14) group than the control (1) P = 0.01 and included cough, chest tightness, pharyngitis, haemoptysis, sinusitis, sneezing, tonsillitis and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:30:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The pulmonary complications of CF continue to have the greatest impact on mortality and morbidity. Recurrent infection and tenacious, difficult to clear mucus, characterise the disorder, particularly as lung function declines.<BR/>
<BR/>Treatment to improve mucociliary clearance with nebulised rhDNase is known to be effective in improving lung function in CF and has been adopted in most countries. However, the long-term efficacy of rhDNase is still a matter of debate (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). Nebulised rhDNase is an expensive treatment and in many countries its use is restricted to those who have moderate degrees of impairment of lung function and who demonstrate an improvement in pulmonary function tests during a trial period (<LINK REF="REF-Ramsey-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramsey 1994</LINK>). This effectively means that a significant proportion of people with CF are ineligible for this form of treatment. There are also some individuals whose lung function does not improve with rhDNase or who are unable to tolerate it due to side effects and an alternative agent to enhance mucociliary clearance would be desirable. In addition rhDNase is thought to increase mucociliary clearance by breaking down DNA debris in the sputum. However, this is likely to be only one of many factors that reduce mucociliary clearance in CF and agents that target alternative abnormalities and increase mucociliary clearance may have additive effects in combination with rhDNase.<BR/>
<BR/>Hypertonic saline represents a potential alternative or supplementary therapy to improve mucociliary clearance to nebulised rhDNase. We reviewed the available literature to determine what evidence was available to support the use of nebulised hypertonic saline in CF. In general, the amount of information available from trials of hypertonic saline in CF was limited due to their small size and medium-term duration (less than three months of treatment with hypertonic saline) of most of the trials. The most recent, and only, long-term trial investigating hypertonic saline (7%) failed to show an improvement in lung function when compared to isotonic saline (0.09%) with regards to the primary outcome of FEV<SUB>1</SUB> (48 weeks). Based on the secondary outcomes from this trial, there is evidence that hypertonic saline decreases the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, along with absenteeism from work or school. There is also less compelling evidence that it may improve at least some aspects of quality of life in adult participants, but not in children over the 48 weeks of treatment. hypertonic saline does not increase the bacterial load of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> or <I>S. aureus</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). While the trials assessed examined efficacy in comparable populations with CF and were well designed, the effect of treatment with hypertonic saline on lung function was small and with the exception of Elkins (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>) they had relatively small numbers and were of insufficient duration to determine if the effect on lung function would be of lasting clinical benefit.<BR/>
<BR/>An immediate effect on measures of mucociliary clearance was demonstrated over isotonic saline and cough alone in a series of trials from Robinson and Riedler that demonstrated increase sputum clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Riedler-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Riedler 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). They showed that a dose of 7% hypertonic saline was more effective than 3%, but no significant advantage was gained by increasing the dose to 12% or by adding amiloride. While they performed a dose-response effect of varying concentrations of saline they did not look at the impact of the volume nebulised. These were all small short-term trials that were proof of concept, but did not address clinical efficacy.<BR/>
<BR/>Six trials looked at the effect of hypertonic saline on lung function. Eng demonstrated a significant increase in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> compared to isotonic saline control measured after two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>). Ballmann compared hypertonic saline 5.75% 10 ml twice-daily to nebulised rhDNase 2.5 mg and found that in both groups FEV<SUB>1</SUB> improved to a similar degree in three weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>). In contrast, Weller who used only 5 ml of hypertonic saline, found that it did not significantly improve pulmonary function, though Mistabron® did (<LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). There was a trend toward improved lung function in the Elkins trial but this did not reach significance following analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). However, the pooled results of these trials did show a significant improvement in lung function at 2 to 4 weeks. In addition, in the larger trial by Suri (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>), hypertonic saline 7% 5 ml twice-daily was compared to daily and alternate-daily rhDNase 2.5 mg. The participants when treated with either rhDNase regimen had a significant improvement in lung function from baseline, but when treated with hypertonic saline there was an increase of only 3% from baseline, less than seen in Ballmann and Eng (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>). In both of these trials 10 ml of hypertonic saline was used compared to 5 ml used by Suri and Weller (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weller-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Weller 1980</LINK>). This raises the possibility that the effectiveness of treatment may also depend on the total volume of saline nebulised and this may account for the lower effect size seen by Suri (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). In addition, Suri found a wide variation in response to treatment with both rhDNase and hypertonic saline, with over 50% demonstrating an increase in FEV1 of greater than 10% with rhDNase and 35% with hypertonic saline. Thus, despite the overall reduced effect seen with hypertonic saline on lung function in individuals, both rhDNase and hypertonic saline have the potential to substantially improve lung function in the medium term. The wide variation seen in response to both hypertonic saline and rhDNase raises the possibility that there may be subgroups of people with CF who are more likely to respond to efforts to improve mucociliary clearance. It also suggests that some individuals may respond better to one treatment compared to the other and physicians may wish to consider this particularly in individuals who fail to respond to rhDNase.<BR/>
<BR/>None of the trials were of sufficient duration or size to assess mortality and while some evidence is available on the impact on lung function this is of insufficient duration to infer any effect on overall survival.<BR/>
<BR/>Symptom improvement was assessed by Robinson and Eng using simple VAS to measure improvements in symptoms in response to hypertonic saline and found that there was an improvement in feelings of better chest clearance, exercise tolerance and quality of sleep (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1996</LINK>). Suri found no differences between those treated with rhDNase and hypertonic saline for 12 weeks in terms of change in exercise tolerance, dyspnoea, oxygen saturation during exercise and symptom score (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). All treatment arms experienced a high frequency of pulmonary exacerbations, but this may be a reflection of the severity of the groups underlying lung disease.<BR/>
<BR/>Delivery time for hypertonic saline appears longer compared to rhDNase and this may have implications for adherence to treatment. Suri and Elkins examined adherence, which appeared high and comparable to rhDNase in Suri three-month trial (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>) and isotonic saline in the Elkins trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). In terms of cost both Ballmann and Suri found hypertonic saline to be less expensive compared to rhDNase (<LINK REF="STD-Ballmann-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ballmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The only trials in which adverse events were reported in detail were those by Eng, Robinson and Suri and Elkins (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>). Acute bronchospasm remains a concern with hypertonic saline. Despite pre-treatment of participants with bronchodilators, three were excluded from the Suri trial due to a fall in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> greater than 15% (<LINK REF="STD-Suri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Suri 2001</LINK>) and in Robinson there was a tendency towards a fall in FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>compared to control (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1999</LINK>). Symptoms such as cough and throat irritation do appear to be more frequent in hypertonic saline compared to control, but this does not appear to have been a serious enough side effect to have led to participant withdrawals. In the Eng trial, one participant did withdraw from the hypertonic saline group because of haemoptysis; although it is not proven that this was a consequence of the treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Eng-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Eng 1996</LINK>).<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:26:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Unlike RhDNAse, hypertonic saline can not be said to lead to an improvement in lung function in the long term. While it has been shown to lead to a small improvement in lung function up to four weeks of treatment, this effect was not sustained at 48 weeks and this was the primary outcome measure of the only long term clinical trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elkins-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Elkins 2006a</LINK>). It was shown however in this trial to reduce the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations and may have a small effect on improvement in quality of life in adults. Hypertonic saline in a concentration of 5% to 7% has been shown to improve mucociliary clearance when delivered by an ultrasonic nebuliser. When delivered following a bronchodilator it appears to be an inexpensive and safe additional therapy for people with CF.<BR/>
<BR/>In view of these findings the authors believe there is evidence to recommend the use of hypertonic saline in CF but it should not be used in preference to rhDNAse. At this stage the benefit appears to be a reduction in pulmonary exacerbation frequency, though evidence does not exist to say it works best in patients with frequent exacerbations.<BR/>
<BR/>The variation in response seen in individuals to both rhDNase and hypertonic saline raises the possibility that certain individuals will respond better to one agent compared to the other. At this point it would be reasonable to conduct N = 1 trial on people with CF who fail to respond, are ineligible or are unable to tolerate rhDNase, with hypertonic saline as an alternative agent to increase mucociliary clearance. Unfortunately there are no data on effects of hypertonic saline in combination with rhDNase.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-02-18 15:11:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Concern remains about the ability of hypertonic saline to improve pulmonary disease in the long term. The reduction in frequency of pulmonary exacerbation is potentially very important but was not of a magnitude to see a substantial improvement in quality of life. It would be valuable to see the effect of hypertonic saline in a longer term clinical trial to see if there is a sustained reduction in exacerbation frequency and to see if this translates to a more compelling improvement in quality of life.<BR/>
<BR/>Future assessments of efficacy for agents that improve mucociliary clearance, including hypertonic saline either alone or in comparison should consider using validated quality of life measures or pulmonary exacerbations as their primary outcomes rather than lung function, to allow adequate powering of clinical trials. The improvements in lung function that have been seen are relatively small and the importance of the effect that hypertonic saline has on pulmonary exacerbations needs to be determined in longer term clinical trials.<BR/>Consideration should be given to defining if there are patient groups that will respond better to HS or other mucociliary clearance agents, especially rhDNAse to better tailor treatment. Consideration should be given to a trial that assesses the effect hypertonic saline has on individuals with frequent pulmonary exacerbations to see if this group has a greater response to treatment.<BR/>
<BR/>Future trials should consider HS in conjunction with other mucociliary clearance regimes, or targeting individuals who fail to gain benefit from rhDNAse. Trials that combine mucociliary agents also need to be considered to assess efficacy. There is a now an additional need to establish the efficacy, dose response, nebulising time and patient adherence using the newer electronic mesh nebuliser technology.</P>
