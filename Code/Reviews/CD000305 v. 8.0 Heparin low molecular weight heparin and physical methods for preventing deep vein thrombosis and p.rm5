<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In the first substantive update, appearing in Issue 4, 2002, the main changes were:<BR/>1. The search date was extended to March 2002.<BR/>2. Five new trials were included (Borris 1995; Eskander 1997; Figuerido 1994; Kew 1999; TIFDED 1999).<BR/>3. This resulted in two new comparisons: Heparin versus mechanical methods (Eskander 1997; Figuerido 1994); and dalteparin versus enoxaparin (two LMW heparins) in the miscellaneous category (TIFDED 1999).<BR/>4. Six trials were excluded and three trials, requiring further information, placed in Studies awaiting assessment.<BR/>5. One trial (Jorgensen 1998), formerly Jorgensen 1995, was transfered from the heparin versus control comparison to the miscellaneous category.<BR/>6. Relative risks instead of Peto odds ratios were calculated.<BR/>7. Synopsis added.<BR/>8. Conclusion adjusted to accommodate the favourable results for low-dose aspirin from the PEP trial.</P>

<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Heparins and some mechanical pumping devices may help prevent blood clots forming in the legs after surgery for hip fracture</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Patients with hip fracture may develop blood clots (thrombosis) in their legs. Some of these blood clots may travel to the lungs and cause a blockage (embolism), which can be fatal. Various drugs and physical devices are sometimes used to try and prevent these complications. This review of randomised trials found that both heparins and mechanical pumping devices significantly decrease the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. There was not enough evidence to conclude about the effect on lung (pulmonary) embolism, mortality or possible side effects for either heparin or mechanical methods. </P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:38:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Hip fracture patients have a high risk of thrombo-embolic complications following surgical management.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the effects of heparin (unfractionated (U), and low molecular weight (LMW) heparins), and physical methods (compression stockings, calf or foot pumps) for prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism after surgery for hip fracture in the elderly.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:38:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (up to March 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2002), EMBASE (1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (1982 to February week 4 2002), Current Contents (1993 week 26 to 2002 week 12), reference lists of published articles and contacted trialists and other workers in the field. Date of most recent search: March 2002.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the use of heparins and physical agents for prevention of DVT and pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Trials were grouped into five categories (heparin versus control, mechanical versus control, LMW heparin versus U heparin, heparin versus mechanical, and miscellaneous) and results pooled where possible.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>The 31 included trials involved at least 2958 predominantly female and elderly patients. Overall, trial quality was disappointing.</P>
<P>Ten trials involving 826 patients which compared U heparin with control, and five trials of 373 patients which compared LMW heparin with control, showed a reduction in the incidence of lower limb DVT (124/474 (26%) versus 219/519 (42%); relative risk (RR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71). There were insufficient data to confirm the efficacy of either agent in the prevention of pulmonary embolism. There was no statistically significant difference in overall mortality (42/356 (12%) versus 38/374 (10%); RR 1.16; 95%CI 0.77 to 1.74). Data were inadequate for all other outcomes including wound complications. There is insufficient evidence from five trials, involving 644 patients, to establish if LMW heparin was superior to U heparin. Most trials evaluating heparins had methodological defects.</P>
<P>Five trials, involving 487 patients, testing mechanical pumping devices were also methodologically flawed, and so pooled results need to be viewed cautiously. Mechanical pumping devices may protect against DVT (16/221 (7%) versus 52/229 (22%); RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.51) and pulmonary embolism. Data were insufficient to establish any effect on the incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism and overall mortality. Problems with skin abrasion and compliance were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>U and LMW heparins protect against lower limb DVT. There is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin.</P>
<P>Foot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent DVT, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem.</P>
<P>Good quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-11 16:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Thrombo-embolic complications have been and remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hip fracture patients (<LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haake-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haake 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1995</LINK>). Some studies have shown that as many as one third to one half of all patients after hip fracture will develop a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Salzman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salzman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haake-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haake 1989</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1995</LINK> reported that 4% of the group who did not receive prophylaxis had a fatal pulmonary embolism. Although the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is frequently advocated in elective hip surgery, heparin or other anticoagulants are less frequently used in patients with hip fracture (<LINK REF="REF-Rodgers-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodgers 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Todd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Todd 1995</LINK>). As patients with fracture undergo a coagulative response at the time of their injury before any surgical intervention, the effectiveness of prophylaxis in this group may differ from that in patients undergoing elective hip surgery. However, some authors have suggested that failure to use thromboprophylaxis in major orthopaedic surgery could indicate medical negligence (<LINK REF="REF-Parker_x002d_Williams-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker-Williams 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>A large number of studies have evaluated various prophylactic measures against thromboembolic complications in hip fracture patients. Agents used include aspirin, warfarin, heparin (low dose, standard or unfractionated (U) heparin, and low molecular weight (LMW) heparin), dextran and pneumatic leg compression devices. With few exceptions, most of these studies have been relatively small. One notable exception, reported after the first version of this review, is the PEP trial (<LINK REF="REF-PEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEP 2000</LINK>) which compared low-dose aspirin versus placebo in over 13,000 patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. Overviews of thromboprophylaxis in hip surgery available at the time of the first version of the review included both elective orthopaedic and hip fracture patients (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lassen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nurmohamed-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nurmohamed 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>). Also available was an overview on antiplatelet thromboprophylaxis from the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration which included data on patients undergoing orthopaedic (elective or traumatic) surgery (<LINK REF="REF-APT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT 1994</LINK>). We noted in the first version of our review that some of these overviews were outdated and some others had limitations in the identification of trials and in the range of interventions and outcomes measured. We concluded that a systematic review of the effect of available, and most commonly used, prophylactic regimens in hip fracture surgery was therefore indicated. While we planned initially to review systemic and oral anticoagulants, plasma expanders, antiplatelet agents, anaesthetic techniques and mechanical methods (<LINK REF="REF-Protocol" TYPE="REFERENCE">Protocol</LINK>), the size of the task compelled us to revise the scope of this review to include only the use of heparin and mechanical methods, which are currently in common use. This is an update of our review first published in 1997 (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the evidence for effectiveness and safety of thrombo-embolic prophylaxis involving heparin (U and LMW heparins) and physical methods, in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.</P>
<P>The specific null hypotheses we aimed to test for these interventions and patient group were:</P>
<P>1. No differences exist in outcomes (DVT, pulmonary embolism, mortality and adverse effects) between any intervention and no intervention.</P>
<P>2. No differences exist in outcomes between different types of intervention.</P>
<P>3. No differences exist in outcomes between patients under 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and over.</P>
<P>Readers should note that lack of available evidence means that we have been unable to test the third hypothesis.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-11 16:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Any randomised or quasi-randomised (methods of allocating participants to a treatment which are not strictly random e.g. by date of birth, hospital record number, alternation) clinical trial of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of DVT and pulmonary thromboembolism in a population undergoing hip fracture surgery which met the specifications listed below was considered.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials which included patients of all ages and both sexes undergoing surgery for proximal femoral fracture. If possible, hip fracture patients who were included in a trial without undergoing hip surgery, were included in analysis on an intention-to-treat basis. Trials which exclusively focused on proximal fractures in children or in high energy fracture in young adults were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The interventions tested were injectable anticoagulants (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins), and physical agents such as compression stockings and arteriovenous foot pumps. These were compared with placebo, no treatment or with each other. Comparisons involving the use of other agents (such as dihydroergotamine (DHE)) or methods in conjunction with these interventions were also included provided these agents or methods were applied to all groups in the study. Other injectable anticoagulants such as dermatan sulphate were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main outcomes of interest were:<BR/>1. DVT (any site, proximal segment or below knee). Wherever possible a distinction was made between active follow-up (scheduled studies) and passive follow-up (prompted by clinical indication) of the above techniques.<BR/>2. Pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosed at autopsy or during life.<BR/>3. Death within the study treatment period, or up to six months of hip fracture surgery. Where autopsy evidence for cause of death was available, this was noted.<BR/>4. Complications associated with the particular intervention including wound haemorrhage, wound infection, wound haematoma (diagnosed either clinically, by ultrasound or by the need for reoperation) and other local side effects. Systemic complications including gastrointestinal haemorrhage, stroke and others e.g. haematuria. <BR/>5. The development of the postphlebitic limb. <BR/>6. The length of hospital stay and any other data which would enable an economic evaluation.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-11 16:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the update of the review, the search for trials was extended from September 1996 to March 2002. Details of the original search strategy are given in the previous version of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Handoll-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Handoll 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register (to March 2002). The Specialised Register is compiled from multiple databases, including regular searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE (which combines subject specific terms with the optimal trial search strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>)), EMBASE and CINAHL, and handsearch results. For further details see the search strategy in the group's module in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>.</P>
<P>In addition, the following subject-specific searches were undertaken:</P>
<P>a. Electronic search of MEDLINE (from 1966 to March 2002), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (1982 to February Week 4 2002) and Current Contents (1993 Week 26 to 2002 Week 12).</P>
<P>In MEDLINE (OVID-Web), the first two sections of the optimal search strategy for randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>) were combined with the specific search terms (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). Similar search strategies were used for EMBASE (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and CINAHL (not shown).</P>
<P>b. The reference lists of all identified trials and review articles were searched.</P>
<P>c. Colleagues and trialists were contacted, as well as some manufacturers.</P>
<P>Articles of randomised trials in languages other than English which were identified by the search strategies a, b and c were included, and translations obtained.</P>

<P>
<B>Selecting trials for inclusion</B>
</P>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating thromboprophylaxis in hip fracture surgery were considered for inclusion by at least two of the review authors. In instances where it was not clear whether the trial was randomised or whether hip fracture patients were involved, a request for further information was sent to the trialist.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
</P>
<P>Methodological quality for each study was independently assessed, without masking, by two review authors using a pre-derived and piloted scoring system. The scoring scheme for the eleven aspects of internal and external validity covered by this scheme plus brief notes of coding guidelines for selected items are given below. Also presented are the specific scores for items *10 and *11 for the primary outcome of DVT.</P>
<P>*1. Was the assigned treatment adequately concealed prior to allocation?<BR/>3 = method did not allow disclosure of assignment.<BR/>1 = small but possible chance of disclosure of assignment or unclear.<BR/>0 = quasi-randomised or open list/tables.<BR/>Cochrane code: Clearly Yes = A; Not sure = B; Clearly No = C.</P>
<P>*2. Were the outcomes of patients who withdrew described and included in the analysis (intention to treat)?<BR/>3 = withdrawals well described and accounted for in analysis.<BR/>1 = withdrawals described and analysis not possible.<BR/>0 = no mention, inadequate mention, or obvious differences and no adjustment.</P>
<P>*3. Were the outcome assessors blinded to treatment status?<BR/>3 = effective action taken to blind assessors.<BR/>1 = small or moderate chance of unblinding of assessors.<BR/>0 = not mentioned or not possible.</P>
<P>*4. Were important baseline characteristics reported and comparable?<BR/>The principal confounders were considered to be age (&gt;5 years difference), previous DVT (&gt;5% difference), known malignancy (&gt;5% difference) and type of fracture (intra/extracapsular) (&gt;5% difference).<BR/>3 = good comparability of groups, or confounding adjusted for in analysis.<BR/>1 = confounding small; mentioned but not adjusted for.<BR/>0 = large potential for confounding, or not discussed.</P>
<P>*5. Were the patients blind to assignment status after allocation?<BR/>3 = effective action taken to blind patients.<BR/>1 = small or moderate chance of unblinding of patients.<BR/>0 = not possible, or not mentioned (unless double-blind), or possible but not done.</P>
<P>*6. Were the treatment providers blind to assignment status?<BR/>3 = effective action taken to blind treatment providers.<BR/>1 = small or moderate chance of unblinding of treatment providers.<BR/>0 = not possible, or not mentioned (unless double-blind), or possible but not done.</P>
<P>*7. Were care programmes, other than the trial options, identical?<BR/>Examples of clinically important differences in other interventions which could act as active measures for DVT prevention, or possible risk factors, were considered to be: time of operation (12 hour difference), duration of operation (30 minutes difference), type of implant/fixation (&gt;5% difference), anaesthetic used within broad categories (&gt;5% difference), difference in rehabilitation (&gt;5% difference).<BR/>3 = care programmes clearly identical.<BR/>1 = clear but trivial differences.<BR/>0 = not mentioned or clear and important differences in care programmes.</P>
<P>*8. Were the inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry clearly defined?<BR/>3 = clearly defined.<BR/>1 = inadequately defined.<BR/>0 = not defined.</P>
<P>*9. Were the outcome measures used clearly defined? (by outcome measure)<BR/>3 = clearly defined.<BR/>1 = inadequately defined.<BR/>0 = not defined.</P>
<P>*10. Were the accuracy, precision, and observer variation of the outcome measures adequate (and clinically useful)? (by outcome measure)<BR/>3 = optimal.<BR/>1 = adequate.<BR/>0 = not defined, not adequate.<BR/>For DVT:<BR/>Score 3 if: a) All participants underwent bilateral ascending venography, or b) all participants underwent bilateral duplex ultrasound scanning with radioactive fibrinogen scan followed by venography in limbs found positive or equivocal, or c) all participants underwent bilateral strain gauge plethysmography followed by venography in limbs found positive.<BR/>Score 1 if: a) Participants underwent bilateral duplex ultrasound scanning, radioactive fibrinogen scan, or plethysmography alone, or b) participants underwent evaluation using the techniques listed in the previous category, of operated limb only.<BR/>Score 0 if: None of the above.<BR/>
<BR/>*11. Was the timing (e.g. duration of surveillance) clinically appropriate? (by outcome measure)<BR/>3 = optimal.<BR/>1 = adequate.<BR/>0 = not defined, not adequate.<BR/>For DVT:<BR/>Score 3 if minimum 4 week follow-up.<BR/>Score 1 if 10 days, under 4 weeks.<BR/>Score 0 if under 10 days.</P>
<P>Disagreement was resolved by scrutiny from a third reviewer. When appropriate, clarification of the method of randomisation, numbers randomised and analysed, blinding and methods used to detect DVT, pulmonary embolism and cause of death were requested from trialists.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods used to collect data from included trials</B>
</P>
<P>Data were independently extracted by two reviewers and, if necessary, adjudicated by a third using a subject specific and piloted data extraction tool. Where necessary, trialists were contacted directly in order to complete these.</P>
<P>
<B>Methods used to synthesize data</B>
</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between comparable trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test within RevMan and was considered to be significant when P &lt; 0.1. For each study, relative risks and 99% confidence limits were calculated for discrete outcomes, and mean differences and 99% confidence limits for continuous outcomes. When appropriate, results of comparable groups of trials were pooled, and 95% confidence limits calculated, using both fixed and random effects models. Where appropriate, good quality trials (here defined as those scoring 16 or above, out of a possible 33, using the above) were pooled separately. General sensitivity analyses were also undertaken to test the effect of the quality of allocation concealment (Cochrane score: A, B or C) and loss to follow-up. Any tests of interaction that were calculated to determine if the results for subgroups were significantly different are based on odds ratio results.</P>

Further information is required for the inclusion or exclusion of the remaining five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Haentjens-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Haentjens 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Krska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perhoniemi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Perhoniemi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zouboulis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zouboulis 1997</LINK>), all of which include hip fracture patients. Requests for further information have been sent. The prospect of a randomised trial comparing low molecular weight heparin with unfractionated heparin was mentioned in <LINK REF="STD-Barsotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barsotti 1990</LINK>. However confirmation of the existence of this trial has not been obtained.</P>
<P>Of the newly identified trials in this, the first, update, five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Borris-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Borris 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>) were included, six trials were excluded, and three trials, requiring further information, await assessment. The publication of <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>, formerly <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1995</LINK>, resulted in the transfer of this trial from the heparin versus control comparison to the miscellaneous category.</P>
<P>The 31 included trials involved at least 2958 predominantly female and elderly patients for the interventions focused on in this review. Aside from the <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK> study, sited in four centres in four European countries, trials were based in one of 17, mainly European, countries. The trials took place from 1970 (<LINK REF="STD-Gallus-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 1973</LINK>) up to 1995 (<LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>). Details of the individual trials are given in the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>Drug administration in all heparin studies was by injection. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Barsotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barsotti 1990</LINK> and one intervention group each of <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>, interventions were started pre-operatively. No details of the timing of LMW heparin injections were provided in <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>. Of the six studies testing physical interventions, only <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK> began pre-operatively.</P>
<P>The application of additional methods of DVT prophylaxis such as early mobilisation and use of simple or graduated compression stockings to all groups in a study was recorded by 10 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Summaries of the studies grouped according to main comparisons are given below.</P>
<P>
<B>Heparin (U or LMW heparin) versus placebo or no treatment</B>
</P>
<P>The 10 included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallus-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahnborg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lahnborg 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svend_x002d_Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Svend-Hansen 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xabregas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Xabregas 1978</LINK>) comparing U heparin with placebo or no treatment involved 826 patients, mainly female (between 66 and 100% of those randomised), and elderly (where given, the mean ages ranged from 73 to 79 years). The percentage of cervical or intracapsular hip fractures enumerated in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>) ranged between 47% to 57%. Most of the other studies only stated that the fractures were of the hip or femoral neck.</P>
<P>LMW heparin was compared with placebo in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK>) and with no treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>. These involved 373 patients, who were predominantly female (over 75%) and elderly in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>. No information on the participants was available in the abstract containing information on the two Sourmelis trials, which differed in the inclusion of patients with pertrochanteric fractures only in <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK> and cervical fractures only in <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK>. The numbers of females and males were equal in the LMW heparin group of <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>, but there was over twice the number of males than females in the control group (17 to 8).</P>
<P>
<B>Mechanical methods versus control</B>
</P>
<P>Mechanical methods of prophylaxis were compared with control in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>) involving a total of 487 patients, again mostly female and elderly. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>) tested pneumatic sequential or cyclic leg compression devices, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK> employed A-V impulse system foot pumps on the affected limb. It was stated in <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK> that no other method of prophylaxis was employed, and this was also likely in <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK> only included patients with subcapital fractures. Fracture type was either not defined or enumerated in the other four studies. We found no randomised trial testing the use of simple thrombo-embolism stockings after hip fracture.</P>
<P>
<B>LMW heparin versus U heparin</B>
</P>
<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>) compared LMW heparin with U heparin and involved a total of 306 elderly patients (mean age 76 years). <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> gave no details of the gender or fracture type. <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK> confirmed the unusually low numbers of females in their study, just 22%, but could offer no explanation. For <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>, 82% were female. The proportion of intracapsular fractures was 19% (<LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>) and 41% (<LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>), comprising a total of 338 patients, compared LMW heparin plus dihydroergotamine (DHE) with U heparin plus DHE. The brief report of <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>, from a poster, provided no further details of the patient population. In <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>, the participants were aged between 42 and 99 years, 73% were female, and 53% had intracapsular fractures.</P>
<P>
<B>Heparin versus mechanical methods</B>
</P>
<P>The two studies falling into this new category are reported separately in this review, due to differences in their comparisons and the serious methodological flaws in <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> compared LMW heparin with intermittent pneumatic compression in 36 patients (mean age 76 years; 56% were female). <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK> compared LMW heparin versus intermittent pneumatic compression up to 48 hours post-operatively followed by LMW heparin. LMW heparin was stopped seven days after the operation in both groups. Despite contact with the trialists, the number of patients actually randomised into <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK> remains unknown. Results were presented for 45 patients (mean age 79.5 years; 84% were female), but this did not include the 10 who died during the trial period and others excluded after trial entry.</P>
<P>
<B>Miscellaneous comparisons</B>
</P>
<P>Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Barsotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barsotti 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taberner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taberner 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>) have been grouped together in this review under 'miscellaneous'. <LINK REF="STD-Barsotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barsotti 1990</LINK> compared giving LMW heparin as a single dose or two doses and involved 103 mainly female (80%) and elderly (mean age 82 years) patients. <LINK REF="STD-Taberner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taberner 1989</LINK>, involving only 28 mainly female (86%) patients of ages ranging from 43 to 91 years, compared adjusted low dose (U) heparin with fixed low dose (U) heparin. <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK> randomised 325 patients to start LMW heparin pre-operatively or post-operatively. (In <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>, the actual comparison was LMW heparin started on day of admission versus on day of surgery.) A placebo control was used in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>, which involved mainly female (77%) and elderly (mean age 79 years) patients. Few details were available in the brief report (a conference abstract) of <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>, reported as being a pilot study, compared two LMW heparins (dalteparin and enoxaparin) started pre-operatively in 132 patients.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-08-11 11:40:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>In the first instance, methodological quality assessment was based on three measures of internal validity: adequate allocation concealment (Cochrane score A, B or C), blinded outcome assessment and intention-to-treat analysis. Details of these and the related items, method of randomisation and loss to follow-up for individual trials are given in the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
<P>No details of the method of randomisation were given for nine studies with only scanty information being provided for a further five. Most of the remaining trials used sealed envelopes (8 out of 16). Allocation was done externally by a pharmacist in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xabregas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Xabregas 1978</LINK>). Eleven trials stated that they were double-blind trials. Quasi-randomised methods employed by four trials were allocation by date of birth (<LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>) and alternation (<LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>). Based on the details given for the method of randomisation including blinding, allocation was judged to be concealed in only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gallus-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some blinding of assessors, often for confirmatory venography, was reported in 11 studies, with independent assessors described in a further three studies. Potential bias was introduced in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>) by large losses often due to 'protocol violations' such as non-compliance and/or no venography. However, intention to analyses were still carried out in <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>. Potential bias was also indicated in the imbalances between the two groups of <LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK> in the numbers randomised and the numbers excluded from the analyses.</P>
<P>The results of the methodological quality assessment scheme for individual studies, grouped by comparison, are given below. The range of overall scores was 3 to 29 (out of a maximum of 33) with a mean score of 13.6. The low scores of <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK> (5), <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK> (3), <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK> (3) and <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK> (5) are likely to reflect that there were only brief reports in abstract form for these studies. A zero for an individual item may indicate that there was insufficient information to make a judgement.</P>
<P>Scores for items 9, 10 and 11 below relate to the diagnosis of DVT. Additional outcome-specific criteria were available for other main outcomes. For item 10, trials in which participants underwent bilateral ascending venography, or bilateral duplex ultrasound scanning, fibrinogen scanning or strain gauge plethysmography followed by confirmatory venography scored 3. For item 11, a minimum follow-up of four weeks was necessary to score 3, and of 10 days to score 1.</P>
<P>A scatter plot of score against year of publication, showed no trend to improved trial quality with time. The results of various sensitivity analyses testing the effects of individual items are reported in the results section.</P>

<P>All trials included in the review were identifiable via electronic database searches with the exception of four studies available only in abstracts from conference proceedings (<LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>), two unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> which is published within a book. Translations were required for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK>) whose results were not reported in English.</P>
<P>Requests for clarification of methodology, results and additional data were sent to trialists for all studies except <LINK REF="STD-Svend_x002d_Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Svend-Hansen 1981</LINK> whom we were unable to locate. Responses were obtained from trialists of 14 trials, mainly of those completed in the last decade. Additional information was provided for 11 trials, as noted in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. For the original version of this review, an unpublished report (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1995</LINK>) of the now published trial <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> and the full report of <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> were both provided by the trialists involved. Individual patient and some tabular data, and a translated summary of methods were provided for <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Any heparin versus control/ placebo </B>
</P>
<P>The results for this comparison are presented for any heparin with subdivisions provided for unfractionated (U) and low molecular weight (LMW) heparin. Separate analyses investigating the effects of aspects of methodological quality such as allocation concealment and loss to follow-up, which involved omission of individual trials or various subgroupings were also performed.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of all 15 studies was DVT, which was the sole outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>. All studies, even those constrained by brief reports, gave some details of the method used to detect DVT. However, as can be seen in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table, a full description of methodology, which would include details of the timing (frequency, duration), the detection method and how applied (bilateral or ipsilateral), and assessor blinding, was rare. Routine or confirmatory venography was applied in eight studies, I-125 fibrinogen scanning in nine studies, and duplex ultrasound scanning in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK>). Clinical examination was the sole method used in <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>. The results of 10 randomised patients of <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> who were found to have DVT prior to surgery were not included in the analyses for this outcome. The results of the appraisal of the methodological quality of DVT detection presented above (items 9, 10 and 11 of the methodological results) show that only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gallus-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>) satisfied the criteria for the method of detection (item 10, described earlier). The surveillance period for DVT was usually either in the 7 to 10 day range, or until ambulation or discharge. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xabregas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Xabregas 1978</LINK>) provided information establishing that their DVT detection period extended beyond the application of the interventions under test.</P>
<P>Data for proximal DVT were given in eight studies, and for distal DVT in six studies. In presenting the outcome data for DVT, the category 'any', refers to any mention of DVT whether proximal, distal or undefined. 'Any' DVT was not available for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK>) where separate proximal (above knee) and distal (below knee) DVT data were provided with no indication of the overall figures.</P>
<P>There was a significant reduction in incidence of 'any' DVT when heparin is compared with either placebo or control (124/474 (26%) versus 219/519 (42%); relative risk (RR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71). The statistically significant heterogeneity for the U heparin trials (p = 0.009) and overall (p = 0.022) can be attributed to the inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>, the only trial showing the converse effect. Removal of <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK> and the other quasi-randomised trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>) improved the agreement (p = 0.17 for U heparin trials; p = 0.3 overall: both non-significant) without markedly affecting the results (RR 0.56; 95%CI 0.47 to 0.67) (not shown). An analysis of the five 'good quality' trials which achieved 16 or above in our methodological quality assessment similarly did not affect the results.</P>
<P>Further analyses exploring the influence of indicators of methodological quality were performed. Analyses, based on Peto odds ratios to enable testing for interaction, are presented for U heparin to examine the effects of allocation concealment, blinding of participants by use of placebo, and the relative duration of intervention and DVT detection. A separate analysis exploring the effects of loss to follow-up is presented for two LMW heparin trials.</P>
<P>Whilst allocation concealment in these studies did not appear to influence effect size, the treatment effect differs significantly between those rated A or B compared with the two quasi-randomised trials rated C (Z=2.17, P=0.03). Although for some (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK>), the exclusion of quasi-randomised trials is without question, we have remained undecided on this issue for three reasons. Firstly it is possible that those trials whose methods are unknown or which do not report adequate safeguards may also, like quasi-randomised trials, risk selection bias. Secondly, it is also possible that quasi-randomised trials can be conducted rigorously, such as by ensuring sequential inclusion, without selection bias. Thirdly, other aspects such as loss to follow-up and assessor blinding may also have an important impact on bias. Although we decided to include quasi-randomised trials in the overall analyses, separate investigations were also performed.</P>
<P>No difference was found between the results of placebo controlled and open trials. The low incidence of DVT in <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK> is likely to be explained by the use of clinical examination as the only means of detection.</P>
<P>One issue which emerged from the assessment of external validity was the relative duration of the intervention and DVT detection. Although the reduction in DVT appears less for those in which surveillance was continued after completion of U heparin treatment, compared with those where surveillance was stopped at the same time (or was of unknown duration), these results were not significantly different from each other (test for interaction, Z=1.74; P=0.08) to confirm this. Since only <LINK REF="STD-Xabregas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Xabregas 1978</LINK> provided separate data for DVT occurring during and after treatment and post treatment (the four DVT in the treatment group all occurred after heparin was stopped) there are insufficient data to address this issue.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK> suffered from a 17 per cent loss to follow-up; and thus conducted an incomplete intention-to-treat analysis. All 10 patients excluded from the analyses of <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> were found to have had DVT already. The results of worst and best case analyses where those in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK> who were not followed up are assumed to have DVT in the intervention group but not in the control group (worst case) or vice versa (best case), indicate an extreme view of the extent of uncertainty created by incomplete monitoring for these results.</P>
<P>Pooled data on the incidence of proximal DVT available from only seven studies showed a significant reduction (20/186 (11%) versus 45/218 (21%); RR 0.45; 95%CI 0.28 to 0.73). A significant result was also obtained for the pooling of data from six studies for distal DVT.</P>
<P>
<I>Pulmonary embolism</I>
</P>
<P>Pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported in 12 studies. Routine ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scanning for all participants was not performed, but was used on a confirmatory basis after clinical detection in <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>, and mention was made of radiological assessment in <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK>. In the other five studies referring to non-fatal PE, the method of detection was clinical alone, not clear or not documented. No studies reported the use of pulmonary angiography, the reference standard for PE. Fatal PE reported in eight trials was confirmed by autopsy data in at least some patients in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>). This will be discussed further in the section on mortality. In presenting the outcome data for pulmonary embolism, the category 'any', refers to any mention of PE whether fatal, non-fatal or unclear.</P>
<P>There was no difference observed in the incidence of 'any' PE between the groups. Although pooling of data from four studies showed a significant and homogeneous increase in the number of non-fatal PE in the U heparin group, these results should be interpreted with caution since all four studies relied on the clinical detection of PE. The potential for a reduction in fatal PE in the heparin group from results pooled from six U heparin trials and two LMW heparin trials is also shown (5/356 (0.1%) versus 14/374 (0.4%); RR 0.47; 95%CI 0.19 to 1.14) but is not confirmed and should be seen in the context of overall mortality and the incomplete autopsy data.</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>Nine studies mentioned mortality, but results were unavailable for <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1977</LINK>. Explicit reference to autopsy results was made in five studies but it was evident that some deaths, often post-discharge deaths, were not autopsied. Five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moskovitz-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Moskovitz 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svend_x002d_Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Svend-Hansen 1981</LINK>) gave causes of death for all deaths, whereas most of the others only selected out fatal PE. The length of follow-up was six months in <LINK REF="STD-Svend_x002d_Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Svend-Hansen 1981</LINK>. Post-discharge mortality was probably also monitored by <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>.</P>
<P>Mortality was increased but not significantly in the heparin group when compared with control or placebo (42/356 (12%) versus 38/374 (10%); RR 1.16; 95%CI 0.77 to 1.74). When reported fatal PE deaths are removed from these results, death from other causes becomes more markedly, but not statistically significantly, greater in the heparin group (37/356 (10%) versus 24/374 (6%); RR 1.58; 95%CI 0.98 to 2.55). The two trials mainly contributing to this result are <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK> where ten heparin and five control patients died of pneumonia and <LINK REF="STD-Svend_x002d_Hansen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Svend-Hansen 1981</LINK> where the two PE occurred in the first 14 days and the rest were 'miscellaneous causes' in nursing home patients over 75 years old.</P>
<P>
<I>Bleeding and other complications associated with the intervention</I>
</P>
<P>Overall, the quality of reporting of potential adverse effects was poor. Complications, primarily related to bleeding, were reported in 11 studies. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sourmelis-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">Sourmelis 1995b</LINK>) of the others were abstracts. These and <LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK> solely reported their prime outcome, DVT. (<LINK REF="STD-Kew-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kew 1999</LINK> also reported an absence of non-fatal PE.) Generally the description of the measurement of complications was very limited, often without indication of systematic follow-up. Results for continuous outcomes such as blood loss and transfusion were poorly reported. Standard deviations were seldom described.</P>
<P>Blood loss and/or transfusions was reported in ten studies of which data from only five could be presented graphically. No significant difference was apparent. Two studies provided incomplete data for bleeding related outcomes: haemoglobin values (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>) and haematuria (<LINK REF="STD-Gallus-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Gallus 1973</LINK>). Five studies mentioned haematomas and four, wound infection. The few data available from these trials for these two outcomes are presented in the analyses tables and show no significant differences within the comparison groups. <LINK REF="STD-Bergqvist-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Bergqvist 1979</LINK> made an indirect reference to these outcomes in the sweeping assertion that no complications were seen. No trial gave any details of the diagnostic criteria for haematoma or wound infection. <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK> lumped haematoma with superficial wound infection as well as reporting no deep wound infection. <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK> reported only having superficial wound infections. The low number of events and incomplete recording of these outcomes prevents any conclusion being drawn for any of the comparisons.</P>
<P>Systemic complications were mentioned by <LINK REF="STD-Galasko-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Galasko 1976</LINK> who reported a cerebral vascular bleed in the control group. Again no conclusions can be drawn for these rarely reported events.</P>
<P>Local discomfort, reactions and pain related to injections were also reported. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lahnborg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lahnborg 1980</LINK>) gave data for injection site haematoma and one (<LINK REF="STD-Xabregas-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Xabregas 1978</LINK>) noted bruising. Results were similar for both groups in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK> (none) and Xabregas (24/25; 24/25), but strikingly different in <LINK REF="STD-Lahnborg-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Lahnborg 1980</LINK> where 52 injection site haematomas were recorded in the heparin group and none in the placebo group. Further consideration is given to this issue in the LMW heparin versus heparin comparisons when different injection patterns are involved.</P>
<P>
<I>The development of postphlebitic limb</I>
</P>
<P>Though <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> reported "postphlebitic limb", this has been interpreted here as marked lower-limb swelling occurring within the first seven days: there was one in the LMW heparin group compared with none in the control group. No other study for any intervention reported postphlebitic limb as an outcome.</P>
<P>
<I>Hospital stay</I>
</P>
<P>Incomplete data were given by <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1992</LINK> who reported that the duration of hospitalisation was comparable in the two groups, and <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK> who made no comment on the slight increase in the mean days in hospital in the control group (32.9 versus 35.7 days).</P>
<P>
<B>Mechanical methods versus control </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Deep vein thrombosis</I>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome of all five studies was DVT. Routine or confirmatory venography was applied in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>). A mixture of methods including I125 fibrinogen scanning was used in <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>, and Doppler ultrasonography in <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>. Further details of the methods used to detect DVT are given in the Characteristics of Included Studies table. The invasive nature of venography was a key cause for post-randomisation exclusions/drop-outs in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> and may well have applied to <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>. No study fully satisfied the criteria for the method of detection (item 10, methodological quality score). The surveillance period for DVT was either in the 7 to 10 day range (<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>), or until ambulation (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>), for which only proximal DVT data were given with no reference to distal DVT, 'any' DVT equals proximal DVT. The incidence of 'any' DVT was significantly reduced (16/221 (7%) versus 52/229 (22%); RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.51) when use of a physical device was compared with no application. The results were consistent for both methods (cyclic sequential compression and A-V foot impulse system). Pooling the results from the two 'good quality' trials (scoring 16 or above), also produced a consistent result. Although there was a potential exaggeration of effect from the results of quasi-randomised trials, the numbers of patients involved are insufficient to draw useful conclusions about the possible effects of trial quality. Best and worst case scenario plots accounting mainly for lost to follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> caused by the omission of data for those not undergoing venography, maintained the direction of effect. Results for both proximal and distal DVT are also displayed.</P>
<P>
<I>Pulmonary embolism</I>
</P>
<P>Non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) was only reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>. Fatal PE, reported in all five studies, was confirmed by autopsy in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>. The numbers of 'any' PE significantly reduced in the patients assigned to physical devices (5/238 (2.1%) versus 16/249 (6.4%); RR 0.40; 95%CI 0.17 to 0.96). Most of the PE reported by <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>, who routinely applied V/Q scanning, was non-fatal but it was not clear whether the only fatal PE (in the control group) was in a hip or pelvic fracture patient. Fatal PE was potentially but not significantly reduced by the use of physical devices (RR 0.27, 95%CI 0.07 to 1.08).</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>All studies mentioned mortality, but results were unavailable for <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK>. Explicit reference to autopsy results was made in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>. Autopsy was carried out on six out of the 10 deaths in <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK>. The length of follow-up was six months in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>, and post-discharge mortality was explicitly monitored by <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>. Mortality was potentially but not statistically significantly reduced by the use of physical devices (RR 0.50, 95%CI 0.22 to 1.14).</P>
<P>
<I>Complications associated with the intervention</I>
</P>
<P>Side effects of physical interventions were not reported in <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> and were not considered on an intention to treat basis for three out of the four other mechanical studies. Nine participants were excluded in <LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK> either because of blisters or intolerance of the foot pump, and one was excluded in <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK> because of unacceptability of the foot pump. A further four patients in Stranks developed dorsal foot sores. In both studies, design modification of the foot pump prevented subsequent problems. It is possible that some of those excluded in <LINK REF="STD-Fisher-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Fisher 1995</LINK> due to non-compliance were a reflection of intolerance, perhaps discomfort, of the compression device. In <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 1982</LINK>, the justification for excluding the patient who died at the end of the operation of presumed pulmonary embolism was her removal of the compression sleeves. However, the information provided for this patient enabled an intention-to-treat analysis.</P>
<P>
<I>Bleeding and other complications</I>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> found no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of haematoma, haematuria and stroke. Nor was there any significant difference in the volume of blood transfused; all patients received blood transfusion. <LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> reported two cases of "postphlebitic limb", interpreted here as marked lower-limb swelling occurring within the first seven days, in the intervention group compared with none in the control group.</P>
<P>
<I>Hospital stay</I>
</P>
<P>Though the data given by the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gargan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gargan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stranks-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Stranks 1992</LINK>) reporting hospital stay showed a slight reduction in hospital stay for the intervention group, these were insufficient to enable tests for significance.</P>
<P>
<B>Low molecular weight versus unfractioned heparin</B> </P>
<P>Indirect comparisons between trials comparing LMW heparin with control, and U heparin with control, do not show a significant difference in effect or effect size for primary outcomes (see above). Five trials directly compared LMW heparin and U heparin, two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>) in combination with dihydroergotamine (DHE). The results for this comparison presented for all five studies are subgrouped according to absence or presence of DHE.</P>
<P>
<I>Deep vein thrombosis</I>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome of all five studies was DVT. Details of the methods used to detect DVT are given in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. Routine or confirmatory venography was applied in these studies with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK> where DVT was detected sonographically. The invasive nature of venography was a key cause for post-randomisation exclusions/drop-outs, and associated intention-to-treat problems in <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>. Both of these trials as well as <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK> satisfied the criteria for the method of detection (item 10, described earlier). Data for proximal DVT were given in three studies, and for distal DVT in two studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK> where only proximal DVT data were given with no reference to distal DVT, 'any' DVT equals proximal DVT.</P>
<P>The comparison of LMW heparin with heparin showed a significant reduction in the incidence of 'any' DVT (47/252 (19%) versus 64/227 (28%); RR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48 to 0.94) for the LMW heparin group. However there was significant heterogeneity (chi-square 10.76 (df=4); P=0.029) overall. An analysis restricted to the three 'good quality' trials (scoring 16 or over), which omitted both <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>, showed no benefit for LMW heparin over U heparin in 'any' DVT. A 'worst case' plot where those lost to follow-up in the LMW heparin group were assumed to have had a DVT, whereas those in the U heparin group were not, showed a non significant increase in DVT in the LMW heparin group (82/287 (29%) versus 64/283 (23%); RR 1.27; 95%CI 0.96 to 1.69). This demonstrated that the loss to follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK> could have an important effect. Similar caution should be applied when viewing the results for proximal and distal DVT.</P>

<P>Routine ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scanning for all participants was performed in <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>, and on a confirmatory basis in <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> found none but gave no indication of the method of detection. The non-significant excess in 'any' PE in the LMW heparin group (7/189 (3.7%) versus 1/165 (0.6%); RR 3.29; 95%CI 0.82 to 13.32) resulted mainly from <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>. It was felt inappropriate to designate the sole PE in <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK> which was discovered at autopsy in a patient who died of decompensated heart failure, as non-fatal or fatal.</P>
<P>
<I>Mortality</I>
</P>
<P>Of the three studies providing mortality data, autopsy results for most of the deaths were available for two (<LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK>) and causes of all deaths were provided by <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>. There was no significant difference in mortality (6/122 (5%) versus 7/120 (6%); RR 0.95; 95%CI 0.31 to 2.36) between the two interventions.</P>
<P>
<I>Bleeding and other complications associated with the intervention</I>
</P>
<P>Complications, including bleeding and wound complications, were reported by four studies, but not by <LINK REF="STD-Dulic-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dulic 1996</LINK>. Only haematoma data, monitored systematically in both <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1989</LINK>, could be pooled, but the non-significant result should be viewed in the context of the low numbers involved (4/136 (3%) versus 6/113 (5%)).</P>
<P>Two trials mentioned systemic complications. <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK> reported one gastrointestinal bleed in the LMW heparin plus DHE group, and <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK> recorded two gastrointestinal bleeds in the LMW heparin group and one in the heparin group. No conclusions can be drawn for these rarely reported events.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK>) gave data for injection site haematoma, and <LINK REF="STD-Monreal-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Monreal 1989</LINK> stated that injection site complications were monitored. Results were similar for both groups in <LINK REF="STD-Lassen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lassen 1989</LINK> (19/53; 24/54). <LINK REF="STD-Hoffmann-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffmann 1996</LINK> attributed the significantly reduced number of patients with injection site haematoma and pain in the LMW heparin group (5/67) compared with that in the heparin group (13/45) (RR: 0.21; 99%CI 0.10 to 0.67: not shown) to the single daily LMW heparin injection instead of three heparin injections. The disproportionate drop-out rate for the heparin group was in part due to patient refusal of three daily injections.</P>

</P>
<P>Results from the two studies in this category are presented separately.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Figuerido-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Figuerido 1994</LINK> compared LMW heparin with intermittent pneumatic compression in 36 patients. As can be seen from the analysis tables, there were no significant differences between the two intervention groups in 'any' DVT (all distal), fatal pulmonary embolism, mortality, bleeding complications (haematoma or haematuria), and transfusion.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK> compared LMW heparin versus intermittent pneumatic compression up to 48 hours post-operatively followed by LMW heparin and provided results for 45 patients. As shown in the analyses tables, there were no significant differences between the two intervention groups in 'any' DVT (location not defined), non-fatal pulmonary embolism or numbers receiving transfusion. The group allocation of 10 additional trial patients who died during the trial period was not identified. <LINK REF="STD-Eskander-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eskander 1997</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference between the two groups in the mean wound drainage results, haemoglobin levels or patient preferences.</P>
<P>
<B>Miscellaneous comparisons </B>
</P>
<P>For completeness and convenience, the results for the five miscellaneous trials have been presented under one heading and the outcomes for individual trials presented together to allow an overall view for each trial. These are all small trials, either in the numbers of patients recruited or included in the analyses, and the resolution of the questions intrinsic to their comparisons can not be answered here.</P>
<P>
<I>LMW heparin: 20mg twice daily versus 40 mg one daily</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Barsotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Barsotti 1990</LINK>)</P>
<P>There was no difference in the incidence of 'any', proximal or distal DVT, detected using venography in addition to other methods, between the two applications of LMW heparin. No pulmonary embolism or deaths were reported. Systematic surveillance of haematoma resulted in the detection of two haematomas in each group.</P>
<P>
<I>U heparin: adjusted versus fixed dose</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Taberner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taberner 1989</LINK>)</P>
<P>This small trial showed no difference in 'any', proximal or distal DVT, detected by venography and other methods. <LINK REF="STD-Taberner-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Taberner 1989</LINK> reported systematic surveillance of haematoma, but gave no results.</P>
<P>
<I>LMW heparin: started pre-operatively versus post-operatively</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>)</P>
<P>Pooled data showed a significant reduction in 'any' DVT in those in whom prophylaxis using LMW heparin was started pre-operatively rather than after surgery. However, <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> suffered from a large loss to follow-up, in part a result of unavailability of venographic results (bilateral phlebography was impossible for 32 out of 239 patients). The results of a worst case analysis, where those who were not followed up are assumed to have DVT in the intervention group but not in the control group, show an extreme view of the extent of uncertainty created by incomplete monitoring for these results. Similar numbers of patients suffered from proximal DVT in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>, but using duplex doppler, proximal DVT was detected in no patients given pre-operative prophylaxis versus nine control patients in <LINK REF="STD-Williams-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 1994</LINK>. No pulmonary embolism was found in <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK>. Pooled mortality data showed no difference between the two groups; there was, however, statistically significant heterogeneity in the results of the two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> reported no significant difference in bleeding or transfusion requirements. No significant differences were found between the two groups for either wound haematoma or infection. <LINK REF="STD-Jorgensen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Jorgensen 1998</LINK> reported that on average the study intervention groups were given one extra injection in the pre-operative period.</P>
<P>
<I>LMW heparins: dalteparin (Fragmin) versus enoxaparin (Clexane)</I> (<LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>)</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between the two LMW heparins in the incidence of 'any' or proximal DVT, detected using venography. No pulmonary embolism was detected in the study period. By two months, two deaths occurred in the enoxaparin group; both were not considered to be due to thromboembolic causes. No statistically significant differences between the two groups were reported for intra or post-operative blood losses or in transfusion volumes. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of bleeding complications: the one in the dalteparin group was a wound haemorrhage and both in the enoxaparin were defined as excessive drops in haemoglobin levels. One patient in each group had a decreased platelet count; both resolved. One patient given enoxaparin suffered a stroke resulting from an infarction, not a bleed.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses by patient characteristics </B>
</P>
<P>Trialists for placebo or controlled trials were sent a request for a breakdown of results by fracture type and basic operation type for intracapsular fractures. However an awareness of the pitfalls of subgroup analyses meant that only a comprehensive response would have been acceptable.

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>In their review of over 70 randomised trials in general surgery, urologic, elective and traumatic orthopaedic surgery, comparing subcutaneous (U) heparin with control or placebo, <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK> concluded that in concord with the results from general surgery trials, an overview of orthopaedic trial results showed that U heparin greatly reduced the incidence of DVT and appeared to reduce mortality from pulmonary embolism. They conjectured that a paradoxical situation could arise where a direct assessment of the effect of treatment on total mortality could be less reliable than indirect assessment based on separate analyses of deaths attributed to pulmonary embolism, to haemorrhage, and to other causes. They concluded that their results suggested that orthopaedic surgeons who did not routinely use any form of prophylactic anticoagulation should reconsider their policy at least in patients at appreciable risk. To some extent, the heparin versus control or placebo comparison is a revisit of <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK> but with an emphasis on hip fracture surgery, the inclusion of two additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-Checketts-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Checketts 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiviluoto-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Kiviluoto 1980</LINK>), both known to be quasi-randomised, and an extension to include five trials testing LMW heparins. As in <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1988</LINK>, the pooled results showed a significant reduction in DVT; the number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one DVT being 5.9 (95% CI 4.3 to 8.3). There were inadequate data to determine if the incidence of the potentially more dangerous proximal DVT was reduced by heparin use. There was insufficient information to test whether heparin may serve to delay rather than avert some DVT, an issue discussed in <LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Toulemonde-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toulemonde 1996</LINK>. In general there was inadequate reporting of pulmonary embolism and diagnostic methods used, a reliance on clinical detection for non-fatal pulmonary embolism, and only partial ascertainment of cause of death using autopsy. These and random effects may have contributed to the apparently contradictory effect of a possible reduction in fatal pulmonary embolism but an increase in non-fatal embolism in the heparin group. A similar contradictory effect has also been noted in a review comparing regional with general anaesthesia for hip fracture surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>). In both reviews the small numbers of patients with pulmonary embolism are inadequate to allow meaningful conclusions. Similar considerations apply with mortality when subgrouped by fatal PE and other cause mortality. The possible increase in deaths from other causes which often happened post-discharge for the heparin group needs further examination. Data enabling assessment of the complications, mainly bleeding, were sadly inadequate. For example, only two studies provided poolable data for wound haematoma, a key concern of orthopaedic specialists. Assessment of long term chronic venous insufficiency as in postphlebitic limb was not possible.</P>
<P>Individual and pooled results of those trials testing the physical methods of pneumatic compression or the more physiologically based A-V impulse system showed a statistically significant reduction in DVT (NNT to avoid one DVT 6.3, 95% CI 4.5 to 10) in the intervention group. There was also a statistically significant reduction in 'any' pulmonary embolism but there were insufficient data to establish an effect on fatal pulmonary embolism or mortality, although the trends were encouraging. These results should be viewed cautiously as the numbers of events are small for pulmonary embolism and mortality, and all five trials have methodological weaknesses. Four of the five trials excluded patients who were non-compliant or suffered complications from their analyses. Though two trials indicated that the problems had been remedied, the tolerance for and skin complications from these devices by the patients must be considered and results made available for analysis in any future trials seeking the best device and optimal use of these devices. The four orthopaedic trials included in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Amaragiri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amaragiri 2002</LINK>) of simple thrombo-embolism stockings (elastic compression stockings) involved elective hip and knee replacement, and thus confirmed the lack of trials testing this intervention in hip fracture patients.</P>
<P>Although there was insufficient evidence to establish any meaningful difference, the results of the comparisons of LMW heparin with U heparin with or without the addition of dihydroergotamine (DHE) did not show a consistent superiority of one drug over the other. This was consistent with the results for primary outcomes of 'any' DVT, 'any' PE and mortality in the indirect comparisons of trials comparing LMW heparin with control, and U heparin and control. However the pooling of such trials remains controversial. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Haas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haas 1996</LINK> in a review on DVT prophylaxis in surgery expressed a particular concern in pooling results from trials comparing LMW heparin with heparin which arose mainly from the pharmacological heterogeneity of LMW heparins and variations in administered doses. This view is plausible. However we have identified only two trials comparing different LMW heparins; one, described by the trialists as a pilot study, is included (<LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>); the other, only available as a conference abstract, is in studies awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Zouboulis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zouboulis 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-TIFDED-1999" TYPE="STUDY">TIFDED 1999</LINK>, considered in the miscellaneous category, showed no difference in effect between the two LMW heparins (dalteparin and enoxaparin); <LINK REF="STD-Zouboulis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zouboulis 1997</LINK> also reported no significant difference for three LMW heparins (enoxaparine, nadroparine calcium and tinzaparin). Thus, so far, there is no evidence to resolve this issue.</P>
<P>The results of the other four comparisons in the miscellaneous category can only be taken as starting results for the comparisons under investigation. These comparisons relating to timing of the start of prophylaxis, the use of fixed or adjusted (which requires additional monitoring) heparin doses, and the once versus twice daily application of LMW heparin serve as a reminder of the many unresolved issues.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The clinical events of practical importance to patients which follow DVT are death, post-embolic pulmonary disease, and post-thrombotic leg. DVT, although it must precede them, does not itself reliably predict any of these outcomes. Clinicians who have concerns about the complications and cost of injectable anticoagulants in this group of patients will continue to be disappointed on two counts. First, there is a lack of data on local adverse effects on wound healing at the operative site, and on post-thrombotic leg. Second, data are inadequate on the prevention of fatal pulmonary embolism and on the prevention of non-fatal embolism and its consequences. And an increase in mortality can not be discounted. Lower limb pumping devices may offer an alternative prophylactic strategy. Although skin problems, the consequences of which remain poorly described, are associated with their use, these devices appear as effective as injectable anticoagulants and death from other causes does not appear to be increased. </P>
<P>While outside the remit of this review, these implications need to be considered alongside other developments, such as the favourable results for low-dose aspirin in the large PEP trial, in this area. We note that recent guidelines on the prevention of thromboembolic disease in this patient group, on consideration of the results of the first version of this review and the PEP trial, recommend that injectable anticoagulants should be reserved for patients at higher risk of thrombosis and those with contradications to physical methods and/or aspirin (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2002</LINK>). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Prior research in the prophylaxis of DVT and thromboembolism using the interventions under review has many shortcomings. These include:</P>
<P>1. Lack of power to identify outcomes of clinical importance (incidence of pulmonary embolism, incidence of systemic adverse effects of prophylaxis).<BR/>2. Failure to collect data on a routine basis for all patients.<BR/>3. Failure to collect any data on some outcomes of clinical importance (post-thrombotic leg, chronic post-embolic pulmonary disease).<BR/>4. Failure to collect adequate data on local wound complications.<BR/>5. Limited follow up. Our recommendation is that it should continue for a minimum of six months after cessation of prophylaxis.<BR/>6. Poor internal validity (randomisation methods, blinding, analysis by intention to treat, study losses).</P>
<P>The research community should note these problems in future study design; many of the above are avoided by the recent PEP trial (<LINK REF="REF-PEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEP 2000</LINK>), which can be considered a good example to follow. On the evidence currently available in this review, direct comparisons of injectable anticoagulants with lower limb pumping devices should be considered, although they may need to be large to confirm either a difference or comparable effectiveness. Three way trials involving the injectable anticoagulants, pumping devices, and injectable anticoagulants with pumping devices may also be useful. Taking account of the results from <LINK REF="REF-PEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEP 2000</LINK>, we suggest that the above comparisons should be extended to include low-dose aspirin. Such research should be informed by a prior review of the evidence that is already available for comparisons involving aspirin as well as the evidence for aspirin in the prevention of thromboembolism in hip fracture patients.</P>

<P>Comment from David K. Cundiff, MD (21.06.07): <BR/>There is no evidence-basis for the final statement of the Implications for practice: " ... recommend that injectable anticoagulants should be reserved for patients at higher risk of thrombosis and those with contradications to physical methods and/or aspirin". Increased risk of thrombosis or contraindications to physical methods and/or aspirin does not mean that anticoagulants become effective and safe.</P>
<P>Because of excluding observational studies and meta-analyses from consideration in the safety analysis, the bleeding and wound healing complications were very likely understated.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>

<P>Thank you for your comments. Regarding your first point, as we state in the review, the source for the recommendation you refer to is the Hip Fracture Guideline Development Group. Prevention and management of hip fracture in older people. A national clinical guideline (No. 56). Edinburgh: Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (www.sign.ac.uk), 2002. </P>
<P>Regarding your second point, while our review does not include evidence from sources other than RCTs, we do highlight the "lack of data on local adverse effects on wound healing at the operative site, and on post-thrombotic leg."</P>

<P>Comment from David K. Cundiff, MD (22.07.08):</P>
<P>I thank Drs. Handoll and Gillespie for their reply (comments 21 June 2007).</P>
<P>I question whether the reference to the SIGN Guideline No. 561 belongs in the &#8216;Implications for Practice&#8217; section. This guideline is not referenced elsewhere in this review and the reasoning behind the SIGN Guideline is not explained. Even after reading the relevant sections of the SIGN Guideline, it is puzzling why they recommended injectable anticoagulant prophylaxis for any hip fracture patients. Concerning the definition of hip fracture patients at &#8220;high risk of VTE,&#8221; the SIGN Guideline contained the following two passages:</P>
<P>1. Hip fracture surgery carries high risk of assymptomatic DVT (45%), symptomatic DVT (1-11%), symptomatic PE (3-13%), and fatal PE (1-7%) in the absence of VTE prophylaxis.</P>
<P>2. Heparin should be reserved for selected patients at high risk for VTE after hip fracture due to</P>
<UL>
<LI>Multiple risk factors*</LI>
<LI>Contraindications to standard mechanical prophylaxis and/or aspirin</LI>
</UL>
<P>* Age &gt; 80 years, obesity (BMI &gt;30), varicose veins, previous VTE, thrombophilias, heart failure, recent MI or stroke (ed. 'recent' not defined), severe infection, inflammatory bowel disease, nephrotic syndrome, polycythaemia, paraproteinemia, Bechet&#8217;s disease, paroxysmal noctural haemaglobinuria, hormone replacement therapy, tamoxifen, paralysis, and malignancy.<BR/>
<BR/>Passage #1 indicates that all patients are at high risk of VTE. However, only certain patients, defined in passage #2, should get heparin. No validation studies are referenced that supports the net benefit of heparin in patients designated at &#8220;high risk&#8221; by the SIGN criteria.</P>
<P>It should be noted that in the original Cochrane review (1998),[ref 3] there was a non significant increase in overall mortality in the heparin group (46/420 (11.0%) versus 35/423 (8.3%); Peto odds ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 2.23). However, in the current version of this review, published in 2002, the non significant increase in overall mortality in the heparin group has diminished as the total number of patients and number of deaths had changed (42/356 (11.8%) versus 38/374 (10.2%); Peto odds ratio 1.16 (0.77- 1.74)).[ref 4] This discrepancy should be explained.<BR/>
<BR/>Concerning the incidence of fatal PE, this review states, "Fatal PE reported in eight trials was confirmed by autopsy data in at least some patients in five trials." Estimating the mortality of PE from death certificates has been shown to be grossly inaccurate with a sensitivity of less than 40% and the predictive value of a positive diagnosis of less than 50%.[ref 5] Therefore, given the apparent minority of patients who died having autopsies, nothing can be concluded about the non significant trend toward reduced fatal PEs (5/356 versus 14/374; Peto odds ratio 0.47 (0.19 - 1.14)), especially with the borderline significant increase in non PE mortality in patients receiving heparins (37/356 versus 24/374 Peto odds ratio 1.58 (0.98 - 2.55).<BR/>
<BR/>While nothing can be inferred from the fatal PE data, the overall mortality trend favoring the control group is important because of the potential clinical effect of rebound hypercoagulability on withdrawal of heparins. Assessing the full extent of deaths from rebound hypercoagulability requires at least two months of followup after discontinuing the heparin. Most rebound hypercoagulability deaths would be missed in this hip fracture review, since only 1/15 RCTs of any heparin had a surveillance period of at least four weeks and 3/15 had less than 10 days surveillance. Given the trend to increased deaths with heparins (stronger in the original version than the current one) in the short followup periods of the RCTs in this review, the possibility of heparin prophylaxis causing increased mortality is quite troubling.<BR/>
<BR/>Referencing the original version of this Cochrane hip fracture VTE prophylaxis review (1998),[3] the SIGN Guideline stated, "There was insufficient data to evaluate the effect of heparin on symptomatic VTE, mortality, or bleeding." If the SIGN Guideline is referenced in this Cochrane review, this sentence, rather than the non evidence-based heparin recommendation for "high risk" patients, would be appropriate to quote. Otherwise, explain why recent data on prophylactic anticoagulants in hip fracture patients in your new review shows more benefit than risk.<BR/>
<BR/>Given the likelihood of an increase in mortality due to rebound hypercoagulability in hip fracture patients receiving injectable anticoagulants and the lack of data on adverse effects, the 'Implications for Practice' for this review should recommend that no injectable anticoagulants be given to any hip fracture patient outside of a RCT.<BR/>
<BR/>Regarding the 'implications for research,' any future anticoagulant prophylaxis trial should have at least two months of followup after the discontinuation of the anticoagulant to assess a possible increase in mortality due to rebound hypercoagulability.<BR/>

<P>We thank Dr Cundiff for his continuing feedback on our review. We consider that our review drew appropriate conclusions from the available evidence at the time it was last updated. Cochrane Reviews are not Practice Guidelines. They provide evidence summaries on defined topics which may be used, along with other evidence, to inform such guidelines.</P>
<P>The reason for including the SIGN guideline in our Implications for practice section was to stress that the implications of the findings of our review needed "to be considered alongside other developments". The authors of this review and the editors felt it was appropriate to draw the attention of readers to material outside the remit of this particular review. Dr Cundiff should contact the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (<A HREF="http://www.sign.ac.uk">http://www.sign.ac.uk</A>) for clarification of any of the content of SIGN Guideline 56.</P>
<P>The "discrepancy" highlighted by Dr Cundiff between the results for mortality for the heparin versus control comparison in the 1998 and 2002 versions of the review results from two changes that we describe under 'What's new' and elsewhere in our review. The first change is that: "The publication of Jorgensen 1998, formerly Jorgensen 1995, resulted in the transfer of this trial from the heparin versus control comparison to the miscellaneous category." The second is that relative risks rather than Peto odds ratios were used in the 2002 review.</P>
<P>We agree that autopsy data are preferable to death certificates and note that our review concludes that "data are inadequate on the prevention of fatal pulmonary embolism and on the prevention of non-fatal embolism and its consequences." We also state that "an increase in mortality can not be discounted."</P>
<P>Dr Cundiff stated &#8220;any future anticoagulant prophylaxis trial should have at least two months of followup after the discontinuation of the anticoagulant to assess a possible increase in mortality due to rebound hypercoagulability&#8221;. We note that in the Implications for research section, we recommended that follow up "should continue for a minimum of six months after cessation of prophylaxis&#8221;.</P>
