<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-10 19:27:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs. Treatment for pneumonia includes antibiotics, rest, fluids, management of complications and professional home care. Oxygen supplementation is one way to help patients who cannot breathe adequately on their own. Management of oxygen supplementation is divided into nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is life-supporting ventilation that involves the use of a machine called a ventilator, or respirator. There are two main types of mechanical ventilation: non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive ventilation. The former provides ventilatory support to a patient through a tightly fitted facial or nasal mask and the latter through a tube inserted into the windpipe through the mouth or the nose or a hole made in the windpipe through the front of the throat. At present, oxygen therapy for individuals with pneumonia is commonly prescribed. However, inconsistent results on the effects of oxygen therapy on pneumonia have been reported and no systematic review has been conducted in patients with pneumonia to determine which delivery system of oxygen therapy leads to the best clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>We searched the related literature and included three randomised controlled trials involving 151 adults with pneumonia aged around 60 years. We did not include patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis. We found that NIV can reduce the risk of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the need for endotracheal intubation, shorten ICU stay and length of intubation. Some outcomes and complications of oxygen therapy depended upon the delivery system and primary diseases. The most common complications of invasive ventilation are ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, we must be aware that oxygen therapy is just one of the treatments for pneumonia and the other standard treatments used by physicians are of equal importance.</P>
<P>The evidence is weak and it is limited by the small number of studies and the small number of study participants.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-10 20:42:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lungs. It is often characterised as inflammation and fluid collection in the alveoli. Common clinical symptoms of pneumonia include cough, sputum production, fever, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, night sweats and pleuritic chest pain. Although pneumonia is most common in young children and the elderly, it can affect people of any age. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites and almost 100 species of pathogens have been identified as causative agents (<LINK REF="REF-Donowitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donowitz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-File-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">File 2003</LINK>). Pneumonia can be classified in several ways including by anatomic changes, microbial cause and radiological classification. However, the disease is commonly classified as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia (HAP or NP) according to a combined clinical classification. The advantage of this classification is that it can help guide the selection of appropriate initial treatment before the microbiologic cause of the pneumonia is known. However, the clinical presentations are often similar in CAP and HAP. In adults, the incidence of CAP increases with age. For people aged 65 to 69 years, the overall rate of CAP ranges from 18.2 cases per 1000 person-years to 52.3 cases per 1000 person-years in those aged over 85 years. (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2004</LINK>). Hospital admission is needed in 20% to 40% of patients with CAP (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The prevalence of HAP increased threefold from those aged &lt; 35 to those aged &gt; 85 years (<LINK REF="REF-Humphreys-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humphreys 2010</LINK>). In low-income countries, pneumonia causes approximately two million deaths annually among children under five years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudan 2004</LINK>). In the USA, pneumonia is the sixth most common cause of death and the most common cause of infection-related mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Donowitz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donowitz 2000</LINK>). Both CAP and HAP are associated with a significant mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Fagon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fagon 1993</LINK>) and high cost. Although 80% of patients with CAP are treated as outpatients, mortality for these patients is usually less than 1%. The other 20% of patients require inpatient management. Approximately 10% to 20% of hospitalised patients with CAP have to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where 20% to 50% of them will ultimately die (<LINK REF="REF-Fine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fine 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2002</LINK>). The overall mean cost per case of CAP management in the United States was calculated as USD 493 for successful treatment and USD 3019 for successful treatment failure (<LINK REF="REF-Monte-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monte 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sergio-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sergio 2009</LINK>). HAP is the leading cause of mortality in hospital-acquired infections (<LINK REF="REF-Flanders-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanders 2006</LINK>). It is associated with crude mortality rates of up to 70% and attributable mortality rates as high as 33% to 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 1998</LINK>). An episode of HAP adds an additional five to six days to the length of hospital stay and thousands of dollars in cost to medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Raghavendran-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raghavendran 2000</LINK>

<P>The treatment for pneumonia includes antibiotics, rest, fluids, management of complications and proper home care. Oxygen supplementation is one of the most important ways to help to improve oxygen saturation in arterial blood gases. Oxygen supplementation may be described both in terms of volume (dosage) and delivery system. Low-volume systems include nasal cannulae (NC), shields and masks. Drawbacks to low-volume systems include drying of the nasal mucosa and eyes, discomfort, as masks can pinch and cause skin irritation, and the fact that their passive delivery system is dependent on the patient's ability to breathe. If the lungs cannot keep the body oxygenated using these methods, mechanical ventilation may be required. The most common methods of respiratory support are non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV or NIPPV), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). The state of respiratory function can be improved more so with mechanical ventilation than with low-volume systems but the disadvantages of the former are twofold: chest muscles can weaken through disuse and bacteria may access the lungs more easily. Cochrane Reviews have found that oxygen may relieve dyspnoea in mildly and non-hypoxaemic people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and relieve breathlessness in end-stage illness in adults; for patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) it may have a beneficial survival effect (<LINK REF="REF-Cranston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cranston 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Crockett-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crockett 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uronis-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uronis 2011</LINK>). The evidence was limited by the methods used in the studies, the small number of studies or the small number of study participants. In 1885, George E Holtzapple discovered that oxygen could be used to treat pneumonia. In 1919, following his discovery, Stadie reported that the mortality in patients with pneumonia was 39% with oxygen and 74% without oxygen but data were adjusted for the severity of the illness.<BR/>

</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-01-10 20:43:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical treatment for pneumonia includes oxygen saturation monitoring and oxygen delivery, both of which can significantly reduce length of hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Loeb-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeb 2006</LINK>). There is consensus among scientists and clinicians on the life-saving benefits of oxygen therapy for patients with severe pneumonia and signs of decreased oxygen saturation. Mortality from pneumonia has also been shown to be related to arterial blood oxygen saturation (<LINK REF="REF-Onyango-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onyango 1993</LINK>). Even without pre-existing co-morbid medical conditions, patients who have an oxygen saturation &lt; 94% should be considered for oxygen supplementation. Moderate levels of supplemental oxygen (nasal cannulae at 2 to 6 l/min or simple mask at 5 to 10 l/min unless otherwise stated) are required if the patient with pneumonia is hypoxaemic and the initial oxygen saturation target range is 94% to 98%. The recommended grade of therapy is 'C', based on the guidelines of the British Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2010a</LINK>). Oxygen therapy is often only necessary in severe cases of pneumonia (severe is defined as a the patient being confused, urea &gt; 7 mmol/l, respiratory rate &gt; = 30/min, low systolic (&lt; 90 mmHg) or diastolic (&lt;= 60 mmHg) blood pressure, or age &gt;= 65 years (or 'CURB-65 score') of three or more) (<LINK REF="REF-Ewig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2003</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-10 20:32:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To date, inconsistent results on the effects of oxygen therapy on pneumonia have been reported. Several studies have reported that supplementing oxygen in NIPPV patients with severe CAP can lead to initial improvement (<LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Domenighetti-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Domenighetti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jolliet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolliet 2001</LINK>). Using either CPAP or bi-level pressure support can improve patients' oxygenation and tachypnoea in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Li-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2003</LINK>). A study from Hong Kong has verified the benefits of either intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Yam-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yam 2005</LINK>). In contrast, a study indicated that patients with CAP who have severe hypoxaemia (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>), the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>), PaO<SUB>2</SUB>/FiO<SUB>2</SUB> ratio &lt; 150), are poor candidates for NIPPV (<LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niederman-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 2001a</LINK>) and NIPPV should only be administered in an appropriate critical care setting for CAP patients because the health of over half of these patients will deteriorate and required intubation (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2002</LINK>). Despite early physiologic improvements, CPAP neither reduced the need for intubation nor improved outcomes in patients with acute hypoxaemia and non-hypercapnia respiratory insufficiency primarily due to acute lung injury, including changes from pneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Delclaux-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Delclaux 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>At present, oxygen therapy for individuals with pneumonia is commonly prescribed. However, no systematic review has previously been conducted on patients with non-hypoxaemic pneumonia to determine which method of oxygen therapy leads to the best clinical outcome.</P>

<P>We assessed the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration&#8217;s &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed each trial in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessment, selective reporting and loss to follow-up. We then classified each trial as 'low risk of bias', 'high risk of bias' or 'unclear risk of bias' according to the <I>Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> <U>(</U>
<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and described by <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2007</LINK>. We resolved differences by discussion among the review authors. We assessed the following characteristics:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation</LI>
</UL>
<P>Low risk of bias: adequate generation of allocation sequence (for example, table of random numbers, computer-generated random numbers, or similar).<BR/>High risk of bias: inadequate generation of allocation sequence (for example, date of birth, case record number, day, month or year of admission, or allocation by judgement of the clinician, the participant, laboratory test or a series of tests, availability of the intervention).<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: the generation was unclear.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allocation concealment</LI>
</UL>
<P>Low risk of bias: adequate concealment of allocation (for example, non-translucent sealed envelopes, central independent unit, or similar).<BR/>High risk of bias: inadequate concealment of allocation (any procedure which is transparent before allocation (for example, dates of birth, alternation, open table of random numbers, the use of case record numbers, or similar).<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: unclear concealment of allocation (for example, only specifying that sealed envelopes were used or not reporting any concealment approach) or inadequate.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Blinding: blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment</LI>
</UL>
<P>Low risk of bias: masking of both the participants and results assessor (for example, identical placebo tablets or similar). Blinding was not considered necessary for mortality or other outcomes (that were not influenced by blinding).<BR/>High risk of bias: not used or non-blinding for detection of outcomes (for example, not performed or tablets versus fluids or similar).<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: insufficient information provided to judge 'low risk of bias' or 'high risk of bias', single-blinding of the results assessor and blinding was performed on the participants but not the results assessor.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data: assessment for potential bias of exclusions and attrition</LI>
</UL>
<P>Low risk of bias: trials had no missing outcome data or a few exclusions (lower than 5%), attrition is noted; or if exclusions were 5% to 10% and an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used.<BR/>High risk of bias: exclusions were wide differences in exclusions between intervention group and control group or the rate of exclusion and/or attrition is higher than 15%, whatever ITT analysis was used.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias: the rate of attrition and/or exclusions is higher than 10%.</P>
<P>Low risk of bias - all quality criteria met.<BR/>Unclear risk of bias - one or more of the quality criteria partly met.<BR/>High risk of bias - one or more criteria not met.</P>

In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Hilbert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hilbert 2001</LINK>), conducted among immunosuppressed participants, the results did not show any benefit of non-invasive ventilation compared with standard treatment (SMD 0, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.54) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). Pooled analyses showed that the duration of use of mechanical ventilation after treatment was not statistically significant (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.14).

However, in the <LINK REF="STD-Hilbert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hilbert 2001</LINK> trial, conducted among immunosuppressed participants, serious complications were reported, such as severe sepsis or septic shock, cardiogenic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia; the results showed that non-invasive ventilation was better than standard treatment in terms of serious complications and the difference between the two compared groups was statistically significant (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.82) (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>). Pooled analyses also showed that the participants who had complications after treatment were statistically significant (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness of evidence</HEADING>
<P>At present, our information regarding treatment of patients with pneumonia requiring oxygen comes from clinical guidelines. No guidelines or studies suggest whether patients without hypoxaemia should be given oxygen supplementation or not. In general, it has been suggested that oxygen saturation should be maintained above 90% in patients with pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Alvin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvin 2004</LINK>). Oxygen therapy is often only necessary in severe cases of pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Ewig-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewig 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2003</LINK>) or in those patients with hypoxaemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) less than 8 Kpa) or oxygen saturation (SaO<SUB>2</SUB>) less than 92% (<LINK REF="REF-Niederman-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niederman 2001a</LINK>). The British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommends that the initial oxygen saturation target range should be 94% to 98% if the patient with pneumonia is hypoxaemic (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 2010a</LINK>). We assumed there would be many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pneumonia with hypoxaemia because of the routine nature of oxygen therapy. To our surprise, very few RCTs conducted on pneumonia with definite criteria were identified, although there were a large number of references about oxygen therapy for respiratory failure. We know that the general methods of oxygen supplementation include nasal catheter or mask, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation.</P>
<P>There are also few articles comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different oxygen therapies for severe pneumonia. We identified six articles; three of them were included (<LINK REF="STD-Confalonieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Confalonieri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cosentini-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Cosentini 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilbert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hilbert 2001</LINK>) and 16 (<LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antonelli-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Antonelli 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brett-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brochard-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Brochard 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CRGSINV-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CRGSINV 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Delclaux-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Delclaux 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eisner-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Eisner 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilbert-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hilbert 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ozsancak-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Ozsancak 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prevedoros-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Prevedoros 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Terragni-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Terragni 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 2001</LINK>) were excluded after re-evaluation. In the three included studies, there were no comparisons between effects of placebo and oxygen treatment. All of them focused on the impact of non-invasive ventilation with standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask on participants with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical interpretation of the data</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes of the analysis show that non-invasive ventilation was better than standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask in terms of death in the intensive care unit (ICU), the number of participants who required intubation, the duration of intubation, duration of ICU stay and complications. This was also true for death in the hospital, two-month survival, duration of hospital stay and duration of use of mechanical ventilation, where there was no statistically significant difference observed between the treatment and control groups. The primary outcomes of death in the ICU, two-month survival and duration of intubation were based only on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Confalonieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Confalonieri 1999</LINK>) in each subgroup conducted among severe CAP patients. In addition to this, there were different kinds of populations of participants in the studies so that heterogeneity cannot be avoided in some outcomes. The outcomes of the subgroup analysis show that non-invasive ventilation was better than standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask in terms of death in hospital and complications among immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates, whereas in the subgroup of severe community-acquired pneumonia, there was no statistically significant difference observed between the non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment groups.</P>
<P>Non-invasive ventilation was safe and adverse effects were minor among moderate hypoxaemic acute respiratory failure participants (diagnosis of CAP as the only cause). Among severe community-acquired pneumonia populations the incidence of complications including gastric distention, ventilation-associated pneumonia, otitis media, mastoiditis and pneumothorax between the compared groups was not significantly different. However, among immunosuppressed patients there were serious complications, such as severe sepsis or septic shock, cardiogenic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia; the results showed that non-invasive ventilation was better than standard treatment in terms of serious complications and that the difference between the two compared groups was statistically significant. Pooled analyses also showed that non-invasive ventilation can decrease the incidence of complications. Furthermore, we did not include patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis because of their varying prognoses. We suggest separate studies should be implemented for these patients. So when we need to apply the conclusions of this review to clinical practice, we must carefully evaluate whether our patients are comparable with the participants described in this review.</P>

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hilbert-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hilbert 2001</LINK>) did not describe the methods of randomised sequence generation but the study clearly described adequate allocation concealment.

<P>None of the included trials documented the methods for blinding due to the specific intervention which is very difficult to blind.

</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-10 20:12:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>COPD is a very common underlying disease in patients admitted with severe CAP (<LINK REF="REF-Ewig-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewig 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moine-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moine 1994</LINK>) but is not recognised as an independent risk factor for mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Ewig-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewig 1997</LINK>). Even so, outcomes for participants with or without COPD were analysed in a subgroup analysis. In this review, we did not find a difference between patients with and without COPD in duration of use of mechanical ventilation. One included study (<LINK REF="STD-Confalonieri-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Confalonieri 1999</LINK>) found that in patients with COPD, non-invasive ventilation required a lower workload for nursing staff over three days, had a lower rate of endotracheal intubation, a shorter duration of ICU stay and a reduced duration of intubation. These differences were statistically significant. Conversely, the differences between outcomes were not found in participants without COPD. In fact, non-invasive ventilation itself could result in decreased mortality, decreased need for intubation and a reduction in the treatment failure rate in patients with COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Felix-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felix 2004</LINK>). The differences may be due to an improvement in outcomes of patients with COPD rather than an improvement due to non-invasive ventilation use in participants with pneumonia.</P>
<P>A study showed non-invasive ventilation could reduce the rate of endotracheal intubation and length of ICU stay in patients with a PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> greater than 45 mmHg but the advantage could not be found in those with PaCO<SUB>2</SUB> less than 45 mm Hg (<LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 1995</LINK>). The most common complications associated with non-invasive ventilation are gastric distention, difficulty in clearing secretions and facial skin necrosis. In this review, complications associated with conventional mechanical ventilation, influenced by population of participants, ranged from very minor to very serious.</P>

<P>Current available evidence shows that non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) and endotracheal intubation, and shorten ICU length of stay and intubation in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia; non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in hospital, shorten ICU length of stay and reduce the incidence of complications in immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Overall, non-invasive ventilation can reduce the risk of death in ICU and endotracheal intubation, and shorten ICU length of stay and length of intubation. Non-invasive ventilation and standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask were similar when measuring mortality in hospital, two-month survival, duration of hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. Other than oxygen therapy, we must mention the importance of standard treatment by physicians. The evidence is weak. However, the review indicates that non-invasive ventilation may be more beneficial than standard oxygen supplementation via a Venturi mask for pneumonia.</P>

<P>Few studies of oxygen therapy have been performed in adults with pneumonia.
