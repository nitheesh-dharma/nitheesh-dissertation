<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-24 17:02:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cochrane researchers conducted a review of the effects of school-based interventions for reducing HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and pregnancy in adolescents. After searching for relevant trials up to 7 April 2016, they included eight trials that had enrolled 55,157 adolescents.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important and how might school-based programmes work?</B>
</P>
<P>Sexually active adolescents, particularly young women, are at high risk in many countries of contracting HIV and other STIs. Early unintended pregnancy can also have a detrimental impact on young people's lives.</P>
<P>The school environment plays an important role in the development of children and young people, and curriculum-based sexuality education programmes have become popular in many regions of the world. While there is some evidence that these programmes improve knowledge and reduce self-reported risk taking, this review evaluated whether they have any impact on the number of young people that contracted STIs or on the number of adolescent pregnancies.</P>
<P>
<B>What the research says </B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Sexual and reproductive health education programmes</I>
</P>
<P>As they are currently configured, educational programmes alone probably have no effect on the number of young people infected with HIV during adolescence (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). They also probably have no effect on the number of young people infected with other STIs (herpes simplex virus: <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>; syphilis: <I>low certainty evidence</I>), or the number of adolescent pregnancies (<I>moderate certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Material or monetary incentive-based programmes to promote school attendance</I>
</P>
<P>Giving monthly cash, or free school uniforms, to encourage students to stay in school may have no effect on the number of young people infected with HIV during adolescence (<I>low certainty evidence</I>). We do not currently know whether monthly cash or free school uniforms will reduce the number of young people infected with other STIs (<I>very low certainty evidence</I>). However, incentives to promote school attendance may reduce the number of adolescent pregnancies (<I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<I>Combined educational and incentive-based programmes</I>
</P>
<P>&#8203;Based on a single included trial, giving an incentive such as a free school uniform &#8203;combined with a programme of sexual and reproductive &#8203;health &#8203;education&#8203; may reduce STIs (&#8203;herpes simplex virus&#8203;;&#8203; <I>low certainty evidence</I>) in young women, but no effect was detected for HIV or pregnancy (<I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>There is currently little evidence that educational programmes alone are effective at reducing STIs or adolescent pregnancy. Incentive-based interventions that focus on keeping young people, especially girls, in secondary school may reduce adolescent pregnancy but further high quality trials are needed to confirm this.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-27 09:54:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>School-based sexual and reproductive health programmes are widely accepted as an approach to reducing high-risk sexual behaviour among adolescents. Many studies and systematic reviews have concentrated on measuring effects on knowledge or self-reported behaviour rather than biological outcomes, such as pregnancy or prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-09-26 16:28:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effects of school-based sexual and reproductive health programmes on sexually transmitted infections (such as HIV, herpes simplex virus, and syphilis), and pregnancy among adolescents.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-14 10:10:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for published peer-reviewed journal articles; and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for prospective trials; AIDS Educaton and Global Information System (AEGIS) and National Library of Medicine (NLM) gateway for conference presentations; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNAIDS, the WHO and the National Health Service (NHS) centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) websites from 1990 to 7 April 2016. We handsearched the reference lists of all relevant papers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-26 16:28:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both individually randomized and cluster-randomized, that evaluated school-based programmes aimed at improving the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-26 16:28:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. When appropriate, we obtained summary measures of treatment effect through a random-effects meta-analysis and we reported them using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-24 17:28:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included eight cluster-RCTs that enrolled 55,157 participants. Five trials were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Kenya), one in Latin America (Chile), and two in Europe (England and Scotland).</P>
<P>
<B>Sexual and reproductive health educational programmes</B>
</P>
<P>Six trials evaluated school-based educational interventions.</P>
<P>In these trials, the educational programmes evaluated had no demonstrable effect on the prevalence of HIV (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.32, three trials; 14,163 participants; <I>low certainty evidence</I>), or other STIs (herpes simplex virus prevalence: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.15; three trials, 17,445 participants; <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>; syphilis prevalence: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.39; one trial, 6977 participants; <I>low certainty evidence</I>). There was also no apparent effect on the number of young women who were pregnant at the end of the trial (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.16; three trials, 8280 participants; <I>moderate certainty evidence</I>). </P>
<P>
<B>Material or monetary incentive-based programmes to promote school attendance</B>
</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated incentive-based programmes to promote school attendance.</P>
<P>In these two trials, the incentives used had no demonstrable effect on HIV prevalence (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.96; two trials, 3805 participants; <I>low certainty evidence</I>). Compared to controls, the prevalence of herpes simplex virus infection was lower in young women receiving a monthly cash incentive to stay in school (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.85), but not in young people given free school uniforms (Data not pooled, two trials, 7229 participants; <I>very</I> <I>low certainty evidence</I>). One trial evaluated the effects on syphilis and the prevalence was too low to detect or exclude effects confidently (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.05 to 3.27; one trial, 1291 participants; <I>very low certainty evidence</I>). However, the number of young women who were pregnant at the end of the trial was lower among those who received incentives (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.99; two trials, 4200 participants; <I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Combined educational and incentive-based programmes</B>
</P>
<P>The single trial that evaluated free school uniforms also included a trial arm in which participants received both uniforms and a programme of sexual and reproductive education. In this trial arm herpes simplex virus infection was reduced (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99; one trial, 5899 participants; <I>low certainty evidence</I>), predominantly in young women, but no effect was detected for HIV or pregnancy (<I>low certainty evidence</I>).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-24 17:29:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a continued need to provide health services to adolescents that include contraceptive choices and condoms and that involve them in the design of services. Schools may be a good place in which to provide these services. There is little evidence that educational curriculum-based programmes alone are effective in improving sexual and reproductive health outcomes for adolescents. Incentive-based interventions that focus on keeping young people in secondary school may reduce adolescent pregnancy but further trials are needed to confirm this.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-27 10:25:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adolescents have been recognized as having an important place in the post-2015 development agenda (<LINK REF="REF-United-Nations-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">United Nations 2015</LINK>); indeed three of the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs) specifically target adolescent sexual and reproductive health, and access to appropriate health services as a human right. However, adolescents, particularly those under 16 years of age, constitute a high-risk group who are less likely to use or have access to condoms or contraceptives (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mathews-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathews 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pettifor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettifor 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Incident HIV infections amongst young people aged 15 to 24 years account for almost half of new infections (<LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 2012</LINK>). These have increased since 2000, with adolescents within the African region having 90% of the world's HIV-related adolescent deaths (<LINK REF="REF-World-Health-Organization-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Health Organization 2014</LINK>). Despite a downward trend in adolescent pregnancy worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-World-Bank-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">World Bank 2016</LINK>), most pregnancies in girls under the age of 18 are unwanted and many are terminated. Restrictive abortion laws and lack of services can result in high levels of maternal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 2006</LINK>). If the pregnancy is continued and unwanted, it is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother's and infant's health (<LINK REF="REF-Pallitto-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pallitto 2005</LINK>). A meta-analysis that examined risk factors for pregnancy for girls aged between 13 and 19 years, found that sociodemographic indicators, family disruption, and leaving school early were the most consistently associated factors (<LINK REF="REF-Imamura-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imamura 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of intimate partner violence on young women&#8217;s ability to control their sexual and reproductive health has also been highlighted as an important issue (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Moreno-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Moreno 2013</LINK>). Poor health-related outcomes can result from lack of autonomy and difficulty in accessing services. Pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage has been linked to unintended pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiel-de-Bocanegra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiel de Bocanegra 2010</LINK>), and limitations on condom use (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2015</LINK>), which increases the risk and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Dhairyawan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dhairyawan 2013</LINK>). It is also associated with poor perinatal and maternal health with increased risk of low birth weight and preterm birth (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Programmes that promote sexual abstinence and delay of sexual initiation in adolescence have been unsuccessful in reducing self-reported pregnancy and STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Underhill-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Underhill 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oringanje-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Oringanje 2016</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-09-26 16:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The school environment plays a pivotal role in the socialization and development of children and young people and has been considered to be an appropriate setting for interventions to promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health (<LINK REF="REF-Dick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mason_x002d_Jones-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason-Jones 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UNAIDS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNAIDS 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Schools bring together large numbers of young people within an established infrastructure, and can provide systems into which interventions can be incorporated. As many young people spend a substantial amount of time in school, it is also an arena for peer connections and the development of relationships that influence individual and group behaviour within the school, and beyond into local communities; although it is important to recognize that schools are not always supportive or safe social environments for young people (<LINK REF="REF-Abrahams-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrahams 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plummer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plummer 2007</LINK>). It is known that dropping out of school can result in adverse health outcomes for young people (<LINK REF="REF-Freudenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freudenberg 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Schools have been the setting for many sexual and reproductive health programmes that have been regarded as being successful (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2006</LINK>), and curriculum-based sexuality education programmes have become popular in many regions of the world. Most of these programmes have been based on the theory of social learning (<LINK REF="REF-Bandura-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandura 1977</LINK>), the health belief model (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenstock-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenstock 1988</LINK>), the theory of reasoned action (<LINK REF="REF-Fishbein-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishbein 2010</LINK>) - or adaptations of these theories - and aim to change attitudes, intentions, behaviours, and social norms through improved knowledge and understanding of the risks of early sexual initiation, and the importance of contraceptive and/or condom use. Many studies have also incorporated the 17 characteristics of programmes that are considered previously to have been successful (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, a range of educational interventions has been developed to promote sexual and reproductive health among adolescents, which aims to reduce the incidence of HIV, STIs, and early unwanted pregnancies. Many of these programmes encourage abstinence from sexual activity, the postponement of sexual debut until later years, or encourage secondary delay (that is, those who have their sexual debut delaying further sexual activity). They also encourage increase in condom use among those adolescents who are sexually active. Interventions include programmes delivered by teachers or peer educators that may be supplemented by condom distribution programmes, and others that include targeted health service provision and include drama, role play, and other engagement activities.</P>
<P>Other evidence suggests that simply staying on at school can have positive effects on sexual and reproductive health outcomes, and that encouraging school attendance helps girls in particular to avoid early sexual activity and pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Black-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monstad-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monstad 2008</LINK>).</P>

<P>Many sexual and reproductive health education programmes are based on behavioural science theories (<LINK REF="REF-Glanz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glanz 2010</LINK>), and aim to improve knowledge, change attitudes, intentions, behaviours, and social norms around sexual and reproductive health. There have been a large number of systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of these programmes (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiClemente-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiClemente 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flisher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallant 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrison-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson_x002c_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson, 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magnussen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magnussen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Medley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Michielsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yankah-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yankah 2008</LINK>), including reviews that have focused solely on school-based interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bennet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennet 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonner-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonner 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2008</LINK>), and a review of reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Mavedzenge-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mavedzenge 2013</LINK>). Many of these reviews have suggested that school- and community-based prevention programmes for adolescents have been effective in delaying self-reported sexual activity, HIV-related preventative behaviours, adolescent pregnancy, and STIs (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fonner-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fonner 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson_x002c_-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson, 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laud-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laud 2016</LINK>), although others have reported less, or mixed, success (<LINK REF="REF-Bennet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennet 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-DiCenso-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DiCenso 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2016</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Oringanje-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Oringanje 2016</LINK>). The logic model for how these programmes might be thought to influence sexual and reproductive health outcomes can be seen in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>As school dropout has negative effects on health outcomes for young people (<LINK REF="REF-Freudenberg-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freudenberg 2007</LINK>), researchers have become interested in using cash or other types of transfers (such as free school uniforms or vouchers) as incentives for adolescents to remain at school (<LINK REF="REF-Baird-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Baird-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baird 2010</LINK>). Conditional and unconditional cash or other transfer programmes have been introduced to take into account the substantial financial barriers to remaining at school or to accessing health services (<LINK REF="REF-Pettifor-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettifor 2012</LINK>), especially where these are not freely provided on a universal basis. These programmes view staying at school - especially for girls - as a &#8216;social vaccine&#8217;, based on evidence that the longer adolescents stay in education the less likely they are to engage in high risk sexual behaviour, such as transactional sex, or because pregnancy or STI/HIV risks would interrupt their longer-term aspirations and career plans.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-09-26 16:48:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most evaluations of school- and community-based programmes, or indeed of any interventions to improve the sexual and reproductive health of young people, have used self-reported sexual behaviours as their main outcomes. However, self-report measures have been found to be prone to bias (<LINK REF="REF-Langhaug-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhaug 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plummer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plummer 2004</LINK>), and, as such, may well be an unreliable surrogate measure for effects such as sexually acquired infections and pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2015</LINK>). Therefore, this review focuses on the effect of such interventions on biological outcome measures. Incidence of HIV or other STIs, or pregnancy are the most convincing indicators of the effectiveness of preventative interventions. This systematic review provides a unique contribution to the field because it only included studies if biological outcomes, such as HIV, STIs, or pregnancy, had been measured objectively. There are also varying interpretations of the strength of the evidence regarding school-based HIV, STIs, and pregnancy prevention programmes for adolescents. This systematic review also provides more detail about the current strength of the evidence by using the GRADE assessment tool.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-10-12 12:35:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (AMJ and either DS, CM, AH, or AK) independently extracted data on study design (location, context, theoretical framework, dates, duration of follow-up), participants (age, gender, language, ethnicity), interventions (type and complexity of the intervention and all the component parts, length of training of teachers or facilitators, content and duration of the intervention, intensity of the intervention), and methodological quality (method of randomization, attrition, sample size, adjustments for assignment bias, appropriateness of analysis for cluster RCTs, potential confounders, and protection against contamination), using a standardized data extraction form designed specifically for the purpose.</P>
<P>For the meta-analysis of the trials the effect measure we used for inference was the relative risk of the outcome. Some of the included trials reported this measure, but other trials reported odds ratios. To convert the information from these studies into a relative risk framework, we used frequencies of observed outcomes and odds ratio effect estimates and corresponding confidence limits to estimate the design effect (DE) and intraclass correlation (ICC) for each study overall. We did this by estimating the variance of the odds ratio under the assumption of independence from the raw frequencies, extracting the variance of the odds ratio from the confidence limits adjusted for clustering, and then calculating the design effect as the ratio of the variance (clustered) over the variance (independence). We followed the guidelines from the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>to reduce the size of each trial to its 'effective sample size' (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1992</LINK>). We then solved the corresponding ICC from the standard design effect equation (DE = 1+(m-1)*ICC, where m is the average cluster size). We used this information to adjust the standard error of the relative risk estimate for clustering (<LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 2014</LINK>). If the ICC or design effect was not reported, we assumed the ICC to be 0.1, as in a previous review of school-based studies (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>For <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2008-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2008 GBR</LINK>, we estimated the DE from the unweighted effect measures and confidence intervals (CIs) reported. We then applied this estimated DE to the weighted estimates and CIs reported.</P>

Where methods, data or analyses were unclear, we contacted the trial authors for clarification. We resolved any discrepancies and disagreements by discussion amongst the review author team.

However as it was not an educational intervention but rather a cash transfer incentive-based programme there was no chance of 'contamination'. Furthermore, although participants were aware of whether they were receiving cash, how much, and whether it was conditional or not, they were not aware that the primary outcomes were related to HIV/STI prevalence. <LINK REF="STD-Baird-2012-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 2012 MWI</LINK> did not mask the investigators that conducted statistical analyses and did not describe blinding of the assessors who gathered samples.

We deemed <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2007-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2007 GBR</LINK> to be at low risk of bias for objective outcomes, as follow-up was equal across both trial arms (99.6% intervention, 99.5% control). A small level of attrition may have occurred due to women attending private clinics (less than 2% terminations) or having terminations in England or Wales (2.7%). There is no reason to expect this would differ across trial arms. However, we deemed <LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2007-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2007 GBR</LINK> to be at high risk of bias for self-reported outcomes due to a very low rate of response (41% control, 38% intervention). A systematic under-representation of school leavers may have biased the result towards the null hypothesis. We deemed <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2007-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2007 TZA</LINK> to be at low risk of bias due to similar attrition rates across control (72%) and intervention (74%) arms. <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2008-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2008 GBR</LINK> conducted an intention-to-treat analysis. Missing data for objective measures meant that 28% of the control girls and 21% of the trial girls (P value 0.21) could not be matched with abortion data.

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-24 17:18:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials included in this review evaluated educational programmes that incorporated many of the specific characteristics that have previously been recommended for well-designed adolescent sexual and reproductive health interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2006</LINK>). However, despite this, they failed to demonstrate any reduction in the prevalence of STIs or adolescent pregnancy. It is only possible to theorize about the potential reasons for this, but three factors may be important.</P>
<P>Firstly, the trials could simply be underpowered for the detection of small but clinically important effects. This could certainly be true for the lack of effect on HIV. Even in geographical settings where HIV is more common than elsewhere, the incidence during adolescence is relatively low and very large trials would be required to exclude small effects with confidence (see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). For more common outcomes though, such as HSV2 and pregnancy, the trials are adequately powered to detect effects, and the effect estimate is close to zero with narrow 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Importantly, if the interventions are not reducing these more common outcomes, they are unlikely to be having an impact on HIV.</P>
<P>Secondly, despite the effort that went in to designing these educational programmes, they may still have failed to address some areas critical to effecting change. For instance, it is unclear to what extent the programmes incorporated discussion of exploitation or violence, or whether the messages were adapted appropriately for both the male and female students. Furthermore, none gave condoms freely to participants. It is therefore not possible to say that educational programmes would never work, only that these programmes did not, despite extensive efforts to develop multifaceted approaches through formative consultation with young people themselves (<LINK REF="STD-Henderson-2007-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Henderson 2007 GBR</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2007-TZA" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2007 TZA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stephenson-2008-GBR" TYPE="STUDY">Stephenson 2008 GBR</LINK>).</P>
<P>The third possible explanation is that educational programmes alone do not address the wider structural issues that influence sexual health outcomes, sexual behaviour and risk taking; the availability and affordability of schools and health services, contraceptive choice and condoms, poverty, and cultural gender norms. Indeed it is this third factor which has led some to develop and promote interventions which prioritize school attendance and educational achievement.</P>
<P>This review included two trials that promoted school attendance through cash transfers, and free school uniforms respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Baird-2012-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 2012 MWI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duflo-2015-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Duflo 2015 KEN</LINK>). Further trials are currently ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Pettifor-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pettifor 2016</LINK>), or have not yet reported their results (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01187979" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01187979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01233531" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01233531</LINK>). The two early trials have had some positive, but conflicting findings, which should temper enthusiasm for this approach until the results of these additional trials have been published. <LINK REF="STD-Baird-2012-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 2012 MWI</LINK> found a reduction in HSV2 prevalence in girls given monthly cash incentives, while <LINK REF="STD-Duflo-2015-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Duflo 2015 KEN</LINK> did not reproduce this effect with free school uniforms. Similarly, while both cash incentives and free school uniforms were associated with a reduction in adolescent pregnancies, a third trial arm in <LINK REF="STD-Duflo-2015-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Duflo 2015 KEN</LINK>, which received both free school uniforms and an educational intervention, did not have a lower incidence of pregnancy. This is counter-intuitive and further trials will help us to understand why.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-24 15:42:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the quality or certainty in the evidence using the GRADE approach, which we have presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>For educational programmes we have moderate certainty that these programmes do not have an impact on either STIs or pregnancy. As described above, we downgraded the certainty for indirectness, as we are unable to extrapolate the findings of these few trials in specific settings confidently to all educational programmes everywhere. For the finding of no effect on HIV prevalence we further downgraded the evidence to low certainty under 'imprecision', as the prevalence of HIV was generally low in these trials and very large trials would be needed to exclude fully the possibility of small but clinically important effects.</P>
<P>For incentive-based programmes, our level of certainty is low or very low due to the limited number of trials available (which affects both precision and directness) and the inconsistencies in the findings of the two available trials. There are currently several more trials of incentive-based programmes underway, and we would expect that certainty about the presence or absence of effects will be increased in future editions of this review.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-24 15:43:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used only peer-reviewed trials in this review. It is unlikely that we missed papers that were unpublished that included biological outcomes, as this is a relatively new innovation in adolescent sexual and reproductive health research and it is likely that they would be published. Most intervention studies of this kind use self-reported measures only.</P>
<P>The missing data from <LINK REF="STD-Jemmott-2015-ZAF" TYPE="STUDY">Jemmott 2015 ZAF</LINK> are unlikely to have affected the overall findings, however, the findings on pregnancy at long-term follow-up were sensitive to the exclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Cabez_x00f3_n-2005-CHL" TYPE="STUDY">Cabezón 2005 CHL</LINK>. The potential for a high risk of bias in this study suggests that the study authors' conclusions should be treated with caution.</P>
<P>All eight of the cluster-randomized controlled trials (cluster-RCTs) reported that they took account of the cluster randomization. However, not all of them included the intraclass correlation (ICC) or design effect. Therefore, we recalculated the standard errors reported and use these in our meta-analyses.</P>
<P>We have only included RCTs. Before-and-after studies are often used for public health interventions, but when we deemed that there were enough RCTs for this analysis, we decided that the inclusion of studies with less robust designs was unlikely to add anything further.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-24 16:06:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The conclusions of this Cochrane Review are consistent with previous published reviews of curriculum-based educational programmes. The Health Technology Assessment Centre&#8217;s systematic review of school-based interventions to prevent STIs including HIV included RCTs and assessed sexual risk behaviour outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Shepherd-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Shepherd 2010</LINK>). The review authors identified few statistically significant effects on behaviour in the included studies. Where there were significant effects, they often only applied to a subgroup of the participants (boys only or girls only, or only the subgroup who became sexually active during the study period). This led them to conclude that &#8220;school-based behavioural interventions for the prevention of STIs in young people can bring about improvements in knowledge and increased self-efficacy, but the interventions did not significantly influence sexual risk-taking behaviour or infection rates&#8221;. The recent suggestion that the UK Govenment's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy which incorporated school-based programmes and health service interventions has been effective in reducing adolescent pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Hadley-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadley 2016</LINK>) is promising but needs further evidence from controlled studies, preferably with randomized designs, as temporal trends can confuse and mislead.</P>
<P>There now seems to be consensus that in sub-Saharan Africa few curriculum-based educational programmes have been shown to be effective, and many of the evaluations have a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Michielsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2008</LINK>). The most recent systematic review of programmes for adolescents and young people based in schools and other settings, found 28 experimental studies, only 11 of which were RCTs, and many of which were judged to be of sub optimal quality (<LINK REF="STD-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Michielsen 2010</LINK>). This paucity of strong evidence regarding the effects of educational programmes in sub-Saharan Africa on adolescent HIV, STI and pregnancy prevention is also consistent with the assessments of earlier reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Flisher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flisher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gallant-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallant 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirby-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirby 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magnussen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magnussen 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Michielsen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Michielsen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paul-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paul 2008</LINK>), in that programmes that aimed at delaying sexual debut among adolescents and young people have been shown to have limited effectiveness. Our current knowledge of what works remains limited, especially for marginalized adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Chandra_x002d_Mouli-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandra-Mouli 2015</LINK>). </P>
<P>The finding that incentive-based programmes that encourage school attendance may reduce pregnancy in adolescents confirms the results of a previous study which suggests that leaving school early was associated with early pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Imamura-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Imamura 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-24 16:23:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a continued need to provide health services that cater for the sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents by providing a range of contraceptive choices and condoms and to include them in decision-making around services that can most fully meet their needs. Schools may be a good place in which to provide sexual and reproductive health services, but there is little evidence that curriculum-based educational programmes alone, as they are currently configured and without the provision of contraception and condoms, are effective in reducing risk behaviours for adolescents and improving their health outcomes. It is likely that the wider role of health service provision and availability, gender norms, sexual exploitation and intimate partner violence, poverty and inequality also need to be acknowledged and addressed and that programmes for girls and boys might need to be configured differently.</P>
<P>Incentive-based interventions that focus on keeping young people in secondary school have had some promising &#8212; though conflicting &#8212; early results, and further trials are ongoing to investigate this.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-24 16:29:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some of the trials included in this review were large, complex, well-designed, and well-conducted trials whose participants were followed up on a medium- to long-term basis. The cost of these trials has been significant, yet they have not been able to show effectiveness for educational curriculum-based interventions on biologically measured adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes. The implications for research are significant. The only trial that showed promise in reducing the prevalence of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) was the conditional cash transfer intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Baird-2012-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 2012 MWI</LINK>); while the only two trial interventions that reduced pregnancy were the incentive-based interventions to maintain school attendance (<LINK REF="STD-Baird-2012-MWI" TYPE="STUDY">Baird 2012 MWI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duflo-2015-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Duflo 2015 KEN</LINK>). </P>
<P>Increasingly it is being realized that structural determinants of health, such as the provision of continuing secondary education or training, are important issues to address for improving adolescent sexual and reproductive outcomes, especially for girls. We need to begin to acknowledge this fully in our work when designing high quality interventions.</P>

<P>Cluster-RCT to assess the impact of a theoretically-based sexuality education programme in 25 (13 intervention, 12 control) secondary schools in the east of Scotland. The approach taken was stated as 'harm reduction' so that those already sexually active would be encouraged to use condoms. Incentives were offered to schools including teacher training, supply cover, or, for schools in the control arm, an equivalent cash amount that could be spent on personal and social education but not sexuality education.</P>

<P>Reducing HIV in adolescents (RHIVA): a proof of concept cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a cash incentivised prevention intervention to reduce HIV infection in high school learners in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa</P>
</CHAR_STUDY_NAME>
<CHAR_METHODS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 10:45:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>The impact of the cash incentivised intervention will be assessed using a matched pair, cluster-RCT design. The 14 selected high schools in the Vulindlela School Circuit will be matched in pairs. The matched pairs of schools will be the unit of randomization. Baseline measurements, using a standardized tool (structured questionnaire and biological specimens) will be undertaken simultaneously in each matched pair and will include all eligibly enrolled and consenting learners in the respective schools. On completion of baseline measurements in each matched pair of schools, the randomization code for the pair will be revealed and the intervention will be implemented in the intervention school. All schools will receive the same prevention intervention but only the intervention school will receive the cash incentives. Follow-up measurements will be undertaken approximately 12 and 24 months after implementation of the intervention using a similar standardized assessment tool to that used at baseline.</P>

<P>Individually randomized, parallel controlled trial. The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether providing cash transfers to young women and their household, conditional on school attendance, reduces young women's risk of acquiring HIV. The overall goal of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) intervention is to reduce structural barriers to education, with the goal of increasing school attendance of young women, thereby decreasing their HIV risk.</P>

<P>Quote: "A system of constrained randomisation was used to allocate communities to the two study arms,ensuring adequate balance on important factors. There were 28,000 ways of allocating half the communities in each stratum to the intervention arm. A computer program tested whether each of these allocations satisfied balance criteria, including: (i) mean HIV prevalence in each study arm within 0.075% of overall mean; (ii) mean prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in each arm within 0.1% of overall mean; (iii) one of two communities neighbouring gold mines allocated to each arm; (iv) even distribution of intervention communities over the four project districts. A total of 953 allocations satisfied these criteria, and one was randomly chosen at a meeting attended by senior government officials" Source: p.436 (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Biological outcomes: Quote: &#8220;There may have been a small level of attrition across both arms because of women attending private health care (less than 2% of terminations), moving from Scotland during the study period (1% average annual migration out of Scotland), or having their terminations in England or Wales (2.7% of all terminations performed on Scottish residents). On balance, the comparison between this study and national rates suggests that the linkage was broadly effective.&#8221;</P>
<P>Comment: 99.6% participants in intervention arm analysed, 99.5% participants in control arm analysed (flow diagram p.2). Very high follow-up rate, loss to follow-up not significantly different across trial arms (9/2071 intervention arm vs 10/2135 control arm). Intention-to-treat analysis performed.</P>

<P>Quote: &#8220;One school considered the baseline survey to be too explicit for pupils aged 13-14 years but took part in all other aspects of the study&#8221; &#8220;a new work experience scheme increased this [leaving school] to 27%. The response rate was lower for school leavers (41% control, 38% intervention). Non-response among those still in school was primarily among persistent absentees, but a small proportion refused to participate (2%). The response rates were similar in each arm of the trial.&#8221;</P>
<P>Comment: follow-up data available for 2987/4233 (71%) control pupils, and 2867/4197 (68%) intervention pupils. High loss to follow-up, spread approximately equally across both groups. Systematic under-representation of school leavers could possibly have introduced bias towards the null as data is missing regarding long-term effects.</P>

<P>Quote: &#8220;Primary analysis was by intention to treat.&#8221; There was &#8220;more missing data in the trial register for abortion matching (postcode and date of birth) than for live birth matching (NHS number only). Any bias from under matching of abortions is likely to be toward underestimation of abortion data in the control arm, since the control arm had more missing data than the intervention arm&#8221;. &#8220;missing postcode for 25% of girls (28% control, 21% intervention, p=0.21)&#8221;.</P>
<P>Comment: 100% of all eligible girls were followed up, and an intention-to-treat analysis performed. Missing data for abortions was higher in the control group but the P value was 0.21.

Two schools (one from each arm) withdrew because of staff changes without knowing their random allocation. One school was unable to implement the intervention, but contributed to follow-up. Differential loss to follow-up between intervention and control schools was largely attributable to loss of one large school after a parent's objection to the questionnaire, although completion rates differed significantly at first follow-up.

A reported decline in HIV incidence in Zimbabwe resulted in a change in study design in order to increase the power of the study. As a result, the final cross-sectional survey included six enumeration areas from each community (each community contained approximately 50 enumeration areas), so approximately 12% of eligible 18-22 year olds were sampled.

However, the findings are not easily generalized to other programmes or settings.<BR/>
