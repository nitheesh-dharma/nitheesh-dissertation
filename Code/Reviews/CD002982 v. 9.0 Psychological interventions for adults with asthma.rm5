There are one or two issues in relation to cumulative updates that will need attention, but this update generally reads well. I have made some changes in red in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution -***please add something in this section of the cover sheet in relation to contribution to updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new - as this is a second update it is confusing to readers to amend the previous entry into What's new. ***Could you separate out the changes for this update from the changes made in 2005 please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References - checked by Liz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - fine. Why is Freeman labelled as C in allocation concealment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels- I have turned off totals for single study results for comparison 3 outcomes 15 onwards. Also I have changed the pooled PEF for relaxation therapy to WMD instead of SMD (as both trials use Litres/min) as this is easier for readers to understand. The text for results have been changed to WMD in L/min for this outcome as well. ***Please check that this is correct and that you are happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis -fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract- PEF results for relaxation changed to WMD in L/min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods - I have amended the first para slightly to indicate that the cross-overs were excluded in the last update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results - Few changes in red (such as WMD for PEF above and P value reduced to 0.054 to be in line with 2 significant figures used elswhere).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion - fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked - done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action - back to authors for amendment of What's new and authors' contributions please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br&gt;CJC edit 29 Sept 05&lt;br&gt;What's new amended - I have listed the new studies.&lt;br&gt;Abstract - number of studies and participants added to clarify that these results are based on small numbers.&lt;br&gt;Good description of methodological quality of studies.&lt;br&gt;Toby could you add a Visual Rx figure showing the impact of relaxation therapy on rescue bronchilators as NNT and put this in the results part of the text please?&lt;br&gt;Results and discussion are otherwise fine.&lt;br&gt;When the NNT has been added this is ready for Peer Review,&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refs &amp;amp; search section checked 23/09/05 Liz&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;TJL added 220805&lt;br&gt;Hi Janelle, &lt;br&gt; Excellent work - glad the trip down to Tooting paid off. A couple of queries/uncertainties that would need to be fleshed out before we can proceed with this review update: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I have underlined a couple of changes in the text. Use your skill and judgement to find them and agree/amend as you see fit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Study quality. Jadad scores aren't much cop for complex interventions as 40% of the score is derived from blinding, which you cannot do in this setting. If studies are underreporting then you may need to re-word the statements on study quality - i.e. study quality was difficult to assess so uncertainty remains over validity of these findings. Of course in an ideal world all trials are done properly, but in this world, the only way we have of even knowing what happens is via reporting. Jadad scores are better at this, but you have the blinding problem mentioned above. If it were down to me, all trialists would be threatened with dinner at my aunt's house until they came up with more rigorous study design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope that these comments are helpful to you - feel free to ring me if you want clarification of what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby &lt;br&gt;__________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.3&lt;br&gt;Final Edit by CJC&lt;br&gt;I have checked the changes and spellchecked the text. This can go on for the next submission.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;___________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes after expert peer review 20th November 2003&lt;br&gt;Comments on expert peer review.&lt;br&gt;Peer review one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition of psychotherapy now added. Descriptions on interventions can be found in the included studies table so we have not added these to the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have now done a search including biofeedback and found some studies but these were either CCTs or not controlled studies (all included in excluded studies table).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differing rationale of the studies is explained so we haven't expanded on this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have said we are not including education and why so also not expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some comment on included studies criteria, we haven't changed these but added a further explanatory sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can't indicate which method is best due to poor methodology and small numbers.&lt;br&gt;Changed psychotherapeutic to psychological as recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer review two (long one)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definition added and descriptions on therapies taken from the table and put into the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions for background added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the next discussion on interventions and rationale we have ignored as this advice would involve a reworking of the review's objectives!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes.&lt;br&gt;We have removed coping (not assessed anyway) but not changing our outcomes now as they were agreed at protocol stage- something for discussion for future reviews (eg updates and children)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A discussion of appropriate outcome measures is a methodological paper and beyond the scope of this review! &lt;br&gt;Added comments about inclusion criteria for trials- ensure interventions target people that need therapy.&lt;br&gt;Also added comment about healthcare utilisation being a primary outcome in the discussion.&lt;br&gt;Ignored all of last two pages as changes the focus of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study PUT 2003 has been incorporated into the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Psychotherapeutic interventions for adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;*************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 13 june 2003 (180603 TJL PASTED AUTHOR'S RESPONSE BELOW YOUR COMMENTS CHRIS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a well written review and was a pleasure to read!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Fine (helpful to mention that CCTs were in the protocol but not in the review). Efficacy inserted in astract to match text later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: Fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: None!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: Conflicting study findings should not be given as a reason for not pooling. I suggest this is removed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract:: Clear. Do you want to suggest that future studies should be parallel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Again clear but there is a bit of a mixture of results and methods in this section. Overall it flows well so I am happy to leave this as it stands. I am not sure that you can just modify the Jadad scale to suit your purposes (although I understand why you did) and it is not going to make an overall difference to the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant within group differences alone are not valid currency of the review as the control is between groups. These either need to be accompanied by a strong health warning or should not be reported....... I suggest that you put this in the beginning of the discussion if you wish to keep all the within group differences in the review, but it is not logical to include only randomised trials in the review and then report outcomes THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY THE RANDOMISATION PROCESS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: See above and please change around the order of reporting to deal with the asthma-specific outcomes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Cross-over trial design is not appropriate in my view due to carry over of this type of intervention. Was this checked for in the cross-overs? Loew and Mussell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next action: back to authors please. &lt;br&gt;*************************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br&gt;180603 &lt;br&gt;Response from Sharon Fleming: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Toby,&lt;br&gt;Thank you for you email with Chris's comments. Could you please thank Chris for his encouraging comments. I've edited the review regarding these-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) I've taken out the sentence on conflicting results from the synopsis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) I've added a caution sentence in the discussion. I do take Chris' point about the value of reporting within group differences, particularly as we excluded CCT's for the same reason. However these were reported results in the studies so I've left them in. We are prepared to discuss this if you disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3) I have not changed the order of results reporting in the discussion as the results were reported in the order of primary outcomes first and secondary outcomes next. It then makes sense to do the same in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4) I've added 'no analysis for carry over effects' in the interventions column of the included studies table for Loew and Mussell. I can understand Chris's point about inclusion of cross over studies for psychotherapeutic studies. With hindsight, it was probably something we should have considered when writing the protocol but these studies do not change the results (only significant within group differences) so I don't think we should remove them. I've added a discussion paragraph about the cross over studies. We have the Garfield Weston Foundation listed as extramural sources of support- we had no support for this review so I don't know where this came&lt;br&gt;from!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;20_06_03&lt;br&gt;Dear Sharon,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for reworking this. I am happy with what you have changed and accept your arguments for those things that you have left alone! The Garfield Weston Foundation support me (which is why I have added them to external sources of support) as I hope my work adds to the quality of reviews. If you feel that in the case of this review my input has been minimal and therefore wish me to remove Garfield Weston I am willing to do so!&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby I am happy for this to go for peer review.&lt;br&gt;14th October 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Response from authors (SF &amp;amp; CMS) to peer review comments.&lt;br&gt;Review 1 (short one!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A definition of psychotherapy has now been added. Interventions are described in full in the included studies table. We are reluctant to add this description to the text as it is already a wordy review! Biofeedback has now been added to the search terms and a search done, resulting in some CCTs but no RCTs. We have described the differing rationale of the studies as a limitation of research in this area. We state that psychoeducation is included only if psychological interventions is the main part. We are not changing that criteria now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand the comment about lack of significant findings. We do not want to change the outcomes of the review at this late stage. The review may provoke discussion on these outcomes and we are happy to consider changes for updates.&lt;br&gt;Comorbidity issues and severity of disease in the patient samples have been mentioned now.&lt;br&gt;The psychologists on our team did not agree that breathing retraining, yoga or massage therapy (2nd reviewer comments) were psychological interventions, so we are not including these (a sentence has been added explaining this).&lt;br&gt;We cannot comment on effects on asthma due to the poor studies (I thought we had explained this adequately). We have changed the title to psychological interventions from psychotherapeutic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2nd reviewer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;on psychological interventions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old title: Psychotherapeutic interventions for adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: Psychotherapeutic interventions for adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Psychotherapeutic interventions for adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: Psychological interventions for adults with asthma&lt;br&gt;Old title: *Psychotherapeutic interventions for adults with asthma&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:37:19 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson" REVIEW_NO="PSYC-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.0.15" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>It is thought by some that psychological interventions can help people with asthma. Systematically, we searched the literature on psychological interventions to find valid studies that looked at the effects of providing mainly psychological interventions for adults with asthma. The studies found examined many different therapies and measured different physical and psychological outcomes; for these reasons, their results could not be easily combined. However, meta-analyses could be performed to determine the effect of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) on quality of life, bio-feedback on PEF, and relaxation therapy on PEF and FEV1 and medication use. The available studies were completed with small numbers of people and the way the studies were conducted could be improved. More research with larger numbers of people and improved design needs to be done before it is known whether psychological interventions are effective in improving health outcomes for adults with asthma.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:37:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Many people have asthma, and for some their symptoms may be triggered by psychological factors. In addition, compliance with medical therapy may have a psychological dimension. Therefore, psychological interventions aim to reduce the burden of symptoms and improve management of the disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions for adults with asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and PsycINFO were searched with pre-defined terms up until May 2007.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:37:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Randomised controlled trials published in any language assessing the effects of a psychological intervention compared with a form of control in adult participants were included in the review. Our primary outcome was healthcare resource defined as: hospitalisation, emergency room visits and/or GP visits</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers assessed the relevance of abstracts identified by electronic searching and retrieved agreed studies for further scrutiny. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were assembled and data extracted.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:37:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Fifteen studies, involving 687 participants, were included in the review. Study quality was poor and sample sizes were frequently small. However, some pooled effects were analysed. Three studies measured our primary outcome but individually did not report significant differences between treatment and control. The use of 'as needed' medications was reduced in two studies, (47 patients), by relaxation therapy (OR 4.47, CI 1.22 to 16.44). There was no significant difference in FEV1 for relaxation therapy in four studies of 150 patients, (SMD -0.01, CI -0.41 to 0.40). Quality of life, measured using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire in two studies, (48 patients), showed a positive effect following CBT (WMD 0.71, CI 0.23 to 1.19). Peak Expiratory Flow outcome data in two studies, (51 patients), indicated a significant difference in favour of bio-feedback therapy (SMD 0.66, CI 0.09 to 1.23) but no significant difference following relaxation therapy (WMD 43 L/min, CI -5 to 92 L/min). There was no statistically significant improvement in depression levels following relaxation therapy (SMD 0.17, CI -0.25 to 0.59). The remainder of the findings between studies were conflicting. This may have been due to the different types of interventions used and the deficiencies in trial design.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review was unable to draw firm conclusions for the role of psychological interventions in asthma due to the absence of an adequate evidence base. Larger, well-conducted and reported randomised trials are required in this area, in order to determine the effects of these techniques in the treatment of asthma in adults.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:28:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:07:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>An estimated 5.1 million people in the UK have asthma (including 1.4 million children). Asthma is expensive, resulting in an estimated cost to the NHS in England of £850 million a year . There are also indirect costs to the economy as over 18 million working days are lost due to the disease each year. People with asthma also incur costs for medication, travel to GP surgeries and medical equipment (<LINK REF="REF-NAC-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2001</LINK>). The high frequency of the disease, and its attendant costs, have prompted the production of guidelines for the management of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2003</LINK>). These guidelines include medication management as well as recommendations to improve patients' self-management skills in the form of Asthma Action Plans. Most patients with asthma are treated in primary care and outpatient settings and the overall success of treatment relies on the contribution to effective management that the patient can bring to bear. This includes factors such as compliance with medical therapy, effective inhaler technique and the ability to manage psychological elements. Asthma has a psychological component, including emotion (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1993</LINK>), so the treatment of asthma increasingly needs to focus on the whole person, taking account of psychological as well as physiological elements. This means that evidence to support clinical staff in deciding upon the type, format and frequency of psychological techniques is needed. The aim of these strategies is to help reduce panic or fear, improve breathing and respiratory function and impact positively on general health and quality of life.</P>
<P>Literature is growing on the relationship between psychosocial factors and asthma. <LINK REF="REF-Bosley-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosley 1996</LINK> found in their review of studies on asthma deaths and near fatal asthma attacks that asthma deaths are related to lack of prompt medical treatment and lack of prompt action by patients and their relatives. They also suggested that there may be an association between psychiatric and asthma morbidity and that a near fatal attack may increase denial or psychiatric problems. Patient's attitudes to their illness may affect their coping skills and compliance with treatment. Because of the psychosocial effects of asthma, strategies such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Kotses-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kotses 1995</LINK>), and group and individual counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1990</LINK>) are now integrated with educational packages about the self-management of asthma in order to improve health outcomes. Other psychotherapies that have been used are autogenic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>) and relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a growing body of work using review methodologies to assess the impact of a range of psychosocial interventions in asthma. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Devine-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Devine 1996</LINK> showed that psycho educational programmes involving relaxation and behavioural techniques improved health outcomes for adults with asthma. Reviews have been undertaken on self-management education for asthmatic adults (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002a</LINK>), limited asthma education for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002b</LINK>), family therapy for asthma in children (<LINK REF="REF-Yorke-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorke 2005a</LINK>) and psychological interventions for children with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Yorke-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorke 2005b</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002a</LINK> concluded that training in asthma self-management, which involves self-monitoring by peak flow or symptoms, coupled with regular medical review and a written plan, appears to improve health outcomes for adults with asthma. Training programmes, which enable people to adjust their medication, also appeared to be more effective than other forms of self-management. In contrast limited asthma education, meaning information only, did not appear to improve health outcomes in adults with asthma, although perceived symptoms might improve (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002b</LINK>). Reviews led to the conclusion that more work is needed to elucidate the effect of providing information in the emergency department for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2002b</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Haby-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haby 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Yorke-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorke 2005a</LINK> in their review of the only two trials on family therapy in asthma and of 12 trials on psychotherapeutic interventions for children (<LINK REF="REF-Yorke-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorke 2005b</LINK>) found some indication that this is a useful adjunct to medication for younger people with asthma.</P>
<P>These reviews do not answer questions specifically about psychological interventions and therefore a systematic review of the effectiveness of psychological interventions for adults with asthma is also required. When managing patients, clinical staff need to have reliable information on whether psychological techniques work, and if so which are the most effective, for which patients. It is also important to know whether interventions work best alone or in combination with each other, and whether it is better that patients are taught individually or in groups. If possible it would also be useful for staff and patients to know what benefits might be expected, and whether they are short-lived or last in the longer term.</P>

<LI>To assess the overall efficacy of psychological interventions compared with usual treatment in improving health and behavioural outcomes for adults with asthma.</LI>
<LI>To assess the comparative efficacy of different types of psychotherapy for adults with asthma.</LI>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of psychological interventions for adults with asthma.<BR/>In the original protocol it was stated that this review would examine CCTs (case-controlled trials) on this subject as well, however as RCTs provide the stronger level of evidence, it was decided to concentrate on these only and a search strategy was designed to include RCTs. The original version of this review included two cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Loew-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Loew 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mussell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mussell 1988</LINK>). We consider this study design inappropriate for studies using psychological interventions as the influence of a treatment might continue after the intervention has been stopped and were therefore excluded from this systematic review. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults, both male and female, over 16 years of age with asthma who have been physician diagnosed or have been diagnosed using internationally established criteria (e.g. BTS guidelines).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-20 14:25:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Any type of psychological intervention used in the treatment of asthma in adults was considered for this review. Psychological interventions have a long history and have been defined as the procedure by which a therapist purposively and systematically attempts to influence a patient by psychological means so that the patient's symptoms decrease or there is a positive change in behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Barendregt-1957" TYPE="STUDY">Barendregt 1957</LINK>). These interventions will be delivered by a trained practitioner or in consultation or supervision by a trained practitioner. Psychotherapy models were categorised according to their theoretical base as follows:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">1. Cognitive behavioural therapy (incorporating core elements of both behavioural and cognitive models)</HEADING>
<P>Using behavioural techniques to change negative thoughts mediating health behaviour. In asthma, this may address incorrect symptom attributions (over- or under-playing their significance) giving rise to suboptimal medication use, or may use systematic relaxation techniques to extinguish fear responses associated with psychosocial triggers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Cognitive therapy</HEADING>
<P>Identification and constructive management of damaging thoughts, such as perceptions of helplessness or inappropriate fear of asthma attack that can trigger episodes. Information (e.g. about the relationship between anxiety and bronchoconstriction) also targets cognitions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3. Behavioural therapy</HEADING>
<P>Concerned with identifying the processes by which behaviour has been learned via association, reward or observation and modifying behaviour using methods such as systematic desensitization, selective reinforcement and positive modelling. The behaviour itself, rather than underlying motivations, is the focus of behavioural interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">4. Relaxation therapy</HEADING>
<P>Designed to control stress &amp; anxiety. In asthma, may reduce panic or fear &amp; improve breathing and respiratory function. Approaches include progressive relaxation (systematically creating tension and release in different parts of the body and/or via guided mental imagery), autogenic training (focuses on attending to bodily feelings and mentally controlling them), hypnosis (deep relaxation that may be induced using mental imagery, often accompanied by autosuggestion to create positive thoughts &amp; feelings). Hypnosis is also thought to induce a state of suggestibility, facilitating both patients' insight into their unconscious motives or anxieties and the absorption of therapeutic messages.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">5. Bio-feedback therapy</HEADING>
<P>Feedback of biological indicators, which the subject learns to control using relaxation. May also be considered a behavioural intervention since the feedback can act as a reinforcer of improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">6. 'Supportive' counselling</HEADING>
<P>Counselling involves talking over problems with a health professional. In supportive counselling, the counsellor simply aims to be a good listener and provide emotional support, rather than offering a more targeted psychotherapeutic intervention. It generally focuses on problems in the here and now and has a short-term duration.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">7. Individual and group format</HEADING>
<P>Some therapies can be delivered to groups of individuals as well as single patients. Social interaction within a supportive non-judgmental peer group may increase self-esteem and encourage disclosure, both of which may (under appropriate circumstances) facilitate therapy.</P>
<P>Patient education programmes were only included where psychological therapy formed the major part of the intervention. Breathing retraining, yoga and massage therapies were not included in this review as these therapies were not considered to be primarily psychological in nature.</P>

<P>For the purpose of this updated review the primary outcome has been changed from level of severity of asthma symptoms and psychological outcomes to health service utilisation. Health service utilisation would be expected to decrease after a psychological intervention if the secondary outcome measures improved. In addition, healthcare utilisation may help to indicate the economic viability of an intervention.</P>

<P>Summary of the 15 eligible studies is given below. Details of individual studies are contained in the table 'Characteristics of included studies'.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study Design</HEADING>
<P>See Included Studies table. One new study (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>) was added for the 2006 update, making a total of fifteen studies included in the review, with two publications from one study reporting different outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>). All were randomised and were conducted over a variety of durations (3 days to 12 months).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 687 participants were included in this review. The studies were generally small with only one having more than a hundred people included (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> recruited 106 people) and the smallest (<LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>) had 12. A power calculation to determine sample size was performed in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>). Six studies included details about how many people were approached to join the research: <LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK> where 90 people were invited and 27 declined to join and 34 agreed (no information is given about the other 29 people), <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> screened 329 people and 68 were randomised; <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> recruited 60 participants and randomised 60; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> where 47 more people were screened than actually participated in the study. <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> invited 101 and 25 agreed. <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> approached 86 people, 38 were excluded and <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> where 90 people attended an initial interview resulting in 30 joining the research. No further data are provided from the other studies. <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> included a flow chart of participant inclusion.</P>
<P>In some studies a description of withdrawals was not given (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mussell-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Mussell 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> gave the numbers who withdrew but no details of their characteristics. <LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK> did not mention withdrawals but eleven people appear not to have completed the study and it is difficult to see what happened to patients, as the numbers do not tally. <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> referred to patients who had dropped out, but also seemed to have a group who completed the treatment but for whom there are no measurements. Although <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> commented on missing data there was no other discussion about missing data and the potential impact this might have had on the findings. <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> provided a flow diagram of participant progress through the phases of the study and <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK> provided a table of participant adherence and drop-out rates. <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> lost six participants between the pre- and post assessments. <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> provided details of drop-outs and withdrawals. In the rest of the studies there was no clear plan enabling the reader to track easily the progress of patients approached or included in the trial and there was no discussion about missing data and the potential impact this might have had on the findings.</P>
<P>The severity of asthma varied from mild to severe, however not all studies reported this. Of note, the sample population included in <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> had a co-existing asthma and panic disorder.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>A wide variety of outcomes were used. Health service utilisation was measured by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>). Other objective measures included lung function such as FEV1, FVC and peak flow (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>) and medication usage (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>). Asthma symptoms were also measured (<LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>). In addition some researchers measured psychological traits such as anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>), depression (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>) fear (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>); health locus of control (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>), quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>) and stress (<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions used</HEADING>
<P>The types of interventions investigated were diverse. Nine studies used some form of relaxation technique as their intervention including hypnosis (<LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>), functional relaxation (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>), progressive relaxation (<LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>), mental imagery (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>), self-administered relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK>) and autogenic training (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>). Three studies assessed biofeedback techniques including heart rate variability (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>) and EMG (<LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK>). In addition, cognitive behavioural therapy was combined with rehabilitation (<LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>) and a psycho-educational programme which included behavioural and cognitive techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>) were also assessed. Details of the interventions used are described in the included studies table.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>) included two intervention groups - one receiving functional relaxation and the other autogenic therapy. The results section of the <LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK> paper reports analysis from the functional relaxation group and the control group only and therefore is classified as a functional relaxation intervention in this review.</P>
<P>Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK>) included relaxation (taught and practiced using a tape-recorded relaxation training exercise), CBT workbook and writing exercises as the intervention. For the purpose of this review this study has been classified as a relaxation therapy intervention.</P>
<P>It should be pointed out that single methods are seldom used and most practicing therapists use an eclectic approach employing different combinations of therapies to suit the individual circumstances (e.g. presumed mechanism of influence, patient characteristics, therapist preferences). There is also considerable overlap between methods; for example, relaxation techniques are part of the armoury of tools used for behaviour modification. In asthma, all of these techniques are used in combination with drug therapies.</P>

<P>Overall the methodological quality of the studies was poor, with several weaknesses in experimental design. Jadad scores varied between 1 and 4 with three studies rated at 4 (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>) and two studies rated at 3 (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>).

</U>
<BR/>Where allocation concealment or the randomisation process was unclear, letters were sent to authors asking for this information. However, as most of these studies were completed some time ago, correspondence from only five authors (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>) was received (apart from information that authors had died or moved away).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Method of randomisation</HEADING>
<P>Studies were randomised with patients allocated to control and experimental groups, however authors tended not to be clear as to whether all the patients who were eligible for the study were approached. Frequently the method of randomisation was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> randomised participants in a 2 x 2 x 4 design; only data from the 2 x 2 groups were analysed as the third group also received Critical Thinking therapy which is not an included therapy for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> used a block design and <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK> described a restricted randomisation design. <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> does not describe the method of randomisation but refers to 'a failure to achieve acceptable randomisation'. <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> had a system of drawing from unmarked envelopes. <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK> reported that the outpatient department sister, who had no other involvement in the study, was responsible for the randomisation and on correspondence confirmed randomisation was done by computer. <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK> also confirmed on correspondence that randomisation was done by computer. Therefore it is difficult in all the studies to gauge whether the method of randomisation was appropriate. This is reflected in the Jadad scores.</P>
<P>Sometimes a researcher blinded to the participants group assessed the outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> used independent researchers who were unaware of the patient's treatment allocation. <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK> involved the outpatient department sister who was blind to the patient's group and although the author conducted the intervention, they are clear that the challenge test was conducted with a researcher who was blinded. Assessment of outcome in <LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK> was not blinded and in <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>, the same person undertook the treatment intervention and measurement. <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> stated that assessments and medical assessments were blinded, but the investigator performed the interventions and delivered the psychometric assessments. <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> stated that the assessors performing the monthly physical assessments were blind to participant allocation. All other authors failed to mention whether the assessment of outcomes was blinded or not.</P>
<P>In general therefore, the conclusion reached about the quality of the studies reflects the comment made by <LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2001</LINK>:653, in his overlapping systematic review, that 'most of the few available studies suffer from inadequacies in experimental design, instrumentation, procedures and/or reporting of results'.<BR/>

<P>This was measured in a variety of ways in eleven studies of which six used a form of relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>), two used bio-feedback techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>) and three used CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Juniper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 1992</LINK>), which includes asthma symptom categories, was used as an outcome measure in three studies. Two studies used CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>) and one used mental imagery relaxation (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>). A meta-analysis could be performed with the two CBT studies (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>). This analysis indicated a significant difference in favour of CBT for the Total AQLQ (WMD 0.71, CI 0.23 to 1.19). <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> found no significant improvement in the intervention group Total AQLQ mean 5.25 (SD 1.39) compared to the control group mean 4.89 (SD 1.45). Means and standard deviations were obtained through author correspondence and a narrative description of no significance difference between the two groups using repeated measures of ANOVA was provided in the paper.</P>
<P>The Asthma Symptom Checklist (ASC) (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsman 1973</LINK>) was used as an outcome measure in four studies. Three studies examined relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>) and one used CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> showed within group differences for hyperventilation severity over the course of treatment with relaxation (F=3.97, df=2,106, P&lt;0.04) , but there were no significant differences between groups. Nocturnal symptoms i.e. sleep, and wheeze, activity, cough and phlegm were reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>). They examined the impact of hypnosis on people with a history of mild to moderate asthma. Patients were separated as to whether they scored high or low on a scale to measure their susceptibility to hypnosis (Stanford hypnotic clinical scale). Daily symptom scores, the rating scale is not given, were averaged for the first two and the last two weeks of the treatment period. In the high susceptibility group who received the hypnosis intervention, the subjective scores for nocturnal symptoms, wheeze and activity limitations improved after treatment. Mean percentage change in symptom scores was -62 (P &lt;0.05) for sleep, -53 (P&lt;0.001) for wheeze and -58 (P&lt;0.01) for activity. No significant change was found in either the low susceptibility treatment or control groups. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> had group numbers that were too small to allow statistical analysis to test for differences, however the whole sample had a decrease in overall symptoms post intervention when compared to pre-intervention measurement, however no usable data were presented. Frequency of acute attacks as measured by patient diaries were unable to be assessed statistically due to the small sample and the infrequency of these attacks. <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> showed a significant improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group for the sub-categories of obstruction (P = 0.04), fatigue (P &lt;0.001) and irritation (P = 0.03) but not for dyspnoea, hyperventilation and anxiety.</P>
<P>Self-reported asthma wheeze was measured in two studies examining relaxation techniques (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>). Meta-analysis indicated no significant improvement in the group receiving relaxation therapy (WMD -0.07, CI -0.69 to 0.56). Frequency of coughing did not significantly decrease in the group receiving relaxation therapy (mean 10.90, SD 10.15) compared to the control group (mean 13.80, SD 16.63) (P = 0.3) (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> also reported no significant increase in self-reported activity level in the intervention group (mean 15.90, SD 12.85) compared to the control group (mean 14.30, SD 18.24) (P = 0.76).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> measured the number of asthma symptom free days during 14 days of CBT and found no significant interactions between group and test occasion (F(1.18) = 1.11, P = 0.31) using 2 x 2 ANOVA.</P>
<P>Bronchoconstriction and hyperventilation were measured in a study by <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>. Within group differences, before and after treatment with bio-feedback, were not significant for bronchoconstriction and hyperventilation. Between group differences were not reported and mean scores were provided with no SD. <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK> also investigated the effects of bio-feedback on these outcomes. Symptoms in the bio-feedback group were found to decrease significantly from the first to the last sessions (P = 0.02) but not in the control group.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>) of an asthma rehabilitation programme including cognitive behavioural therapy resulted in both the intervention group and the control group having less asthma attacks (data to support this are not provided, apart from P&lt;0.05).</P>

<P>A pooled effect of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>) following relaxation therapy indicated no statistically significant improvement in PEF measurements (WMD 43 L/min, CI -5 to 92 L/min).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> measured FEV1/FVC, with the ratio expressed as a percentage, following relaxation and found a statistically significant improvement in the intervention group mean 102.0 compared to the control mean 93.7 (F(1,54) = 4.57, P = 0.38). Also measured by <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> was FEV1% predicated.

<P>Methacholine challenge test.<BR/>A methacholine challenge test to detect improvement of asthma following intervention was used in two RCTs. One adopted a hypnotic technique to relax subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>) and the other study used relaxation training (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>). No significant treatment effects were shown in the RCT using relaxation training. In the trial using a hypnotic technique the most important finding was a significant improvement in bronchial hyper-responsiveness for patients with a high susceptibility for hypnosis. The data using mean PC20 (SEM) were 9.09 (1.71) before treatment and 15.9 (2.79) after treatment (P=0.008), where PC20 is the provocation concentration of methacholine that caused a 20% fall in FEV1.</P>

A pooled effect from these two studies demonstrated a positive response to treatment (OR 4.47, CI 1.22 to 16.44). This translates to a number needed to treat of 3 (95% CI 2 to 28) (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). For the sub-group of people with a high susceptibility to hypnosis, <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK> found the relaxation group had significantly less bronchodilator use after treatment (mean 34.0 puffs/day (SD 7.8) when compared to before treatment (46.0 (7.2), P&lt;0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>, also using relaxation, found a significant difference in the numbers of people in the experimental group (n=4) who required less bronchodilators when compared to the control (n=0; P&lt;0.05).</P>
<P>The effect of bio-feedback on medication use yielded conflicting results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>) reported a significant improvement in the intervention group mean 5.15 (SD 2.78) compared to the control group mean 7.58 (SD 2.68) and another <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK> found no significant differences when measuring amounts of inhaled or oral steroids taken at 6 weeks post intervention.

<P>Anxiety was used as an outcome measure in eight studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>) using a variety of interventions and measurement techniques. The effect of relaxation on anxiety levels was investigated in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> assessed anxiety levels using the Profiles of Mood States (POMS) (<LINK REF="REF-McNair-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 2003</LINK>) and reported no statistically significant difference in the relaxation group (mean 28, SD 7.58) compared to the control group (mean 22, SD 8.14) (P = 0.054). <LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK> used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and showed an increase for the intervention as compared to the control group which is referred to as 'a tendency to react positively'. However, the magnitude was small with an increase or decrease of one point only, which is unlikely to have either clinical or statistical significance. Anxiety was measured using the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1970</LINK>) in <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK> presented no data. <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> included a narrative conclusion of no statistical difference between the groups, using univariate-repeated measure-ANOVA. Means and SD were provided following author correspondence for Trait Anxiety (intervention mean 42.0, SD 13.11 and control mean 38.63, SD 11.90) and State Anxiety (intervention mean 39.09, SD 13.0 and control mean 42.85, SD 15.24). State anxiety was assessed in <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>. The groups were too small to allow statistical analysis to test for differences between the two intervention groups and the control group, however the whole sample had a significant decrease in anxiety post intervention (at one year follow up) when compared to pre-intervention measurement (mean change -12.09; t=4.13;P&lt;0.01). The same study assessed neuroticism, extraversion and lying (Eysenck Personality Inventory), repressive coping (Marlowe Crowne Social Desirability Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Crowne-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowne 1960</LINK>)), self-control methods to the solution of behavioural problems (Self-Control Schedule (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 1980</LINK>)), and catastrophising (Dysfunctional Cognition Inventory (<LINK REF="REF-Zocco-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zocco 1985</LINK>)). There were no significant differences found.</P>
<P>Trait anxiety was measured by <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK> following CBT. Patients were treated in an Asthma Rehabilitation Group involving education and a cognitive behavioural intervention. There were significant differences between baseline and one year follow up in those who received the intervention, in respect of trait anxiety (data at enrolment (t0) showed a mean 43.2 (SD 10.0) and at 1 year (t1) 36.7 (9.1),P&lt;0.0005), psychophysiological disorder (t0 48.7 (9.3) t1 45.1 (9.4), P&lt;0.02) and depressive symptoms (t0 5.8 (3.7) t1 3.6 (3.0), P&lt;0.006), but not for psychophysiological disorder in the control group. There are other outcomes studying optimism, negative staff regard, internal awareness, external control, psychological stigma and authoritarian attitude from a Respiratory Illness Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Staudenmayer-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staudenmayer 1978</LINK>). Within group analyses showed significant decreases for external control (data at enrolment (t0) showed a mean 10.1 (SD 3.8) and at 1 year (t1) 8.4 (3.5),P&lt;0.05) and psychological stigma (t0 9.0 (3.8), t17.5 (3.8),P&lt;0.03) in the intervention group and psychological stigma (t0 10.2(5.6) t17.8 (3.8) P&lt;0.03) in the control group. Anxiety is a sub-scale on the asthma symptom checklist used by <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK> following CBT. No significant differences between groups were found. <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> measured anxiety using the Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety Scale (SPRAS) (<LINK REF="REF-Sheehan-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheehan 1986</LINK>). The results of 2 x2 ANOVA showed a statistically significant interaction between group and test occasion F(1.22) = 12.75, P &lt;0.01.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Depression</HEADING>
<P>Two studies measured depression as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>) following relaxation therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK> provided a narrative of no statistical difference between the groups using univariate-repeated measure-ANOVA is provided. However, means and SDs were provided following author correspondence for the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (intervention group: 7.84, 6.98 and control group: 7.0, 6.74). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> used the POMS and reported no statistically significant improvement post relaxation therapy (intervention group mean 28, SD 8.82 and control group mean 24, SD 7.80, P = 0.27). Meta-analysis of these two studies showed no significant improvement in depression level (SMD 0.17, CI -0.25 to 0.59).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> also measured depression using the BDI to examine the effects of CBT. Results of 2 x 2 ANOVA analysis demonstrated no statistical improvement (F(1.22) = 2.94, P &lt;0.10) between the two groups.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Health Locus of Control</HEADING>
<P>Health locus of control, including internal beliefs, and external control through powerful others and chance was measured using the Health Locus of Control Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Wallston-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallston 1976</LINK>) in an Italian version in a study investigating the effects of CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>). There were no significant differences between baseline and one year follow-up except an increase in beliefs about 'external chance' in the control group. 'External chance' on the Health Locus of Control Scale measures the belief that health depends on casual factors and luck (t0 9.9 (3.5) t1 11.5(3.0) P&lt;0.03). <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> measured health locus of control, following relaxation therapy, using the Health Attribution Test (<LINK REF="REF-Achterberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achterberg 1992</LINK>). No statistical difference between the intervention group and control group was reported for the measurements of internal control (P = 0.55), powerful others (P = 0.84) and chance (P = 0.7).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Other psychological outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Panic/fear and fatigue using an asthma symptom checklist (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>) showed differences over the course of treatment with relaxation therapy in an RCT. They report no significant differences between groups, but panic/fear severity did decrease for the whole sample (F=3.34, df =2,104, P&lt;0.02). <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> also included panic/fear and fatigue but did not present usable data.</P>
<P>Psychological symptoms were examined in a RCT of relaxation therapy, using a self-report weekly symptom questionnaire incorporating a five-point severity rating scale (<LINK REF="STD-Erskine-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Erskine 1979</LINK>). Data showed no difference between the two groups (muscular relaxation, and mental and muscular relaxation) and patients overall did not show any significant reduction in symptoms and signs. <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK> assessed the effect of imagery relaxation using the Knowledge, Attitude, and Self-efficacy Asthma Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Wigal-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wigal 1993</LINK>). Compared to the control group and the group receiving therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in attitude (intervention group mean 90, SD 7.14; control group mean 80, SD 9.46; P = 0.0094) and self-efficacy (intervention group mean 89, SD 9.46; control group mean 77, SD 10.02; P = 0.00061) but not asthma knowledge (intervention group mean 15, SD 2.42; control group mean 13, SD 2.76; P = 0.4).</P>
<P>Psychological elements were examined in a trial of autogenic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>) with measures of the patient's state- 'vegetative', emotional, behavioural, cognitive and reactivity to stress with no significant differences between baseline and follow up in either group, with the exception of 'vegetative' state in the experimental group (mean difference (SD) 1.83(2.69) P&lt;0.05). A Negative Emotionality Scale, which incorporates measures of negative affectivity as a personality trait, including irritability, nervousness and emotional instability was used by <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>. People in the experimental group had a decrease in scores, suggesting improvement, and there were significant differences between experimental and control groups (F(2,42)=10.8,P=0.0002).</P>
<P>Temperament was studied in <LINK REF="STD-Payette-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Payette 1977</LINK> using the Taylor-Johnson Temperament Analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1974</LINK>) with no significant differences found between a group receiving biofeedback training and a control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> included measures of the most relaxed and tense moment in a session using a 9-point Likert scale. They found a significant treatment effect for relaxation during the training session, with the waiting list group being less relaxed (mean 4.2 (SD 1.5)) than the progressive relaxation groups (2.8 (1.4)) during their eighth session (P&lt;0.05, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.2).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK> found no significant differences between groups when measuring reactivity to stress. Reactivity to stress is the extent to which the body reacts to stressors. It can be assessed by comparing physiological measures in a resting state (baseline or relaxation) to those in the presence of a physical or psychological stressor.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> measured participant stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1983</LINK>). ANCOVA (controlling for age, age of diagnosis, and perceived stress levels at baseline) did not reveal any significant differences between groups in perceived stress levels at the end of a four week CBT program (F(1,54) = 1.48, P = 0.230).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This systematic review evaluated fifteen trials of varied psychological interventions for adults with asthma and found that generally these interventions do not decrease health service utilisation, or decrease frequency, severity and duration of asthma symptoms. However, due to the poor quality of these studies any results and conclusions must be viewed with caution. In addition, usable statistical results were often not available in the papers. This limited firm conclusions being made as to the effect of psychological interventions for adults with asthma. The psychological interventions themselves were varied, did not necessarily have a clear theoretical underpinning and were not always well described. </P>
<P>Health care utilisation is increasingly being used as a primary outcome in drug trials and other studies on patients with asthma. This being the case, the primary outcome of this review also reflects this. However, few trials included in this review measured this outcome. In addition, it is assumed that self-report measures were used, and these may not give accurate data. This review cannot draw any conclusions as to the effect of psychological interventions on healthcare utilisation by adults with asthma. This outcome needs be included in future trials of psychological intervention for adults with asthma.</P>
<P>Lung function was measured as an outcome in a number of studies and two separate meta-analyses were performed. Although bio-feedback was found to improve PEF significantly (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 2004</LINK>) relaxation therapy did not have such an impact on FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henry-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Henry 1993</LINK>) or PEF (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>). However, these meta-analysis do not include large patient numbers. Another meta-analysis found that relaxation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>) had a positive effect on discontinuation and decrease of medications. Again this meta-analysis included a small number of participants (n = 47). </P>
<P>The AQLQ (<LINK REF="REF-Juniper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 1992</LINK>) was used as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>). This consistency provided for a meta-analysis to be performed on the two studies assessing the effect of CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>). This indicated a significant improvement in Total AQLQ scores in the group receiving CBT compared to the control. Further use of the AQLQ would be beneficial in further assessing the impact of CBT on this outcome. These studies also analysed each sub-category of the AQLQ to assess the impact of therapy on specific outcomes. This generally produced conflicting results between studies. </P>
<P>The ASC (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsman 1973</LINK>) was also adopted more than once as an outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>). Whilst these studies used relaxation therapy no meta-analysis could be performed due to small sample sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK> ) and the presentation of within group analysis only (<LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>). As such, no conclusion as to the benefits of relaxation therapy on the ASC outcomes can be provided. </P>
<P>The psychological outcomes examined were numerous and diverse and there seems to be no consensus as to which psychological outcomes are conceptually linked to asthma or to the psychological interventions being studied. For example, although a number of studies measured anxiety as an outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Deter-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Deter 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ewer-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Ewer 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freeman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Freeman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Put-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Put 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sommaruga-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sommaruga 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wagaman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Wagaman 2000</LINK>) the interventions used varied and the anxiety measurement tools also varied. This prevented any pooled result being analysed. In addition, depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck 1987) by two studies however, one used relaxation as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 2004</LINK>) and the other CBT (<LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>). </P>
<P>Participant satisfaction with the intervention was only assessed in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK>). However, the rigour of this assessment is difficult to ascertain. <LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1994</LINK> acknowledged that the assessment was performed but presented no data nor further comment. <LINK REF="STD-Ross-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ross 2005</LINK> reported data on this outcome however, a tool developed by the research team was used with no evidence of validity or reliability described. <LINK REF="STD-Hockemeyer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hockemeyer 2002</LINK> used a pre developed tool which indicated greater participant satisfaction in the intervention group compared to the placebo. </P>
<P>There is a general view that asthma is connected with psychological elements in the person (<LINK REF="STD-Lehrer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Lehrer 1993</LINK>). This may involve a cause and effect relationship and because psychology and emotion are involved it is thought that psychological techniques may have a positive effect on patient outcomes. There is a large worldwide literature base supporting these ideas but this review shows that questions of effectiveness have not yet been answered. It is clearly a difficult area to investigate and presents challenges for the design of good RCTs. Researchers have to recruit sufficient numbers of subjects to show an effect if there is one, ensure appropriate randomisation and blinding techniques and follow up subjects for a reasonable period. </P>
<P>RCTs evaluating this area are diverse. They study a mixed group of psychological techniques, which are difficult to classify due to the different methods used to deliver the intervention. This resulted in heterogeneous interventions even when the technique was given the same classification by study authors. </P>
<P>The diversity of the interventions was also complicated by a multiplicity of outcomes and the tools used to measure these. There is no consensus on which outcomes a psychological intervention might influence and the conceptual link between them. The most common outcome used in the studies reviewed was lung function; twelve of the studies evaluated this. However, whilst lung function was widely assessed, different measurements were taken, for example % predicted FEV1 and PEF L/min. Health care utilisation is increasingly being used as a primary outcome in drug trials and other studies on patients with asthma. This being the case, the primary outcome of this review was changed as being hospitalised or being ill enough to visit the GP may be the most important outcome for the patient. Few trials have used this outcome. It is assumed that self-report measures were used, and these may not give accurate data.</P>
<P>The psychological outcomes adopted were even more numerous and diverse and there seems to be no consensus as to which psychological outcomes are conceptually linked to asthma or to the psychological interventions being studied. </P>
<P>It is apparent that this body of work does not seem to have a clear direction where current work is influenced by previous studies. Most of these small studies were done by trialists who, with the exception of Lehrer's team, did only one study. This has resulted in diverse studies looking at diverse interventions reporting on large numbers of different outcomes.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Because of the poor methodological quality and small sample sizes of the trials included, this review can draw no conclusions as to the effectiveness of psychological techniques for adults with asthma. However, some promising results did emerge from meta-analysis performed for the effect of CBT on quality of life, bio-feedback on PEF and relaxation on medication use. Many of the other outcomes measured yielded conflicting results. The results from current RCTs in the field do not allow us to answer adequately any of our original objectives. This review cannot therefore provide guidance for clinical practice.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Larger RCTs with good methodological quality are needed. There are a limited number of rigorous trials in this area and comparisons are frustrated by diversity of outcomes and poor results reporting. All pertinent results should be reported with means and standard deviations to aid comparisons.</P>
<P>There does not seem to be a developed programme of research for evaluating psychological interventions for adults with asthma, with many research teams doing just one study. Researchers in the field should agree common interventions, taxonomy and outcome indicators. There is a question over how appropriate it is to conduct RCTs of psychological interventions at all. This mainly has to do with the fact that in practice isolated therapies are seldom used and treatment plans are individualised to patients as complex self -management plans. </P>
<P>Evaluation using an RCT in the clinical setting may mean that the intervention is so tightly controlled that even if effectiveness were proven it might be difficult to transfer the intervention into routine clinical practice. Research funding should target a range of good quality research, including well designed rigorous RCTs, to determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of psychological techniques that have a sound theoretical base, with common taxonomy and outcome indicators and which can be used in the real world with individual patients who have differing needs and get better at different speeds.</P>

The setting for the study is the community (patient's<BR/>homes) with the intervention co-ordinated via the lead hospital. Patients<BR/>are recruited on the basis that they have severe asthma as indicated by them<BR/>being on British Thoracic Society Step 4/5 treatment and/or having had<BR/>previous admissions for asthma. The patients are also deemed to be at risk<BR/>of future adverse asthma outcomes due to failure to attend clinic<BR/>appointments or comply with their asthma management in other ways (e.g.<BR/>non-compliance with medication or changes in medication, failure to keep<BR/>peak flow records when asked)<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Four fortnightly home visits of approximately<BR/>one hour in length conducted by an asthma nurse for two months, supplemented<BR/>by phone calls between visits and monthly for four months after the last<BR/>visit, making a 6 month intervention in total. Patients are also able to<BR/>phone the asthma nurse throughout and after the duration of the<BR/>intervention. The nurse provides asthma education, self-management and<BR/>coping skills training and, with clinical supervision from a general<BR/>practitioner with psychiatric training and Health Psychologist, aims to<BR/>address co-existing psychosocial problems which compromise effective asthma<BR/>management. The intervention takes a cognitive behavioural approach and<BR/>involves liaison with/referral to other medical, psychological or social<BR/>services as necessary.<BR/>The control group continues with routine care comprising usual use of<BR/>primary, secondary and emergency health services which varies to some degree<BR/>across the hospitals involved.<BR/>

<P>Primary outcome: Asthma control assessed via a score from a brief<BR/>questionnaire asking about asthma symptoms in the past month (questionnaire<BR/>based on recommendations from Royal College of Physicians Asthma Outcomes<BR/>seminar 1999, used in previous local studies, reliability and validity work<BR/>being undertaken).<BR/>Secondary outcomes: Quality of life assessed via the Living with Asthma<BR/>Questionnaire (Hyland) and Short Form 36 (Ware et al).<BR/>Economic evaluation will also involve assessment of direct health care,<BR/>social service and patient costs and indirect costs.<BR/>Additional/explanatory outcomes: Psychiatric morbidity assessed via the<BR/>General Health Questionnaire 12 and Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale,<BR/>attack and everyday coping assessed via the Asthma Coping Questionnaire<BR/>(Maes &amp; Schlosser), perceived control assessed via the Perceived Control of<BR/>Asthma Questionnaire (Katz et al), attack management and compliance assessed<BR/>via 2 sub-scales of the Revised Asthma Problem Behavior Checklist (Creer et<BR/>al) and compliance scale of Moriskey, readiness to change asthma self<BR/>management behaviour assessed via an Asthma Stage of Change Questionnaire<BR/>developed for the study and supplemented with additional questions on<BR/>performance of self management behaviours (trigger avoidance, peak flow<BR/>monitoring, smoking, exercise etc.)<BR/>Outcomes are assessed via self administered questionnaires completed by<BR/>patients during interviews in their home conducted at baseline and 2, 6 and<BR/>12 months after entry into the study. The primary endpoint is 6 months (the<BR/>end of the intervention for those receiving the nurse programme).</P>

<P>Cognitive behaviour therapy</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Using behavioural techniques to change negative thoughts mediating health behaviour.

<TD>
<P>Relaxation techniques</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Designed to control stress &amp; anxiety. In asthma, may reduce panic or fear &amp; improve breathing and respiratory function. Approaches include progressive relaxation (systematically creating tension and release in different parts of the body and/or via guided mental imagery), autogenic training (focuses on attending to bodily feelings and mentally controlling them), hypnotherapy (deep relaxation that may be induced using mental imagery, often accompanied by autosuggestion to create positive thoughts &amp; feelings), and biofeedback (feedback of biological indicators, such as tracheal noise, which the subject must control via relaxation. May also be considered a behavioural intervention since the feedback can act as a reinforcer).</P>

<CAPTION>
<P>Based on the findings of this review this image shows that when relaxation/autogenic therapy is given to 100 patients, on average 3 would need to be treated in order to induce a reduction in the amount of bronchodilator used. The data analysed showed that 22/100 people would be able to do this anyway, but that an additional 34/100 people could achieve this with treatment.</P>
