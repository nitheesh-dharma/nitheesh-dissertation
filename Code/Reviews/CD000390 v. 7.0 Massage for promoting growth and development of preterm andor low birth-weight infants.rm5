<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Massage for promoting growth and development of premature and low birth-weight infants</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>In utero, infants are exposed to physical stimulation. This raises the question whether gentle physical massage helps babies born before 37 weeks gestation or weighing less than 2500 grams (5.5 pounds) to develop after birth, and if it can improve their behaviour. The review only included randomized controlled trials, studies in which a group of babies received massage and was compared with a similar group which did not. The authors searched the medical literature and contacted experts and found 14 studies. In most of these studies babies were rubbed or stroked for about 15 minutes, three or four times a day, usually for five or ten days. Some studies also included "still, gentle touch", in which nurses put their hands on babies but did not rub or stroke them. On average, the studies found that when compared to babies who were not touched, babies receiving massage, but not "still, gentle touch", gained more weight each day (about 5 grams). They spent less time in hospital, had slightly better scores on developmental tests and had slightly fewer postnatal complications, although there were problems with how reliable these findings are. The studies did not show any negative effects of massage. Massage is time consuming for nurses to provide, but parents can perform massage without extensive training.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>It has been argued that infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units are subject both to a highly stressful environment - continuous, high-intensity noise and bright light - and to a lack of the tactile stimulation that they would otherwise experience in the womb or in general mothering care. As massage seems to both decrease stress and provide tactile stimulation, it has been recommended as an intervention to promote growth and development of preterm and low-birth weight infants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether preterm and/or low birth-weight infants exposed to massage experience improved weight gain and earlier discharge compared to infants receiving standard care; to determine whether massage has any other beneficial or harmful effects on this population.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The following databases were searched: the specialized register of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group and that of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field. Searches were also undertaken of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psychlit, CINAHL and Dissertation Abstracts International (up to July 1, 2003). Further references were obtained by citation tracking, checking personal files and by correspondence with appropriate experts. Data provided in published reports was supplemented by information obtained by correspondence with authors. There were no language restrictions.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials in which infants with gestational age at birth &lt;37 weeks or weight at birth &lt;2500g received systematic tactile stimulation by human hands. At least one outcome assessing weight gain, length of stay, behaviour or development must be reported.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extracted from each trial were baseline characteristics of sample, weight gain, length of stay and behavioural and developmental outcomes. Physiological and biochemical outcomes were not recorded. Data were extracted by three reviewers independently. Statistical analysis was conducted using the standard Cochrane Collaboration methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Massage interventions improved daily weight gain by 5.1g (95% CI 3.5, 6.7g). There is no evidence that gentle, still touch is of benefit (increase in daily weight gain 0.2g; 95% CI -1.2, 1.6g). Massage interventions also appeared to reduce length of stay by 4.5 days (95% CI 2.4, 6.5) though there are methodological concerns about the blinding of this outcome. There was also some evidence that massage interventions have a slight, positive effect on postnatal complications and weight at 4 - 6 months. However, serious concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies, particularly with respect to selective reporting of outcomes, weaken credibility in these findings.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Evidence that massage for preterm infants is of benefit for developmental outcomes is weak and does not warrant wider use of preterm infant massage. Where massage is currently provided by nurses, consideration should be given as to whether this is a cost-effective use of time. Future research should assess the effects of massage interventions on clinical outcome measures, such as medical complications or length of stay, and on process-of-care outcomes, such as care-giver or parental satisfaction.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>It has been argued that infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) are subject both to a highly stressful environment - continuous, high-intensity noise and bright light (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1990</LINK>) - and to a lack of the tactile stimulation that they would otherwise experience in the womb or in general mothering care (<LINK REF="REF-Montagu-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montagu 1978</LINK>). </P>
<P>A number of workers have suggested that massage both decreases stress and provides tactile stimulation (for an overview of this set of beliefs, see <LINK REF="REF-Vickers-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickers 1996</LINK>). Massage has been recommended as an intervention to promote growth and development of preterm and low-birth weight (LBW) infants. </P>
<P>Though massage can be defined as any form of systematic tactile stimulation by human hands, the type of massage typically used in neonatal care is a gentle, slow stroking of each part of the body in turn. For example, Scafidi 1986 describes the infant being placed in a prone position and being stroked "for 1 min periods (12 strokes at approximately 5 seconds per stroking motion) over each region in the following sequence: (1) from the infant's head and face to the neck; (2) from the neck across the shoulders; (3) from the upper back to the waist; (4) from the thigh to the foot to the thigh on both legs and (5) from the shoulder to the hand to the shoulder on both arms". Massage is often combined with other forms of stimulation such as rocking, kinaesthetic stimulation (eg. passive extension/flexion movements of the arms and legs), talking or eye contact. </P>
<P>A number of non-systematic reviews have been published which support massage interventions in the care of preterm/LBW infants (see, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1980</LINK>.) The only systematic review published is that of <LINK REF="REF-Ottenbacher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottenbacher 1987</LINK> who concludes that "subjects receiving some form of controlled tactile stimulation performed better on a variety of dependent measures than subjects not receiving intervention". This review is now out of date and is flawed by the inclusion of trials of varying quality (both randomised and non-randomised) which evaluated varying interventions (from massage to non-nutritive sucking). There also appears to be no judgement about the relative importance of different outcomes.</P>
<P>Though the mechanisms by which massage might be of benefit are not fully understood, an explanation in terms of nutrient intake is unlikely. <LINK REF="STD-Field-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1987</LINK> found that massaged infants did not consume or retain more formula than controls, a finding consistent across trials of other forms of supplemental stimulation in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Bernbaum-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernbaum 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1982</LINK>) and animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Schanberg--1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schanberg 1984</LINK>). Any increases in weight gain resulting from massage may be due to improved conversion of food into growth. As improved metabolic efficiency has been associated with increased activity levels in both human (<LINK REF="REF-Torun-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torun 1979</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Young-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1981</LINK>) and rat models (<LINK REF="REF-Mittelman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mittelman 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mussachia--1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mussachia 1980</LINK>) such a finding is one explanation as to why massage may improve weight gain. On the other hand, it may be that massage reduces adverse reactions to stress. Scafidi 1990 describes that overt signs of stress, such as facial grimaces and clenched fists, were lower in infants receiving massage than controls. <LINK REF="STD-Acolet-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Acolet 1993</LINK> reports falls in plasma cortisol following massage, though no differences were reported by <LINK REF="STD-Kuhn-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhn 1991</LINK>. In summary, the biological rationale for the use of massage to improve growth and development in preterm/LBW infants is that it may increase metabolic efficiency whilst decreasing stress behaviours.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Our primary question is whether preterm and/or LBW infants exposed to massage experience improved weight gain and earlier discharge compared to those infants receiving standard neonatal care. Our secondary question is whether massage has any other beneficial or harmful effects on this population.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The following databases were searched: the specialized register of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group and that of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field. Searches were also undertaken of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psychlit, CINAHL and Dissertation Abstracts International (up to July 1, 2003). Further references were obtained by citation tracking, checking personal files and by correspondence with appropriate experts.

Databases were searched using the term 'massage', 'touch' or 'tactile stimulation' with 'infant - newborn', 'infant - premature' and 'infant - low birth weight'. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Inclusion of studies</P>
<P>All retrieved references were first scanned by AV to remove any clearly inappropriate titles. Hard copies of all remaining papers were then obtained. AV read all papers and again removed any for which there was no possibility of eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied by each reviewer separately. Disagreements about study inclusion were resolved by consensus. All trials excluded from the review were given reasons for exclusion. </P>
<P>Assessment of quality of studies </P>
<P>The methodological criteria used to appraise each paper were concealment of treatment allocation (was treatment allocation concealed until the patient had been unambiguously entered into the trial? could it have been altered after entry?), performance bias (were patients treated similarly in all respects other than the experimental intervention?), blinding of observers (were those assessing outcome blind to treatment assignment?) and exclusions/withdrawals (were there systematic differences in withdrawals from the trial?). Each criterion was graded 'A', 'B' or 'C': 'A' indicates a low risk of bias, where the plausibly postulated bias is unlikely to alter the results seriously; 'C', on the other hand, indicates a high risk of bias, where plausibly postulated bias seriously weakens confidence in the results; a criterion is graded 'B' where it was partially met or where no data are available such that some doubt is raised about possible bias. Each paper was graded independently by at least three reviewers with disagreements resolved by discussion. Methodological assessment was not conducted blind to author, institution, journal of publication or results, as reviewers were familiar with most of the studies. Where studies were reported in different phases, the quality of each phase was assessed separately. </P>
<P>Data abstraction</P>
<P>The following data on the trial participants were extracted by group: dates of recruitment into trial; inclusion and exclusion criteria for gestational age and weight; mean weight and gestational age at birth and at entry by group; sex by group; number of withdrawals; risk factors (eg. exposure to cocaine in utero) and adverse effects. The following data on the trial outcomes were extracted: weight gain, length of stay, behaviour or development; observer blinding (graded A, B or C: see above); the time after start of treatment that the outcome was measured; whether there is evidence that the data were or were not normally distributed; mean and standard deviation/median and inter-quartile range/number and percentage. If the outcome was sleep/wake state, details were recorded as to the length of time of observation, time elapsed from the end of the intervention to the beginning of the observation period and the criteria for determining sleep/wake state. If the outcome measure was behavioural or developmental but not sleep / wake, Brazleton scale or Bayley scale, the method of assessment was described. If different periods or times of measurement were reported, each was treated as a different outcome. Physiological and biochemical outcomes were not recorded. If an outcome measure was taken from nursing case notes, it was assumed to have been measured unblinded. Details of the intervention given in the treatment and comparison groups were recorded. Reviewers noted any baseline differences which they thought may have affected the result of the trial along with any other comments on the trial data or methodology. Data collection forms were completed by at least three reviewers independently. Attempts were made to contact authors to clarify or provide missing data. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. Data collection forms were pilot tested to verify definitions of terms. </P>
<P>Statistical analysis</P>
<P>A grade of 'C' on concealment of treatment allocation was grounds for excluding the trial from the review. All other trials were included. Each reviewer decided independently which outcomes in which trials should be meta-analysed. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan 4.1.</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Our eligibility criteria were liberal: we aimed to include as many trials as possible, even those on infants who only just met criteria for low birthweight or preterm birth. Most of the subjects in the studies we reviewed were very low birthweight (about 1200 - 1600g) and of short gestation (around 30 - 33 weeks). They were usually healthy and medically stable and had been transferred to intermediate or "grower" care before the start of the intervention. Their parents were generally of low socioeconomic status. Trials generally excluded infants with congenital abnormalities, serious pathology (eg. necrotising enterocolitis), histories of maternal drug abuse and those requiring ventilatory assistance or intravenous feeding. One trial had an inclusion criterion which specified a disease state (maternal drug addiction for <LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK>) in addition to preterm birth or low-birth weight. </P>
<P>The interventions used in the trials can be categorised into "massage" and "still, gentle touch." Infants receiving massage were typically rubbed and stroked gently for approximately 15 minutes, three or four times a day. Many massage interventions also included kinaesthetic stimulation consisting of passive flexion/extension movements of the limbs. Infants assigned to still, gentle touch had nurses place their hands on them gently as they slept. After 15 or 20 minutes, the hands would be removed. No stroking or rubbing motions were used. </P>
<P>Both forms of intervention were usually applied by nurses for 5 to 10 days. An exception was the study by <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1977</LINK> in which the intervention was applied by mothers for 30 days following discharge.</P>
<P>The outcomes of greatest interest to us were weight gain and length of stay in hospital. We also recorded developmental and behavioural outcomes. The <LINK REF="REF-Brazleton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazleton 1983</LINK> scale is a standard developmental measure which was used in several trials. It is divided into several sub-scales (habituation, orientation, range of state, motor maturity, state regulation, autonomic stability, number of abnormal reflexes and stress behaviours). A higher score is desirable for all sub-scales except the latter two. Many trials reported complex sleep/wake state outcomes (for example, percentage time with facial expressions) which could not reasonably be used in a meta-analysis. The only sleep/wake values we decided to include in statistical analyses were percentage time awake and percentage time in movement. </P>
<P>Some authors attempted to assess longer-term development using the standard <LINK REF="REF-Bayley-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayley 1969</LINK> scales of motor and mental development (higher score optimal). Two authors (<LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Scafidi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scafidi 1993</LINK>) assessed postnatal complications using scales such as the Postnatal Complications Scale (higher score optimal), the Newfoundland Scale (lower score optimal) and the <LINK REF="REF-Brazy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazy 1985</LINK> Scale (lower score optimal).</P>
<P>Full details on the characteristics of each study are given in the table of included studies.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>There would appear to be five main methodological issues to consider when interpreting the results of this review.</P>
<P>i) Performance bias. We originally intended to assess each trial for performance bias, the degree to which patients were treated similarly in all respects other than the experimental intervention. However, no trial report described manoeuvres to control performance bias. In correspondence, authors stated that while they may not have taken formal steps to ensure that treatment was similar for all infants in a trial, care and treatment is given in the best interests of each patient. </P>
<P>It is our view, however, that clinicians may well be influenced in the care of a neonate by knowledge of group assignment. Differential care may be compensatory, in other words, extra care may be given to those not receiving massage on the grounds that they require extra attention in place of the additional treatment. This would tend to reduce differences between groups. On the other hand, performance bias may exaggerate differences between groups if, consciously or unconsciously, clinicians gave extra care to infants in the massage group because they want to see massage proven as effective. However, it is unclear whether the degree of extra care likely in such circumstances would plausibly lead to differences in weight gain. Furthermore, it is hard to know if it would be feasible to blind clinicians to treatment allocation in a trial of massage for preterm/LBW infants. </P>
<P>ii) Exclusion bias. Most trial reports did not describe any withdrawals or drop-outs. We sought further details from authors directly and obtained confirmation that there were no exclusions for <LINK REF="STD-Field-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Scafidi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scafidi 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2000</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-White-Traut-1983" TYPE="STUDY">White Traut 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-White-Traut-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White Traut 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1977</LINK> gave adequate information in the trial reports. The low levels of exclusions seemed plausible given the setting of the research. Participants were typically medically stable and transferred to intermediate care ("grower" nurseries) when the trial started. The main reasons for withdrawals in trials of preterm/LBW infants are death, intercurrent illness and transfer to a different institution. Such events are likely to be rare in intermediate care. We concluded therefore that systematic bias due to withdrawals is unlikely to be a problem.</P>
<P>iii) Blinding of weight measurements. No trial described procedures to blind those taking weight measurements. Although weight measurements might be tampered with by a trialist who has knowledge of a subject's treatment assignment, this seems unlikely. Similarly, it does not seem plausible that unconscious bias would explain persisting differences between groups for an outcome, such as daily weight gain, which is objective, precise and measured repeatedly. If weight gain was unconsciously inflated every day, a considerable discrepancy between recorded and actual weight would be apparent by the end of the trial. Nonetheless, poor blinding of the main outcome measure might be considered to be a flaw of the research included in the review.</P>
<P>iv) Blinding length of stay. There are no standardised criteria for discharge of a preterm/LBW infant from hospital. Discharge depends not only on the corrected gestational age and clinical condition of the baby but on the medical and social situation of the family. There are also discharge policies specific to each unit. It is unclear whether a decision to discharge may have been influenced by knowledge of group assignment, especially as parents have a role in determining discharge. In the words of one author <LINK REF="STD-White-1976" TYPE="STUDY">White 1976</LINK>, length of stay data "were seriously compromised by relatively arbitrary decisions regarding medical discharge from the hospital as determined by maternal requests". Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-White-Traut-1986" TYPE="STUDY">White Traut 1986</LINK>) explicitly stated that physicians responsible for discharging infants were blind to group assignment, but it is unclear how this blinding was achieved.</P>
<P>v) Types of intervention. We originally expected to find trials in which massage formed part of a multi-modal programme of stimulation. Only two such trials were included. In <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1977</LINK>, cuddling and rocking were used as well as stroking. In <LINK REF="STD-Rose-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1980</LINK>, infants received vestibular, auditory and tactile stimulation. However, <LINK REF="STD-Rose-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Rose 1980</LINK> did not report any outcomes relevant to the review (see Table of Included Studies) and it did not seem appropriate to analyse <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1977</LINK> separately just because infants had been cuddled and rocked. On the other hand, we included two trials (<LINK REF="STD-M-_x002d_-McCarthy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">M - McCarthy 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1996</LINK>) in which the intervention was a gentle, still touch. This seemed to be a very different type of intervention to the rubbing, stroking and passive movements which provided tactile stimulation in the remaining included studies. As a result, we analysed the results of the two different types of intervention separately. This was not planned in the original protocol.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Preterm/LBW infants receiving massage interventions - rubbing, stroking and kinaesthetic stimulation - gained more weight per day than controls (weighted mean difference (WMD) 5.1g, 95% CI 3.5, 6.7). This difference is of low clinical significance. There was, moreover, statistically significant heterogeneity between trials (chi square=11.22, df=5, p=0.047). Infants receiving gentle, still touch without stroking or rubbing experienced no weight gain advantage (WMD 0.2g greater increase in weight per day, 95% CI -1.2,1.6). </P>
<P>Massage interventions decreased length of stay by 4.5 days (95% CI 2.4, 6.5). The meta-analysis of this outcome is strongly influenced (52% of weighting) by one study (<LINK REF="STD-White-1976" TYPE="STUDY">White 1976</LINK>) which had a small sample size (12) and which presented data inconsistently (see Characteristics of Included Studies.) Exclusion of this study in a sensitivity analysis did not have a significant effect on the central estimate but the confidence intervals are widened: mean reduction in length of stay is 5.0 days (95% CI 2.0, 7.9). There is no evidence of a length of stay advantage for infants receiving gentle, still touch.</P>
<P>Massage improved performance slightly on the Brazleton scales for habituation (WMD 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.1), motor maturity (WMD 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.1) and range of state (WMD 0.6, 95% CI 0.2, 0.9). These effects are sensitive to the choice of statistical model: using a random effects model, differences between groups do not reach statistical significance. Moreover, there is extreme statistical heterogeneity (e.g. for habituation, chi square =17.52 df=2, p&lt;0.001). Performance was also improved on orientation (WMD 0.5, 95% CI 0, 1) and state regulation (WMD 0.5, 95% CI -0.1, 1.0), though the lower confidence limit approximates the line of no difference for these two sub-scales. There was no evidence of effect on autonomic stability (WMD -0.1, 95% CI -0.6, 0.3), or on number of abnormal reflexes (WMD -0.6, 95% CI -1.6, 0.4). An apparent error in Wheeden's 1993 study - which reported a standard deviation for this outcome five times larger than other trials - would not change the conclusion of no difference between groups. Stress behaviours were also reduced, though this result was only reported by one study. Evidence was insufficient concerning other developmental scores such as the Bayley scale.</P>
<P>Massage improved postnatal complications as measured by the <LINK REF="REF-Littman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Littman 1978</LINK> Postnatal Complication Scale (WMD 16, 95% CI 11, 21). However, almost all of the weighting (95%) in this analysis comes from one study with a sample of size of 30. Moreover, there is an unexplained discrepancy between the size of the standard deviations in the two studies in the meta-analysis. The effects on the Newfoundland and <LINK REF="REF-Brazy-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazy 1985</LINK> complications scales are hard to judge: there is only one study in each analysis and there appears to be an error in the reporting of standard deviations for the Newfoundland scale.</P>
<P>There was no evidence of an effect of gentle still touch on neonatal morbidity score, days on supplemental oxygen, blood transfusions, activity or behavioural distress cues. Though data for some of these outcomes are non-normal, and possibly should not be meta-analysed, analysis of data from each trial individually gives no reason to change the conclusion of no difference between groups. Gentle, still touch increased days on phototherapy, though given the large number of outcomes, this may be a chance finding. Due to the low number of subjects in the two trials of gentle, still touch (a total of 50), the analyses lack statistical power. </P>
<P>No adverse effects of touch or massage were reported in any study.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The nursing literature consulted for this review strongly advocates massage interventions in the care of preterm/LBW infants. This literature is characterised by the use of unsystematic methods of review, leading to the inclusion of non-randomised and uncontrolled trials and even general discussion papers as evidence in support of massage. For example, in a non-systematic review of the literature, <LINK REF="REF-Field-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1980</LINK> includes <LINK REF="STD-Solkoff-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Solkoff 1975</LINK>, who does not give any details of the method of treatment allocation and <LINK REF="STD-Siqueland-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Siqueland 1973</LINK>, a paper consisting of a short piece of prose which fails to describe experimental methods or present numerical data. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-M-_x002d_-McCarthy-1992" TYPE="STUDY">M - McCarthy 1992</LINK> cites <LINK REF="STD-Tribotti-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Tribotti 1990</LINK>, an uncontrolled trial, as evidence that "certain types of touch may ... be beneficial to ... preterm infants". Furthermore, studies of interventions such as "mothering", rocking, hammocks and water beds have been cited in reviews which did not start from a focused question and which drew general conclusions about the value of "tactile stimulation". An example is <LINK REF="REF-Field-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1980</LINK>, who included all the above interventions in a narrative review; in a subsequent review (<LINK REF="REF-Field-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 1995</LINK>), one of the citations used to support a statement about "the effects of massage therapy ... on the preterm newborn" was the <LINK REF="STD-Barnard-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Barnard 1983</LINK> study of rocking waterbeds. Similarly, <LINK REF="REF-Ottenbacher-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottenbacher 1987</LINK> included trials of massage, non-nutritive sucking and non-systematic fondling in a meta-analysis of "tactile stimulation as a form of early intervention." The findings of such reviews are difficult to put into practice because, by including such a disparate range of techniques, they do not specify an intervention which can be implemented in a clinical setting. </P>
<P>This systematic review has excluded much of the research said to constitute the research base of massage interventions in neonatal care. Nonetheless, the kernel of papers of adequate quality which remains seems to suggest, at first, that massage improves weight gain in preterm/LBW infants, albeit by the moderate amount of 5g / day.</P>
<P>One possible explanation for the increase in weight gain might be differential caloric intake between groups. Though we did not enter caloric intake into the meta-analyses - it was not an outcome measure - we did review the data on this variable as an indicator of performance bias. No difference in formula intake was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Field-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Scafidi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Scafidi 1993</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-1976" TYPE="STUDY">White 1976</LINK> does report significantly increased formula intake. Given that there are 163 patients in trials showing no difference and only 12 in <LINK REF="STD-White-1976" TYPE="STUDY">White 1976</LINK> one might be tempted to conclude that there is no coherent evidence of differences in caloric intake between groups. As such, massage intervention might be said to lead to increased weight gain without changes in formula intake, suggesting that massage leads to improved conversion of food into growth. However, the picture is slightly more complicated. Not all studies reported caloric intake, raising the possibility of reporting bias. In addition, both <LINK REF="STD-White-1976" TYPE="STUDY">White 1976</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK> report improbable figures for caloric intake: from White's figures, for example, it can be calculated that experimental infants consumed 676 cc of formula per kilogram of body weight per day. Do errors in reporting caloric intake cast doubt on these studies as a whole?</P>
<P>The results for other outcomes are less clear. The data for hospital length of stay are likely to be of great interest to parents, clinicians and purchasers of care. Although a decrease in the length of stay of 4 - 5 days is of considerable value, there must be concerns about bias, particularly, in selective reporting: it is unclear why this outcome was reported in some studies but not others. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-White-Traut-1983" TYPE="STUDY">White Traut 1983</LINK>) pre-specified that length of stay was to be recorded. This raises suspicions that data were reported only if significant effects were found. Indeed, we have some evidence that this is the case. <LINK REF="STD-Wheeden-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Wheeden 1993</LINK> was one of the authors who did not give data for length of stay in the published trial report. When we obtained raw data directly, we found that though there were differences between groups which favoured massage, these did not reach statistical significance. Further evidence of selective reporting comes from <LINK REF="STD-White-Traut-1999" TYPE="STUDY">White Traut 1999</LINK>, where data are given for length of stay (which was statistically significant), but not weight gain (where there was no difference between groups), even though both were recorded.</P>
<P>The data for another important clinical outcome, postnatal complications, are based on a small number of subjects. Moreover, there were sometimes unexplained differences in standard deviations between trials.</P>
<P>The improvements on the Brazleton sub-scales are of unclear clinical benefit. It is not known whether small changes on the Brazleton scale are of prognostic significance for longer-term outcome.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most intriguing data comes from 6 month follow-up of <LINK REF="STD-Field-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1987</LINK> which suggests improvements in weight gain and in mental and motor development in preterm/LBW infants receiving massage intervention. Some support for Field's findings is provided by <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1977</LINK> data for weight at 4 months. Data from Bayley scales are not available from this trial. The number of subjects is very small in these analyses.</P>
<P>This systematic review suggests that massage may improve weight gain in preterm/low birth weight infants and provides some evidence for an effect on length of stay. However, the strength of this conclusion is weak because of important methodologic weaknesses in the contributing trials as noted previously. Caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions from this body of research.</P>
<P>The decision whether to use a treatment depends on comparing the level of evidence and probable degree of benefit with the treatment's cost and potential for harm. We have argued that the evidence base for preterm infant massage is weak and that with the possible exception of length-of-stay, where there were particular concerns about blinding and selective reporting, effect sizes were of minor clinical significance. On the other hand, proponents of preterm infant massage argue that it non-invasive, does not require specialist equipment and can be implemented without undue disruption to routine care procedures. For medically stable infants at least, it seems to have a very low risk of adverse effects. Though somewhat time consuming, massage can be undertaken by those without extensive training, including parents. </P>
<P>When deciding whether massage for preterm infants does more good than harm, both the low cost/potential for harm and the weak evidence-base need to be considered.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is insufficient evidence of effectiveness to warrant wider use of preterm infant massage. Where massage is currently provided by nurses, consideration should be given as to whether this is a cost-effective use of time.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is warranted to assess the effects of massage interventions on clinical outcome measures such as medical complications and length of stay. The method for controlling bias in evaluations of length of stay needs to be carefully considered. Selective reporting of outcomes must be avoided. Studies with longer-term follow-up of development are also warranted. Such studies should be conducted at a number of different, independent research institutions. Finally, though it seems reasonable to suppose that massage improves process-of-care outcomes such as care-giver and parental satisfaction, this could be evaluated systematically.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>66 low and very low birthweight infants (defined by the author as &lt;2500g and &lt;1500g respectively) recruited from hospitals in London, UK and the surrounding regions. No inclusion or exclusion criteria described. Mean birthweight and gestational age for massage/control group: 1500/1600g; 32.3/32.0 weeks. Percentage female in massage / control group: 58 / 46%.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>RISS technique (see Rice 1979). Intervention started within 120 hours of birth. Routine care in control group.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Change in weight from birth to 1 week old assessed unblinded. A number of reflexes (rooting, sucking, hand grasp, crawling, passive arm movement, passive leg movement) were also observed (blinding unclear) at one week. These are not included in the analyses because no data were reported.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>16 infants in the massage group received their first treatment within the first 48 hours; 15 received their first treatment between 49 and 120 hours. The authors compare the change in weight between these two sub-groups and report significantly lower (p&lt;0.03) weight loss in the early intervened group (29.1g; SD44.1) than in the late intervened group (78.1g; SD 70.0g). We attempted to contact the authors for further information about other aspects of the trial but were unsuccessful.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Blinding of randomisation: adequate, though see discussion. From a fax from Field: "The table [of random numbers] was kept by project co-ordinator who assigned massage person to start massaging infants as soon as they were admitted to intermediate care &amp; only if we had informed consent. The person getting the informed consent did not know which groups the infant would be assigned to. Could [allocation] been altered after entry? No." See also Wheeden 1993, who undertook a study at the same unit and describes a similar randomisation process. Blinding of intervention: inadequate Complete follow-up: adequate Blinding of outcome measurement: see "Outcomes"</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>40 preterm infants from the Miami area, recruited when medically stable and admitted to the "grower" nursery. None were receiving supplemental oxygen or intravenous feeding. Inclusion criteria: gestational age &lt; 36 weeks; birthweight &lt;1500g; weight at entry to study 1100-1650g. Exclusions: "congenital heart malformations, gastrointestinal disorders, CNS disturbances, drug addictions and congenital anomalies". Average birthweight, gestational age and weight at entry to the study for massage / control: 1280 / 1268g; 31 / 31 weeks; 1393 / 1385g.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>The massage intervention consisted of three, 15 minute periods at the beginning of three consecutive hours starting approximately 30 minutes after the first morning feeding. Each session consisted of two, five minute periods of tactile stimulation (stroking) with an intervening five minute period of kinaesthetic stimulation (passive flexion/extension movements of the limbs). Massage was administered for ten consecutive weekdays. Control infants received routine nursery care.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Daily weight gain over course of study (unblinded); all subscales of the Brazleton Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale (1983), assessed blindly at end of treatment period; percentage of time "awake" and "in movement", assessed blindly for 45 minutes at end of treatment period and at least 4 hours after the last massage using the criteria of Thoman (1975); length of stay (unblinded). Half of the sample were evaluated at a 6 month follow-up for weight, body length and head circumference centile and the Bayley (1969) mental and motor scales (blinding unclear). The following outcome was relevant to the review but no data were reported: number of apneic episodes. The following outcomes were not thought relevant to this review: volume intake of formula; caloric intake; number of feedings; percentage of time in the following states: quiet sleep; active sleep; REM sleep; drowsy; inactive alert; active alert; with single limb movement; with multiple limb movement; with head turns movement; with gross body movement; with facial expressions; crying. The following outcomes were not thought relevant to the review and no data were presented: frequency of urination; frequency of stooling; heart rate; body temperature; number of parent visits; number of parent visits with touching; number of parent visits with holding; number of parent visits with feeding; percentage time in behavioural distress.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Standard deviations for Field (1987) for length of stay; Bayley scales at 6 months and weight at 6 months were calculated, where possible, from t-tests. From the p values, t values were calculated. A pooled standard deviation for both groups was calculated from the t value. Standard deviations for 4 month length and head circumference were not given. They were estimated by multiplying the mean in each group by the ratio of the mean to standard deviation in that group reported in Rice 1976. The author was unable to provide any further raw data.</P>

<P>Schmidt 1980 involves outcomes on some of the subjects in Rose 1980. On page 176, the authors of the former paper state that "effects ... were examined for preterm infants who had received routine nursing and medical care and for preterms who prior to testing had received intervention emphasizing tactual stimulation" and then references the latter paper. We attempted to contact the authors for further information about other aspects of this trial but were unsuccessful.</P>

<P>Author informed us that all 40 patients in Scafidi 1990 were included in this paper. Length of stay data for all 1993 subjects were not reported. Only one Brazleton subscale was reported. Attempts to obtain original data from the author were unsuccessful. Standard deviations for weight gain were not given. They were estimated by multiplying the mean in each group by the ratio of the mean to standard deviation in that group reported in Scafidi 1990. Means and standard deviations for orientation on the Brazleton scale are reported separately for "high" and "low" gainers: these values were pooled for each group. No standard deviations were reported for length of stay. These were estimated from a t value given in the text.</P>

<P>It appears likely that allocation was unconcealed. From page 25 of McNichol's thesis: "after four infants had been assigned randomly, one to each group, a chart was made indicating which gestational ages and birth weights were represented by these [subjects]. When another [subject] was available, the chart was examined to determine which group(s) did not have a [subject] of the particular gestation and birth weight. A paper with the number of the groups needing such a [subject] was placed in a container and one number was chosen at random. Toward the end of the study, the compositon of each group determined the assignment of the last [subjects]." Groom and McNichol's theses probably consist of data from the same trial. Though there is no direct reference to this in either study: i) the theses were submitted in the same year to the same university ii) the interventions described in each thesis are the same iii) both theses describe recruitment from identical hospitals in Indiana iv) very similar baseline characteristics in each group (eg. the number of males and females in group 1 and 2 in McNichol's thesis are 3/4 and 4/4; in Groom's thesis it is 3/4, 5/4) v) page 102-8 of Groom's thesis and page146-7 of McNichol's give individual patient data for gestational age, sex, race, birthweight and so on. Though the data are not presented well, AV checked 6 patients (the first three from two of the groups) in McNichol's study and found patients with identical or near identical characteristics in Groom's study.</P>

At best, some of the subjects came from a randomised trial with unconcealed allocation, but the data from these subjects are mixed in with those from non-randomised comparisons. The author's exact words (page 56-7): "Hospital 1. 12 subjects ... were assigned first to the non-intervention group .... and then to the intervention group." "Hospital 2. 13 subjects ... were randomly assigned to the control group ... and to the experimental group. Footnote: an attempt to have both groups at the same time had failed. Mothers (control group) who observed the responses of the infants (experimental group) declined to be in the control group. The technique was taught to all mothers and fathers and the infants discarded. After discharge of that group we randomly assigned infants to control and experimental groups The experimental infants were discarded. After this group discharge new assignment of the two groups and control infants were discarded." "Hospital 3. 41 subjects ... the first sample (N=8) was divided into the two groups by matching for birthweight and gestational age ... these were allocated to two groups on a quasi-random basis."</P>

<P>Allocation appears to be unconcealed (or at the very least, interfered with). On page 22, the author states: "The [code] numbers assigned to the experimental group ... and for the control group [were as follows....] However, at the time of data collection subjects 3 and 4 turned out to be a set of twins. It seemed preferable to the investigator to assign subject 3 to the control group and subject 4 to the experimental group, so that a comparison could be made between them. Subjects 8 and 9 were also a set of twins. Therefore, the investigator assigned subject 8 to the experimental group and subject 9 to the control group. When all ten subjects had been discharged, three additional subjects were admitted to the study. Subject 11 was assigned to the control group to match one of the experimental group subjects. Subjects 12 and 13 were a third set of twins. Therefore, subject 12 was admitted to the experimental group to match another subject in the control group, and subject 12 was admitted to the control group...."</P>
