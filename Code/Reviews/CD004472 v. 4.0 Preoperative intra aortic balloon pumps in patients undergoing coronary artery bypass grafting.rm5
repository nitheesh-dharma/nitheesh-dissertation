<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-12 18:20:20 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting may suffer from heart failure in the immediate hours following surgery due to stunning of the heart muscle. Drugs may be required to support the heart if this happens. Increasingly, a device called an intra aortic balloon pump is used as a mechanical assist device to help such patients. The device is a balloon which is positioned close to the heart in the main blood vessel called the aorta. By inflating and deflating with beats of the heart it acts to increase blood flow to the heart as well as reduce the amount of work the heart is doing. This is a temporary device which supports the heart during the immediate post operative period. Recent evidence suggests that certain patients may benefit from a period of support with the balloon pump before their operation in order to try and optimise heart function before the stress of surgery. This review suggests the intra aortic balloon pump may be beneficial in terms of survival from the operation however there are many problems with the validity of the trials used in this review and a categorical answer to this question requires further randomised controlled trials.</P>

<P>Six trials were included (five on-pump and one off-pump). This update adds the results of one further trial. Data from a total of 255 patients were included in the meta-analysis of mortality outcomes; all on-pump. Generally, the patients were considered as "high risk" and 132 were treated preoperatively with IABP and 123 served as controls. There were four hospital deaths in the intervention arm and 23 in the non-intervention arm (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.41; P&lt;0.0001). In a subgroup analysis, low cardiac index (&lt;2.0 L/min/m<SUP>2</SUP>) was noted in 21 out of 105 patients in the treatment arm and 59 patients out of 88 in the non-treatment arm (OR 0.14, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.25; P&lt;0.00001). An off-pump versus on-pump analysis was not possible due to the limited number of off-pump studies. However a single well-conducted RCT suggested favourable effect of the preoperative IABP in off-pump patients.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-03 10:10:47 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Joey Kwong">
<P>Evidence suggests that preoperative IABP may have a beneficial effect on mortality and morbidity in specific high risk patient groups undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, however there are many problems with the quality, validity and generalisability of the trials. However, the available evidence is not robust enough to extend the use of IABP to truly elective, high risk patients. Defining more precisely which patient groups may benefit would be the challenge for the future.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-03 22:34:56 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Within cardiac surgery, the intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) has a well established place in algorithms for managing low cardiac output following surgery and is described in any specialty textbook (<LINK REF="REF-Bojar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bojar 1999</LINK>). The device acts to increase diastolic blood pressure and therefore coronary perfusion while reducing afterload, thus increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. The clinical aspects of this device are well described in "Perioperative Care in Cardiac Surgery" by <LINK REF="REF-Bojar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bojar 1999</LINK>. The IABP is integral to current postoperative management and is of undeniable efficacy, so it is not surprising that there have been no RCTS in this setting as ethical permission would not be forthcoming. The analogy has been made that we don't need an RCT to determine whether a parachute is efficacious in preserving life. Within current clinical practice the IABP is deployed preoperatively in a number of circumstances including unstable angina refractory to medical treatment and cardiogenic shock following percutaneous coronary intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Gutfinger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gutfinger 1999</LINK>). Further indications for deployment of the IABP preoperatively have emerged from retrospective (<LINK REF="STD-Dietl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dietl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 2000</LINK>) and randomised controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Christenson-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christenson-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christenson-1997c" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 1997c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christenson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Christenson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oberhoffer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oberhoffer 2006</LINK>) including: age, poor left ventricular function, left main stem disease, diffuse coronary disease and redo surgery. The Benchmark Registry (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2001</LINK>) describing current practice in the use of the IABP suggests that of 16,909 uses between 1996 and 2000, 13% were in high risk patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization. The Registry is USA based and collects clinical data retrospectively on patients receiving an IABP from a number of centres throughout the world. A further retrospective analysis from the Benchmark Registry, in which outcomes from US and non-US centres were compared, advocates the early deployment of the IABP (<LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2003</LINK>). There is some evidence from randomised and non-randomised studies supporting the prophylactic use of the IABP in certain cardiac surgery patients. This review represents a formal assessment of the cumulative data with meta-analysis of all the evidence for and against the use of this device preoperatively in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularisation. This review is an update of our previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Field-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Field 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>The six randomised trials included were all published in peer-reviewed journals apart from <LINK REF="STD-Oberhoffer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oberhoffer 2006</LINK> which was accepted for presentation at the World Congress of World Society of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and published in abstract form. Their characteristics are given in detail in the Table of Included Studies (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). All studies apart from <LINK REF="STD-Oberhoffer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Oberhoffer 2006</LINK> had the same principle investigator and this was of some concern. However the author was contacted and assurances sought, and obtained, that each study was entirely independent. Through this contact, additional data were also obtained on two year outcomes. These five papers acknowledge the support of either St Jude Medical or Datascope. Datascope are the manufacturers of the intra-aortic balloon pump. Attempts were made and some contact was had with Dr Oberhoffer via telephone however further information was not forthcoming. Please see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for description of bias.</P>
<P>General bias is bound to exist in terms of reporting of positive results in the literature however we are unaware of any data to that effect. Clearly the study is not blinded to either the patient or the surgeon. Follow-up in the studies are however complete. We believe the largest bias is against a positive result in that there is a high conversion rate from "no preoperative IABP" to post operative insertion caused by poor patient progression.</P>

The intervention group had a two hour period of preoperative augmentation with an IABP. Myocardial revascularisation was performed using normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and myocardial protection included intermittent cold cardioplegia with topical hypothermia.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-12-03 22:56:46 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>Data from a total of 255 patients was included in the mortality outcomes analysis. There were significantly fewer in-hospital deaths in the intervention compared to the control arm (OR 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.41; P&lt;0.0001). In the sub-group of Christianson papers, low cardiac index (&lt;2.0 L/min/m2) was noted in fewer patients in the treatment arm compared to the control arm (OR 0.14; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.25; P&lt;0.00001). Evidence from RCT 4 suggests one hour of preoperative IABP augmentation is sufficient. There was no differences in long term mortality in the survivors of the primary hospital episode. There was insufficient data to analyse off pump patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The results of this meta-analysis are limited by a number of issues concerning the included randomised controlled trials:</P>
<P>a) In general terms all the studies identified and used in the meta-analysis were small. Five were from the same institution, with the same principle investigator, over a relatively short and overlapping period of time. The study independent of Christiansons group has only been published in abstract form. Each study design is broadly similar and therefore any bias can be expected to be propagated. Because of the nature of the trials there was no blinding in the methodology.</P>
<P>Discussion with Dr Jan Christenson has provided some reassurance that the data in each of his studies are independent, but this does not allow us to exclude other methodological problems. Another point for observation is that these studies were funded in part by Datascope who might be expected to benefit from positive results.</P>
<P>b) More specifically there are points of concern within each study. The randomised controlled trials included in this review are principally concerned with the efficacy of the preoperative IABP as a prophylactic intervention. However, as pointed out by <LINK REF="STD-Holman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 2000</LINK> with regard to these studies, "these studies included many patients with on-going myocardial infarction and preoperative cardiogenic shock, which are generally accepted therapeutic rather than prophylactic indications for IABPs". In particular, all the studies had a variable number of patients with "unstable angina", 100% in <LINK REF="STD-Christenson-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Christenson 2003</LINK>. This may account for two other issues of concern. Firstly there was a very high mortality in the control group (23/123) relative to the IABP group (4/132). It seems likely that this high mortality was a result of the unstable nature of the patient population recruited. A reflection of this is the observation that a large percentage of the control group had a low post operative cardiac index requiring insertion of an IABP (52/88 in Christiansons series). The same observation is made in the single off-pump study in which there was an unusually high conversion to on-pump in the control group (10/15) which did not have a preoperative IABP. In addition, seven patients in the control group required a postoperative IABP for low cardiac output. These facts may be attributable to the high risk nature of these patients, however because of a lack of information regarding their Euroscores (<LINK REF="REF-Nashef-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nashef 1999</LINK>) or Parsonnet (<LINK REF="REF-Parsonnet-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsonnet 1989</LINK>) scores we are unable to judge this objectively. [For details of these scoring systems see additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.] Whatever the explanation, a mortality of around 20% in patients undergoing CABG would be regarded as unacceptably high by any standards (<LINK REF="REF-SCTS-Blue-Book-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCTS Blue Book 2008</LINK>) .</P>
<P>c) The definition of "high risk" is problematic. Many of the definitions used in these studies are not conventionally accepted prognostic factors (Euroscore or Parsonnet score) for operative mortality. The definition of high risk in these studies is based on an "in-house" definition of a combination of left main stem disease, diffuse disease, redo-surgery, low ejection fraction, unstable angina, posterior vessel off-pump surgery and hypertension. Some of these parameters (diffuse disease, left main stem and posterior vessel off-pump surgery) are not commonly accepted prognostic factors.</P>
<P>A recent paper by <LINK REF="STD-Diez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Diez 2008</LINK> attempted to risk stratify patients. Unfortunately, the data presented suggests little progress on the issue of preoperative risk stratification. . Another retrospective study by <LINK REF="REF-Healy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2006</LINK> suggested that the correct identification of appropriate patients who would benefit from pre-emptive placement of IABP could be performed using the EuroSCORE. Patients with a preoperative score of &gt;5 in their study benefited from preoperative IABP. <LINK REF="REF-Dunning-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunning 2003</LINK> performed a retrospective study and "derived and validated a clinical score that has a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 96.5% in the prediction of those patients requiring an IABP. The authors argued that it was more robust than using the Parsonnet score and that their validated clinical scoring system would be useful both to guide individual clinical decision making and to compare variation of IABP usage among institutions. Although retrospective studies are limited in the conclusions that can be drawn from them, we believe the only way forward in predicting which patients should have a preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump is based on the EuroSCORE which should be part of any future trial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Additional Meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>The results of two recent meta-analysis concur with ours. However, we believe ours to be robust because <LINK REF="REF-Dyub-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyub 2008</LINK> included non-randomised data, data on patients undergoing off pump surgery, and data on patients where the IABP was inserted at the end of the operation (<LINK REF="STD-Marra-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marra 2002</LINK>) and only two of the four on-pump randomised trials by Christianson were included (as <LINK REF="REF-Dyub-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyub 2008</LINK> et al believed there was duplication). We believe off-pump patients should be analysed separately as the conduct of the operation and the effects of a IABP are such as to not allow bulk analysis. The second systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Dunning-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunning 2004</LINK> was incomplete and purely descriptive with no statistical analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">On-pump studies</HEADING>
<P>Although there are clear concerns about the analysis presented in the paper, there is a large body of contributory non-randomised evidence concerning the use of the IABP preoperatively in a number of patient groups both on-pump (<LINK REF="STD-Dietl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dietl 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gutfinger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gutfinger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 2000</LINK>) and off-pump (<LINK REF="STD-Craver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Craver 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Dietl-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Dietl 1996</LINK> have published a retrospective analysis of 163 consecutive patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF&lt;0.25) and undergoing isolated CABG between January 1991 and December 1995. In group A, 37 patients had a preoperative IABP, while group B (126 patients) underwent operation without this early intervention. Interestingly, 28 patients in group B (22.2%) required a post operative IABP for haemodynamic support, 42.9% (12/28) of whom subsequently died. Overall 30 day mortality in group A was 2.7% (1/37) and in group B was 11.9% (15/126). Needless to say this resulted in a significant cost benefit. A significant number of the recruited population were diagnosed as having urgent or emergency operations and a proportion had unstable angina or a history of myocardial infarction within a week. <LINK REF="STD-Gutfinger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gutfinger 1999</LINK> retrospectively analysed 206 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG between January 1993 and September 1996. Group I (109) acted as controls and did not receive a preoperative IABP, while Group II (97) acted as the intervention arm. Patients in Group II had a higher number of unstable patients and this is reflected in the higher Parsonnet score (Group I, 15+/-6.4 and Group II, 21.4+/-7.3, P&lt;0.001). The difference in mortality between the two groups (Group I, 3(2.8%) and Group II, 6(6.2%)), NS) was taken as evidence of efficacy. However, the study lacked statistical power to exclude either substantial harm or benefit in the intervention compared to the comparison group.<LINK REF="STD-Holman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Holman 2000</LINK> took a different approach and suggested that previous studies had looked at using the preoperative IABP in high risk patients who were also "unstable" - now a commonly accepted therapeutic intervention. These authors distinguished this high risk unstable population from a truly elective high risk population. The propensity matched study consisted of a retrospective analysis of 7,581 patients registered with the Alabama CABG Cooperative Project between July 1995 and June 1996, 592 of whom received a prophylactic pre-incision IABP. No patients had current or recent instability. There was no survival advantage to using a prophylactic IABP in this patient population, however there was a significant reduction in hospital length of stay. Clearly, the efficacy of the preoperative IABP in truly elective, on-pump high risk patients requires further clarification, preferably with a randomised controlled trial. More recent studies in this updated review confirm our conclusions (<LINK REF="STD-Miceli-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Miceli 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gong-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gong 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kern-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Kern 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Santarpino-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Santarpino 2009</LINK>) suggesting further studies are needed to define this population.</P>

<P>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Craver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Craver 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2004</LINK>) provide additional, non-randomised, retrospective data describing the preoperative IABP in high risk patients undergoing off-pump CABG. <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK> published a retrospective analysis of 142 high risk patients who underwent off-pump CABG between April 1998 and July 2000. Their specific interest was in the efficacy of the preoperative and intraoperative IABP in aiding posterior vessel off-pump surgery. Despite the intervention arm of the study (with IABP, 57) having a higher number of high risk unstable patients than the control arm (without IABP, 85), there was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (single death in without-IABP group), and this was taken as evidence in favour of the prophylactic IABP. Conversion rates to CPB were comparably low in both groups towards the end of the study. <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2004</LINK> reported on a series of 133 consecutive patients undergoing off-pump CABG between April 2000 and July 2003. Group I had 32 patients who were treated with a preoperative IABP and Group II served as controls (101). Despite Group I having a higher proportion of unstable high risk patients in it, mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (Group I, 0 and Group II, 1). There was no conversion to CPB in either group. This was taken as evidence of the preoperative IABP improving stability in high risk patients. <LINK REF="STD-Craver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Craver 2001</LINK> reported a favourable effect of the preoperative IABP in a limited series of 16 patients who underwent off-pump CABG. There was no control group in this study. Unfortunately, as with the on-pump studies, the patient population recruited were generally from a high risk unstable group and further work is required to understand which high risk elective patients might benefit from this intervention. A further study by <LINK REF="STD-Etienne-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Etienne 2007</LINK> concluded that the combined use of preoperative intra aortic counterpulsion and beating heart intervention allows complete revascularisation in high risk patients with an important reduction in operative mortality and excellent mid-term results. Group I (25 "emergencies" in which IABP was inserted one hour preoperatively) were compared with Group II (non-emergencies in which IABP was inserted 24 hours preoperatively) and EuroSCORE was utilised. They suggest that "compared with the EuroSCORE predictive model a dramatic decrease in mortality occurred in both groups. Group I predicted mortality was 36.8% and observed was 20% and in Group II the predicted mortality was 15.2% and the observed was 0%. Additional evidence for benefit in off-pump surgery and highlights the utility of Euroscore in this process.</P>

<P>The combined clinical experience of the authors suggests at present it is usual practice in the UK to deploy the IABP preoperatively in patients listed for isolated coronary surgery only when they are deemed unstable with rest pain or in heart failure i.e. so-called "in-house urgent" cases. We are however aware of no formal published UK based data to support this opinion (<LINK REF="REF-SCTS-Blue-Book-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">SCTS Blue Book 2008</LINK>). This review found some evidence to support this practice of deploying the preoperative IABP in high risk unstable patients. However, the available randomised data is dependent on small statistically underpowered studies with unclear methodology. This update adds a further single RCT (abstract form) to the analysis, however the evidence remains insufficiently robust enough to extend the use of IABP to truly elective, high risk patients. The issue of elective patients may be addressed in the trial currently on-going in Italy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-12-03 22:57:21 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further RCT evidence is required. It would be helpful to perform an RCT looking at entirely elective, high risk patients. In particular, it would be interesting to design a trial with patients stratified by risk according to the recognised risk score for perioperative death (Euroscore). Such data would allow us to know if the efficacy of IABP depends on level of patient risk.</P>

<STUDY DATA_SOURCE="SOUGHT" ID="STD-NCT00881192" MODIFIED="2010-12-03 17:26:23 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="Nicole Ackermann" NAME="NCT00881192" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;A RCT registered with &amp;quot;Clinicals Trials.gov&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perioperative Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) Operations in Patients With Severely Depressed Left Ventricular FunctionThis study is currently recruiting participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verified by IRCCS Policlinico S. Donato, April 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Received: April 14, 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently recruiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its first introduction in humans in 1962, Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is now the most commonly used therapeutic option to support failing heart in cardiac surgery. The main effects of IABP are an increase in diastolic blood pressure and therefore an improvement in coronary perfusion and a reduction of ventricular after load, thus increasing stroke volume and cardiac output. IABP-related complications include limb ischemia, bleeding at the site of IABP insertion, infection, and aortic dissection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IABP could be used preoperatively, intraoperatively, or postoperatively. However, despite the wide use of the device, the optimal timing and use of IABP in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains controversial. Time of insertion has been showed to affect hospital mortality, ranging from 18.8% to 19.6% for preoperative insertion, from 27.6% to 32.3% for intraoperative insertion, and from 39% to 40.5% for postoperative insertion. Several studies, randomized and non-randomized, have been conducted to address the impact of preoperative use of IABP on the outcome, each study including a relative small number of patients. In an effort to increase the strength of the results, two meta-analysis have been conducted and published in 2008. The objectives of both were to assess the effect on mortality and morbidity of using IABP preoperatively in high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Surprisingly, the meta-analysis from Field and co-workers was conducted on four randomized controlled trials (for a total of 193 patients included) published by the same author from the same institution, making the results not conclusive although favourable toward a beneficial effect of the preoperative use of IABP. Moreover, two of the randomized trials conducted by Christenson and co-workers and included in the above mentioned meta-analysis, were excluded from the meta-analysis from Dyub and co-workers because considered duplicates Unfortunately, one study by Christenson and co-workers and included in the meta-analysis from Dyub was conducted on off-pump surgery, introducing another bias in the criteria of eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present it is unclear whether the preoperative use of IABP in high-risk coronary patients scheduled for CABG operations leads to a better outcome. The experimental hypothesis of the present randomized, controlled trial (RCT) is that the placement of IABP immediately before beginning the surgical procedure induces a reduction of major morbidity after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary Outcome Measures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Major morbidity according to STS (mechanical ventilation &amp;gt; 48 hours, mediastinitis, surgical reexploration, stroke, acute renal failure) [&amp;#160;Time&amp;#160;Frame:&amp;#160;30 days after operation&amp;#160;] [&amp;#160;Designated&amp;#160;as&amp;#160;safety&amp;#160;issue:&amp;#160;No&amp;#160;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondary Outcome Measures:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time on mechanical ventilation; ICU and hospital stay [&amp;#160;Time&amp;#160;Frame:&amp;#160;30 days after the operation&amp;#160;] [&amp;#160;Designated&amp;#160;as&amp;#160;safety&amp;#160;issue:&amp;#160;No&amp;#160;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IABP complications (lower limb ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, bleeding) [&amp;#160;Time&amp;#160;Frame:&amp;#160;30 days after the operation&amp;#160;] [&amp;#160;Designated&amp;#160;as&amp;#160;safety&amp;#160;issue:&amp;#160;Yes&amp;#160;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Estimated Enrollment:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;160&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Study Start Date:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;April 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Estimated Study Completion Date:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;April 2011&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Estimated Primary Completion Date:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;April 2011 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimated Primary Completion Date:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 2011 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigned Interventions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control: No Intervention No preoperative IABP; if needed, postoperative IABP placement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;IABP: Active Comparator Preoperative IABP placement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procedure: IABP preoperative IABP placement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed Description:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCT including patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery (with or without associated procedures) and having a left ventricular ejection fraction &amp;lt; 0.30. Exclusion criteria: age &amp;lt; 18 years, no patient's consent, contra-indications to the use of IABP (severe peripheral arteropathy; endovascular abdominal aortic prostheses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients will be randomly allocated to either a control group or a treatment group. Patients in the control group will not receive an IABP preoperatively, and patients in the treatment arm will receive an IABP positioned immediately after the induction of anesthesia and before beginning surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomization will be performed the day before the operation. Primary endpoint: reduction of major morbidity rate (defined as either prolonged (&amp;gt; 48 hours) mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure, mediastinitis, surgical revision, stroke).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondary endpoint: reduction in inotropic drug use, shortening of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160; Eligibility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ages Eligible for Study: &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 Years and older&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genders Eligible for Study: &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accepts Healthy Volunteers: &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Criteria Inclusion Criteria:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elective CABG operation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age &amp;gt; 18 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ejection fraction &amp;lt; 0.30&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Exclusion Criteria:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No consent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emergency operation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contra-indication to IABP placement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;#160; Contacts and Locations&lt;br&gt;Please refer to this study by its ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00881192&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Locations &lt;table rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Italy, Milan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;IRCCS Policlinico S.Donato&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Recruiting&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;San Donato Milanese, Milan, Italy, 20097&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Contact: Marco Ranucci, MD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; 00390252774 ext 754 &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cardioanestesia%40virgilio.it?subject=NCT00881192, IABPCABG, Perioperative Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) Operations in Patients With Severely Depressed Left Ventricular Function&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;cardioanestesia@virgilio.it&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Principal Investigator: Marco Ranucci, MD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sub-Investigator: Serenella Castelvecchio, MD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sub-Investigator: Carlo De Vincentiis, MD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sub-Investigator: Andrea Biondi, MD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Sub-Investigator: Ekaterina Baryshnikova, BD, PHD &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Sponsors and Collaborators IRCCS Policlinico S.
