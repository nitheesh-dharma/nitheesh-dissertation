<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-04-17 18:54:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the backflow of urine from the bladder up the ureters to the kidney. People with VUR are thought to be more likely to get urinary tract infections (UTIs) involving the kidney tissue, which may cause permanent kidney damage. Current treatment options include reimplantation of the ureters or endoscopic surgery, long-term antibiotics, endoscopic correction (injection of a substance around the entry of the ureter into the bladder) using different materials, or a combination of interventions. This review found no strong evidence that long-term antibiotic prophylaxis prevented repeat UTIs in children with VUR. Associated side effects were infrequent and minor, but prophylaxis was associated with a threefold increased risk of bacterial resistance to the treatment drug in subsequent infections. Surgery decreased the number of UTIs with fever, but did not change the number of children developing symptomatic UTI or kidney damage.</P>

<P>Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) results in urine passing retrograde up the ureter. Urinary tract infections (UTI) associated with VUR have been considered a cause of permanent renal parenchymal damage in children with VUR. Management of these children has been directed at preventing UTI by antibiotic prophylaxis and/or surgical correction of VUR. The optimum strategy is not clear.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-03-30 14:22:51 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>In August 2010 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE and screened reference lists of papers and abstracts from conference proceedings.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-03-30 13:50:25 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>RCTs in any language comparing any treatment of VUR including surgical or endoscopic correction, antibiotic prophylaxis, non-invasive non-pharmacological techniques and any combination of therapies.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-04-17 14:41:47 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) and their 95% CI's Data were pooled using the random effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-02 10:56:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Twenty RCTs (2324 children) were included. Long-term low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis compared to no treatment/placebo did not significantly reduce repeat symptomatic UTI (846 children: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17) or febrile UTI (946 children: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.24) at two years. There was considerable heterogeneity in the analyses and only one study was adequately blinded. At one to three years, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of new or progressive renal damage on DMSA scan (446 children: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80). Side effects were infrequent when reported, but antibiotics increased the likelihood of bacterial drug resistance threefold (132 UTIs: RR 2.94, 95% CI 1.39 to 6.25).</P>
<P>When long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with surgical or endoscopic correction of VUR plus antibiotics for one to 24 months (10 studies, 1141 children), the risk of symptomatic UTI was not significantly different at any time point. Combined surgical and antibiotic treatment caused a 57% reduction in febrile UTI by five years (2 studies, 449 children: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.70) but did not decrease the risk of new or progressive renal damage at any time point. Postoperative obstruction was seen in 0% and 7% of children in two surgical studies and 0% in one endoscopic study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-02 10:57:44 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Compared with no treatment, use of long-term, low-dose antibiotics did not significantly reduce the number of repeat symptomatic and febrile UTIs in children with VUR. Considerable heterogeneity in the analyses and inclusion of only one adequately blinded study, made drawing firm conclusions challenging. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of developing new or progressive renal damage, but assuming an 8% baseline risk, 33 children would need long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent one more child developing kidney damage over the course of two to three years.</P>
<P>The added benefit of surgical or endoscopic correction of VUR over antibiotic treatment alone remains unclear. Eight children would require combined surgical and antibiotic treatment to prevent one additional child developing febrile UTI by five years, but it would not cause fewer children developing renal damage.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-04-17 18:54:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is thought to be a maturational abnormality of the vesicoureteric junction, which results in retrograde passing of urine up the ureter during voiding. Although the exact prevalence in children is unknown, about a third investigated after a urinary tract infection (UTI), shows signs of VUR (<LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1994</LINK>). UTI is common, affecting 5% to 10% of all children (<LINK REF="REF-Hellstrom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstrom 1991</LINK>), with 30% to 50% of them likely to suffer a recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1994</LINK>). VUR is thought to predispose for UTI, renal involvement during UTI and hence to potentially cause subsequent permanent renal damage in 15% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Montini-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montini 2007</LINK>). Retrospective analyses of selected individuals with renal scarring, have reported hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in approximately 20% and 10% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Martinell-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinell 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1998</LINK>). However recent data from a prospective cohort study have indicated, that possibly due to better treatment of acute infections, these adverse outcomes now occur considerably less frequently (<LINK REF="REF-Wennerstrom-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennerstrom 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennerstrom-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennerstrom 2000b</LINK>).</P>
<P>As a result of the hypothesized causal link between VUR and renal scarring, VUR screening and treatment strategies have largely been directed towards avoidance of UTI induced-damage (<LINK REF="REF-Belman-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belman 1995</LINK>). To this end, both antibiotic prophylaxis with or without surgical VUR correction have been used. In addition to the common Politano-Leadbetter, Lich-Gregoir and Cohen surgical techniques, newer, less invasive techniques involving endoscopic periureteric injections of polydimethylsiloxane (Macroplastique), dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Deflux) or glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen have been assessed<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Capozza-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Capozza 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frankenschmidt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankenschmidt 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frey-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Frey 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oswald-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Oswald 2002</LINK>). Although VUR is a common problem in childhood, there has been no consensus regarding the optimal management strategy and practice varies widely.</P>

<P>We originally identified 10 studies after full paper assessment (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 2004</LINK>). The International Reflux Study was reported in a European (<LINK REF="STD-IRS-EUR-1981_x002d_2003" TYPE="STUDY">IRS EUR 1981-2003</LINK>) and an American arm (<LINK REF="STD-IRS-USA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">IRS USA 1992</LINK>) and so we treated them as two separate studies. We captured two studies by screening reference lists of the authors.

Overall, girls outnumbered boys, with a maximum reported ratio of 4:1 (<LINK REF="STD-Garin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Garin 2006</LINK>).

For this review, we only included the data from children with VUR. In <LINK REF="STD-Reddy-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Reddy 1997</LINK> no treatment was compared with two antibiotic prophylaxis regimens (daily or intermittent antibiotic administration). Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> (125 children) compared probiotics with antibiotic prophylaxis. Overall the duration of the antibiotic treatment varied from one to three years.</P>
<P>In 10 studies (1141 children) the effectiveness of low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis, given for one to five years, was compared with ureteric reimplantation by open surgery (<LINK REF="STD-BIRSG-1987" TYPE="STUDY">BIRSG 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holland-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Holland 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IRS-EUR-1981_x002d_2003" TYPE="STUDY">IRS EUR 1981-2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IRS-USA-1992" TYPE="STUDY">IRS USA 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smellie-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smellie 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Scott-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Scott 1968</LINK>) or endoscopic subureteric injection of Deflux (<LINK REF="STD-Capozza-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Capozza 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dite-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Dite 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-Reflux-Trial-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish Reflux Trial 2010</LINK>). All who underwent a surgical or endoscopic procedure received antibiotic prophylaxis for one to 24 months, with a variety of open surgical techniques being used to correct VUR. Generally, only children with higher (dilating) grades of VUR were included. The gender distribution was usually poorly reported. Outcomes were reported at three months to 10 years post randomisation.</P>
<P>One study had a three-arm design (203 children), and children were randomised to endoscopic VUR correction and antibiotic prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis alone, or surveillance (<LINK REF="STD-Swedish-Reflux-Trial-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish Reflux Trial 2010</LINK>).</P>

We did not find a single RCT in which an open surgical procedure was compared with endoscopic correction of VUR, nor one in which antibiotic use was compared with surgery alone, or with other treatment strategies such as management for voiding dysfunction.</P>
<P>In total, we have included 20 studies (58 reports) enrolling 2324 children under the age of 18 years from the USA, Europe, Australasia and South Korea. The number of participants varied between 10 and 321. Nine studies included less than 100, eight studies included between 100 and 200, and three studies enrolled more than 200 children. Data for at least one outcome was available from 2219 participants. Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was the predominant chemoprophylactic drug of choice, but trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, cefadroxil or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were also used for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Symptomatic UTI and febrile UTI</HEADING>
<P>Of the eight studies that compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment, six had repeat symptomatic UTI as the primary outcome and allowed distinction of febrile UTI as a separate entity. One and two year incidence of symptomatic UTI varied from 12% to 36% in the group treated with antibiotics and 2% to 41% in the surveillance group. The point estimate for overall effect favoured antibiotic prophylaxis, but the result was not statistically significant for either symptomatic UTI (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.1 (5 studies, 846 children): RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17) or febrile UTI by one to two years of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>.2 (6 studies, 946 children): RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.24). For both outcomes, there was a large amount of unexplained heterogeneity among studies.

For allocation concealment, heterogeneity appeared to be related to <LINK REF="STD-Garin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Garin 2006</LINK>, however removing this study did not alter the statistical significance of the result (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.1 (5 studies, 833 children): RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.05).

<P>We had planned to analyse the results of studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis (for one to five years) with surgical VUR correction together with studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with endoscopic VUR correction to obtain summary measures of treatment effects. However, we separated outcomes according to follow-up time (one to two, four to five, five to 10, and more than 10 years) and for none of the time-points did the analyses include both surgical and endoscopic interventions to estimate the treatment effect.

<P>Adverse events for either group were generally not well reported. Postoperative obstruction to the urinary tract occurred in 7% of children (10/151) in the European arm of the International Reflux Study. The Birmingham Reflux Study stated that no cases of postoperative obstruction were found after five years. None of children treated with endoscopic injection in the <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-Reflux-Trial-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish Reflux Trial 2010</LINK> suffered vesicoureteric obstruction. The authors did report six other adverse events. One boy had transient ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation on ultrasound at one month, one boy developed urine retention after endoscopic injection, and one boy aspirated during anaesthesia and required overnight observation in the intensive care unit. One girl suffered abdominal pain with pelvic dilatation and decreasing split function. The authors stated this resulted from a crossing vessel at the pelviureteral junction and was not related to the intervention. Finally, in one boy a fibrous narrowing of the bulbar urethra without obstruction was detected during the first endoscopic procedure. A weakening urine stream and obstructive flow curve pattern led to repeat endoscopic investigation, which revealed deterioration of bulbar narrowing. Ultimately internal urethrotomy was done. No other study referred to obstruction. No other adverse outcomes of surgery or endoscopy were reported.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-02 11:18:16 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The benefits and harms of interventions for primary VUR were assessed in 20 studies involving 2324 children.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Antibiotic prophylaxis versus surveillance/no treatment</HEADING>
<P>Overall, low-dose long-term antibiotic prophylaxis tended to reduce the number of recurrent symptomatic and febrile UTIs, but the result was not statistically significant. Only one of the included studies was adequately blinded. Its point estimate favoured antibiotic prophylaxis, but the result was not significant and patient numbers too small to adequately power this analysis. Long-term low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of children developing new or progressive renal damage by 60% compared with no treatment. Assuming a baseline risk of 8% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.3; baseline risk 17/220), 33 children would need prophylaxis to prevent one extra child developing a new or progressive renal scar over the course of two to three years. Side effects of the preventive treatment were minor and infrequent but poorly reported. Little data were provided as to how side-effects had affected adherence. Reported compliance rates varied between 70% and 100%, but they were inconsistently measured. Since previous studies have shown poor compliance for daily antibiotic regimens for VUR (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenfield-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenfield 1997</LINK>), it raises the question whether antibiotics were inherently not very effective or not being used as prescribed. Treating VUR patients with long-term low-dose antibiotics was associated with a threefold increased risk of microbial resistance against the prophylactic drug in breakthrough infection. This estimate however was based on the pooled data of only three studies, with high levels of heterogeneity and imprecision due to small numbers.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">VUR correction with surgery plus antibiotics (1-24 months) versus antibiotics alone</HEADING>
<P>Only the European arm of the IRS study evaluated the differential risk of symptomatic UTI between medical and surgical management. Both strategies included prescription of antibiotics, for five years or until VUR resolution in medically treated children as opposed to six months in the surgically treated children. By four to five years there was no difference in symptomatic UTI. Both the European and the American arms of the IRS study however, investigated the risk of febrile UTI and found a significant benefit for those children who underwent surgical VUR correction. Assuming a baseline risk of 22% of developing febrile UTI when on antibiotics alone (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.6; baseline risk 48/218), the estimated RR of 0.43 would translate into a RD of 13% and eight patients needing surgery to prevent one extra febrile UTI over the course of five years. Further analysis at 10 years confirmed these results. It supports the idea that although surgery might not provide an added benefit over antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing symptomatic lower UTI, it might keep the infection from spreading to the upper tract, and ultimately prevent subsequent renal damage. No evidence was found to corroborate this theory however, since the risk of developing new or progressive areas of renal damage at five and 10 years was no different between the treatment groups. You could argue that if VUR were an important modifiable risk factor for the development of UTI and renal damage, we would expect significant reduction in these outcomes for the group of surgically treated patients. It may be that delayed treatment of acute pyelonephritis is the more important risk factor, hence explaining why adverse outcomes of renal damage are currently seen less frequently than they used to (<LINK REF="REF-Wennerstrom-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennerstrom 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennerstrom-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennerstrom 2000b</LINK>). In addition, no differences between treatment groups were demonstrated for hypertension or CKD, but small numbers resulted in large imprecision and follow-up time was too short.</P>
<P>Potential benefits of surgery need to be weighed against its potential adverse effects. Whereas the Birmingham Reflux Study stated that no cases of postoperative obstruction were found after five years, they occurred in 7% of children (10/151) in the European arm of the International Reflux Study, corresponding to one every 14 to 15 patients undergoing the procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Endoscopic treatment for VUR correction</HEADING>
<P>When compared with long-term low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis alone, endoscopic correction combined with antibiotics did not significantly reduce either symptomatic or febrile UTI by two years. There was also no significant difference in new or progressive renal damage. Results however were derived from only two small studies with contradicting point estimates. When endoscopic correction was compared with no treatment in the <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-Reflux-Trial-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish Reflux Trial 2010</LINK>, 45% fewer children developed symptomatic UTI by two years. A similar risk reduction was seen for febrile UTI, but the result was not significant. Children that underwent endoscopic VUR correction also received antibiotic prophylaxis for a minimum of three months. Given that in the comparison of endoscopic treatment versus antibiotic prophylaxis, the point estimate favoured the prophylactic treatment alone, it seems unlikely that the endoscopic treatment was responsible for the reduced risk of febrile UTI in the comparison with no treatment.</P>
<P>Assuming correction were beneficial, endoscopic subureteric injection of various materials could offer an alternative method of correcting VUR. It is currently widely used in North America and Europe since it is known to be associated with less pain and postoperative recovery time compared with open surgery. Four studies included in this review have demonstrated acceptable rates of VUR correction with three different materials. In a systematic review of 63 studies involving 5527 patients, the success rates for correction of VUR grades I and II, III, IV and V were 78.5%, 72%, 63% and 51% after one treatment; second treatments had an overall success rate of 68% (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 2006</LINK>). Therefore rates of correction appeared to be lower than those reported with surgical reimplantation techniques particularly for high grade VUR.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-04-17 21:17:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For the primary outcome of symptomatic UTI and febrile UTI, study participants had mostly lower grades of VUR. Only five participants in the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> had VUR grade V. These patients are generally viewed as having the highest risk of developing renal scars after pyelonephritis. Hence we should be careful with extrapolating the results from this review to children with VUR grade V. Similarly, the studies that compared surgery and antibiotics with antibiotics alone only included participants with higher degrees of VUR. This reflected the view that chances of spontaneous resolution would be slimmer and risks of renal scarring greater. VUR grade V however was also excluded from the International Reflux Study, since it was regarded to be part of a widespread malformation of the urinary tract instead of an isolated problem of the vesicoureteric junction and thought to experience a greater benefit from surgery.</P>
<P>A randomised comparison between antibiotic treatment and surgery alone has not been performed since in all studies, antibiotics were also given for a variable length of time. Only studies designed to assess the incremental benefit of surgery over antibiotics alone have been conducted.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-04-17 21:18:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>The quality of conduct and reporting of these studies was variable, with many studies omitting crucial methodological information used to assess the risk of bias.</P>
<P>This review update has mainly added new studies that compared antibiotics to no treatment. Although in general both methodological quality and standard of reporting were good, only the <LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK> was optimally designed, providing placebo and ensuring blinding of all participants, caregivers, outcome assessors and data analysts.</P>
<P>The effect estimate of incremental benefit of surgery was based on only one study that included 429 patients in the analysis. Given the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind participants or health care providers. Since this tends to result in overestimation of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), bias might have played a part in producing the statistically significant difference in febrile UTI in favour of surgical management.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-04-17 21:22:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>For over five decades, scientific published work has suggested the existence of a link between recurrent UTI, VUR and renal scarring (<LINK REF="REF-Olbing-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olbing 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smellie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smellie 1998</LINK>). VUR has been thought to facilitate the involvement of the upper urinary tract during UTI by allowing retrograde passage of infected urine to the ureter. Subsequently all interventions have been targeted at preventing UTI-induced damage to the kidney. Earlier versions of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 2004</LINK>) were not been able to provide evidence as to whether the common practice of diagnosing and treating children with VUR conferred important health benefits, since no adequately powered studies had included a no treatment arm. Five new studies have since been published that compare the administration of antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. Although the addition of these studies produced a risk estimate in favour of long-term low-dose antibiotics, the result was not statistically significant. Only one of studies was optimally designed with adequate blinding of all participants and personnel involved in the study (<LINK REF="STD-PRIVENT-Study-2009" TYPE="STUDY">PRIVENT Study 2009</LINK>). When analysed by itself it produced a RR of 0.70. The result was not significant (95% CI 0.35 to 1.24), but patient numbers too small to adequately power the analysis. In the original study, the investigators had included 576 children both with and without VUR. They found a 6% absolute risk reduction (95% CI 1 to 13) for the group treated with antibiotics versus those treated with placebo and the effect of preventive antibiotic treatment did not differ according to the VUR status.</P>
<P>In comparison to the previous review, we have highlighted symptomatic and febrile UTI as more relevant primary end points rather than positive urine cultures.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-04-17 12:50:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Compared with no treatment, use of long-term low-dose antibiotics tended to reduce the number of repeat symptomatic and febrile UTIs in children with VUR, but the result was not statistically significant. A large amount of unexplained heterogeneity in the analysis and inclusion of only one adequately blinded study, makes drawing firm conclusions challenging. Prophylaxis modestly reduced the risk of new or progressive renal damage, produced few side effects but was associated with a threefold increase in prophylactic drug resistance in subsequent UTIs.</P>
<P>The added benefit of surgery over long-term low-dose antibiotic use remains uncertain. Although there was a significant reduction in repeat episodes of febrile UTI, there were no differences in either symptomatic UTI or renal damage. Informed decision making should consider the risk of adverse events associated with surgery. Correcting VUR using endoscopic approaches would theoretically reduce these risks it but was not associated with a reduced number of symptomatic or febrile UTIs or a reduction in new or progressive renal damage.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-04-17 21:22:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>We still need a well-designed, blinded and adequately powered study in children with VUR to resolve the remaining uncertainty surrounding the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing UTI and renal damage. Hence we await with interest the results of the ongoing, placebo-controlled 'randomised Intervention for children with VesicoUreteral Reflux' study (<LINK REF="STD-RIVUR-Study" TYPE="STUDY">RIVUR Study</LINK>), which examines the effect of low-dose antibiotic treatment on symptomatic UTI and renal parenchymal injury assessed by DMSA scan. The role of surgery in the management of VUR needs further exploration. Of specific interest would be the impact of VUR correction by endoscopic subureteric injection without antibiotics versus no treatment on the incidence of febrile UTI and renal parenchymal injury assessed by DMSA scan.</P>

<P>It is difficult to accept the fact that Surgery does not help. There are specific indications for surgery especially in the realm of paediatric VUR. A more appropriate study would have been to compare the two groups (surgery vs conservative)in a similar grade of reflux and as such the controversy exists only in Gr3 reflux.</P>
<P>Regarding the assessment of children with UTI it is clear cut that the first investigation will be Ultrasound examination Followed by MCU.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Response to Dr Philipraj</P>
<P>This systematic review of randomised controlled trials has summarised the results of published and unpublished trials identified by a comprehensive search of literature sources. The majority of published trials have compared surgery and antibiotic prophylaxis with antibiotic prophylaxis. The large trials (Birmingham Reflux Study, International Reflux Study) only enrolled children with dilating reflux - equivalent to grade 3 or more on the International Classification. The International Reflux Study only enrolled children with grade 3 and 4 reflux; children with grade 5 reflux were excluded. There were no trials identified that compared surgery and antibiotic prophylaxis only and only enrolled children with grade 3 reflux. When data from these trials are combined in meta-analysis, there were no significant differences in the risk for further urinary tract infection or for renal scarring. In the International Reflux Study, the incidence of febrile urinary tract infections over 5 years of follow up was significantly reduced in children undergoing surgery compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. This was the only benefit of surgery over antibiotic prophylaxis that could be demonstrated. Otherwise the available trials have not demonstrated an additional benefit of surgery over antibiotic prophylaxis. </P>
<P>This systematic review of treatment cannot provide any information on the most appropriate investigations for children following urinary tract infection.</P>

<P>
<I>Yes (low risk of bias): </I>The study protocol is available and all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way; the study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).</P>

<TD>
<P>
<I>No (high risk of bias): </I>Not all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect); one or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.</P>
