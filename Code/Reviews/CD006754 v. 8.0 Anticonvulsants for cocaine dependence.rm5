<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Cocaine is an illicit drug available as a powder for intranasal or intravenous use or smoked as crack. Short- and long-term use of this drug results in the spread of infectious diseases (for example, AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis), crime, violence and prenatal drug exposure. Cocaine dependence is associated with medical and psychosocial complications and is a major public health problem. No proven pharmacological treatment for cocaine dependence is known. Antidepressant, anticonvulsant and dopaminergic medications have all been studied. The present review looked at the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsant drugs for treating cocaine dependence, both as a class and individually.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors searched scientific databases and Internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (in which participants were allocated at random to any anticonvulsant drug or placebo or another type of drug or non-pharmacological intervention intended to reduce,the use of cocaine). We assessed also dropout from treatment and frequency of side effects .We included people of any gender, age or ethnicity.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review authors identified 20 studies with 2068 participants, 77% male, with a mean age of 36 years. The mean duration of the trials was 11.8 weeks (range eight to 24 weeks). All but two of the trials were conducted in the USA, all with outpatients. The anticonvulsant drugs studied were carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. No significant differences were found between placebo and any anticonvulsant in reducing the number of dropouts from treatment, use of cocaine, craving and severity of dependence, depression or anxiety. Side effects were slightly more frequent in the anticonvulsant groups. No current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcomes dropout and use of cocaine, and was low for the outcomes side effects and craving. The major limitation of the trials was incomplete reporting of the methods used to protect against selection bias, randomly allocate participants to groups and conceal allocation. The evidence is current to June 2014.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:03:49 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem that is characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Although effective pharmacotherapy is available for alcohol and heroin dependence, none is currently available for cocaine dependence, despite two decades of clinical trials primarily involving antidepressant, anticonvulsivant and dopaminergic medications. Extensive consideration has been given to optimal pharmacological approaches to the treatment of individuals with cocaine dependence, and both dopamine antagonists and agonists have been considered. Anticonvulsants have been candidates for use in the treatment of addiction based on the hypothesis that seizure kindling-like mechanisms contribute to addiction.</P>

<P>We included a total of 20 studies with 2068 participants. We studied the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. Only one study had one arm by which the anticonvulsant was compared with the antidepressant desipramine. Upon comparison of anticonvulsant versus placebo, we found no significant differences for any of the efficacy and safety measures. Dropouts: risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 17 studies, 20 arms, 1695 participants, moderate quality of evidence. Use of cocaine: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02, nine studies, 11 arms, 867 participants, moderate quality of evidence; side effects: RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.90, eight studies, 775 participants; craving: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.09, seven studies, eight arms, 428 participants, low quality of evidence.</P>

<P>Although caution is needed when results from a limited number of small clinical trials are assessed, no current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications in the treatment of patients with cocaine dependence.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-13 13:50:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the leaf of coca, which is commonly available as powder for intranasal or intravenous use, or as crack, a free-base form that is smoked. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that when abused typically quickly leads to dependence. Cocaine dependence is characterised by continued use of cocaine despite significant substance-related problems.</P>
<P>Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem that is characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among regular users, a broad distinction can be made between socially integrated consumers, who may be using the drug in a recreational context, and more marginalised drug users, who use cocaine, along with opioids, as part of a chronic drug problem. Regular cocaine use has been associated with cardiovascular, neurological and mental health problems, and with elevated risk of accident and dependence. Cocaine injection and use of crack cocaine are associated with the highest health risks, including transmission of infectious diseases (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to these serious implications, cocaine use has been found to have direct negative cognitive effects on the brain, affecting tasks related to inhibition, memory, concentration, problem solving, learning, planning, attention and discrimination (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cocaine is also implicated in acute hospital admissions, suicides and deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Degenhardt-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degenhardt 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in only a few countries. It is estimated that about 2.2 million young adults 15 to 34 years of age (1.7% of this age group) used cocaine in the past year (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>). Illicit use of cocaine is still a persistent health problem worldwide. According to recent national population surveys, between 0.4% and 9% of the adult population report that they have tried cocaine at least once (i.e. lifetime prevalence), with Italy (4.2%), Spain (8.8%) and the United Kingdom (9.0%) at the upper end of this range. In general, recent cocaine use (past 12 months) is reported by less than 2% of adults (range, 0.2% to 3.6%). In Spain and the United Kingdom, recent prevalence rates are higher than 3% (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that the number of US citizens 12 years of age or older who are current users of cocaine has dropped by 44% since 2006. The US government survey on cocaine use found that in 2011, an estimated 1.4 million US citizens used cocaine - down from 2.4 million in 2006. The number of people who first tried cocaine over the previous year decreased from one million in 2002 to 670,000 in 2011. In addition, the number of people who abused or were dependent on cocaine dropped from 1.7 million in 2006 to 0.8 million in 2011.</P>
<P>The number of people who tested positive for cocaine in the workplace dropped by 65% from 2006 to 2012, and a 44% decrease in cocaine-related overdose deaths was reported from 2006 to 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-NSDUH-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">NSDUH 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although cocaine use in many South American countries has decreased or remained stable, a substantial increase in Brazil is obvious enough to be reflected in the regional prevalence rate for 2011. Cocaine use in Australia increased over the four years leading up to 2012 (<LINK REF="REF-UNODC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">UNODC 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2012, a decrease in cocaine use among addicts seeking treatment was observed , after a peak in 2008, in Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom, all countries reporting relatively high prevalence rates (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:39:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been estimated that at least 1.3 million people received treatment for illicit drug use in Europe during 2012.</P>
<P>Most treatment is provided in outpatient settings such as specialised centres, general healthcare centres such as general practitioners&#8217; offices and low-threshold facilities (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cocaine was cited as the primary drug among 14% of all reported individuals entering specialised drug treatment in 2012 (55,000) and in 18% of those entering treatment for the first time (26,000). Differences between countries have been noted, with around 90% of all cocaine users reported by only five countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and United Kingdom). Together, these five countries account for just over half of the EU population (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Currently, no medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cocaine dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Pani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pani 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>No effective pharmacotherapy is currently available for cocaine dependence despite two decades of clinical trials involving primarily antidepressant, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant and dopaminergic medications.</P>
<P>Recent controlled clinical studies have highlighted some promising medications, especially glutamatergic (<I>N</I>-acetylcysteine, modafinil, topiramate) and GABAergic (vigabatrin) agents, agonist replacement therapy (sustained-release methylphenidate, d-amphetamine) and indirect dopaminergic agents (disulfiram). Additionally, immunotherapy is a newly investigated approach (<LINK REF="REF-Karila-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karila 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several Cochrane systematic reviews have been published on the efficacy of antidepressants (<LINK REF="REF-Pani-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pani 2011</LINK>), dopamine agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2011</LINK>), psychostimulants (<LINK REF="REF-Castells-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castells 2010</LINK>), disulfiram (<LINK REF="REF-Pani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pani 2010</LINK>) and antipsychotics (<LINK REF="REF-Amato-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amato 2007</LINK>) for the treatment of cocaine dependence, but none of these provided support for the efficacy of these treatments. One published review on the efficacy of psychosocial treatment for psychostimulant dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Knapp-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapp 2007</LINK>) showed that existing treatments have yielded modest outcomes at best, leading to the conclusion that different formats of existing treatment models should be developed and tested and new psychosocial interventions should be undertaken.</P>
<P>A recent study found that topiramate was more efficacious than placebo in increasing the mean weekly proportion of cocaine non-use days and associated measures of clinical improvement among cocaine-dependent individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nonetheless, cocaine dependence remains a disorder for which no pharmacological treatment with proved efficacy is known, although considerable advances in the neurobiology of this addiction could guide future development of medication.</P>
</INTERVENTION>

<P>The effect of cocaine seems to rely on its ability to increase the availability of monoamines (dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline) in the brain. The dopamine increase in specific areas of the mesolimbic system with cocaine, which is shared with other drugs such as heroin, alcohol, cannabis and nicotine, has been involved in the rewarding effects of drugs and self-administration behaviour in animals and humans (<LINK REF="REF-Di-Chiara-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Di Chiara 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drevets-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drevets 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drevets-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drevets 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volkow-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volkow 2003</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Anticonvulsants have been regarded as candidates for the treatment of cocaine addiction based on the hypothesis that seizure kindling-like mechanisms contribute to addiction (<LINK REF="REF-Crosby-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crosby 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kranzler-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Kranzler 1995</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>In addiction, anticonvulsants potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission (<LINK REF="REF-Czapinski-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Czapinski 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Landmark-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landmark 2007</LINK>). GABA neurons are part of the mesolimbic dopamine system, and activation of GABA receptors in the ventral tegmental area is known to dampen dopamine neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens (<LINK REF="REF-Koob-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koob 1997</LINK>). The inhibitory capacity of GABA may be effective in blocking cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, which may lead to a decrease in cocaine reinforcement and reduced cocaine self administration (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kushner-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kushner 1999</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Some of the anticonvulsants more commonly studied for this purpose are carbamazepine, tiagabine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin and vigabatrin.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:42:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 2008, we published a Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating several anticonvulsant drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Minozzi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minozzi 2008</LINK>), with the aim of updating and completing the pre-existing review on carbamazepine for the treatment of cocaine dependence (<LINK REF="REF-Lima-Reisser-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lima Reisser 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>We concluded that no current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications in the treatment of cocaine dependence, and that larger randomised investigations analysing relevant outcomes (dropout, use of cocaine measured as number of individuals abstinent at the end of treatment) would have been necessary.</P>
<P>Since 2008, new RCTs on this topic have been published, and for this reason, an update of the systematic review is mandatory.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-04-09 12:40:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (SM and MC) independently assessed risk of bias of the included studies. They performed risk of bias assessment for RCTs and CCTs in this review using the criteria provided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The approach recommended for assessing risk of bias in studies included in a Cochrane review involves a two-part tool used to address seven specific domains, namely, sequence generation and allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and providers (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias) and other sources of bias. The first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement related to the risk of bias for that entry in terms of low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgements, we used the criteria provided by the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> as adapted for the field of addiction. See <LINK REF="APP-06" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 6</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>The domains of sequence generation and allocation concealment (avoidance of selection bias) were addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study.</P>
<P>Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (avoidance of performance bias and detection bias) was considered separately for objective outcomes (e.g. dropout, use of substance of abuse as measured by urinalysis, relapse at the end of follow-up) and subjective outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of signs and symptoms of withdrawal, patient self-reported use of substance, side effects, craving, psychiatric symptoms).</P>
<P>Incomplete outcome data (avoidance of attrition bias) were considered for all outcomes except for dropout from treatment, which very often is the primary outcome measured in trials on addiction.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Grading of evidence</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome using the GRADE system. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) developed a system for grading the quality of evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Grade-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grade 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shunemann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shunemann 2006</LINK>), which takes into account issues related not only to internal validity but also to external validity, such as directness of results. The 'Summary of findings' tables present the main findings of a review in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular, they provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum of available data on the main outcomes.</P>
<P>The GRADE system uses the following criteria in assigning grades of evidence.</P>
<OL>
<LI>High: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Low: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.</LI>
<LI>Very low: Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</LI>

<P>We analysed dichotomous outcomes by calculating the risk ratio (RR) for each trial with uncertainty in each result expressed by 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous outcomes by calculating the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI when studies used the same instrument in assessing the outcome. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) when studies used different instruments. For craving score, severity of dependence (Addiction Severity Index (Drug ASI), Clinical Global Impression - Observer (CGI-O)), depression (Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)) and anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)), we compared the postintervention mean scores of experimental and control groups.</P>

The first involved a placebo participant who accidentally shot himself in the eye with a nail gun, which required surgery, while he was in the follow-up phase of the study. The other two SAEs occurred in participants who were taking gabapentin. <LINK REF="STD-Bisaga-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bisaga 2006</LINK> reported five SAEs, four occurring in participants randomly assigned to gabapentin. Three of the SAEs in the gabapentin group were mild and resolved without hospitalisation (chest pain, bloody stools and calf pain), and one warranted removal from the study (depression with suicidal tendencies). None of the SAEs were judged to be related to the gabapentin. In <LINK REF="STD-Cornish-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cornish 1995</LINK>, the only unexpected, serious adverse medical event that occurred was the death of one participant who was randomly assigned to carbamazepine. <LINK REF="STD-Montoya-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Montoya 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nuijten-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Nuijten 2014</LINK> reported that no SAEs occurred.

Serious adverse events in the tiagabine group included hospitalisation due to suicidal ideation and hospitalisation for detoxification from alcohol and cocaine. An additional three tiagabine participants were hospitalised as the result of chest pains. Finally, one participant in the tiagabine group experienced two hospitalisations - one for gallstones and one for being incoherent and agitated following use of a large amount of cocaine. One of the placebo participants was hospitalised as the result of experiencing visual hallucinations and agitation, and a second placebo participant experienced two hospitalisations, both due to chest pains, which he attributed to panic attacks.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:16:35 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found 20 studies including 2068 participants comparing anticonvulsants versus placebo for the treatment of cocaine dependence. The anticonvulsants assessed were carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin.</P>
<P>Overall, no significant differences were found for any of the primary and secondary outcomes when any anticonvulsants were compared with placebo. Also in the subgroup analyses comparing a single anticonvulsant versus placebo, no differences were found in any of the primary or secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Results on side effects are few because only 8/21 (38%) studies reported data on side effects in a useable way. Moreover heterogeneity is high between studies in the frequencies of any side effects; this suggests that side effects could have been defined differently within studies, and that probably studies for which the frequency of side effects was very low reported only the most significant or important ones, whereas studies with high frequency reported any and low relevant side effects.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:16:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All but two of the 21 included studies were conducted in the USA. This could limit the generalisability of the results because health effects of various substances of abuse seem to be strongly dependent on social context, and the location at which studies were conducted could act as an effect modifier in the estimation of efficacy of treatment. Moreover among the included participants, 84.5% smoked crack cocaine, and only 10.6% used the intranasal route in the 13 studies that reported this information. These frequencies do not reflect the real prevalence of the different formulations of cocaine and route of administration: In European countries, crack cocaine represents around 13% of individuals seeking treatment (ranging from 1% in Italy and 36% in England) (<LINK REF="REF-EMCDDA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">EMCDDA 2012</LINK>). This further limits on the generalisability of the results.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:16:41 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only 7/21 (30%) studies have been judged as having low risk of selection bias; all other studies were judged as having unclear risk of selection bias because the information was not reported. All but three studies (86%) were double-blind. A total of 8/21 (38%) studies were judged as having high risk of attrition bias. All other studies performed the analysis on an intention-to-treat basis or reported no withdrawals from the study. Two studies were judged to be at high risk of selective reporting because they did not report results for dropout, and because they did not report raw data for craving or psychiatric outcomes but only stated that no differences were noted.</P>
<P>However, with subgroup analysis, as in the case of single classes of anticonvulsants, single types of medications and confounder/moderator evaluation, as well as with comparisons versus other medications, findings of the review were limited by the small number of studies included in the meta-analysis of study outcomes. Therefore the precision of the calculated effects is low. Finally, the great heterogeneity of the scales used in the primary studies and the way in which results were reported often made a cumulative analysis impossible.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:16:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found no unpublished studies despite efforts to contact all first authors of the included studies and to perform a search of conference proceedings. We did not use funnel plots to assess the possibility of publication bias because in this review, only small negative studies have been included, and in this situation, this method is not sensitive.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>Both preclinical and clinical studies have investigated the potential involvement of this class of medication in the treatment of substance use disorders; clinical trials specifically designed for evaluation of anticonvulsants and their efficacy and safety in cocaine dependence have been performed. Among the reviews published after our previous Cochrane review on the topic, two (<LINK REF="REF-Cohen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shinn-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinn 2010</LINK>) were exclusively interested in the efficacy of topiramate. They adopted a narrative approach and reported results of two clinical trials and one clinical trial, respectively. A third review (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez 2010</LINK>) was characterised by a meta-analytical approach (<LINK REF="REF-Alvarez-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alvarez 2010</LINK>). It included 15 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 1236 participants and evaluated seven anticonvulsant drugs. According to this review, treatments do not show improvement in subject retention compared with placebo, and the number of cocaine-positive urine samples was close to reaching statistical significance (95% CI 0.85 to 1.06) compared with placebo.</P>
<P>Our review, besides applying Cochrane methodology, includes 20 studies with 2068 participants, and it extends evaluations to a wider range of primary and secondary outcomes. On the whole, the results that we obtained show no evidence of differences between anticonvulsants and placebo. However, it has to be considered that anticonvulsants constitute a really heterogeneous group. Besides their anticonvulsant action, they have different pharmacological profiles and indications. This would suggest the need for a more detailed evaluation of singular medications. Unfortunately, for most outcomes, meta-analyses carried out on specific anticonvulsants included only one or two studies and few participants.</P>

<P>Although caution is needed when results from a limited number of clinical trials are assessed, at present no current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsants, as a category, in the treatment of cocaine dependence. In terms of specific medications, the insufficiency of evidence may leave to clinicians the alternative of balancing possible benefits against potential adverse effects of treatment.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-09 11:17:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To answer the urgent demand of clinicians, patients, families and the community as a whole for adequate treatment for cocaine dependence, we must improve primary research in the field of addiction to make the best possible use of a single study. Researchers must design larger randomised investigations to analyse relevant outcomes (dropout, use of cocaine measured as number of participants abstinent at the end of treatment). The fact that this review has found that the anticonvulsants investigated are not efficacious for cocaine dependence should not discourage researchers from carrying out new clinical trials on anticonvulsants with different pharmacological characteristics. Some of these studies are ongoing and will be added to this review as soon as their results become available. Besides increasing the numbers of trials and participants, these studies (five on topiramate, two on vigabatrin, two on tiagabine, one on levetiracetam), when available, will contribute to evaluation of the efficacy of specific medications.</P>

For a participant who completed the trial, his or her end-point would be from study week 8"</P>
