Symptoms and signs include local pain, itching, tenderness, reddening of the skin, and hardening of the surrounding tissue. There is some evidence to suggest a link between ST and venous thromboembolism (VTE; a condition where blood clots form (most often) in the deep veins of the leg and can travel in the circulation and lodge in the lungs). Treatment aims to relieve the local symptoms and to prevent the extension of the clot into a deep vein, ST recurrence, or the development of more serious events caused by VTE. This is the third update of a review first published in 2007. The evidence is current to March 2017.</P><P><B>Study characteristics and key results</B></P><P>This update included 33 randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 7296 participants. Treatments included rivaroxaban (a medicine called a direct oral inhibitor of activated factor X), injections of medicines under the skin to prevent blood clotting (e.g. fondaparinux, low molecular weight heparin, or unfractionated heparin), elastic compression stockings, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; a pain killer medicine), topical treatment (medicine applied to the skin), and surgery.</P><P>One large study, accounting for half of the participants included in the review, showed that treatment with fondaparinux for 45 days was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (where symptoms indicate there is a VTE), ST extension (where the clot moves further up the leg), and recurrence of ST (where clots return) compared to placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups. In one study in people with ST at high risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, fondaparinux was associated with a non-significant reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to rivaroxaban. There were no major bleeding events in either group. Both low molecular weight heparin and NSAIDs reduced the occurrence of extension or recurrence of ST with no effect on symptomatic VTE or major bleeding. Topical treatments relieved local symptoms but the trials did not report on progression to VTE. Surgical treatment and wearing elastic stockings were associated with a lower rate of VTE and progression of the ST compared with elastic stockings alone.</P><P><B>Quality of the evidence</B></P><P>Overall, the quality of evidence was very low for most treatments due to poor study design, imprecision of results, lack of a placebo (non-treated) group and only one study in some comparison. The quality of evidence was low to moderate for comparisons in two placebo-controlled trials.</P><P>In conclusion, fondaparinux appears to be an adequate treatment for most people with ST. The optimal dose and duration of treatment need to be established in people at high risk as well as people at low risk for recurrent thrombotic events. Further research is needed to assess the role of rivaroxaban and other such medicines, or thrombin, low molecular weight heparin or NSAIDs and to demonstrate the effectiveness, if any, of topical treatment, or surgery in terms of VTE<I>.</I></P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-02-15 09:29:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-24 12:58:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>The optimal treatment of superficial thrombophlebitis (ST) of the legs remains poorly defined.

Treatment included fondaparinux; rivaroxaban; low molecular weight heparin (LMWH); unfractionated heparin (UFH); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); compression stockings; and topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment to surgical interventions such as thrombectomy or ligation. Only a minority of trials compared treatment with placebo rather than an alternative treatment and many studies were small and of poor quality. Pooling of the data was possible for few outcomes, and none were part of a placebo-controlled trial. In one large, placebo-controlled RCT of 3002 participants, subcutaneous fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in symptomatic VTE (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.50; moderate-quality evidence), ST extension (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.22; moderate-quality evidence), and ST recurrence (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.54; moderate-quality evidence) relative to placebo. Major bleeding was infrequent in both groups with very wide CIs around risk estimate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.86; moderate-quality evidence). In one RCT on 472 high-risk participants with ST, fondaparinux was associated with a non-significant reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to rivaroxaban 10 mg (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.18; low-quality evidence). There were no major bleeding events in either group (low-quality evidence). In another placebo-controlled trial, both prophylactic and therapeutic doses of LMWH (prophylactic: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74; therapeutic: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.77) and NSAIDs (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.78) reduced the extension (low-quality evidence) and recurrence of ST (low-quality evidence) in comparison to placebo, with no significant effects on symptomatic VTE (low-quality evidence) or major bleeding (low-quality evidence). Overall, topical treatments improved local symptoms compared with placebo, but no data were provided on the effects on VTE and ST extension. Surgical treatment combined with elastic stockings was associated with a lower VTE rate and ST progression compared with elastic stockings alone. However, the majority of studies that compared different oral treatments, topical treatments, or surgery did not report VTE, ST progression, adverse events, or treatment adverse effects.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 10:02:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Prophylactic dose fondaparinux given for 45 days appears to be a valid therapeutic option for ST of the legs for most people. The evidence on topical treatment or surgery is too limited and does not inform clinical practice about the effects of these treatments in terms of VTE. Further research is needed to assess the role of rivaroxaban and other direct oral factor-X or thrombin inhibitors, LMWH, and NSAIDs; the optimal doses and duration of treatment in people at various risk of recurrence; and whether a combination therapy may be more effective than single treatment. Adequately designed and conducted studies are required to clarify the role of topical and surgical treatments.</P></ABS_CONCLUSIONS></ABSTRACT><BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-15 09:24:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-02-14 13:00:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-02-13 13:14:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>The term superficial thrombophlebitis (ST), also known as superficial venous thrombosis, refers to a pathological state characterised by an inflammatory-thrombotic process in a superficial vein. Distinctive clinical findings include pain and a reddened, warm, tender cord extending along the vein. The surrounding area may show signs of erythema (reddening of the skin) and oedema (swelling of the tissue). ST is a relatively common disease and, although its incidence has never been properly determined, it is estimated to be higher than that of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is about 1 per 1000 cases (<LINK REF="REF-De-Weese-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Weese 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nordstrom-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nordstrom 1992</LINK>). In one community-based study conducted in a population of 265,687 adults in France, the annual diagnosis rate of symptomatic, confirmed ST was 0.64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55% to 0.74%) (<LINK REF="REF-Frapp_x00e9_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frappé 2014</LINK>).</P><P>While the majority of ST occurs in varicose veins, additional predisposing risk factors similar to those for venous thromboembolism (VTE) include immobilisation, trauma, postoperative states, pregnancy, puerperium (the period immediately following childbirth), active malignancy, autoimmune diseases, use of oral contraceptive pills or hormonal replacement therapy, advanced age, obesity, and a history of previous VTE (<LINK REF="REF-Barrelier-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrelier 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Moerloose-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Moerloose 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lutter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samlaska-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samlaska 1990a</LINK>). Furthermore, the presence of inherited thrombophilia (a disorder where there is a tendency for thrombosis to occur, for example factor V Leiden, the prothrombin 20210A mutation, and deficiencies of the natural anticoagulant proteins C and S) in ST suggests a similar pathophysiology as VTE (<LINK REF="REF-de-Moerloose-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Moerloose 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martinelli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinelli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samlaska-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samlaska 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Samlaska-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samlaska 1990b</LINK>). Traditionally, ST has been considered a relatively benign disease, but several studies have described an association between ST and VTE (<LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bounameaux-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bounameaux 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krunes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krunes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lutter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quenet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenet 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verlato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlato 1999</LINK>). In people with a diagnosis of ST, 6% to 44% have an associated (or develop) DVT, 20% to 33% have asymptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), and 2% to 13% have symptomatic PE (<LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bounameaux-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bounameaux 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frapp_x00e9_-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frappé 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krunes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krunes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lutter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Plate-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Plate 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quenet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenet 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skillman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skillman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verlato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlato 1999</LINK>). ST located in the saphenous main trunk seems to have the strongest association with VTE (<LINK REF="REF-Bergqvist-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergqvist 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blumenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lutter-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lutter 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Quenet-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quenet 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unno-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unno 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verlato-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verlato 1999</LINK>). The variations in estimates reported in the literature are probably due to the retrospective design of most studies, the small number of participants included, and the fact that ST was often diagnosed in vascular laboratories where people were referred for suspected DVT. In one cross-sectional and prospective epidemiological cohort study, ST at diagnosis was associated with VTE in 25% of the cases (<LINK REF="REF-Decousus-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decousus 2010a</LINK>). During a three-month follow-up, 10% of people with ST developed thromboembolic complications despite 90% having received anticoagulant drugs, and about 98% had used elastic compression stockings. In one nationwide population-based cohort study of 10,973 people with a first diagnosis of ST, the incidence of VTE in the first three months after ST diagnosis was 3.4%, which was estimated to be over 70 times higher compared to the general population without ST (<LINK REF="REF-Cannegieter-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannegieter 2015</LINK>).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-02-14 13:00:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of ST in clinical practice as suggested by a survey in 2011 among practitioners mostly from North America showing a large variability in the management of ST (<LINK REF="REF-Dua-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dua 2014</LINK>). Several therapies have been proposed in the literature, including surgery (ligation or stripping of the affected veins), elastic stockings, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that aim to reduce pain and inflammation, and several anticoagulant agents. It is unclear whether different locations of ST may influence the choice of treatment. The thrombus location in trunks of either the great saphenous vein (saphena magna) or small saphenous vein (saphena parva) may have the highest risk of extension into the deep vein system and thus could require an aggressive form of treatment, whereas other locations may be associated with a lower risk of extension and thus may warrant a less aggressive approach. Validated risk stratification tools based on ST location and patient characteristics are currently unavailable.</P></INTERVENTION><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-02-13 11:16:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>While the estimates of VTE prevalence in people with ST vary, management of ST should consider the prevention of this scaring complication beyond the mere resolution of local symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Cannegieter-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannegieter 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Decousus-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Decousus 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wichers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wichers 2005</LINK>). Conservative management, mainly focusing on the painful symptoms of disease, might therefore be insufficient.

We resolved disagreements by consensus.</P><P>Two components of randomisation were assessed: generation of allocation sequences and concealment of allocation. Generation of allocation sequences was considered adequate if it resulted in an unpredictable allocation schedule. Mechanisms considered adequate included random-number tables, computer-generated random numbers, minimisation, coin tossing, shuffling cards, and drawing lots. Trials using an unpredictable allocation sequence were considered randomised. Trials using potentially predictable allocation mechanisms, such as alternation or the allocation of participants according to date of birth, were considered quasi-randomised.</P><P>Concealment of allocation was considered adequate if participants and investigators responsible for participants selection were unable to predict, before allocation, which treatment was next. Methods considered adequate included central randomisation; pharmacy-controlled randomisation using identical prenumbered containers; and sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.</P><P>Blinding of participants and therapists was considered adequate if experimental and control preparations were explicitly described as indistinguishable or if a double-dummy technique was used. Assessors were considered blinded if this was explicitly mentioned by the investigators.</P><P>Analyses were considered adequate if all randomised participants were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The item 'free of selective reporting' was classified as at 'low risk of bias' if we had both the protocol and the full report of a given study, where the full report presented results for all outcomes listed in the protocol. We classified a study as at 'high risk of bias' if a report did not present data on all outcomes reported in either the protocol or the methods section. The risk of bias item 'free of other bias' was not considered in this review.

I<SUP>2</SUP> values of 25%, 50%, and 75% may be interpreted as low, moderate, and high between-trial heterogeneity, although the interpretation of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic depends on the size and number of trials included (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00fc_cker-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rücker 2008</LINK>). In the presence of no or low heterogeneity, we planned to use the fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel method) and the random-effects model to pool and analyse summary effect sizes. Where possible, we presented results as summary risk ratios (RR) or hazard ratios (HRs) for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MD) for all continuous variables. We determined the 95% CI for each estimate. The unit of analysis was the number of participants with the outcome of interest. Where possible, we analysed the results by ITT, including every individual in the randomly assigned treatment group regardless of whether they completed the treatment or withdrew from the trial.</P><P>We planned to evaluate publication bias and other biases related to small study size using funnel plots, plotting effect sizes on the vertical axis against their standard errors on the horizontal axis.

The therapeutic approach for ST should aim at the resolution or improvement of the local symptoms but also, and even more importantly, at preventing the possible extension of the superficial vein thrombosis into the deep venous system (<LINK REF="REF-Wichers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wichers 2005</LINK>).</P><P>This review summarised data from 7296 people with ST of the legs. About half of the participants were included in the CALISTO study, which compared 45 days of fondaparinux versus placebo using a double-blind method (<LINK REF="STD-Decousus-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Decousus 2010b</LINK>). Fondaparinux reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE by 85%, ST extension by 92%, and the recurrence of ST by 79%. A total of 88 participants would need to be treated with fondaparinux to prevent one PE or DVT. These benefits were achieved without apparently increasing the risk of bleeding and they were maintained at one-month follow-up after discontinuation of treatment. However, CIs around bleeding estimate were broad and did not exclude a significantly higher risk with the drug. In the SURPRISE study, people with ST and one or more risk factors for thromboembolic complications were randomised to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban 10 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer_x002d_Westendorf-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer-Westendorf 2017</LINK>). The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as effective as fondaparinux; however, the study was not powered to prove non-inferiority. In addition, the authors observed a non-statistically significant increase of the primary composite outcome as well as of clinically relevant non-major bleedings in the rivaroxaban group which require further evaluation in appropriately sized studies. In contrast to the CALISTO study, the risk of thromboembolic events seemed to increase after treatment withdrawal at 45 days suggesting that a longer treatment may be required for people at high risk.</P><P>Compared with placebo or topical treatments, both NSAIDs and LMWH could help preventing ST extension while effectively controlling local symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Stenox-Group-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stenox Group 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Titon-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Titon 1994</LINK>). When compared with each other, LMWH and NSAIDs seemed to be associated with a similar reduction in the incidence of VTE and worsening of ST. However, these conclusions need to be taken cautiously due to the methodological drawbacks, the low incidence of VTE, and the sample size of the available studies, which did not have enough power for a direct comparison between LMWH and NSAIDs. Thus, these data remain preliminary and further research is required to determine which treatment works better in terms of VTE prevention, and whether a combination may be more effective. Moreover, the benefits of LMWH and NSAIDs should be balanced against the associated adverse effects such as bleeding and gastric complications. None of the studies reported major bleeding episodes in participants randomised to LMWH. NSAIDs increased the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared with placebo. To date, no study has evaluated NSAIDs versus surgery whereas one trial directly compared LMWH with surgical treatment, showing a comparable efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="STD-Lozano-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lozano 2003</LINK>). Despite the methodological limitations of this study, the results would suggest that a medical approach with LMWH would be as effective and safe as an invasive surgical treatment.</P><P><LINK REF="STD-Cosmi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cosmi 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Vesalio-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vesalio Group 2005</LINK> compared different regimens of LMWH head-to-head. While symptomatic VTE occurred at a similar rate with prophylactic and higher (intermediate or therapeutic) dose LMWH, the higher-dose LMWH seemed to be associated with a significant 70% reduction in ST progression (<LINK REF="STD-Cosmi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cosmi 2012</LINK>). Furthermore, the findings of <LINK REF="STD-Cosmi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cosmi 2012</LINK> suggested that treatment with LMWH should be prolonged for at least 30 days to reduce the incidence of symptomatic VTE, compared to shorter usage of LMWH. However, it should be noted that neither <LINK REF="STD-Cosmi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cosmi 2012</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Vesalio-Group-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Vesalio Group 2005</LINK> had a placebo or inactive control group and <LINK REF="STD-Cosmi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Cosmi 2012</LINK> was prematurely interrupted, which may have led to an overestimation of the differences between the groups.</P><P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Boehler-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Boehler 2014</LINK>, the addition of compression stockings to prophylactic dose LMWH seemed to carry no additional benefit in terms of clinical improvement.</P><P>Preliminary data suggested that high-dose UFH can be effective in the treatment of ST although this needs to be confirmed in larger studies (<LINK REF="STD-Marchiori-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Marchiori 2002</LINK>).

In addition, the methodological quality of these studies was often poor, with major study design flaws such as an unclear method of allocation or randomisation, the lack of a placebo as control group, or an unacceptably high dropout rate. All these limitations weaken the clinical applicability of the results and cast doubt about the actual efficacy and safety of these treatments.</P><SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 13:36:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Fondaparinux was associated with a significant lower incidence of VTE, ST extension, or ST recurrence relative to placebo with similar risk of bleeding.

The methodological quality of the included studies varied from low to high (see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Poor reporting did not allow proper scoring of relevant study design features, such as sequence generation and allocation concealment, in the majority of included studies. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low for most intervention outcomes due to limitations in study design, imprecision of results and single study comparisons. The quality of evidence was low to moderate for outcomes in the two placebo-controlled studies included in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Decousus-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Decousus 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenox-Group-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Stenox Group 2003</LINK>).

The 'no difference' findings on a specific outcome may thus be the result of insufficient power of the analysis to show a difference between treatment groups as well as the absence of a true effect. For similar reasons, it was not possible to conduct subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy outcomes to evaluate the interaction of trial characteristics with treatment effects.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-02-13 11:06:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Since our previous systematic review on the prevention of VTE in people with ST of the leg (<LINK REF="REF-Wichers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wichers 2005</LINK>), the results of two large RCTs on the efficacy of fondaparinux for the treatment of ST have become available (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer_x002d_Westendorf-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer-Westendorf 2017</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Decousus-2010b" TYPE="STUDY">Decousus 2010b</LINK>).

Fondaparinux should be given at a dose of 2.5 mg subcutaneously once daily for 45 days. Final recommendations cannot be drawn for rivaroxaban, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), unfractionated heparin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Data are still too preliminary to draw firm conclusions on the role of surgery and the topical, oral, and parenteral treatments evaluated this far.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-02-12 13:42:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>Several questions about the treatment of ST remain unsolved. The role of rivaroxaban and other oral direct factor Xa inhibitors for the management of ST requires further evaluation. As suggested by the results of the SURPRISE study, the efficacy of anticoagulant treatment may vary according to the presence of underlying risk factors for recurrent thromboembolic events (<LINK REF="STD-Beyer_x002d_Westendorf-2017" TYPE="STUDY">Beyer-Westendorf 2017</LINK>). Individuals at increased risk could benefit of higher intensity or longer anticoagulant treatment. The usefulness, potential healthcare benefits and cost-savings of risk stratification tools needs to be evaluated. Additional studies should assess the costs, effects on quality of life, and the cost-effectiveness of fondaparinux (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 2010</LINK>). Large and adequately designed randomised controlled trials would be required to assess the actual role of NSAIDs and LMWH, and how these drugs compare with fondaparinux. Whether topical treatment might add some benefit if given in combination with fondaparinux remains unclear.</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-02-12 13:43:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><P>We would like to thank the external peer referee Dr Benilde Cosmi for her comments and Mrs Carole Gibson for acting as the consumer on this review.

This type of analysis is recommended in the Cochrane manual, but I am sure there must be a better way. See "Comparison 23. Exhirud ointment versus placebo". This has one study. One outcome "efficacy" was split into 4 categories, and there were thus 4 analyses for 'excellent/good/some/no efficacy'.

However, it does not seem that the reason for misconduct would influence the quality of the data which, in any case, the GMC report suggested not to be falsified. Therefore we do not think that this misconduct should be explicitly mentioned in the text. Moreover, the data from the studies of Belcaro do not affect the main conclusions of the review.

The results of this large and methodologically robust RCT provide good answers to some of the reviewer's concerns.</P></FEEDBACK_REPLY><FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS MODIFIED="2013-02-05 11:03:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Marlene Stewart"><P>Feedback: Michelle Co, BScPharm; Hayley Coe, BScPharm; Sarah West, BSc, BScPharm; Aaron Tejani BScPharm, PharmD</P><P>Reply: Marcello Di Nisio, Iris M Wichers, Saskia Middeldorp<BR/></P></FEEDBACK_CONTRIBUTORS></FEEDBACK_ITEM></FEEDBACK><APPENDICES MODIFIED="2018-02-14 14:14:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><APPENDIX ID="APP-01" MODIFIED="2018-02-13 10:59:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson" NO="1"><TITLE MODIFIED="2017-01-10 12:24:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">CENTRAL search strategy</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2018-02-13 10:59:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson"><TABLE COLS="3" ROWS="11"><TR><TD COLSPAN="2"><P>Search run on Thur 9 Mar 2017</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>Hits</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#1</P></TD><TD><P>MESH DESCRIPTOR Thrombophlebitis EXPLODE ALL TREES</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>1046</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#2</P></TD><TD><P>MESH DESCRIPTOR Phlebitis</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>145</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#3</P></TD><TD><P>MESH DESCRIPTOR Venous Thrombosis EXPLODE ALL TREES WITH QUALIFIERS CO</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>197</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#4</P></TD><TD><P>(superficial near thrombo*):TI,AB,KY</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>152</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#5</P></TD><TD><P>(superficial near phleb*):TI,AB,KY</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>33</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#6</P></TD><TD><P>SVT:TI,AB,KY</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>175</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#7</P></TD><TD><P>*phleb*:TI,AB,KY</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>3102</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#8</P></TD><TD><P>#1 OR #2 OR #3 OR #4 OR #5 OR #6 OR #7</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>3452</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#9</P></TD><TD><P>* NOT SR-PVD:CC AND 12/12/2012 TO 28/02/2017:DL</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>349958</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>#10</P></TD><TD><P>#8 AND #9</P></TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><P>707</P></TD></TR></TABLE></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX><APPENDIX ID="APP-02" MODIFIED="2018-02-14 14:14:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" NO="2"><TITLE MODIFIED="2018-02-14 14:14:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Trials registries searches</TITLE><APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-15 08:34:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch"><P>ClinicalTrials.gov</P><P>30 studies found for: thrombophlebitis </P><P>World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</P><P>136 records for 69 trials found for: thrombophlebitis AND leg</P><P>ISRCTN Register</P><P>30 results thrombophlebitis </P></APPENDIX_BODY></APPENDIX></APPENDICES><EXTENSIONS><EXTENSION ID="FLOW_1" NAME="FIGURE" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="FLOWCHART"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="1"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;33 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis)&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="143"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;33 studies included in qualitative synthesis&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="143"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;30 studies included in previous version of the review&lt;/p&gt;"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;3 NEW studies (4 reports) included&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="158"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;18 full-text reports assessed for eligibility&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="153"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;836 reports after duplicates removed screened by CIS&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="154"><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;707 additional reports identified from CENTRAL reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;196 reports identified from trials registries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="120"/><FLOWCHARTBOX TEXT="&lt;p&gt;18 reports identified from the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="135"/><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;818 reports assessed as irrelevant to this review&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="187"/></FLOWCHARTBOX><OUT TEXT="&lt;p&gt;2 additional studies excluded with reasons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 citations added to previously included studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 reports added to awaiting classification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 study excluded that had been in 'awaiting classification' in previous version of the review&lt;/p&gt;" WIDTH="184"/></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></FLOWCHARTBOX></ALIAS></EXTENSION><EXTENSION ID="AFF_17123_1" NAME="PERSON" REVMAN_VERSION="5.1.0" TYPE="ADDRESS"><ALIAS ALIAS_ID="17123"><ADDRESS><DEPARTMENT>Department of Vascular Medicine</DEPARTMENT><ORGANISATION>Academic Medical Center</ORGANISATION><CITY>Amsterdam</CITY><COUNTRY CODE="NL">Netherlands</COUNTRY></ADDRESS></ALIAS></EXTENSION></EXTENSIONS></COCHRANE_REVIEW>
