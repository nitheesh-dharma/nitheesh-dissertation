<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-29 11:39:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The brain is situated in a rigid box (the skull) that cannot expand, so normal swelling from injury cannot occur. When brain swelling does occur, pressure inside the skull rises. This makes it harder for the heart to pump the oxygen-rich blood into the brain needed for recovery. If treating physicians cannot control swelling, the lack of blood supply to the swollen brain can cause further brain damage. Efforts to avoid this damage can include regular monitoring of the pressure inside the skull (intracranial). There are different ways to monitor pressure. One commonly used method is to insert a small probe into the skull. But whenever something is put into the skull, there is a chance it may cause bleeding or an infection.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>

<P>The evidence in this review was up to date as of May 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The one randomised controlled trial (RCT) identified included 324 participants, all of whom had sustained severe traumatic brain injury and were receiving care in intensive care units in South America. People in one group had a pressure monitoring device inserted into their skull. People in the control group did not receive the device. All participants had regular monitoring of pressure in the skull through observation by the treating doctors and nurses, and X-rays.</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>We did not identify any (statistically significant) differences between the two groups at six months in relation to death or survival with severe disability. There were no important complications of ICP monitoring.</P>

<B>Future research</B>
</P>
<P>More research is needed into how routine monitoring of intracranial pressure can inform clinical care.</P>

<P>We know that the brain damage resulting from traumatic and other insults is not due solely to the direct consequences of the primary injury. A significant and potentially preventable contribution to the overall morbidity arises from secondary hypoxic-ischaemic damage. Brain swelling accompanied by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) prevents adequate cerebral perfusion with well-oxygenated blood.</P>
<P>Detection of raised ICP could be useful in alerting clinicians to the need to improve cerebral perfusion, with consequent reductions in brain injury.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-09-25 14:14:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL Plus, ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED &amp; CPCI-S), clinical trials registries and reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 22 May 2015.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-02-05 12:23:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised controlled studies of real-time ICP monitoring by invasive or semi-invasive means in acute coma (traumatic or non-traumatic aetiology) versus clinical care without ICP monitoring (that is, guided only by clinical or radiological inference of the presence of raised ICP).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-10-16 17:18:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors (ET and RF) worked independently to identify the one study that met inclusion criteria. JR and RF independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information, including details of methods and outcome data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-15 18:24:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One randomized controlled trial (RCT) meeting the selection criteria has been identified to date.</P>
<P>The included study had 324 participants. We judged risk of bias to be low for all categories except blinding of participants and personnel, which is not feasible for this intervention. There were few missing data, and we analysed all on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
<P>Participants could be 13 years of age or older (mean age of sample 29; range 22 to 44), and all had severe traumatic brain injury, mostly due to traffic incidents. All were receiving care within intensive care units (ICUs) at one of six hospitals in either Bolivia or Ecuador. Investigators followed up 92% of participants for six months or until death. The trial excluded patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) equal to three and fixed dilated pupils on admission on the basis that they had sustained brain injury of an unsalvageable severity.</P>
<P>The study compared people managed using either an intracranial monitor or non-invasive monitoring (imaging and clinical examination) to identify potentially harmful raised intracranial pressure. Both study groups used imaging and clinical examination measures.</P>
<P>Mortality at six months was 56/144 (39%) in the ICP-monitored group and 67/153 (44%) in the non-invasive group.</P>
<P>Unfavourable outcome (defined as death or moderate to severe disability at six months) as assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) was 80/144 (56%) in the ICP-monitored group and 93/153 (61%) in the non-invasive group.</P>
<P>Six percent of participants in the ICP monitoring group had complications related to the monitoring, none of which met criteria for being a serious adverse event. There were no complications relating to the non-invasive group.</P>
<P>Other complications and adverse events were comparable between treatment groups, 70/157 (45%) in the ICP-monitored group and 76/167 (46%) in the non-invasive group.</P>
<P>Late mortality in both the monitored and non-invasive groups was high, with 35% of deaths occurring &gt; 14 days after injury. The authors comment that this high late mortality may reflect inadequacies in post-ICU services for disabled survivors requiring specialist rehabilitation care.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-29 11:38:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data from the single RCT studying the role of routine ICP monitoring in acute traumatic coma fails to provide evidence to support the intervention.</P>
<P>Research in this area is complicated by the fact that RCTs necessarily assess the combined impact of measurement of ICP with the clinical management decisions made in light of this data. Future studies will need to assess the added value of ICP data alongside other information from the multimodal monitoring typically performed in intensive care unit settings. Additionally, even within traumatically acquired brain injury (TBI), there is great heterogeneity in mechanisms, distribution, location and magnitude of injury, and studies within more homogeneous subgroups are likely to be more informative.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2015-10-29 11:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-14 16:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-24 12:41:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies in traumatic brain injury (TBI) first led to the insight that the damage and disability seen was not due solely to the direct consequences of the primary injury. Postmortem pathological data suggested that some additional brain damage occurred as a result of further hypoxic-ischaemic damage. This raised the important possibility that inadequate cerebral blood supply in the early postinjury phase added to overall morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1989</LINK>). Given that this process occurs when the patient is in hospital, the damage was potentially amenable to remediation.</P>
<P>The brain's blood supply (cerebral perfusion) is dependent on the difference between the arterial blood pressure driving blood into the brain and the pressure of brain tissue within the skull (intracranial pressure, or ICP). The higher the ICP, the harder it is for the heart to drive blood into the brain, as it is enclosed in a rigid box (the skull). Thus detection and treatment of raised ICP can in certain circumstances lead to improved brain perfusion and a reduced risk of additional ischaemic brain damage.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-14 12:33:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physicians typically monitor ICP continuously by using a pressure transducer, placed into either the subdural or subarachnoid space, the brain parenchyma itself or a cerebral ventricle via catheter. Although placement of the latter is more invasive, it allows the additional possibility of draining cerebrospinal fluid as a therapeutic response to raised ICP. However, subdural/subarachnoid placement of pressure transducers is technically simpler and more favoured among clinicians.</P>
<P>Data from an ICP monitor are typically displayed in real time in an ICU setting, and values over agreed thresholds may trigger specific medical or neurosurgical interventions. Some authors have additionally advocated the recording of ICP continuously to allow the estimation of a cumulative 'burden' of raised ICP and impaired cerebral perfusion over time.</P>
<P>Researchers and clinicians have proposed several non-invasive techniques for estimating intracranial pressure over the years, including 'fontanometry' in infants with a patent anterior fontanelle, and measurements of intraocular and middle ear pressure in older children and adults. These techniques remain experimental, and this review confines itself to studies measuring ICP directly.</P>
<P>A number of early non-randomised studies suggested that prompt resuscitation and painstaking management of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in an intensive care unit (ICU) could reduce mortality and morbidity after traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>). Whilst investigators initially emphasised elevations of ICP per se, attention has more recently switched to maintenance of the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), calculated as the difference between the mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) and ICP (<LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosner 1990</LINK>). From this perspective, maintenance of adequate MAP may be useful in addition to interventions aimed at lowering ICP.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-10-14 16:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Potential benefits of having accurate real-time ICP data in the management of coma might include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>improved detection of rising ICP, provided that monitoring can detect raised ICP more effectively than bedside assessment based on clinical or radiological data (this might be particularly pertinent in units where patients are electively paralysed as part of neurointensive care, as this masks some clinical indicators of rising ICP);</LI>
<LI>knowledge on the degree to which ICP is elevated, which can inform the selection of the best treatment options (in terms of aggressiveness) according to the severity of the situation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Despite the development of relatively less invasive techniques for the measurement of ICP, potential hazards (including infection and haemorrhage) still remain associated with the placement of monitoring probes (<LINK REF="REF-Chambers-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chambers 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mayall-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayall 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Narayan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narayan 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paramore-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paramore 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Benefit will only ensue from ICP monitoring if effective clinical responses exist, and these will depend on the mechanism of the raised ICP. Increases in ICP due to focal (localised) space-occupying collections are more probable in the context of traumatic, rather than non-traumatic coma, and these are potentially amenable to surgical evacuation. On the other hand, non-traumatic causes of coma include brain infections (such as bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis or cerebral malaria), metabolic disturbances (such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hepatic encephalopathy and poisoning) and other medical conditions (such as preeclampsia), and in these situations physicians may have fewer effective options for addressing raised ICP. Therefore, it is necessary to separately analyse the benefits of monitoring ICP according to traumatic and non-traumatic causes of coma.</P>
<P>The risk&#8722;benefit ratio of ICP monitoring may also depend on coma severity, as typically measured by the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), with benefit increasing with severity (<LINK REF="REF-Jennett-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jennett 1975</LINK>). As with several other aspects of 'routine' neurointensive care of patients after acute brain injury, there is a wide variation in the use of ICP monitoring in routine clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Morris-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 2006</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-25 16:46:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from non-randomised controlled trials supporting routine ICP monitoring have led to recommendations that it be included in published guidelines, such as <LINK REF="REF-BTF-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTF 2007</LINK>, for the routine management of severe traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Becker-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>). In this regard, it is important to remember that ICP measurement is not an end in itself, but a tool to guide treatment of raised ICP and maintain cerebral perfusion. Any randomised controlled trial in this area will of necessity comprise both an approach to detecting raised ICP (i.e. invasive real-time monitoring versus clinical assessment) and one or more approaches to treating it (i.e. a protocol for clinical intervention based on the measured or clinically inferred presence and degree of raised ICP), and it may be difficult to separate the effects of ICP measurement from the effects of its treatment.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2010. The present version includes data from the first study identified that meets inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> is a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Investigators employed stratified sequence generation, allocating participants according to centre, severity of injury and age.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> took place in intensive care units (ICUs) at six South American hospitals (four in Bolivia and two in Ecuador).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Trialists randomised all participants either within 24 hours of injury (for patients with GCS &lt; 8 on admission) or within 24 hours of deterioration (for patients deteriorating to GCS &lt; 8 within 48 hours of injury). Median GCS motor score at randomisation was 4.0. Forty-nine per cent of participants had localised brain injuries, and none were capable of following commands. Road traffic accidents involving cars or motorcycles were responsible for 51% of the injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK>, supplemental file table S6). Fewer than half of all participants were transported to the first admitting hospital by ambulance. Most were transferred to study hospitals from another admitting hospital.

<P>
<B>Intervention: </B>"Patients&#8230;assigned to the pressure monitoring group had an intraparenchymal monitor placed as soon as possible and were treated to maintain an intracranial pressure of less than 20 mmHg . . . Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid required ventriculostomy placement" (<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK>).

<B>Control:</B> standard care, defined as care "in accordance with a protocol based on the pretrial standard for care at the three original participating hospitals"<I>. </I>The supplemental data file in the online version of <LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> contains a detailed description of this protocol.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary, prespecified outcome for the included study was a composite measure of survival time, impaired consciousness and functional status at three and six months as well as neuropsychological status at six months (Carney 2012). A blinded outcomes assessor determined neuropsychological status. This composite measure was based on performance across 21 measures of functional and cognitive status and calculated as a percentile (with 0 indicating the worst performance, and 100 the best performance). This composite score incorporates GOS-E outcomes, which are reported separately in the supplemental data.</P>

<P>Since the last update of this review, one trial meeting inclusion criteria has been published (<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK>). It is a randomised controlled trial comparing an ICP treatment strategy guided by continuously monitored ICP data versus care based on clinico-radiological assessment of the presence of raised ICP. There was no evidence of difference in outcome between the two strategies.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-28 16:54:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The one included study did not find any differences between the two groups in the primary outcome measures, mortality or severe disability. There is evidence that in the non-invasive group (reliant on imaging and clinical examination), physicians tended to take more aggressive measures to treat suspected raised ICP. Since there are known and potential adverse consequences for some of these treatments (for example, excessive hyperventilation to reduce ICP by vasoconstriction can cause further cerebral ischaemia), the data suggest that accurate ICP data may allow more appropriate tailoring of treatments for raised ICP to the severity of an individual case.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-25 17:55:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trials related to ICP monitoring inevitably reflect the combined effects of both detecting and quantifying elevated ICP, on the one hand, and treating it through one or more approaches, on the other. There are also several proposed ways to analyse and interpret real-time ICP data (<LINK REF="STD-Eide-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Eide 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robertson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Robertson 1999</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> took place in South America, and its authors raised the possibility that limited pre-hospital services may have affected the data in ways that limit the generalisability of the findings to other countries (i.e. with more developed rapid response and pre-hospital services). They further point out that suboptimal pre-hospital care may have reduced the potential for optimal ICU care to confer benefit, although they maintain that overall mortality postadmission to ICU was comparable to that of other published studies.</P>
<P>A more important consideration may be the high rate of late mortality (&gt; 14 days postinjury), which likely reflects deficiencies of post-ICU, specialist care for severely disabled survivors in the early stages of rehabilitation after injury. However, a post hoc analysis of mortality at 14 days showed no significant difference between groups.</P>

<P>In a recent meta-analysis of the role of ICP monitoring in traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2014</LINK>), the authors aggregate the results of six non-randomised cohort studies excluded from this review, together with <LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kostic-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Kostic 2011</LINK>.

<P>The role of routine intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in the management of acute encephalopathy remains controversial, and there is wide variability in current clinical practice. Data from a single, large, well-conducted RCT failed to provide evidence to inform clinical practice at this stage. The findings of observational studies demonstrating associations between ICP monitoring and improved survival should be interpreted with caution due to their non-randomised nature (<LINK REF="STD-Shafi-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Shafi 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bennett-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Bennett 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Farahvar-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Farahvar 2012</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-14 16:32:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For many years, commentators expressed pessimism that a formal randomised study would assess the use of routine ICP monitoring in the foreseeable future. The main grounds for this pessimism were the cost and logistics of undertaking a study of the requisite size as well as the opinion that the role of ICP monitoring was widely established and that evaluation of other newer interventions was now a priority. Disappointing subsequent experience with trials of novel neuroprotective strategies suggested that the effects of between-centre variation in 'conventional' management may have effects on patients' outcomes which are of a comparable magnitude to these novel approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Clifton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clifton 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reinert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinert 1999</LINK>). Suggestions of large effect sizes in non-randomised studies, such as in <LINK REF="STD-Lane-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lane 2000</LINK>, and indications that indiscriminate use of ICP monitoring might prolong ICU stay without improving outcome, as <LINK REF="STD-Cremer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cremer 2005</LINK> reported, restored some equipoise, enabling the important contribution to the literature that <LINK REF="STD-Chesnut-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Chesnut 2012</LINK> provides.</P>
<P>Trials related to ICP monitoring inevitably reflect the combined effects of both detecting and quantifying elevated ICP, on the one hand, and treating it through one or more approaches, on the other.

<P>Future work needs to acknowledge the very marked heterogeneity of pathologies even among people with traumatic brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Saatman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saatman 2008</LINK>). Indications for ICP monitoring vary between subgroups (<LINK REF="REF-Stocchetti-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stocchetti 2014</LINK>), and researchers should consider studies within clinico-radiologically defined subgroups.</P>

<P>This version (October 2015) of the review incorporates changes to bring it up to the standards of <I>The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>, including revised Methods that utilise the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. In January 2015, Joseph Raper joined the author team. In the methods section, instead of mapping results to the GOS, we chose to report them as the original investigators did, using the GOS-E. Although the scales are similar, they are not the same, and specifically the GOS outcomes of 'severe disability' and 'persistent vegetative state' do not exist in the GOS-E.</P>
<P>Review authors' note, August 2015: In future versions of this review, in order for a study to be eligible for inclusion in the review, it must have adequate allocation concealment and have pre-specified measurement time points, or sufficient data to enable time-to-event analysis.</P>

<P>Review authors' note, October 2015: In future versions of this review, we will calculate the risk ratio (rather than the odds ratio which was pre-specified in the original protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Forsyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forsyth 2000</LINK>)).</P>
