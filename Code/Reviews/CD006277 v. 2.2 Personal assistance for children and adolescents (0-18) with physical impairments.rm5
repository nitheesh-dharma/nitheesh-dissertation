<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Personal assistance is here defined as paid support of at least 20 hours per week for people with impairments. This review investigated the effectiveness of personal assistance versus any other form of care for children and adolescents with physical impairments. A literature search identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria. This review is part of a series of reviews; evidence from related reviews about different populations might be informative to researchers and practitioners.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>There is a high and increasing prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance in the form of individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents with physical impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Children and adolescents with physical impairments (0-18 years) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. 130 full papers were examined. None met the inclusion criteria.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No eligible studies were found.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Research in this field is limited. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition of impairments</HEADING>
<P>The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to <I>impairment</I> as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular <I>activities</I> as a result of impairments, and a person's <I>participation</I> in education, social life and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms <I>disability</I> or <I>handicap</I>.</P>
<P>This review includes children and adolescents with physical impairments. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently, and interventions to improve participation differ according to user needs. Furthermore, impairments affect people differently over the course of their lives.This is part of a series of reviews conducted with the Cochrane and Campbell collaborations; young people with intellectual impairments or both physical impairments and intellectual impairments are considered separately, as are adults and the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2008b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mayo_x002d_Wilson-2008c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayo-Wilson 2008c</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prevalence of impairments</HEADING>
<P>Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (<LINK REF="REF-UN-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 1990</LINK>) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates.</P>
<P>A recent American survey (N=13,792) found that 7.3% of people under 18 years old have impairments that restrict their participation in age-appropriate activities (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-UN-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impacts</HEADING>
<P>Proponents of the <I>social model of disability </I>regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (<LINK REF="REF-Abberley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abberley 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1990</LINK>). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g. making buildings accessible), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem.</P>
<P>Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with physical impairments when physical, social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Hammal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammal 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Mihaylov-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mihaylov 2004</LINK>). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (<LINK REF="REF-Lavigne-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lavigne 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Neely_x002d_Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely-Barnes 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Pit_x002d_Ten-Cate-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pit-Ten Cate 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Varni-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varni 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Children with impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (<LINK REF="REF-Witt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2001</LINK>). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (<LINK REF="REF-Rossiter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossiter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharpe-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharpe 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thyen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thyen 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments and costs are positively related to severity of impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Newacheck-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newacheck 2004</LINK>). Caring for a child with impairments may cause family members (notably mothers) to withdraw from work and social life and put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (<LINK REF="REF-Neely_x002d_Barnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neely-Barnes 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Witt-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Witt 2001</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-05-15 03:35:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, mental and physical health of children and adolescents.</P>
<P>There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with physical impairments. For example, building regulations and school schedules may be designed such that some children and adolescents with impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (<LINK REF="REF-Colver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colver 2005</LINK>). However, such broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Assistive devices, physical therapy, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities.</P>
<P>Personal assistance is paid support given to children and adolescents with impairments in various settings to enable them to participate in mainstream activities. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments and differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time in that it is indefinite and ongoing.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-05-16 10:35:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, the U.S. and Canada. The naming of personal assistance may vary from country to country, which is often related to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. For example, personal assistance may be provided through agencies or through individual budgets.</P>
<P>Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. High staff turnover rates, low wages, and lack of training are potential problems (<LINK REF="REF-Keigher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keigher 2000</LINK>). Having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users' need for privacy, or with parents' own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children.</P>
<P>Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, other recipients may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments may prefer other services. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-05-15 04:08:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been non-systematic reviews of studies of personal assistance services for people with different types of impairments, for example spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="REF-Hagglund-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hagglund 2004</LINK>). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (<LINK REF="REF-Socialstyrelsen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Socialstyrelsen 2005</LINK>).</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with physical impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to 'no-intervention' (which may include unpaid family care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and to participate in normal activities due to permanent physical impairments. </P>
<P>With the exception of young people living in student accommodation (e.g. residential schools), young people living in institutions for people with impairments were excluded.</P>
<P>Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments were excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>In consultation with experts and the reference group (see Acknowledgements), the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. Twenty hours of assistance is the minimum required to qualify a person for personal assistance in several countries with national schemes.</P>
<P>This review defines personal assistance as individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week, which is provided for an indefinite period of time (i.e., <I>not</I> rehabilitation or respite care).<BR/> <BR/>Comparisons could have included, either singly or in combination, informal care (which might be delivered by parents or other family members), institutionalisation, service housing (cluster housing), on-demand services, night patrols, transportation services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. 'No-treatment' and 'waiting list' groups were eligible even if other services received were not described. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) were included. These were treated as separate comparisons.</P>

<P>Databases were searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches were limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believed it was unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980.</P>
<P>No language restrictions were imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases were searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) were searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases were searched in appropriate languages.</P>
<P>No filters based on methodology were applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies.</P>
<P>The authors worked with the reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (<LINK REF="REF-Jackson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 2005</LINK>) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that was likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers).</P>

<P>No eligible studies were found.</P>
<P>After removing duplicates electronically, 58,431citations were retrieved for this and related reviews. Based on their titles or abstracts, one reviewer (EMW) eliminated most citations. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) reviewed 14,712 citations independently. Full-texts were reviewed for 130 citations identified through electronic databases (often because we could not access abstracts or other information that would allow us to exclude a citation).</P>
<P>Additionally, staff at the CDPLPG contacted by email or letter the 300 research organisations and charities listed at the website of the Independent Living Institute (Sweden; http://www.independentliving.org/donet/) between November 2005 and January 2006, and a further 31 other organisations and experts/practitioners in the field of disability were contacted following leads supplied by those who responded to this first call. In June 2006, we contacted relevant government offices of 14 countries wherein personal assistance was known to be common (UK, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Austria, Finland, Belgium, USA, Hungary, Federal Republic of Germany, Norway); 66 responses were received.</P>
<P>One study involving children with intellectual impairments was included in a related review. No studies were included in this review.</P>
<P>A flowchart of the process of trial selection was made in accordance with the QUOROM statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1999</LINK>) and is included <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-16 10:35:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In 1986, Ratzka noted that 'there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures' (<LINK REF="REF-Ratzka-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ratzka 1986</LINK>). This is as true for children and adolescents as it was twenty years ago. It would be possible to compare personal assistance to other services or to different forms of personal assistance in locations implementing new programmes. Similarly, new users might be assigned to new models of personal assistance in places with long-standing personal assistance services.</P>
<P>Services for children and adolescents with impairments are organised differently around the world. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine (i) what marginal benefits are gained from personal assistance (i.e. the added value compared to other services that exist today), (ii) at what total relative cost and (iii) which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.</P>

<P>Data extraction and management</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM).</P>
<P>The following data will be collected for all trial arms:<BR/>1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, living arrangements, social and economic status);<BR/>2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability);<BR/>3) Other interventions received; and<BR/>4) Outcome measures listed above (including multiple measures of outcomes where available).</P>
<P>The following data will be collected for all studies:<BR/>1) Programme differentiation, i.e. differences in the services received by participants in different arms (<LINK REF="REF-Dane-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dane 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MRC-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC 2000</LINK>), including crossover between groups; and<BR/>2) Context.</P>

<P>Assessment of risk of bias</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) where:<BR/>(A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);<BR/>(B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known);<BR/>(C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number); and<BR/>(D) indicates that random allocation was not used.</P>
<P>Studies in all quality categories were considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2003</LINK>). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants is described in the Table of Included Studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline.</P>
<P>Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews. At present, evidence indicates that 'scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually' (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; see also <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The following components are considered in the Description of Studies and in Additional Tables:<BR/>1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?);<BR/>2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?);<BR/>3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?);<BR/>4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?);<BR/>5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>); and<BR/>6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?).</P>

<TD>
<P>Multiple measures</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If we conduct meta-analyses in which only one effect estimate can be used from each study, we will select one measure if it is more valid or reliable than the others. For example, if a single respondent completes both a validated scale assessing multiple domains of quality of life and an unvalidated visual analogue scale, we will select the validated scale. If a study includes several equally valid measures and only one effect estimate can be used for meta-analysis, we will calculate the average effect for this purpose (e.g. the average SMD or RR weighted by variance).<BR/>

<P>Multiple arms</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison or inclusion in a meta-analysis, the most intense service or the service that best follows the goals of personal assistance (e.g., services that give users more control) will be included in the meta-analysis. If a single eligible intervention group is compared to multiple eligible control groups, 'no-treatment' controls will be chosen over other groups for comparison and inclusion in meta-analyses. For studies that do not have no-treatment condition, the most common intervention in clinical practice will be chosen to maximise the external validity of the results.<BR/>

<P>Data synthesis<BR/>(Outcome data)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Meta-analyses may be conducted to combine comparable outcome measures across studies. All overall effects will be calculated using inverse variance methods. Random-effects models will be used because studies may include somewhat different treatments or populations.<BR/>

<P>Mean differences, standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs will be calculated for comparisons of continuous outcome measures.</P>

<TD>
<P>Dichotomous data</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Within studies, relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated for comparisons of dichotomous outcome measures. Dichotomous outcome measures may be combined by calculating an overall RR and 95% CI.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Continuous outcomes</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Continuous outcome measures may be combined when means and standard deviations or complete significance testing statistics are available, unless statistical tests assuming normality would be inappropriate. For example, for scales beginning with a finite number (such as 0), effect estimates will not be combined unless a mean is greater than its standard deviation (otherwise the mean would be very unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution). If continuous outcomes are measured identically across studies, an overall weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI may be calculated. If the same continuous outcome is measured differently across studies, an overall standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI may be calculated (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). SMDs will be calculated using Hedges g.<BR/>

<P>Types of analyses</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Studies in which participants are analysed as members of the groups to which they were originally assigned (intention-to-treat analysis), studies that include only those participants who were willing or able to provide data (available-case analysis), and studies that analyse participants who adhered to the study's design (per-protocol analysis; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) will be analysed separately. Studies in which the reasons for excluding participants from analyses can not be determined from relevant reports or through contact with the authors will be considered with per-protocol analyses.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Homogeneity</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>The consistency of results will be assessed using the I-squared statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). If there is evidence of heterogeneity (Q-statistic p less than or equal to 0.1 coupled with an I-squared value of 25% or greater), the authors will consider sources according to pre-specified subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses (below) but will not report an overall estimate of effect size. If heterogeneity remains within these subgroups, the review will report the results on a trial-by-trial basis, in a narrative summary.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Subgroup analyses</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Large numbers of subgroups may lead to misleading conclusions and are best kept to a minimum (<LINK REF="REF-Counsell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Counsell 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1991</LINK>). If possible, this review will include separate effect estimates for the following subgroups:<BR/>1) Organisation of services<BR/>2) Place of residence<BR/>3) Acquisition of impairment<BR/>4) Amount of assistance</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analysis</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Sensitivity analyses will investigate the influence of lower quality studies (i.e., those rated C and D on allocation concealment) on the results of the review. To investigate the possibility of bias, including publication bias, funnel plots will be drawn (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>). In the event of asymmetry, the reviewers will seek input from methodologists, including the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration Methods Groups, on appropriate analyses.<BR/>
