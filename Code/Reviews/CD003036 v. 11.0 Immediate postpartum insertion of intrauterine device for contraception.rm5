<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-15 15:12:13 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women have two main choices for intrauterine contraception (IUC): one that releases the hormone levonorgestrel, and one without hormones that contains copper. Beginning IUC use right after childbirth and before hospital discharge can be good for many reasons. The woman knows she is not pregnant, and the time and place are convenient for starting a method that works well. We looked at whether IUC would be more likely to come out on its own if put in right after birth of a baby. For women who wanted IUC but did not have it placed right away, we studied whether they returned later for insertion.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Until 1 April 2015, we ran computer searches for randomized trials of IUC inserted within 10 minutes of placenta (afterbirth) delivery. We wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare different times for insertion as well as types of IUC and ways to insert the device.</P>
<P>We found 15 trials. Seven recent studies compared IUC insertion right after childbirth versus early insertion (before hospital discharge) or later insertion (weeks after discharge). Four had full reports, although three were small studies. Insertion was as likely to occur when placed right after childbirth as when planned for later placement, except in a study from Uganda. For the four trials overall, the IUC came out more often on its own when placed right after childbirth than when inserted weeks later. Use at six months was more likely with insertion right after childbirth than weeks later. In single studies, the groups did not differ in use at 3 months or 12 months.</P>
<P>Eight older studies looked at types of IUC put in right after childbirth. Changing IUC design did not seem to affect whether IUC stayed in or whether it was used later on. Inserting IUC by hand or with a holding instrument did not seem to make a difference.</P>
<P>We found newer trials with full reports that compared placement times. The studies were of good quality. Ongoing trials will provide additional data, although some sample sizes are small. Larger studies would provide better information on whether the IUC came out on its own and on whether side effects occurred.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-15 14:39:44 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women who want to start intrauterine contraception (IUC) during the postpartum period might benefit from IUC insertion immediately after delivery. Postplacental insertion greatly reduces the risk of subsequent pregnancy and eliminates the need for a return visit to start contraception. Without the option of immediate insertion, many women may never return for services or may adopt less effective contraception.<BR/>

</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-06-15 18:03:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our aim was to examine the outcomes of IUC insertion immediately after placenta delivery (within 10 minutes), especially when compared with insertion at other postpartum times. We focused on successful IUC placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-06-15 14:47:39 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for trials until 1 April 2015. Sources included PubMed (MEDLINE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), POPLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the original review, the authors contacted investigators to identify other trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-06-15 18:14:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one treatment arm that involved immediate IUC placement (i.e., within 10 minutes of placenta delivery). Comparison arms could have included early postpartum insertion (from 10 minutes postplacental to hospital discharge) or standard insertion (during a postpartum visit). Trials could also have compared different IUC methods or insertion techniques. Delivery may have been vaginal or cesarean. Primary outcomes were placement (insertion), subsequent expulsion, and method use at study assessment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-06-15 14:51:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, we used the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Earlier studies primarily reported results as life-table rates. We aggregated trials in a meta-analysis if they had similar interventions and outcome measures. A sensitivity analysis included studies with moderate or high quality evidence and sufficient outcome data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 16:02:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 15 trials. Seven studies reported from 2010 to 2014 were added to eight from the original 2001 review. Newer trials compared immediate postplacental insertion versus early (10 minutes to 48 hours) or standard insertion (during the postpartum visit). Of four with full reports, three were small trials. The other three studies had conference abstracts. The eight early trials examined immediate insertion of different devices or insertion techniques. Most studies were published in the 1980s, some with limited reporting.</P>
<P>Our sensitivity analysis included trials with sufficient outcome data and moderate or high quality evidence. Four newer trials comparing insertion times met the inclusion criteria. Two studies used the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) after vaginal delivery. The other two trials placed IUC after cesarean section; one used the CuT 380A intrauterine device (IUD) and the other used the LNG-IUS.</P>
<P>A pilot trial compared immediate insertion versus early or standard insertion. In groups comparing immediate versus early insertion (N = 30), all women had the LNG-IUS inserted. By six months, the groups had the same expulsion rate and did not differ significantly in IUC use.</P>
<P>For immediate versus standard insertion, we conducted meta-analyses of four trials. Insertion rates did not differ significantly between study arms. However, the trial from Uganda showed insertion was more likely for the immediate group, although the estimate was imprecise. In the meta-analysis, expulsion by six months was more likely for the immediate group, but the confidence interval was wide (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 16.32; participants = 210; studies = 4). IUC use at six months was more likely with immediate insertion than with standard insertion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.09; participants = 243; studies = 4). Study arms did not differ in use at 3 or 12 months in individual small trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-15 14:54:21 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Recent trials compared different insertion times after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Evidence was limited because studies with full reports generally had small sample sizes. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate; abstracts and older studies had limited reporting. Ongoing trials will add to the evidence, although some are small. Trials of adequate power are needed to estimate expulsion rates and side effects.</P>
<P>The benefit of effective contraception immediately after delivery may outweigh the disadvantage of increased risk for expulsion. Frequent prenatal visits during the third trimester provide the opportunity to discuss effective contraceptive methods and desired timing for initiation. Clinical follow-up can help detect early expulsion, as can educating women about expulsion signs and symptoms.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-06-15 18:32:01 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-15 16:44:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-15 15:15:38 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>During the postpartum period, delay in initiating contraception is common. Effective contraception after childbirth helps lengthen birth intervals and thus improves the health of mothers and infants. Preventing unintended pregnancies helps avoid their financial, psychological, and health costs. A longer birth interval decreases the risk of major maternal complications including death, third-trimester bleeding, puerperal endometritis, and anemia (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). To reduce risk for poor maternal and infant health outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended waiting 24 months after a birth before attempting the next pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intrauterine contraception (IUC) includes the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and copper-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs). The LNG-IUS and the CuT 380A IUD provide contraceptive protection similar to that attained with tubal sterilization (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2011</LINK>). Compared with sterilization, however, IUC use is simpler, less expensive, and immediately reversible. IUC use is not very common in 'more developed' regions globally, where the most prevalent forms of contraception are condoms and contraceptive pills at 18% each, among women who are married or in union (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2011</LINK>). In 'less developed' areas, female sterilization leads at 21% and is followed by IUC use (15%) and contraceptive pills (7%) (<LINK REF="REF-UN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">UN 2011</LINK>). These statistics are influenced by countries with large populations such as India and China, which are dominated by sterilization and IUC use, respectively.</P>
</CONDITION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-15 16:44:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Insertion of IUC immediately after delivery has several advantages. It may avoid the discomfort related to standard insertion and bleeding from insertion will be disguised by lochia. The woman is known to be not pregnant, and her motivation for contraception may be high. For women with limited access to medical care, postpartum care before discharge provides an opportunity to discuss contraception. Delay in initiating contraception is common in the postpartum period because of the challenges of caring for a new infant (<LINK REF="REF-Teal-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teal 2014a</LINK>). Immediate placement of a long-acting reversible contraceptive, such as IUC or an implant, results in higher use rates. In the USA, however, most insurance reimbursement policies for delivery-related care do not allow separate billing for postpartum IUC or implants prior to discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Aiken-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aiken 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women who delay getting IUC may experience an unintended pregnancy or may never return for the insertion (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2009</LINK>). An early study from Colombia showed that 95% of women interested in immediate postpartum IUD insertion had it done. Only 45% of those wishing later insertion ultimately had an IUD inserted. Although some women in the latter group may have been ambivalent and later decided against an IUD, the inconvenience and expense of a return visit probably deterred some women (<LINK REF="REF-Echeverry-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Echeverry 1973</LINK>). A US database review examined the return rate for IUC insertion when two visits were required (<LINK REF="REF-Bergin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergin 2012</LINK>). Only 54% of the women had IUC inserted; return rates were higher when the IUC order initiated at a gynecologic rather than an obstetric visit. Women delivering at a university hospital in the USA were surveyed about postpartum contraception (<LINK REF="REF-Glazer-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazer 2011</LINK>). Nearly a fourth were interested in immediate IUC placement if available. Months later, only 5% were using IUC and nearly a fourth still wanted IUC.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-06-15 15:23:32 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the original review in 2001, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of immediate postplacental insertion compared different devices or different insertion techniques. Many of the IUDs used in those studies are no longer marketed. None of the trials compared IUC insertion at different time points. In 2010, a conference abstract reported results of a trial of immediate postplacental versus standard insertion. Over subsequent years, several trials have compared insertion times for postpartum IUC. The recent studies have examined immediate IUC insertion after cesarean delivery, as well as after vaginal delivery. Investigators used the LNG-IUS or the CuT 380A. Such trials could provide further evidence regarding subsequent expulsion and method use after immediate insertion of currently marketed IUC.</P>

<P>When the crude number of events was published for dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). An example is the proportion of women with spontaneous expulsion. We used a fixed-effect model for analysis within a single study. Fixed and random effects yield the same result if no heterogeneity exists, as when a comparison includes only one study. For meta-analysis, we used random effects. Even when the interventions were similar across studies, the inclusion criteria could lead to differences in study populations. For the original review, the authors reported results primarily as gross cumulative event rates per 100 women. Most studies had insufficient sample sizes to assess rare events, such as uterine perforation.</P>

This modification of the TCu 220C was termed the Delta T. Similarly, investigators tied three chromic sutures to the superior bar of a Lippes Loop D, thereafter termed the Delta Loop. Each modification was compared with the conventional device without sutures. The other interventions examined in these two reports were hand versus instrument insertion of the various devices (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kisnisci-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kisnisci 1985</LINK>).</LI>

The US trials indicated little difference between the study arms, regardless of whether the IUC was inserted after vaginal or cesarean delivery, or whether the LNG-IUS or the CuT 380A was used.</LI>
<LI>For expulsion, the denominator was the number of women with IUC placed according to study plan. Expulsion by six months was more likely with immediate insertion than with standard insertion (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 16.32; participants = 210; studies = 4) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). However, the wide confidence interval indicates imprecision in the estimate.</LI>
<LI>For IUC use, the denominator was the number of women randomized. Use at six months was more likely with immediate insertion than with standard insertion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.09; participants = 243; studies = 4) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). However, the groups did not differ at three months in one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Dahlke-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlke 2011</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>) or at 12 months in another (<LINK REF="STD-Whitaker-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Whitaker 2014</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Immediate postplacental insertion: different devices or insertion techniques</HEADING>
<P>The eight trials included from the 2001 review examined immediate insertion of different devices or insertion techniques; none compared insertion times. Seven were published from 1980 to 1987, and one in 1996. The reported life-table rates mentioned below are also shown in <LINK TAG="ANALYSES_AND_DATA" TYPE="SECTION">Data and analyses</LINK>. For these trials, we summarized the results for insertion, use, and expulsion in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>The addition of chromic sutures to conventional IUDs had little impact on clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Cole-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1984</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>). Virtually all participants received an IUD (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Women were randomly assigned to either a Delta Loop or a Lippes Loop D. The only significant finding noted by the investigators was a lower rate of expulsion with the Delta Loop at six months (15.7 versus 21.5 per 100 women). Gross six-month continuation rates with the two devices were 78.5 and 73.8 per 100 women, respectively. Follow-up rates were 62.7 and 66.1. Among women randomized to either the Delta T or the TCu 220C, the rates of expulsion at six months were 11.6 and 11.5 per 100 women, respectively. Six-month continuation rates were 81.8 per 100 women for both groups, and follow-up rates were 71.0 and 70.9. The technique of insertion for the Delta Loop device (hand versus inserter or forceps) had no significant impact on expulsion or continuation rates. Follow-up rates were 84.2 for hand insertion and 83.0 for instrument insertion.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kisnisci-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kisnisci 1985</LINK> compared the Delta Loop and the Delta T (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-006.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.6</LINK>). These results from one center involved in <LINK REF="STD-Cole-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Cole 1984</LINK> were published separately. Nearly all participants received an IUD. Expulsion rates per 100 women at 12 months were 3.7 for the Delta Loop and 7.6 for the Delta T. The 12-month pregnancy rates were 2.1 and 0, respectively. The two devices had similar 12-month rates of removal for pain or bleeding: 1.1 and 1.0 per 100 women. Likewise, continuation rates were comparable: 93.3 and 90.7 per 100 women, respectively. Follow-up rates were 78.9% for the Delta Loop and 86.7% for the Delta T. The investigators noted that the groups did not differ significantly in the termination or event rates.</P>
<P>The TCu 200 was superior to the Progestasert for immediate postpartum insertion for the outcomes in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Lavin-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Lavin 1983</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>). The Progestasert had significantly higher expulsion rates than the TCu 200, and the differences were independent of whether the devices had been introduced by hand or with an inserter. The 12-month expulsion rates for hand insertion and instrument insertion were 9.0 and 8.1 for the TCu 200, and 35.8 and 35.2 for the Progestasert. The 12-month continuation rates were reported to be significantly higher for the TCu 200 groups (86.3 when introduced by hand and 86.1 for inserter) than for the Progestasert groups (59.9 and 57.2, respectively). At 12 months, follow-up rates were 69.7 and 67.7 for the TCu200 and Progestasert instrument-insertion groups, respectively, versus 76.1 and 77.4 for the respective hand-insertion groups; significance levels were not provided.</P>
<P>The TCu 200 also appeared to perform better than the prototype three-year progesterone device (IPCS-52) (<LINK REF="STD-Apelo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Apelo 1985</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-008.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.9</LINK>). The 12-month rates for expulsion when hand-introduced were 39.0 for IPCS-52 and 19.9 for TCu 200. The comparable rates for the inserter-introduced devices were 14.2 for the IPCS-52 and 10.3 for the TCu 200. The 12-month continuation rates per 100 women for the IPCS-52 were 57.3 for hand insertion and 77.1 for instrument insertion. For the TCu 200, the continuation rates were 73.8 for hand inserted and 84.9 for instrument inserted. The 36-month continuation rates were 52.3, 55.8, 67.7, and 62.9, respectively. The investigators tested for statistical significance after 36 months. The life-table rates for expulsion at 36 months were 39.0 for the hand-introduced IPCS-52, 24.2 for the inserter-introduced IPCS-52, 19.9 for the hand-introduced TCu 200, and 13.1 for the inserter-introduced TCu 200. Investigators reported that expulsion for the hand-inserted IPCS-52 was significantly greater than for the hand-inserted or instrument-inserted TCu 200. Removals for bleeding and pain were uncommon with both devices and did not change between 12 and 36 months. For pooled data, the researchers noted that the TCu 200 had a significantly lower expulsion rate than the IPCS-52, and instrument insertions had a significantly lower expulsion rate than hand insertions. At 12 months, follow-up rates appeared lower for the TCu 200 group with hand insertion (71.1%) than for the group with instrument insertion (99.1%). For the IPCS-52, both insertion groups had 83% follow-up. At 36 months, when statistical testing was done, follow-up ranged from 55% to 67% across the groups.</P>

<LI>Spontaneous expulsion rates at six months for all three IUDs exceeded the predetermined stopping rules, so the trial terminated early.

The investigators stated that expulsion for the Copper 7 was significantly lower than for the Lippes Loop; no statistical testing was mentioned.

<P>In this synthesis, we included trials with sufficient outcome data and evidence of moderate or high quality (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). We focused on the trials that compared IUC insertion times (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Four of these newer trials met the criteria; three used the LNG-IUS and one used the CuT 380A.</P>

<LI>Expulsion by six months was more likely for the immediate group, but the confidence interval was wide. Two trials examined the LNG-IUS after vaginal delivery. The other two placed the IUC after cesarean section; one used the CuT 380A and the other, the LNG-IUS.</LI>

<P>Three newer trials comparing insertion times used the CuT 380A (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The conference abstracts lacked design information and outcome data. However, these trials were larger than those with full reports. Two trials examined immediate versus early insertion. Expulsion by six weeks in one study was reported to be lower for the immediate group compared with the early group, and continued use at six months was higher in the immediate group. In the other trial with early insertion, the study arms did not differ significantly in expulsion or continuation at six months. The third trial studied immediate versus standard insertion. Insertion rates did not differ significantly between the study arms, nor did continued use at 12 months.</P>
<P>Eight early studies showed that modifications of IUDs for immediate postpartum insertion were not helpful (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Modifications included the addition of absorbable sutures to the superior arms of T-shaped IUDs and Lippes Loops, and the addition of plastic arms to the vertical stem of a Nova T. The choice of insertion technique (hand versus instrument) also appeared to be clinically unimportant. Only one trial noted any significant difference (<LINK REF="STD-Apelo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Apelo 1985</LINK>), but a later trial with better methods found no substantial differences (<LINK REF="STD-Xu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three of the seven newer trials examined different insertion times for the LNG-IUS and four compared insertion times for the CuT 380A. Three placed the IUC after vaginal delivery, two after cesarean delivery, and two after either type of delivery. The eight trials from the 2001 review compared different devices or insertion techniques with immediate insertion rather than different insertion times. Several of those trials examined immediate insertion after vaginal delivery, but others did not specify the type of delivery. Many of the IUDs examined in the earlier studies are no longer widely used. Overall, limited data were provided on safety (e.g., perforation and infection) and on other adverse events.</P>
<P>Immediate IUC insertion is common in many areas of the world. Of the trials comparing insertion times, four were conducted in the USA, two in India, and one in Uganda. The early trials of immediate insertion were conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, South America, and Asia. Three were multisite trials. Non-randomized studies also provide evidence of how common immediate IUC insertion has become; some are discussed below (<LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>). Feasibility studies show that IUC insertion may be acceptable in some settings, but conducting an RCT may not. In a study of early versus standard insertion in Malawi, nearly the number planned were recruited but less than half were randomized (<LINK REF="REF-Bryant-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryant 2013</LINK>). In Kampala, Uganda, more than half the women screened opted out of the feasibility study for intra-cesarean insertion (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2015</LINK>). Surveys of the women who opted out, as presented in a conference abstract, indicated that 41% wanted to ask their husband first, 16% did not like IUC, and 15% said their husband did not like IUC (<LINK REF="STD-Lester-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Lester 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Insertion of hormonal IUC may be delayed because of concerns about the effect on lactation. Another Cochrane review examined hormonal contraceptives and lactation (<LINK REF="REF-Lopez-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lopez 2015</LINK>). Two included studies did provide data on lactation with LNG-IUS use. In a secondary analysis from <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2010</LINK> (Chen 2011), women who had immediate postpartum insertion stopped exclusive breastfeeding earlier than women who had standard insertion. The trial was not designed to measure this effect. The pilot study (<LINK REF="STD-Dahlke-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlke 2011</LINK>) stated that breastfeeding at six months did not differ significantly across the immediate, early, and standard groups, although the standard group had the lowest rate. Most progestin-only methods are considered category 3 for less than six weeks postpartum (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Category 3 means that the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. The method is not usually recommended unless more appropriate methods are unavailable or unacceptable. In the USA, for the first month postpartum, progestin-only methods are category 2, meaning that the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the risks (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We summarized our assessment of the evidence quality (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Risk of bias is also summarized in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and is shown by study in <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. Overall, we considered the evidence to be of moderate quality. About a fourth of the reports lacked information on the randomization process and allocation concealment. Several trials had no blinding or no mention of blinding. The timing of insertion made blinding of participants unfeasible. Assessors could have been blinded, but the outcomes were often expulsion and IUC use. Standards for reporting trials were developed in the late 1990s, and the CONSORT statement was widely adopted in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2010</LINK>). The three recent trials for which we had only a conference abstract lacked information needed to assess risk of bias. For two of those trials, the investigators communicated that full reports were in progress.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-15 16:47:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Immediate postpartum insertion of IUC involves trade-offs. Expulsion rates appear higher with postplacental and early postpartum insertion than with standard insertion. The net effect of these expulsions is not clear from published studies, for example, if detected and another contraceptive is started, accidental pregnancies might be avoided. In the two more recent studies that assessed pregnancy, none was reported. The earlier studies had varied pregnancy rates. Insertion of IUC immediately after delivery is convenient for both the woman and the clinician. Resumption of ovulation can be unpredictable after delivery, and IUC provides highly effective contraception during the puerperium.</P>
<P>Non-randomized studies provide some information about expulsion and IUC use or continuation after immediate or early insertion. Over a five-year period in India, 1037 women had a CuT 200B inserted immediately after vaginal (37%) or cesarean (63%) delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Shukla-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shukla 2012</LINK>). The expulsion rate was 11% by six months and most occurred in the first six weeks. A prospective case series of early LNG-IUS insertion after vaginal delivery was conducted at a university medical center in the USA. With only 40 women enrolled, the expulsion rate was 38% (<LINK REF="REF-Stuart-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 2012</LINK>). The results may not be reliable because of the small sample size. In Turkey, 268 women chose the timing for CuT 380A insertion after vaginal or cesarean delivery: immediate, early (up to 72 hours), or standard (<LINK REF="STD-Eroglu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Eroglu 2006</LINK>). Complete expulsion was higher for the immediate (11%) and early (14%) groups compared with the standard insertion group (3.6%) at eight weeks. In Pakistan, 100 women had a CuT 380A or Multiload inserted immediately after vaginal or cesarean delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Alam-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alam 2014</LINK>). Complete expulsion occurred in three women by 10 weeks.</P>
<P>Early trials included in this review indicated that immediate postpartum insertion of IUDs was safe and effective. Decades ago, <LINK REF="STD-WHO-1980" TYPE="STUDY">WHO 1980</LINK> judged expulsion and pregnancy rates to be excessive for women who underwent immediate IUD insertion. However, variable clinical experience, rather than patient characteristics, may be responsible (<LINK REF="STD-Chi-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Chi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kisnisci-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kisnisci 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiery-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiery 1985</LINK>). Two systematic reviews examined studies of various designs that compared different insertion times or routes (<LINK REF="REF-Kapp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonalkar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonalkar 2014</LINK>). Evidence from studies of copper-containing IUDs and the LNG-IUS indicated that postplacental and early postpartum insertion was safe compared with standard insertion, but expulsion rates were higher.</P>
<P>Expulsion rates may be lower for postplacental insertion after cesarean delivery than after vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="REF-Kapp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kapp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sonalkar-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sonalkar 2014</LINK>). Recent studies examined immediate insertion after cesarean delivery but were uncontrolled. A study in Turkey examined the safety and efficacy of immediate insertion of the CuT 380A during cesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Celen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Celen 2011</LINK>). At six months, the cumulative expulsion rate was 10.6 per 100 women and the continuation rate was 81.6%. A feasibility study of immediate insertion after cesarean delivery assessed expulsion and acceptability among 90 women in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Levi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levi 2012</LINK>). Among the 60% who returned for a six-week visit or provided a six-month phone interview, no expulsions were identified by examination or ultrasound nor were reported by the women. The investigators emphasized the importance of providing effective contraception before discharge, given that only 48% returned for the six-week postpartum visit. A pilot study in Dakar, Senegal, examined cesarean insertion of IUC in 46 women (<LINK REF="REF-Gueye-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueye 2013</LINK>). The expulsion rate at three months was 2.2%. In India, 564 women had intra-cesarean insertion, and the expulsion rate was 9% by six months (<LINK REF="REF-Mishra-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mishra 2014</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>Recent trials compared different times for postpartum IUC insertion after vaginal or cesarean delivery. However, the evidence is limited because only a few studies had full reports, and most were small trials. Expulsion appeared more likely for immediate postplacental than for standard insertion. Later IUC use did not differ for postplacental insertion compared with standard insertion.</P>
<P>Some early trials of immediate postpartum insertion reported expulsion rates higher than those reported in the literature for standard insertion. The IUC modifications were not helpful in reducing expulsion rates. Insertion of IUC by hand or by instrument appeared to be equally successful.</P>
<P>Counseling women is difficult when evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited. The benefit of providing highly effective contraception immediately after delivery may outweigh the disadvantage of increased risk of expulsion. Clinical follow-up is important in detecting early expulsion, as is educating women to recognize the signs and symptoms of expulsion (<LINK REF="STD-Dahlke-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Dahlke 2011</LINK>). Frequent prenatal visits in the third trimester provide the opportunity to discuss effective contraceptive methods and desired timing for initiation (<LINK REF="REF-Teal-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Teal 2014a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although we found seven new trials, the evidence is still limited. Of the four new studies with full reports, three had small sample sizes. Another three trials provided preliminary results in conference abstracts. These trials were larger than those with full reports and may provide more definitive results. However, they show few significant differences between study arms. Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate. The abstracts and the older studies provided less information on design and outcomes.</P>
<P>More data are becoming available on comparisons of immediate postplacental versus early or standard insertion. Ongoing trials and one recently completed study will add to the evidence, although some are small. Several address placement after vaginal delivery, for which expulsion rates are high with immediate insertion. Trials of adequate power are needed for more accurate estimation of expulsion and use rates, as well as perforations and other adverse events. Adequate follow-up is also important for assessing those main outcomes.</P>
