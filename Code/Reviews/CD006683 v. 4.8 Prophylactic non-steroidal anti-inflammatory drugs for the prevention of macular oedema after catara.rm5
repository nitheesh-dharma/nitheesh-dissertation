<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-10-14 09:46:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the aim of this review?</B>
<BR/>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if NSAID eye drops can prevent a sight-threatening complication of cataract surgery (swelling at the back of the eye, known as macular oedema). Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 34 studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Key messages</B>
<BR/>There is only low-certainty evidence to support the use of NSAID eye drops to prevent macular oedema affecting vision after cataract surgery.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What was studied in the review?</B>
<BR/>There is a clear lens in the eye that focuses the light on the back of the eye. As people get older this lens can become cloudy. A cloudy lens is known as a cataract. Doctors can remove the cataract and replace it with an artificial lens. This is usually a very successful operation. Occasionally, people having cataract surgery can get swelling at the back of the eye after the operation. This swelling is known as macular oedema. It usually gets better on its own accord, but if it persists it can result in poor vision.</P>
<P>NSAIDs are a medication that can treat inflammation. They may be able to reduce the chances of this swelling happening. The NSAIDs studied in this review were eye drops.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main results of the review?</B>
<BR/>The review authors found 34 relevant studies. These studies were conducted in all parts of the world including the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and South-East Asia. Most (28) of these studies compared NSAIDs combined with steroids against steroids alone. Some of the studies (6) compared NSAIDs with steroids alone. A variety of NSAIDs were used, including ketorolac, diclofenac, nepafenac, indomethacin, bromfenac, pranopfen and flurbiprofen. People taking part in these trials were followed up from between one and 12 months. Most studies only followed up to two months or less. Six studies were funded by industry; seven studies were funded from non-industry sources and the rest of the studies did not report the source of funding.</P>
<P>There was low-certainty evidence that NSAIDs reduce the chance of poor vision due to macular oedema three months after cataract surgery. Only one study reported on poor vision due to macular oedema at 12 months and we judged this to have very low-certainty of evidence.</P>
<P>Using NSAIDs was associated with a reduced risk of macular oedema but the review authors judged this to be low-certainty.</P>
<P>Inconsistent results were seen for some measurements of macular oedema, such as the thickness of the tissue at the back of the eye (central retinal thickness) at three months after surgery. This measurement was not reported by any studies at 12 months after surgery.</P>
<P>Similarly, inconsistent results were seen for vision measurement (visual acuity) but most studies found small differences between people given NSAIDs and people not given NSAIDs.</P>
<P>Only one study reported quality of life, and this suggested little impact of NSAIDs on quality of life.</P>
<P>Adverse events mainly consisted of a burning or stinging sensation.</P>
<P>
<B>How up-to-date is this review?</B>
<BR/>The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 2 September 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-01 01:26:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Macular oedema (MO) is the accumulation of extracellular fluid in the central retina (the macula). It may occur after cataract surgery and may give rise to poor visual outcome, with reduced visual acuity and distortion of the central vision. MO is often self-limiting with spontaneous resolution, but a small proportion of people with chronic persistent MO may be difficult to treat. Chronic oedema may lead to the formation of cystic spaces in the retina termed 'cystoid macular oedema' (CMO). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in cataract surgery and may reduce the chances of developing MO.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-28 15:06:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The aim of this review is to answer the question: is there evidence to support the prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs either in addition to, or instead of, topical steroids postoperatively to reduce the incidence of macular oedema (MO) and associated visual morbidity.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-28 09:39:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase. Date last searched 2 September 2016. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-28 14:29:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which adult participants had undergone surgery for age-related cataract. We included participants irrespective of their baseline risk of MO, in particular we included people with diabetes and uveitis. We included trials of preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs in conjunction with postoperative topical steroids. The comparator was postoperative topical steroids alone. A secondary comparison was preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs alone versus postoperative topical steroids alone. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-01 01:42:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using standard methods expected by Cochrane. We pooled data using a random-effects model. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and considered the following: risk of bias of included studies, precision of the effect estimate, consistency of effects between studies, directness of the outcome measure and publication bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-28 14:32:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 34 studies that were conducted in the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and South-East Asia. Over 5000 people were randomised in these trials. The majority of studies enrolled one eye per participant; a small subset (4 trials) enrolled a proportion of people with bilateral surgery. Twenty-eight studies compared NSAIDs plus steroids with steroids alone. Six studies compared NSAIDs with steroids. A variety of NSAIDs were used, including ketorolac, diclofenac, nepafenac, indomethacin, bromfenac, flurbiprofen and pranopfen. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. In general, the studies were poorly reported. We did not judge any of the studies at low risk of bias in all domains. Six studies were funded by industry, seven studies were funded from non-industry sources, and the rest of the studies did not report the source of funding.</P>
<P>There was low-certainty evidence that people receiving topical NSAIDs in combination with steroids may have a lower risk of poor vision due to MO at three months after cataract surgery compared with people receiving steroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.76; eyes = 1360; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 5%). We judged this to be low-certainty evidence because of risk of bias in the included studies and indirectness, as the extent of visual loss was not always clear. Only one study reported poor vision due to MO at 12 months and we judged this to be very low-certainty evidence as there were only two events. Quality of life was only reported in one of the 34 studies comparing NSAIDs plus steroids versus steroids alone, and it was not fully reported, other than to comment on lack of differences between groups. There was evidence of a reduced risk of MO with NSAIDs at three months after surgery, but we judged this to be low-certainty due to risk of bias and publication bias (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.49; eyes = 3638; studies = 21). There was inconsistent evidence on central retinal thickness at three months (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 87%). Results ranged from -30.9 µm in favour of NSAIDs plus steroids to 7.44 µm in favour of steroids alone. Similarly, data on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were inconsistent, but nine out of 10 trials reporting this outcome found between-group differences in visual acuity of less than 0.1 logMAR.</P>
<P>None of the six studies comparing NSAIDs alone with steroids reported on poor vision due to MO at three or 12 months. There was low-certainty evidence that central retinal thickness was lower in the NSAIDs group at three months (mean difference (MD) -22.64 µm, 95% CI -38.86 to -6.43; eyes = 121; studies = 2). Five studies reported on MO and showed a reduced risk with NSAIDs, but we judged this evidence to be of low-certainty (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.41; eyes = 520). Three studies reported BCVA at three months and the results of these trials were inconsistent, but all three studies found differences of less than 0.1 logMAR between groups.</P>
<P>We did not note any major adverse events - the main consistent observation was burning or stinging sensation with the use of NSAIDs.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-30 16:37:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Using topical NSAIDs may reduce the risk of developing macular oedema after cataract surgery, although it is possible that current estimates as to the size of this reduction are exaggerated. It is unclear the extent to which this reduction has an impact on the visual function and quality of life of patients. There is little evidence to suggest any important effect on vision after surgery. The value of adding topical NSAIDs to steroids, or using them as an alternative to topical steroids, with a view to reducing the risk of poor visual outcome after cataract surgery is therefore uncertain. Future trials should address the remaining clinical uncertainty of whether prophylactic topical NSAIDs are of benefit, particularly with respect to longer-term follow-up (at least to 12 months), and should be large enough to detect reduction in the risk of the outcome of most interest to patients, which is chronic macular oedema leading to visual loss.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-28 14:48:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-28 14:48:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cataract refers to the clouding of the natural crystalline lens of the eye. It is the leading cause of avoidable visual impairment and blindness in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that unoperated cataract alone accounts for 33% of visual impairment, an estimated 94 million cases worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Pascolini-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pascolini 2012</LINK>). In many parts of the world, particularly higher-income countries, availability of cataract surgery at a relatively early stage of visual impairment in the disease process has led to this procedure being one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Macular oedema (MO) is the accumulation of extracellular fluid in the central retina (the macula) which may present following cataract surgery with lens implantation (pseudophakic macular oedema) or without (aphakic macular oedema) and may give rise to poor visual outcome with reduced visual acuity and distortion of the central vision. The diagnosis of this condition is made both clinically using slit lamp biomicroscopic examination of the macula and with the aid of fundus fluorescein angiography or optical coherence tomography (OCT) (<LINK REF="REF-Choi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choi 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of MO varies with type of surgery, intraoperative complications and pre-existing risk factors. Reported risk of MO varies between 0.9% and 5% for modern uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Spaide-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spaide 1993</LINK>), but can be as high as 10% in the presence of surgical complications such as vitreous loss (<LINK REF="REF-Blomquist-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blomquist 2002</LINK>). Vision is not always affected, and the incidence of MO with decrease in visual acuity is reported at 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2013</LINK>), and is associated with increasing retinal thickness (<LINK REF="REF-Hee-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hee 1995</LINK>). A multicentre audit of 55,567 cataract operations in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) showed a risk of 1.62%, at a median postoperative review time of 31 days (<LINK REF="REF-Jaycock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaycock 2009</LINK>). This was based on surgeons' reports rather than systematic examination of the macula and was defined as poor visual outcome attributed to MO.</P>
<P>Other risk factors for MO include ocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, retinal ischaemic conditions such as central and branch retinal vein conditions, retinal vascular diseases and dystrophies, for example retinitis pigmentosa and retinal telangiectasia, as well as degenerative causes such as age related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy while the use of topical prostaglandin analogue therapy in glaucoma remains a theoretical risk (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2003</LINK>). The use of topical adrenaline 2% (epinephrine) in aphakic patients has also been described to be associated with macular oedema. Other factors may include cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2001</LINK>) but the pathogenesis is unclear.</P>
<P>MO is often self-limiting with spontaneous resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2013</LINK>). The small proportion of patients with chronic persistent MO may be difficult to treat (<LINK REF="REF-Yannuzzi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yannuzzi 1995</LINK>), and they may experience permanent reduction in vision from atrophy of the photoreceptor layer of the retina (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2013</LINK>). Chronic oedema may lead to the formation of cystic spaces in the retina, termed 'cystoid macular oedema' (CMO).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-11 15:49:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intervention is the topical use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in this case, eyedrops, in addition to topical steroid eyedrops after cataract surgery. They may also be used preoperatively, primarily to reduce the risk of pupil constriction during surgery, but this may potentially also reduce the risk of MO. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are a group of drugs which are in common use orally as over-the-counter treatments for the reduction of pain, redness and swelling associated with systemic inflammation. Some of these are also available in eyedrop form as prescription medicines for the reduction of ocular inflammation.</P>
<P>The comparative intervention is the use of topical steroids on the eye after cataract surgery, which is current standard therapy, and may in itself reduce the risk of MO. Steroids are a group of prescription-only drugs which are used systemically to suppress the symptoms, signs and sequelae of inflammation. They are also used in their topical eyedrop form for the reduction of ocular inflammation.</P>
<P>In the last decade or so, several clinical trials have examined the use of topical NSAIDs in the treatment and prevention of postoperative inflammation and pseudophakic macular oedema, without the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids (<LINK REF="REF-Ballonzoli-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballonzoli 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carnahan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carnahan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Polanski-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polanski 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solomon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 2001</LINK>). NSAIDs such as ketorolac and indomethacin are cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors which suppress breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier that may occur in the early postoperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Flach-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flach 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flach-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flach 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sanders-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanders 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Jain-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 2001</LINK> recommended the use of prophylactic NSAIDs in patients with predisposing factors to developing postsurgical MO, irrespective of cause. Other clinical studies suggest that topical NSAIDs may be more effective than topical steroids in re-establishing the blood-aqueous barrier postoperatively, suggesting an important role in MO prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Flach-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flach 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraff-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraff 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ursell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ursell 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The meta-analysis conducted in <LINK REF="REF-Rossetti-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossetti 1998</LINK> of the use of NSAIDs suggested possible beneficial effects of NSAIDs for both the prophylaxis and treatment of MO, but concluded that the overall quality of the evidence was insufficient to justify recommendation of its widespread use in prophylaxis. A Cochrane Review on treatment of MO following cataract surgery, found that two out of seven included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed a beneficial effect of NSAIDs on chronic MO (<LINK REF="REF-Sivaprasad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivaprasad 2004</LINK>), although problems with trial quality and heterogeneity prevented valid meta-analysis.</P>
<P>A recent randomised, placebo-controlled trial looking at the adjunctive effect of topical NSAIDs in addition to intravitreal steroids (triamcinolone) and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) in chronic MO, found a statistically significant improvement with the use of topical nepafenac in reduction of retinal thickness and improvement in visual acuity at 16 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2010</LINK>). NSAIDs have also been used with good tolerance and efficacy, as an alternate treatment for patients with MO of mixed origin who are steroid responders, and therefore cannot be treated with steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Warren-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warren 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-12 19:26:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>NSAIDs are cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and may work by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Inflammation within tissue is caused by the production of pro-inflammatory products by several pathways. NSAIDs act to suppress the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of inflammation, inhibiting production of prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenach-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenach 2010</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-10-11 15:49:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As cataract surgery is the second most commonly performed operation worldwide, and MO occurs in between 1% and 10% of all cataract surgeries (depending on risk and complications) and leads to poor visual outcome, there is a significant volume of visual morbidity which can be potentially prevented if it is found that NSAIDs are effective in its prophylaxis. NSAIDs are relatively inexpensive, easily obtainable and carry the potential to significantly improve the outcome of cataract surgery worldwide.</P>
<P>Despite some evidence in favour of the beneficial effects of NSAIDs in MO, uncertainty remains about whether it has significant benefit in the prevention of MO when used perioperatively in addition to steroids. A recent editorial posed the question as to how prescribing NSAIDs for routine cataract surgery became so popular in the USA without compelling evidence of a visual benefit to patients (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2016a</LINK>). This uncertainty is reflected in widespread variation in clinical practice. For example, NSAIDs are much less frequently used in the UK for this indication. This review attempts either to resolve the persisting clinical uncertainty or to identify the need for further research to achieve such resolution.</P>
<P>This review is confined to addressing the use of NSAIDs in the prophylaxis of MO. A separate Cochrane Review on treatment of established cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has already been published (<LINK REF="REF-Sivaprasad-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sivaprasad 2004</LINK>), but the effectiveness of NSAIDs in treatment remains uncertain. MO can lead to permanent structural damage in the central retina, therefore a prevention strategy may be more effective than treatment after the damage has been done.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-28 15:06:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>The aim of this review is to answer the question: is there evidence to support the prophylactic use of topical NSAIDs either in addition to, or instead of, topical steroids postoperatively to reduce the incidence of macular oedema (MO) and associated visual morbidity.</P>

<P>We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this review. We excluded within-person studies i.e. studies where eyes are randomly allocated to the intervention and comparator due to the possibility that the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one eye may affect the outcome in the other.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-10-01 03:52:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We included trials in which adult participants had undergone standard surgery for age-related cataract. We included participants irrespective of their baseline risk of MO, in particular, we included people with diabetes and uveitis.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-11 15:49:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary comparison of this review was topical NSAIDs in addition to topical steroids versus topical steroids alone in cataract surgery. Surgery can include extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE; large incision with sutures), manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS; small incision without sutures), phacoemulsification cataract surgery (mechanised small incision extracapsular extraction) and intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE; planned and unplanned intracapsular procedures).</P>
<P>We included trials of preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs in conjunction with postoperative topical steroids. The comparator was postoperative topical steroids alone.</P>
<P>A secondary comparison was preoperative and/or postoperative topical NSAIDs alone versus topical postoperative steroids alone.</P>
<P>We included studies irrespective of whether incident MO was subsequently treated.</P>

<P>We defined poor vision outcome as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) not improving to 6/9 or better (or equivalent with other notations of vision) attributed to a diagnosis of MO (detected clinically, angiographically or on optical coherence tomography (OCT)). This included participants who developed MO and required and received treatment.</P>
<P>Our primary outcome was measured at three months after surgery, which we took as any observation between one month and six months after surgery. We also examined poor visual outcome due to MO at 12 months after surgery, which we took as any observation between six and 18 months after surgery.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2016-10-04 12:49:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Four review authors (JE, CL, DL, BL) independently extracted data using a pre-piloted data extraction template in Covidence (<LINK REF="REF-Covidence-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Covidence 2016</LINK>). A fifth review author (CB) generated a random sample of 20% of studies and checked data input for these. We resolved discrepancies by discussion.</P>

<P>As far as possible, we extracted data for an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. We contacted trial investigators as needed. Data were imported directly from Covidence into Review Manager 5 by JE (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>), and checked by the other review authors (CL, DL, BL).

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-02 00:21:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We used Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool for assessing risk of bias in each included study. Four review authors (JE, CL, DL, BL) independently assessed risk of bias according to methods set out in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-10-02 00:23:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We calculated the risk ratio for outcome measures reported as dichotomous data (for example, poor visual acuity attributed to MO within three months). We calculated the mean difference for measures of retinal thickness. We planned to analyse ordinal outcome data as dichotomous data if an established defensible cut-off point is available, such as quality of life measures. We did not plan to meta-analyse adverse effects.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-10-02 00:24:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Trials included may randomise one or both eyes to the intervention or comparator. If both eyes were allocated to the same treatment, we planned to analyse as 'clustered data' if data were available. In the event four trials included data on both eyes, but this was generally a small proportion of the total participants. We have analysed as reported. We excluded studies which allocated different eyes to different treatments as there may be a confounding cross-over effect due to systemic absorption.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-10-02 00:25:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We assessed all included trials for number of participants excluded or lost to follow-up. We documented reasons for loss to follow-up by treatment group, if reported.

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-02 00:26:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>Where heterogeneity was observed between individual study results we did not combine studies but present a tabulated summary of results. We did not rely on statistical significance of a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test to indicate heterogeneity but examined the forest plot of the study results and the overall characteristics of the studies. We looked at the consistency between studies by examining the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic value.

<P>There were variations in the reporting of recruited and randomised participants. As such it is difficult to establish definitively the total number of people that were randomised in these trials.

<P>One study reported this outcome at 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Yannuzzi-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Yannuzzi 1981</LINK>). There was high attrition in this study (only 38% of eyes followed up) and only two events (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.09 to 20.37; eyes = 88). We judged this to be very low-certainty evidence, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision (2 levels; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>One study reported quality of life at 1 month after surgery using the Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability (COMTOL) questionnaire (<LINK REF="STD-Almeida-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Almeida 2012</LINK>), No differences in the impact upon quality of life measures were identified between the treatment and control groups. The use of topical NSAIDs was also reported to have good tolerability and comparable side-effect profile to placebo. However the data in this study were not fully reported and a response rate of only 60% was achieved with significant attrition with 65 out of 162 patients declining to answer the interview after surgery for "logistical reasons".</P>
<P>Quote: "The global [health-related quality of life] HRQOL questions showed no difference in the extent to which quality of life was affected by medication side effects between &#8220;not at all&#8221; and any reported effect (question 6; P = 0.8476). Regarding the extent quality of life was affected by activity limitations, there was no difference between &#8220;not at all&#8221; and any reported limitations (question 9; P = 0.8584). According to the COMTOL questionnaire, there was no difference in compliance between the 3 study groups (question 10; P = 0.3801).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-30 15:35:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>We identified 34 studies that were conducted in the Americas, Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and South-East Asia.</P>
<P>Over 5000 people were randomised in these trials. The majority of studies probably enrolled one eye per participant, a small subset (4 trials) enrolled a proportion of people with bilateral surgery. Twenty-eight of these 34 studies compared non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) plus steroids with steroids alone. Six studies compared NSAIDs (on their own or with placebo) with steroids. A variety of NSAIDs were used, including ketorolac, diclofenac, nepafenac, indomethacin, bromfenac and pranopfen. Follow-up ranged from one month to 12 months. The majority of studies (n = 23) followed up to two months or less. In general, the studies were poorly reported. We did not judge any of the studies at low risk of bias in all domains.</P>
<P>There was low-certainty evidence that people receiving topical NSAIDs in combination with steroids may have a lower risk of poor vision due to macular oedema (MO) at three months after cataract surgery compared with people receiving steroids alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.61; eyes = 1360; studies = 5; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 5%). There were very little data for 12 months (only one study reported poor vision due to MO at this time point) and we judged this to have very low-certainty evidence. Similarly, we judged the evidence on 'clinically symptomatic MO' to be low-certainty. There was evidence on central retinal thickness at three months, but this was inconsistent (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 87%). Results ranged from -30.9 microns in favour of NSAIDs plus steroids to 7.44 microns in favour of steroids alone. Similarly, data on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were inconsistent. Nine out of 10 trials reporting this outcome found between-group differences of less than 0.1 logMAR.</P>
<P>None of the six studies comparing NSAIDs alone with steroids reported on poor vision due to MO at three months or 12 months. We judged the evidence on MO to be low-certainty. There was low-certainty evidence that mean central retinal thickness was lower in the NSAIDs group at three months (mean difference (MD) -22.64 microns, 95% CI -38.86 to -6.43; eyes = 121; studies = 2; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). Two studies reported BCVA at three months, and the results of these trials were inconsistent, but both found differences of less than 0.1 logMAR between groups.</P>
<P>Quality of life was only reported in one of the 34 studies, and it was not fully reported other than to comment on lack of differences between groups. In general, no major adverse events were noted - the main consistent observation was burning or stinging.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-03 22:27:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>There were a relatively large number of trials, and these studies have a wide global range which means their results will be globally applicable.</P>
<P>The included studies compared NSAIDs and steroids in cataract surgery using phacoemulsification, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) surgical techniques. However, the more recent trials exclusively used phacoemulsification, which may make their findings less applicable to parts of the world where resources are less available and ECCE is standard.</P>
<P>The aim of this review was to assess whether the use of NSAIDs had an impact on visual loss due to MO in the long-term. The evidence is very sparse with respect to that question, with only one study with high attrition, reporting on visual loss due to MO at 12 months after surgery. This is clearly an important gap in the evidence.</P>
<P>There are many trials looking at the short-term effects of NSAIDs, but there is considerable variation in terms of types, doses and regimens of NSAIDs and steroids used. One aspect that we have not highlighted in this review, but has been discussed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2016a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2016a</LINK>), is the potency of the steroid used in the comparison group. Use of low potency steroids, such as fluorometholone 0.1%, may lead to an overestimate of the relative effect of NSAIDs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Certainty of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>We graded the evidence as low- to very low-certainty. In general, the trials were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge the extent to which bias had been avoided. We did not judge any of the studies at low risk of bias for all domains. Many trials were not properly masked and, in a few studies, there were problems with attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. For outcomes that had more data we identified the possibility of publication bias with an asymmetric funnel plot. There were also problems with directness. For example, many studies reported "CMO" but were not clear whether or not this was 'clinically significant', or indeed what this meant in terms of whether it caused both symptoms and signs. And in many of the older studies this could not be verified by optical coherence tomography (OCT).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-03 22:28:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Dooley">
<P>We have made several modifications to the original protocol (see <LINK TAG="PRO_REV_DIFF" TYPE="SECTION">Differences between protocol and review</LINK>), but these were made before the data extraction and analysis phases of the review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-30 15:36:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Wielders-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wielders 2015</LINK>). This review included 17 trials. The reason why they had fewer trials than the current review was because they only included studies of phacoemulsification cataract surgery and they excluded studies that did not report the incidence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO).</P>
<P>The review by <LINK REF="REF-Wielders-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wielders 2015</LINK> reported effect measures in the same order of magnitude as that suggested by this review, but because they reported odds ratios (ORs), rather than risk ratios (RRs), these effect estimates are exaggerated (further away from null). The authors concluded that the odds of CMO were reduced in people who were given NSAIDs, but they did not incorporate a judgement on the overall certainty (or quality) of the evidence in their conclusions, even though they had assessed the risk of bias in the included trials using two different methods. It is also notable that, although the abstract highlights the fact that 17 trials were included in the review, it is less clearly pointed out that the effect estimates were based on a relatively small subset of these trials. This review was subsequently criticised because it did not fully incorporate an assessment of visual loss due to CMO, because the conclusions were based on so few trials, and because of the likely exclusion of studies that did not report any events (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>A report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, also published in 2015, was more conservative in its conclusions (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2015</LINK>). This was a narrative review of the literature with no meta-analysis, nor any assessment of the quality of the evidence. They concluded that NSAIDs reduced the incidence of CMO, and may increase visual recovery, depending on the treatment of the comparator group, however, they concluded that the use of NSAIDs did not alter long-term (3 months) visual outcomes, a finding which is supported by the current review.</P>
<P>One slightly older systematic review published in 2014, included 15 trials and did include an overall GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence, which they judged to be low- to moderate-certainty for inflammation, low-certainty for visual acuity and high-certainty for CMO (<LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK>). This review again focused on phacoemulsification. It was restricted to the comparison of NSAIDs (on their own or with placebo) versus steroids alone. They cited the previously published protocol of this review justifying theirs as being different for these two reasons. They evaluated inflammation within one week of surgery and MO at any time point. There are some differences between the current review and <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> in terms of the included studies. This is because the searches for the current review were restricted to evidence relating to MO. However, the trials contributing data to the analysis of MO are similar in the two reviews. <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> included one study that we judged was probably not a randomised controlled trial (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Miyake-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Miyake 2000</LINK>), and one study that we have included in the NSAIDs plus steroids comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2013</LINK>). The estimates of effect for MO reported in <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> and reported in this review are of a similar order of magnitude, although <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> reports a stronger effect. This can be attributed to the fact that, when extracting data from studies using the <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 1977</LINK> classification, <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> considered Grades 2 to 3 as MO, whereas in the current review we considered Grades 1 to 3. The main difference between the reviews is in the grading of the certainty of the evidence. <LINK REF="REF-Kessel-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessel 2014</LINK> considered the evidence to be high-certainty. It is not clearly stated why, but the footnote refers to a RR of 6, which we understand to mean that it is a strong effect, therefore they have not downgraded. We have considered the evidence on MO to be low-certainty, downgrading for risk of bias and publication bias (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-10-25 15:51:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Using topical NSAIDs may reduce the risk of developing macular oedema after cataract surgery, although it is possible that current estimates as to the size of this reduction are exaggerated due to selective non-reporting of negative studies. It is unclear the extent to which this reduction has an impact on the visual function and quality of life of patients. There is little evidence to suggest any important effect on vision after surgery</P>
<P>The value of adding topical NSAIDs to steroids, or using them as an alternative to topical steroids with a view to reducing the risk of poor visual outcome after cataract surgery is uncertain. This is reflected in wide variations in modern practice. The role of the relative effectiveness and safety of NSAIDs as an alternative to steroids in the control of post operative inflammation is being addressed in another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Gonzales-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonzales 2013</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-11 15:49:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future trials should address the remaining clinical uncertainty of whether prophylactic topical NSAIDs are of benefit, particularly with respect to longer-term follow-up (at least to 12 months), and should be large enough to detect to detect reduction in the risk of the outcome of most interest to patients, which is chronic macular oedema leading to visual loss. They should be rigorously conducted and double-masked.</P>

<P>In the protocol we had planned to contact pharmaceutical companies for more information (<LINK REF="REF-Goh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2007</LINK>). We did not do this because since the protocol was written, the role of clinical trial registries have meant that it is much easier to identify potentially unpublished trials.</P>
<P>We had planned to use confidence intervals for the I<SUP>2</SUP> value, but as this is not routinely implemented in RevMan 5 as yet, we have not done this. We felt the extra effort required to analyse the data in a software package that could provide these confidence intervals, such as Stata, was not worth it.</P>
<P>We added some additional outcomes as a result of our collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). These are clearly identified in the text. We have clarified our definition of macular oedema to include all 3 levels of the Miyake classification and whether or not cystic spaces are detectable on imaging which we have termed simply macular oedema (MO).

Intraoperatively, 3 days of ketorolac 0.4% provided significantly lower discomfort scores than with 1-hour and placebo dosing (P &lt; 0.001). One day of ketorolac 0.4% also provided significantly reduced intraoperative discomfort scores than with 1-hour dosing (P = 0.001) and placebo dosing (P &lt; 0.001). Postoperatively, 3 days of ketorolac 0.4% provided significantly lower discomfort scores than 1-hour dosing or control dosing (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 5). In addition, patients randomised to 1 or 3 days of ketorolac 0.4% were significantly less likely to require additional intravenous anesthesia (8% in each group) than patients in the control group (40%) (P = 0.008). Twenty percent of patients in the 1-hour group required additional anesthesia for pain control."</P>

<P>Quote: "No patient deaths were reported during the study. Overall, 13 patients reported other serious adverse events, none of which were related to treatment. Three of the serious adverse events reported in the vehicle group (cardiac failure congestive, coronary artery occlusion, and pancreatitis) led to patient discontinuation; no other serious adverse events led to discontinuation in either treatment group. Separate from the three patients who discontinued due to serious adverse events, four other patients discontinued study participation due to nonserious adverse events. Of these nonserious events, two reported instances of punctate keratitis (one in each treatment group) were assessed as being related to the study drugs. No instances of targeted adverse events (defined as corneal erosions) were reported during the study.</P>
<P>Two reports of punctate keratitis and a single report of corneal epithelium defect were assessed as being related to treatment with nepafenac. A single report of punctate keratitis was assessed as being related to treatment with vehicle. No other ocular or nonocular adverse events reported in the study were assessed as being related to the study drugs.</P>
<P>In both treatment groups, corneal staining and intraocular pressure were each generally similar at the presurgical baseline and at the day 90 visit (or early exit). Additionally, no safety issues or trends were identified based upon changes from baseline in fundus parameters (retina/macula/choroid and optic nerve) and ocular signs (inflammatory cells, aqueous flare, corneal oedema, and bulbar conjunctival injection). The study results indicate no new clinically relevant risks associated with increasing the dosing of nepafenac from 14 days to 90 days, even in the higher-risk diabetic patient population."</P>

The severity of burning and stinging was significantly greater in the flurbiprofen group on days 4-20 and 21-60 and in the indomethacin group on days 1-3, 4-20, 21-60, and 61-120 than in the vehicle group. At day 1-3, moderate to severe burning and stinging were reported by 7.0% (16/230) of the patients treated with flurbiprofen, 9.7% (23/237) of the patients treated with indomethacin, and 3.1% (7/224) of the patients treated with vehicle."</P>
