<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-03 19:50:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anupa Shah">
<P>Cataract is a major cause of global blindness, accounting for 50% to 80% in developing countries. The number of people blind from cataract is expected to rise due to the increase in life expectancy. Aging causes changes in the lens protein leading to opacification of the lens. These changes are often bilateral although maybe asymmetric. Symptoms from cataracts include glare, blurred vision, progressive decrease in visual function and blindness. Surgery is currently the only treatment option once the lens has opacified and vision is decreasing. The indication for surgery is based on whether the patient's reduced visual function interferes with their quality of life. Different surgical techniques have been developed to remove the cloudy lens which is replaced either by an intraocular lens (positioned in the posterior chamber or the anterior chamber of the eye), aphakic glasses or contact lens. There are four main forms of cataract extraction surgery: intracapsular (ICCE), extracapsular (ECCE), phacoemulsification (PHACO) and manual small incision (MSICS). The review authors searched the medical literature and identified 17 randomised controlled trials (9627 participants) investigating the different surgical interventions. Six of these trials suggested that PHACO gives a better outcome than ECCE. They suggest a better uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) following PHACO than ECCE but the majority of the trials showed no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between the two groups. The costs per procedure were not markedly different between the two techniques in a UK based study, however, a Malaysian study showed ECCE to be significantly cheaper. A study comparing MSICS and ECCE, advocated MSICS as the procedure of choice due to equal costs and better visual results. Two studies compared the results of PHACO and MSICS. Phacoemulsification having a significantly higher proportion of patients with UCVA &gt; 6/18 (81.1% versus 71%) but there was no difference in BSCVA. Trials comparing costs of PHACO and MSICS are important for future research. Manual small incision surgery offers an alternative technique in developing countries as it provides acceptable visual outcomes when compared to PHACO yet is likely to be more economical as it avoids the initial outlay of costs of PHACO. It is important to remember that the studies in this review were based in a variety of countries and situations (hospital based or cataract camps); a knowledge of the setting is vital before drawing conclusions from the data.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Cataract accounts for 50% of blindness globally and remains the leading cause of visual impairment in all regions of the world, despite improvements in surgical outcomes (WHO 2005). This number is expected to rise due to an aging population and increase in life expectancy. Although cataracts are not preventable, their surgical treatment is one of the most cost-effective interventions in healthcare. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effects of different surgical interventions for age-related cataract.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE up to July 2006, NRR Issue 3 2005, the reference lists of identified trials and we contacted investigators and experts in the field for details of published and unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTS).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Where appropriate, risk ratios, odds ratios and weighted mean differences were summarised after assessing heterogeneity between the studies. <BR/>
</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We identified 17 trials that randomised a total of 9627 people. Phacoemulsification gave a better visual outcome than extracapsular surgery but similar average cost per procedure in Europe but not in poorer countries. Extracapsular surgery with posterior chamber lens implant and ICCE with or without an anterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implant gave acceptable visual outcomes but extracapsular surgery had less complications. Manual small incision surgery provides better visual outcome than ECCE but slightly inferior unaided visual acuity compared to phacoemulsification.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>This review provides evidence from seven RCTs that phacoemulsification gives a better outcome than ECCE with sutures. We also found evidence that ECCE with a posterior chamber lens implant provides better visual outcome than ICCE with aphakic glasses. The long term effect of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) needs to be assessed in larger populations. The data also suggests that ICCE with an anterior chamber lens implant is an effective alternative to ICCE with aphakic glasses, with similar safety. Phacoemulsification provides the best visual outcomes but will only be accessible to the poorer countries if the cost of phacoemulsification and foldable IOLs decrease. Manual small incision cataract surgery provides early visual rehabilitation and comparable visual outcome to PHACO. It has better visual outcomes than ECCE and can be used in any clinic that is currently carrying out ECCE with IOL. Further research from developing regions are needed to compare the cost and longer term outcomes of these procedures e.g. PCO and corneal endothelial cell damage. </P>

<B>Introduction</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>The World Health Organization estimated from a recent global review of surveys that there are 37 million people worldwide who were blind in 2002 (<LINK REF="REF-Passolini-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Passolini 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Resnikoff-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikoff 2004</LINK>) and that age-related cataract remained the leading cause of blindness globally in 2002 as it was in 1990. Fifty per cent of total world blindness is thought to be due to cataract and the majority of blinding cataract is found in developing countries. This is despite an increasing number of visually impaired and blind people gaining access to cataract surgical services due to the development of prevention of blindness programmes in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-Kupfer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kupfer 1994</LINK>). In India alone over three million cataract surgeries are now performed annually (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1998</LINK>). Despite these positive trends the number of people blind due to cataract is increasing because of the changing demographic structure of populations (<LINK REF="REF-Limburg-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Limburg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Minassian-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minassian 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thylefors-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thylefors 1998</LINK>). More than 82% of all blind persons are 50 years of age or older. The contribution of cataracts to blindness globally is likely to grow due to an ageing population and unsuccessful attempts to control this blinding condition in low and middle-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blindness and severe visual impairment have a significant impact on the socioeconomic development of individuals and societies. Cataract surgical treatment leads to<BR/>substantial long-term savings in health-care and social expenditures. Savings also accrue from the reduced commitment made by family members caring for a visually impaired person. Females have a significantly higher risk of cataract blindness or being visually impaired than males mainly because of their higher incidence of cataract and inadequate access to eye health care, which is often provided preferentially to males (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). The resulting downward socioeconomic spiral can be reversed through widely available, appropriate, cost-effective and curative interventions.</P>
<P>It is estimated that the present number of 20 million cataract blind will double by the year 2020. The global initiative "Vision 2020: The Right to Sight" has suggested various strategies to reduce cataract blindness (<LINK REF="REF-Foster-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 2001</LINK>). The World Health Organization has called for a dramatic increase in surgical volumes worldwide, but the outcomes of cataract surgery are not always good and this needs to be investigated further (<LINK REF="REF-Venkatesh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesh 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Treatment of cataract</B>
<I>
<BR/>
</I>Opacification of the lens occurs as a result of denaturation of lens proteins and this is not thought to be reversible. Some interventions for preventing or delaying the development of cataract are used but their effectiveness has not been proven. Surgery is currently the only treatment option once the lens has opacified and vision is decreasing.</P>
<P>Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) gained popularity in the 1960s and 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Elder-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elder 1969</LINK>) and is still widely used in developing countries. The whole lens with intact capsule is removed from the eye. The function of the removed lens can be replaced either by the insertion of an intraocular lens (IOL) usually in the anterior chamber, or by the use of aphakic glasses or contact lens. The main advantage of ICCE is that it is a standardised technique that can be performed by trained surgeons rapidly (three to five minutes) with minimal manipulation of the eye. The secondary problem of opacification of the lens capsule, with the need for further surgical or laser intervention, is avoided with this technique.<BR/>
<BR/>Extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) was introduced with the development of microsurgical techniques in the early 1980s. The lens contents are removed through a large 12 mm incision leaving the posterior lens capsule intact. A posterior chamber IOL can then be placed in the capsular bag (<LINK REF="REF-Apple-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apple 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Duane-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duane 1986</LINK>). If no IOL is implanted, aphakic glasses or contact lenses must be used. Extracapsular surgery has become the preferred method of extraction in economically advantaged countries and most surgeons in developing countries have been trained to use this method.</P>
<P>Further technological development has led to a majority of surgeons in developed countries adopting sutureless ECCE surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Norregaard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norregaard 1999</LINK>). This surgery uses either mechanical fragmentation (phacoemulsification) of the lens nucleus (<LINK REF="REF-Mehta-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 1999</LINK>), or a manual fragmentation technique (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hennig-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennig 1999</LINK>). Both suture and sutureless ECCE leave in place the posterior capsule of the lens. This keeps the anatomical barrier between the posterior and anterior segments of the eye and may reduce the risk of posterior segment complications. The disadvantage of all the extracapsular techniques is that the posterior lens capsule can become cloudy (<LINK REF="REF-Apple-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apple 1992</LINK>) with the need for a primary or secondary capsulotomy by surgery or using a YAG laser. This increases the costs of surgery and incurs the risk of secondary complications (<LINK REF="REF-Javitt-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javitt 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phacoemulsification is the most commonly performed method of cataract extraction in the developed world and involves ultrasonic fragmentation of the crystalline lens. The incision is small (3.2 mm) which allows rapid visual rehabilitation postoperatively and low induced astigmatism. This technique requires a phacoemulsification machine which may cost £20,000 to £45,000 and has high disposable and maintenance costs. Phacoemulsification requires extensive surgical training, particularly the necessity to carry out a continuous capsulorhexis.</P>
<P>Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) was first described by Blumenthal (<LINK REF="REF-Blumenthal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumenthal 1994</LINK>). In Asia and Africa there has been a renewal of interest in this technique (<LINK REF="REF-Ruit-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruit 2000</LINK>) as an alternative to phacoemulsification because it is considerably less costly but has similar benefits of rapid visual recovery and reduced astigmatism (<LINK REF="REF-Yorston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorston 2005</LINK>). It involves a 6 to 6.5 mm scleral incision, just large enough to allow insertion of a 6 mm IOL. There are various different techniques described for performing the capsulotomy in MSICS, for example, the can-opener method (<LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>), the continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (<LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>) and the endocapsular technique where the incision is from pupil margin to pupil margin. The cataract is delivered into the anterior chamber hydroextracted and aspirated. The posterior capsule of the lens is left intact. This technique is technically more difficult than a standard manual ECCE.</P>
<P>In addition there is a growing realisation that substantial barriers to surgery still exist, especially in rural areas of developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snellingen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snellingen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaidyanathan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaidyanathan 1999</LINK>). This complex mix of rapid development of technology, increasing numbers of people blind due to cataract, and barriers to surgery will demand the development of quality information systems, which can monitor outcomes and develop comparative cost models, accessible to both providers and consumers.<BR/>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts resulting from the electronic searches. Full copies were obtained of any report referring to definitely or possibly relevant trials. These full copies were assessed according to the definitions in the 'Criteria for considering studies for this review'. Only trials meeting these criteria were assessed for methodological quality.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality</B>
<BR/>Trial quality was assessed according to methods set out in section 6 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005b</LINK>). Five parameters were considered: allocation concealment, method of allocation to treatment, documentation of exclusions, completeness of follow-up, methods of documentation of complications. Each parameter of trial quality was graded: A - low risk of bias; B - moderate risk of bias; C - high risk of bias. Two review authors independently assessed the trial quality and disagreement was resolved by discussion. Authors were not masked to the report authors and trial results during the assessment.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data collection</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted using a form developed by the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group. Two authors extracted data and compared the results for differences. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. </P>
<P>
<B>Data synthesis</B>
<BR/>Data from studies collecting comparable outcome measures with similar follow-up times were analysed using either the risk ratio, odds ratio or weighted mean difference. Where it was appropriate to pool results we used a fixed-effect model because of the low number of trials in each comparison. We assessed heterogeneity between trial results using a chi-square test. If the studies showed quite different results we did not combine them, even though the test for heterogeneity was not significant, as we felt that it would have low power in these situations. </P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity analysis</B>
<BR/>We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of study quality on effect size. There are not enough trials included at present to conduct any sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>
<B>Updating the review<BR/>
</B>The original protocol only looked at studies with postoperative visual acuity results at one year or more. A modification was made to this protocol to include studies looking at postoperative visual outcome at six weeks and beyond. The authors updating the review felt that early visual stabilisation is achieved with certain surgical techniques : phacoemulsification and manual small incision surgery. These studies were carried out in countries where longer term follow up is difficult (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>) or when it does occur there is a large loss to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>) . It cannot be said that the visual outcome at four to 12 weeks is a perfect representation of long term outcome as we need to take account of later onset adverse events. <BR/>Early visual stabilisation is not achieved for surgical techniques involving sutures such as ECCE where the visual outcome at six weeks is affected by suture induced astigmatism (<LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>). </P>

<B>Method and concealment of allocation to treatment</B>
<BR/>Six trials state that they used computer generated random number lists as the method of producing a random sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>). Two trials state that allocation schedules were allocated by the trial statisticians (<LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>).<BR/>The method of concealment used to deliver the sequence of treatment allocation in six studies was sealed opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>) and in one study ballots were drawn (<LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>). The delivery system for concealment of allocation was not stated in <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>.<BR/>For the other trials, it is simply stated that the groups were randomly allocated and details of method and delivery of randomisation were not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Documentation of exclusions</B>
<BR/>There were no exclusions after treatment allocation in ten trials (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>). In two trials, eight people did not receive surgery after treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> five people in the phacoemulsification group were withdrawn after randomisation compared to 13 in the extracapsular group. Exclusions were not clearly documented in the other trials (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>Completeness of follow-up </B>
<BR/>Follow-up rates were good. More than 85% follow up was achieved in ten studies at time of conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK> 100%; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> 85%; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK> 92.5% (phacoemulsification group): 93.5% (manual small incision cataract surgery group (MSICS)); <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> 91% (in both groups); <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> 89% (phacoemulsification group): 86% (extracapsular group); <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> 99%; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK> 94.5% (extracapsular group): 96.1% (MSICS group); <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> 100%; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK> 100%; <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK> 89%). In three studies there was more than 80% follow up at study conclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> 84% in both groups). In <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> 87% of the group receiving an intraocular lens (IOL) and 82% of the group receiving aphakic spectacles were followed up. In three trials the number of patients seen at last follow up was not clear (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK>). In general trials did not report whether people who were lost to follow-up differed from those who remained in the trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Masking of outcome assessment <BR/>
</B>This involved masking of the patients and the assessors to type of surgery that had been performed in each treatment group. For masking of outcomes, see the methods section in the 'Characteristics of included studies' table.<B>
<BR/>
</B>In trials where an IOL was compared to aphakic spectacles/contact lenses (<LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>) or posterior chamber IOL compared to anterior chamber IOL (<LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>), masking of outcome assessment was not possible because of the spectacle appearance of participants in either arm or the type of IOL was obvious from examination of the eye. As in many surgical trials despite the assessors being masked to the treatment allocation code it was usually obvious which intervention the participant had undergone. In the trials comparing phacoemulsification and extracapsular extraction, participants were said to be masked to the study group but the assessors were either unmasked (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>) or other studies state that their assessors was masked (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>) depending on what assessment was being performed. Despite some studies stating that the assessor was masked when comparing PHACO and ECCE it seems difficult for this to have been done as the size, location and suture number in each procedure is obviously different. The studies involving MSICS were also said to have masked assessors (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>) which may have been more likely with the MSICS and PHACO groups but it would have been obvious at clinical assessment which were the ECCE group. In most of these studies masking was carried out as much as was possible for outcomes such as refraction, visual acuity assessment, endothelial cell counts, UBM and fluorescein angiograms which were performed by assessors other than those who were carrying out the postoperative clinical examination. </P>
<P>
<B>Intention-to-treat analysis</B>
<BR/>Fourteen trials analysed all participants who completed follow-up in the group to which they were randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> study it was not clear if this was done. The analysis was complicated by the fact that for a small minority of participants, both eyes were enrolled in the trial. In <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK> data was analysed both as per randomisation and also by IOL implanted. </P>
<P>
<B>Handling of data for two eyes</B> <BR/>In most of the trials, only one eye per person was enrolled in the trial, thus avoiding difficulties with the analysis of correlated data for two eyes (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> 333 eyes from 331 people were enrolled in the trial. Some people were therefore in more than one treatment group. Since it affects only a small number of eyes it is considered unlikely to have a major effect on the results and this complexity was therefore ignored in the analysis. Two studies were paired eye studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>) and were not compared to results from non-paired eye studies.</P>

<BR/>We found nine trials that compared these types of surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes<BR/>
</I>Seven studies reported on the visual outcome following surgery. However, due to the heterogeneity of the data presentation and the variability in the postoperative time interval at which visual outcomes were reported, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, we were unable to put them in a meta-analysis. We have referred back to the authors to get further details of the data. <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> reported visual outcomes (both BSCVA and UCVA) measured at three weeks, six weeks, three months, six months and one year after surgery. The phacoemulsification group achieved a better visual outcome throughout the follow-up period due to the fact that the extracapsular group experienced higher levels of astigmatism. One year after surgery, 204/224 (91%) of the phacoemulsification group achieved visual acuity of 6/9 or better with spectacle correction, compared to 184/215 (86%) of the extracapsular group (relative risk (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.14) This is similar to <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK> (study population of diabetics only and a paired eye study) where 96% (44/46) of the phacoemulsification group and 83% (38/46) achieved visual acuity of 6/12 or better with spectacle correction at one year. <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK> (study population of pseudoexfoliative cataracts with small pupils) documented significantly better BSCVA at one year in the phacoemulsification group than extracapsular group. <LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> showed no significant difference in BSCVA between the two groups at respective follow up times. The BCVA for the seven studies are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.<BR/>Two studies commented on UCVA. In the <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> study one year after surgery, 87/224 (39%) of the phacoemulsification group achieved unaided visual acuity of 6/9 or better compared to 42/215 (20%) of the extracapsular group (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.73). In <LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK> 83% of phacoemulsification group achieved 6/12 or better compared to 50% in the extracapsular group at two months.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) complications during surgery </I>
<BR/>In the two largest studies there were significantly more complications in the extracapsular group. In the <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> study, 7.2% (17/236) of the extracapsular group had peroperative iris prolapse compared to zero of the phacoemulsification group. Capsule rupture and/or vitreous loss were equally common in the two groups with 8/246 cases in the PHACO group compared to 9/236 cases in ECCE group. In the <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK> study there was a significantly higher rate of zonular dialysis, capsular tear, and vitreous loss in the extracapsular group. Complications are not commented on in two studies <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> and in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>) it is clearly stated that there were no intraoperative complications. Complications during surgery are statistically compared in <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> corneal decompensation was not reported but there were two retinal detachments, both in the PHACO group, and five cases of macular oedema (two in the PHACO group and three in the ECCE group). In <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK> there was less macula oedema (2.1% v 16.8%) in the PHACO group compared to ECCE group. It was not possible to ascertain from the papers whether the same patients who had PC tear +/- vitreous loss were the same as those who developed macula oedema. We have statistically compared the macula oedema rates in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. There was no difference in IOL decentration between the two groups. <LINK REF="STD-Landau-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Landau 1999</LINK> found a significantly higher rate of intraocular lens haptic subluxation in the extracapsular group. Three studies commented on the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO), one was a paired eye study (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>), and other two were single eye studies (<LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> showed posterior capsule opacification occurred less commonly in the PHACO group (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92). <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK> showed there was significant less posterior capsule opacification (10.6% v 38.3%) in patients who underwent PHACO who had pseudoexfoliation syndrome and <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK> found a higher rate of posterior capsule opacification in the extracapsular group (35% v 11%) in diabetic patients. The population subgroups of these three studies are not comparable so an overall analysis of PCO was not carried out. <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK> found no significant difference between the two groups with respect to postoperative incidence of pseudophakic macula oedema (four cases PHACO versus six ECCE cases), postoperative incidence of progression of diabetic retinopathy or development of high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Three studies showed significantly more inflammation in the ECCE group in the early postoperative period but no difference at three months (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>). Although the time interval at which postoperative inflammation is recorded are similar in the three studies the data is recorded in different formats, qualitative (<LINK REF="STD-Dowler-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dowler 2000</LINK>), expressed as median and interquartile range (<LINK REF="STD-Laurell-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Laurell 1998</LINK>) and mean and standard deviation (<LINK REF="STD-Chee-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chee 1999</LINK>), hence we have been unable to compare them statistically. We have contacted the authors of these studies to request the raw data to undertake the appropriate analysis. Corneal decompensation was not reported.</P>
<P>
<I>(d) corneal endothelial cell dysfunction</I>
<BR/>Corneal endothelial cell loss was reported in three studies. However, due to the heterogeneity in follow up time (<LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> - 30 days, <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> - 6 weeks, <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> - 1 year) it was not possible to compare them statistically. We have contacted the authors of the latter study to request the raw data at six weeks to undertake the appropriate meta-analysis.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> showed a significant increase in endothelial permeability, corneal thickness and coefficient of variation in the early postoperative period in the extracapsular group. Three studies have shown no difference in mean percentage endothelial cell loss between the two groups at respective follow up times (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> (4.72% ECCE v 5.41% PHACO), <LINK REF="STD-Ravalico-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ravalico 1997</LINK> (10.1% ECCE v 8.5% PHACO), <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> (9.1% ECCE v 10.5% PHACO). In the <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> study however PHACO was associated with a higher risk of severe cell loss in patients with hard cataract (P = 0.04 RR 3.7, 95% CI 1.03 to 13.34).</P>
<P>
<I>(e) costs</I>
<BR/>Two studies have looked at cost in different economic settings. In the <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> study in the UK, the average cost of PHACO was similar to ECCE i.e. £332.89 compared to £335.07. <LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK> in Malaysia found ECCE to be significantly cheaper than PHACO i.e. RM 1,664.46 (RM 1,233.04 to RM 2,377.64) v RM 1,978.00 (RM 1,557.87 to RM 3,334.50). However, the follow up was short (only 2 months) and the study did not include future clinic visits for removal of sutures.</P>

<B>(2) PHACO WITH PCIOL VERSUS MSICS WITH PCIOL</B>
<BR/>Two studies have compared this intervention (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK> 1.6% (3/185) of the PHACO group and 1.6% (3/187) of the MSICS group had BCVA worse than 6/18 i.e. did not achieve functional vision at 6 weeks RR 1.01 (95%CI 0.21 to 4.94). 0.5% of the PHACO group and 0% of the MSICS group have a poor outcome following surgery (BSCVA &lt; 6/60). In the <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> study there was only 1 patient with BSCVA worse than 6/18 (who was in the MSICS group). We have statistically compared the visual outcomes in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>.<B>
<BR/>

<BR/>
<I>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK> showed 7/199 (3.5%) of the PHACO group and 12/201 (6%) of the MSICS had PC tears (P = 0.43). Both groups had 2 patients with iridodialysis and 1 with zonule dialysis. One patient in the PHACO group had a drop nucleus and one in the MSICS group had a detachment of Descemet's membrane. Two patients in the PHACO group had an extension of their anterior capsulorhexis and another 2 had to convert to MSICS due to intraoperative difficulty. There were no intraoperative complications from the <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> study. The PC tear/ vitreous loss are statistically compared in <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>.<B>

<BR/>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>From <LINK REF="STD-Gogate-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gogate 2005</LINK> 4 (PHACO) v 5 (MSICS) patients developed iritis postoperatively. Nine per cent (18/185) PHACO and 4.5% (9/187) MSICS (P = 0.073) developed corneal oedema on the first day which had resolved by 6 weeks in both groups. Three patients developed a shallow anterior chamber on day 1 (1 PHACO, 2 MSICS). Three patients in the PHACO and 4 in the MSICS had retained cortical matter. There was no documentation about postoperative complications in <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>.<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>(d) corneal endothelial cell count</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> showed no statistically significant difference in endothelial cell loss between the two groups. The sample size of the study was adequate to detect a difference of 7% in endothelial cell loss between techniques with a power of 80%. There was a mean 5.41% (N = 60,SD 10.99) induced cell loss in PHACO at 6 weeks follow-up compared with 4.21% (N = 53, SD 10.29) for MSICS.</P>

<BR/>Two studies have compared this intervention (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK> study 13.3% (48/362) of the ECCE group and 10.2 % (35/344) of the MSICS group had a BSCVA &lt; 6/18 i.e. a poor functional visual outcome in the operated eye RR 1.30 (95%CI 0.86 to 1.96), there was no significant difference between the two groups (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>). Four patients (1.1%) in ECCE group and 6 (1.7%) in MSICS group had poor visual outcome (BSCVA &lt;6/60) in the operated eye, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> 1/53 cases had BSCVA &lt; 6/18 in MSICS group compared to 5 in the ECCE group (3 related to high astigmatism, 1 posterior capsule opacification and 1 anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy). Only one patient, had a VA &lt; 6/60 and they were in the ECCE group (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>).<BR/>
<I>
<BR/>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK> study, 21 of the patients in the MSICS group were converted to ECCE either due to density of cataract or because of small pupil. Seventeen of the ECCE group and 29 of the MSICS group had intraoperative complications RR 1.04 (95% CI 1 to 1.08) this was not significantly different. Ten out of 383 (6 with vitreous loss) in the ECCE group and 18/358 (6 with vitreous loss) in the MSICS had posterior capsule tears OR 0.51 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.11) (see <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>). Two patients in the MSICS group had iridodialysis. There were no complications during surgery in the <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> study (we have reaffirmed this by contacting the author).<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK> study 94/383 in the ECCE group and 121/358 in the MSICS group had postoperative complications in the first 6 weeks RR 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25); the majority were mild (27.1%) (<LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> grade 1). There were no severe complications (<LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> grade 3), moderate complications were seen in 3/383 ECCE group and 5/358 in the MSICS group RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.02), there was no significant difference between the two groups. Mild complications e.g. descemet's folds, iritis and corneal oedema were more commonly seen in MSICS group (32.4% v 23.7% ECCE group). Posterior capsule opacification was seen equally in both groups (3/383 ECCE v 4/358 MSICS).</P>
<P>
<I>(d) corneal endothelial cell count</I>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> study showed there was no statistically significant difference in endothelial cell loss between the two groups. The sample size was adequate to detect a 7% difference in endothelial cell count between the groups, giving a power of 80%. There was a mean 4.72% (N = 52, SD 13.07) induced cell loss in ECCE at 6 weeks follow-up compared with 4.21% (N = 53, SD 10.29) for MSICS.<BR/>
<BR/>(e) costs<BR/>In the <LINK REF="STD-PUNE" TYPE="STUDY">PUNE</LINK> study there was no significant difference in surgical time or cost between the two procedures, even accounting for surgeon variation. The average cost of ECCE was US $15.82, MSICS US $15.68 of which US $11.34 was a fixed facility cost common to both. It is not clear from the paper the power of this study to detect a difference in costing with this sample size hence we have contacted the authors to clarify this.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>(4) ECCE WITH PCIOL VERSUS ICCE WITH ACIOL </B>
<BR/>One study compared this intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>The proportion not achieving good functional vision following surgery was 18% in the ACIOL group and 16% in the PCIOL group RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.61 to 2.08). The difference was not statistically significant. Eleven per cent of patients with ACIOL and 9% of patients with PCIOL had a poor visual outcome following surgery RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.82). There was no significant difference in the final refractions between the two groups. In this study no biometry was performed, patients received standard power lens.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>There was no difference in overall incidence of complications between the two groups. Nine eyes randomised to PCIOLs were converted to ACIOL because of capsule rupture or zonule dehiscence at surgery, 1 eye randomised to ACIOL inadvertently received a PCIOL.</P>
<P>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>Twelve eyes that received ACIOL underwent secondary procedures; 8 had removal of post-inflammatory membranes, 3 had repeat peripheral iridectomy due to iris bombé, 1 had replacement of displaced lens. Five eyes that received PCIOLs had secondary procedures. Three had removal of thickened anterior capsule flap, 2 had removal of residual lens matter. Non-surgical interventional complications occurred in 5 eyes with ACIOL and 3 eyes with PCIOL. In the ACIOL group, 3 had iris bombé, 1 developed an anterior chamber blood clot and one developed a hypopyon. In the PCIOL group 2 eyes developed posterior capsule thickening, 1 eye developed a postoperative anterior chamber blood clot. This study only addresses IOL implants in African patients hence the degree of inflammation cannot be extrapolated to patients from other ethnic groups.</P>
<P>
<B>(5) ECCE WITH PCIOL VERSUS ICCE WITH AG</B>
<BR/>One trial compared these types of surgery (<LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>Best-corrected vision less than 6/60 occurred in 0.6% of the ECCE-PCIOL group compared to 1.6% of the ICCE-AG group. People in the ECCE-PCIOL were less likely to experience a poor outcome one year after surgery (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.84). Functional vision less than 6/18 was recorded in 16% of people receiving IOLs and 15% of people receiving spectacles (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.28). This analysis includes 155 participants who did not present with personal eye glasses at follow-up.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>Vitreous loss during surgery was reported in 1.7% of participants in the <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>. Capsular rupture combined with vitreous loss was observed in 1.7% of the ECCE-PCIOL group.</P>
<P>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>Posterior capsular opacification occurred in 9% of the ECCE-PCIOL group at one year. There were eight cases of corneal decompensation, four in each group and eight cases of retinal detachment, three in the ECCE-PCIOL group compared to five in the ICCE-AG group. Macular oedema, the diagnosis of which was verified with fluorescein angiography, occurred more frequently in the ICCE-AG group. There were 23/1474 in the ECCE-PCIOL group compared to 59/1401 in the ICCE-AG group (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60).</P>
<P>
<I>(d) quality of life </I>
<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> study was the only study that examined quality of life. In both study groups participants' responses showed large improvements in visual functioning and quality of life. With improvement in visual acuity from 20/60 to 20/20 there was an increase in visual functioning and quality of life for both procedures with the advantage of ECCE with PCIOL over ICCE with AG across all visual categories. The visual functioning and quality of life sub-scale scores associated with lens implant visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/60 showed consistently the same or slightly better than participants operated without lens implant associated with visual acuity scores of 20/20.</P>
<P>
<B>(6) ICCE WITH ACIOL VERSUS ICCE WITH AG </B>
<BR/>Two trials compared these interventions (<LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>Best corrected vision worse than 6/60 was reported in 2.6% of the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to 2.2% of the ICCE-AG group in the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> study (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.14). In <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> with data up to two years after surgery, 3.9% of the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to 3.6% of the ICCE-AG group had best corrected acuity less than 6/60 one year after surgery (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.96). The pooled relative risk from these two studies is 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.72. The visual outcome BCVA worse than 6/60 at one year is statistically compared in <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>.<B>
<BR/>
</B>The whole cohort taking part in the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> trial was invited for re-examination two to five years after surgery; 65% were re-examined. There were 13 new cases of best corrected acuity less than 6/60 occurring after one year follow-up, nine in the ICCE-ACIOL group and four in the ICCE-AG (odds ratio 2.1, 95% CI 0.59 to 9.55). There was no indication that lens-related problems increased over time.</P>
<P>Functional vision less than 6/18 was reported in 55% of the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to 41% of the ICCE-AG group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.49) in the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> study. The visual outcome BCVA worse than 6/18 at one year for the two studies is statistically compared in <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>.<B>
<BR/>
</B>There were similar numbers of people severely visually impaired and blind in both groups at all follow-up times. The exception to this is at one year when there were more people functionally blind in the ICCE-AG. This occurred due to the loss of aphakic glasses. There was a 60% reduced risk of functional blindness in the ICCE-ACIOL group one year after surgery. Significant astigmatism was approximately four times more common in the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to ICCE-AG group. Most participants in both groups had 'against the rule' astigmatism, 446 or 88.8% (95% CI 86.0 to 91.6) and 348 or 83.5% (95% CI 79.9 to 87.1) respectively.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> pre-operative assessment was not standardised as two centres used different types of biometry and one centre did not use biometry. In addition, the results were not presented strictly according to the definition of functional vision used in this review. Visual acuity was presented with the entire aphakic group having +10 spectacle correction. This analysis showed that 51% of the ACIOL group had functional vision less than 6/18 compared to 46% of the aphakic group (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24). As the outcome is not strictly the same in these two cases, we have not calculated an overall summary score. In the <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> a limbal incision was used in 91% of patients. No comparative data are available on degree of astigmatism.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>There were similar numbers of peroperative complications in the two groups in <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>. Vitreous disturbance leading to vitrectomy occurred in 69/616 (11.2%) of the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to 58/613 (9.5%) of the ICCE-AG group. In <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> 2.9% of the ICCE-ACIOL group received an anterior vitrectomy compared to 0.4% of the ICCE-AG group.</P>
<P>
<I>(c) clinical complications </I>
<BR/>Corneal endothelial cell loss after six week follow-up was 17% in the IOL group and 14.4% in the aphakic group (P &lt; 0.05) in the <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> trial. After six weeks there was no significant difference in the continuing cell loss between eyes having no lens compared to eyes with lens (12 months: IOL 5.3%, AG 4.1%, P = 0.06; 24 months: IOL 3.1%, AG 2.9% P = 0.71).<BR/>The <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> studies reported other complications related only to severe visual impairment. On the whole, these complications occurred infrequently. The power of these studies to detect differences, even when the results are pooled, is therefore low.</P>
<P>Retinal detachment: There were few cases of retinal detachment and so the power of these studies to detect a difference was low. At one year after surgery, there were 8/1430 in the ICCE-AG groups and 2/1437 in the ICCE-ACIOL groups (pooled RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.20). However, later follow-up in the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> study found four more cases of retinal detachment in the ICCE-ACIOL group, further evidence for little difference between the two groups in incidence of retinal detachment.</P>
<P>Glaucoma: In <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> secondary glaucoma as a cause of visual loss was reported more commonly in the ICCE-ACIOL group (five cases) compared to the ICCE-AG group (no cases). Uveitis was also found more commonly in the ACIOL group compared with the aphakic group. <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> reports the presence of secondary glaucoma at 0.1% with no significant difference between the groups.</P>
<P>Cystoid macula oedema: There were two cases of cystoid macular oedema in the ICCE-ACIOL group in <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> compared to none in the ICCE-AG group. In <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> three cases in the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to two in the ICCE-ACIOL group. The pooled relative risk of having severe visual impairment due to cystoid macula oedema in the ICCE-ACIOL group compared to ICCE-AG group was 2.2 (0.49 to 9.79).</P>
<P>Corneal endothelial decompensation: This occurred rarely. In <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> there was one case at one year that occurred in the ICCE-AG group. No further cases were identified after one year. In <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> there was one case in the IOL group.<BR/>The clinical complications for retinal detachment, macular oedema and corneal decompensation are statistically compared in <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>.<B>

<B>(7) STUDIES OF OLDER LENS TYPES</B>
<BR/>There were two studies that considered older lens types (<LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK>). The data for these studies are not presented in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>
<I>(a) visual outcomes</I>
<BR/>Best-corrected vision of less than 6/60 was not reported as an outcome in the <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> study. In this study, 96% of ICCE without IOL, 84% of ICCE with iris clip lens and 84% of ECCE with iridocapsular lens had best corrected vision better or equal to 6/12 at one year after surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> the vision outcomes at two years after surgery were presented as medians and mean. There was a non-significant difference between the two study groups. In the ICCE-ACIOL group the mean visual acuity was 0.72 (standard deviation 0.237) compared to 0.74 (standard deviation 0.194) in the ECCE-PCIOL group.</P>
<P>
<I>(b) complications during surgery</I>
<BR/>Vitreous loss was reported in 4% of cases in <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>. Capsular rupture was reported in 2.5% of <LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK> cases. The study found a total cell loss of 14.9% 24 months after surgery. There was a significantly higher continuing cell loss with the iridocapsular lens compared to the iris clip lens or no lens implantation. Many of these corneas decompensated two years after surgery.</P>
<P>
<I>(c) clinical complications</I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> reports the presence of secondary glaucoma of 1.2%. Cystoid macula oedema is reported in both studies. Only <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> verified the findings with fluorescein angiography. Posterior capsular opacification was reported in the three studies that included an ECCE group and was the most frequent complication relating to visual impairment (all grades of impairment) ranging from 0.5% at one year and 13.5% at four years (in a random sub-sample) in the <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> study to 29.6% in the <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> study. <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> also reported a 3.1% frequency of toxic lens syndrome.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The studies reported in this review cover a wide range of countries and this must be considered in the formulation of any recommendations from the data. There is certainly a trend for intracapsular surgery to be supplanted by ECCE and PCIOL and more recently in the Indian subcontinent to be supplanted by MSICS. Even within the Indian subcontinent there is a marked difference between results of cataract camps and hospital based (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>) treatments so when comparing results from different trials knowledge of the setting of the study is vital.</P>
<P>High volume surgery, which simply means surgical techniques with high patient throughput, is needed in the Indian subcontinent and Africa where cataract is common and resources are limited with almost three to six million blind from cataract (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foster-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foster 1991</LINK>). However, any high volume procedure must also focus on quality. In a strive for the latter there is a trend for intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) to be replaced with ECCE with PCIOL implantation; the former technique is still being used in up to 40% of total surgeries in some developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1998</LINK>). The three studies conducted in Asia (<LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK>) are therefore relevant to the issue of the prevention of cataract blindness.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison of results of the three large studies in South Asia</B>
<BR/>There were important differences between these trials that need to be highlighted before interpreting the results. <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> was performed by a few surgeons in one centre of excellence using operating microscopes. The power of the lens required was calculated using biometry before surgery. The <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> study was conducted in a remote rural eye hospital in the Terai region of Nepal. No attempt was made to estimate the power of lens required before surgery. All surgery was done using 4.5 X loupe magnification by two highly trained surgeons. The <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> study was similar to <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> and was conducted in three centres, in India (Hyderabad), Bangladesh (Chittagong) and western Nepal and 19 surgeons undertook the operations. This study may well be more representative of usual surgical practice and ability, thereby having a greater external validity. The data in this review suggest that intracapsular extraction with a modern multiflex anterior chamber lens implant has similar safety and effectiveness as intracapsular extraction with aphakic glasses (AG) in the developing country setting. In the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> studies, the risk of a poor visual outcome (visual acuity less than 6/60) one to two years after surgery did not increase after implantation of an anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) compared to intracapsular extraction without implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). At one year follow-up there were more people functionally blind in the intracapsular extraction with aphakic glasses (control) group due to the loss of aphakic spectacles. There were three cases of corneal decompensation identified 12 to 24 months after surgery in 2867 participants. Two of these cases occurred in the control group that is only one case of corneal decompensation occurred in a person with an ACIOL. Long term follow-up of up to five years after surgery did not show any increased risk of corneal decompensation. In the <LINK REF="STD-LAHAN" TYPE="STUDY">LAHAN</LINK> study only, uveitis and secondary glaucoma occurred more frequently in eyes with an anterior chamber lens implant. Relatively high rates of uveitis were also seen in a non-randomised trial conducted in a black African population in southern Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1998</LINK>). Higher rates of poor visual outcome were observed in <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> where many surgeons in three different centres conducted the operations, however, these were still less than five per cent (visual acuity 6/60) and there was no increased risk associated with implantation of anterior chamber lenses. In addition, corneal endothelial lens measurements in the <LINK REF="STD-SACMS" TYPE="STUDY">SACMS</LINK> study did not give cause for concern in contrast with previous studies with now outdated anterior chamber lenses (<LINK REF="STD-OCTET" TYPE="STUDY">OCTET</LINK>). Corneal decompensation was commonly seen with the first generations of anterior chamber lenses the first two to five years after implantation. Clinico-pathological data from developed country settings have shown no indication that the new generation of ACIOLs (<LINK REF="REF-Apple-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Apple 2000</LINK>) have given rise to a new epidemic of corneal complications.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison between intracapsular and extracapsular extraction.<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vogel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Vogel 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK> were the only studies that compared two different surgical techniques. These studies showed that there were no clinically relevant differences in the visual acuity distributions of both BSCVA and UCVA between ECCE-PCIOL and ICCE-AG/ ACIOL. However, 155 patients lost their aphakic glasses at follow up; an obvious disadvantage. Overall there was no significant difference in complication incidence between the two techniques but the studies were not appropriately powered to detect differences, if the incidence of the complications is small. However, intracapsular extraction gave a significantly higher frequency of cystoid macular oedema (<LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>) but this did not significantly increase the number of participants with severe vision loss (&lt; 6/60). The documented secondary procedures by <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK> may be reduced by improved surgical technique in the ECCE group which would affect the overall results. All of the studies showed a significant increase of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) in the ECCE and PCIOL groups, 0.5% at one year and 13.5% after four years (random sub-sample). The long-term effect on vision will depend on the availability of Nd YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Long-term complications of ACIOL, for example stability in anterior chamber, glaucoma, corneal endothelial cell loss and the effect of training surgeons to perform the more complicated ECCE-PCIOL procedure were not addressed in these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Waddell-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Waddell 2004</LINK> was a paired eye study and was analysed by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test. Substantial improvements in vision-related quality of life were reported by people taking part in the <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> study. These improvements were more marked in people receiving an IOL compared to people receiving aphakic glasses.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison between phacoemulsification and extracapsular surgery</B>
<BR/>The introduction of any new surgical technique requires validation against the previous gold standard to show an improvement in quality. There are nine trials that have compared these two techniques. They suggest a better UCVA following PHACO than ECCE . The majority of the trials showed no difference in best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) between the two groups apart from <LINK REF="STD-Katsimpris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katsimpris 2004</LINK> which showed better vision in the PHACO group. However, this result may be due to the higher intraoperative complications and greater PCO in the ECCE group affecting vision. The complication rate both early and late was significantly lower in the PHACO group in all studies. Even though the endothelial cell loss was comparable between the two techniques there was a higher risk of severe loss in the PHACO group associated with removal of dense cataracts. The costs per procedure were not markedly different between the two techniques in a UK based study (<LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK>), however, a Malaysian study (<LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>) showed ECCE to be significantly cheaper. The results of this study are limited by the fact the follow up was short and the ECCE group of participants still required a minimum of two further hospital visits for suture removal which was not accounted for in the costing. Extrapolation of these costs to other parts of the world where cataract surgery costs are very different must be made with caution.</P>
<P>
<B>Comparison between phacoemulsification and manual small incision cataract surgery <BR/>
</B>In an effort to combat the initial outlay of costs of PHACO, MSICS is an appealing alternative that may be performed in a high volume setting. Manual small incision cataract surgery offers an alterative to developing countries where there is a mixed population of hospital based and camp based cataract services. Two studies compared results of these two techniques, with PHACO having a significantly improved proportion of patients with uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) &gt;= to 6/18 (81.1% v 71%), there was no difference in BSCVA. There was no difference in the average postoperative astigmatism or surgical induced astigmatism between PHACO and MSICS but significantly less patients had &lt; 1 D astigmatism in the PHACO group (P = 0.04). There was no statistical difference in the number of patients who did not achieve functional vision in the operated eye, who had a poor visual outcome and surgical complications (including endothelial cell loss) between the two groups. There are few papers comparing costs of these two techniques as yet.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Comparison between extracapsular extraction and manual small incision cataract surgery </B>
<BR/>Studies comparing these two techniques have shown a significantly better UCVA &gt;= 6/18 and surgical induced astigmatism in the MSICS group (47.9%) v ECCE group (37.3%) RR 1.21 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.37) (P = 0.0001), but no difference in BSCVA between the two groups.<BR/>There was no significant difference in complications or costs between the two groups. However, MSICS was advocated as procedure of choice due to equal costs and better unaided visual acuity results.</P>
<P>An observation from our meta-analyses is the heterogeneity of visual outcome data and follow up times amongst studies examining results following PHACO. This made statistical comparison between studies difficult and hence a uniform criteria for reporting the visual results from PHACO trials needs to be established. Firstly it is important that both UCVA and BCVA should be recorded. A decreased UCVA compared to best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) maybe due to surgically induced astigmatism, which has been found to be the case with MSICS (<LINK REF="REF-Venkatesh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesh 2005</LINK>). The difference between UCVA and BCVA often shows that residual refractive error is a major cause of poor visual outcome, just considering BCVA underestimates visual impairment. Therefore it would be useful to report UCVA and BCVA &gt; 6/12, especially in trials involving PHACO and MSICS in developing countries. This would give an estimate of the uncorrected refractive error (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2006</LINK>) in patients following cataract surgery hence a further estimate of the overall cost to the patient. A suggestion would be for each study to report those patients with poor visual outcomes as those who did not achieve UCVA and BCVA of 6/60 and who did not achieve UCVA and BCVA of 6/18. They should also report good visual outcomes, as the number of patients with postoperative best corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or better (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 1999</LINK>). This level of vision is often used as the level of vision required for daily tasks (<LINK REF="REF-Congdon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Congdon 2004</LINK>). The World Health Organisation definitions of visual impairment are based only on distance visual acuity. There may be subsets of persons who have poor distance vision and good near vision or vice versa and these may impact on quality of life in different ways (<LINK REF="REF-Dandona-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dandona 2006</LINK>). Therefore, it would be useful to record near vision pre and postoperatively. The difference in the level of astigmatism when comparing the surgical techniques is particularly relevant in populations that have limited access to spectacles. It is clear that sutureless surgery produces less astigmatism and provides patients with faster visual recovery and fewer follow-up visits than surgery involving sutures.<BR/>It would also be easier to compare postoperative visual outcomes at standard time intervals. Although it is reasonable to compare PHACO and MSICS visual outcomes at six weeks it is not appropriate to compare these with techniques requiring sutures such as ECCE and ICCE which require a longer period for vision stabilisation due to suture induced astigmatism. A suggested standard time interval to record visual acuity would be six weeks, three months and one year postoperatively. It is recognised that long-term follow up is a challenge especially in developing countries.</P>
<P>Extracapsular cataract surgery is rapidly becoming more popular in developing countries and replacing ICCE. In India more than 50% of cataract surgeries are ECCE (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1998</LINK>), yet there is little clinical data which compares intraoperative and long-term outcomes of extracapsular surgery conducted with sutures and sutureless surgery techniques (manual phacofragmentation or PHACO). Particular attention is required to assess the incidence of intraoperative complications (capsular rupture/ vitreous loss) and the long-term vision threatening complications including the frequency of PCO. Outcome studies have indicated that prospective follow up for at least three years would provide such information (<LINK REF="REF-Shrestha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shrestha 2001</LINK>). </P>
<P>Trials on comparative costing of surgical systems and procedures are needed to compare the cost benefit in intervention programmes for cataract blindness. Although there have been cost comparisons of PHACO and ECCE there has been few trials comparing the cost of MSICS. <LINK REF="STD-MEHOX" TYPE="STUDY">MEHOX</LINK> (UK study) found PHACO and ECCE to have similar costs whereas the Malaysian study (<LINK REF="STD-Rizal-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rizal 2003</LINK>) found ECCE to be significantly cheaper, but this study did not include postoperative clinic visits. Other reports in the literature have documented higher providers costs for PHACO in comparison to ECCE (<LINK REF="REF-Asimakis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asimakis 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Muralikrishnan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muralikrishnan 2004</LINK> looked at the economic cost of cataract surgery for PHACO, ECCE with IOL and MSICS in Southern India. The providers costs were highest for PHACO (US $25.55) compared to MSICS ($17.03) and ECCE ($16.25), due to the need for expensive equipment and consumables for PHACO. The patients costs (direct and indirect ) were highest for ECCE due to the increased number of days required for follow-up which incurs transportation and economic productivity loss. As a result MSICS was the lowest cost, whereas PHACO and ECCE had similar total costs (<LINK REF="REF-Muralikrishnan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muralikrishnan 2004</LINK>). This study only reports on the cost of cataract surgical procedures, not on both costs and outcomes, which is what would be required for a cost-effectiveness study. The evidence suggests that MSICS which achieves similar visual outcome results to PHACO but is less expensive maybe the technique of choice. However further evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of PHACO and MSICS is required prior to a change in policy. Cost is an important issue as it has proven to be one of the major barriers to the uptake of surgery by patients in developing countries, especially in Nigeria, Nepal (<LINK REF="REF-Yorston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yorston 2005</LINK>) and Pakistan (<LINK REF="REF-Anjum-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anjum 2006</LINK>). Patients in most communities are willing to pay the equivalent of one month's wages for a cataract operation, therefore the cost of surgery should be based on the paying capacity of the population being treated.</P>
<P>There are also few comparative studies assessing the effect of different cataract extraction techniques on functioning vision and quality of life. Evaluation of cataract surgery outcomes should not be based on postoperative visual acuity alone It is important to show that the reduction in functional ability caused by cataract can be reversed by surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mamidipudi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamidipudi 2003</LINK>). It would be useful to evaluate quality of life, overall visual function and time taken to resume daily activities/ work following each of the surgical techniques. Solely considering visual outcomes does not give all the answers to which surgical technique is preferable for the patient, doctor or health care provider. <BR/> <BR/>When assessing cataract surgical techniques outcome studies are also useful sources. For example, <LINK REF="REF-Venkatesh-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Venkatesh 2005</LINK> was an outcome study carried out at the same institute as <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK>. In this case the outcome study had less favourable visual outcomes than the randomised controlled trial. This was thought to be the case because <LINK REF="STD-MIOLS" TYPE="STUDY">MIOLS</LINK> had strict exclusion criteria and the outcome study did not exclude any patients with ocular co-morbidity. The outcome study was designed to demonstrate what happens on a routine basis rather than compare the effectiveness of procedures. Outcome studies are particularly useful for looking at adverse events such as postoperative endophthalmitis (<LINK REF="REF-Montan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-West-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">West 2005</LINK>) and provide useful information for rare events but care must be taken when interpreting results to assess for bias. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>This review provides evidence from nine randomised controlled trials that phacoemulsification (PHACO) gives a better visual outcome than extracapsular extraction with sutures. The majority of these trials have been conducted in developed countries in a specialised hospital setting. Comparative clinical data between manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS), extracapsular extraction and phacoemulsification is only documented in a few studies but has shown the former technique to give better visual results than extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and only slightly inferior to phacoemulsification in a developing world setting. When choosing the surgical procedure each patient should be examined on a case by case basis as each surgical technique has its limitations. The contraindications to MSICS include poor zonular integrity as a result of pseudoexfoliation, decompensated cornea and hard nuclear cataract (&gt; grade IV).</P>
<P>Further work on cost / benefit of the introduction of sutureless surgery (manual phacofragmentation or PHACO) in programmes for the prevention of cataract blindness in the developing country setting is needed.</P>
<P>This review also found evidence that ECCE with a posterior chamber lens implant provides better visual outcome than intracapsular extraction with aphakic glasses or anterior chamber intraocular lens. This finding is based on the results of two trials. The data in the review also suggests that intracapsular extraction with an anterior chamber lens implant is an effective alternative to intracapsular extraction with aphakic glasses, with similar safety.</P>
<P>This review does not provide any evidence from controlled trials as to the rates of corneal complications with anterior chamber lenses more than seven or eight years after surgery. However, observational data from developed country settings do not indicate that this is likely to be a problem. Posterior capsular opacification in extracapsular extraction is common - the clinical implications in the developing world have not yet been fully documented. <BR/>No comparative data from developing regions outside India are available on the different surgical approaches and there are few published studies to give a basis for cost benefit analysis comparing the different surgical procedures. <BR/>Most young ophthalmologists in developing countries learn exclusively extracapsular techniques as this has been adopted as the primary surgery of choice. Technically MSICS is more difficult than a standard manual ECCE. Additional skills of hydro-dissection and hydro-delineation are required for MSICS but these are also useful for surgeons going on to learn PHACO. If these techniques are to be included in a cataract management programme it is important that ophthalmologists have received proper training in the techniques.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Considering the vast number of cataract surgical procedures performed worldwide there are few randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical techniques. Further data from developing regions are needed to compare all aspects of intraocular lens surgery with the four main surgical procedures - intracapsular extraction with an anterior chamber lens, extracapsular surgery with a posterior chamber lens with or without sutures, phacoemulsification and manual small incision cataract surgery. To make comparisons of the data between studies possible we propose setting a standard visual acuity recording system:<BR/>1. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 6/60, UCVA and BCVA worse than 6/18 and UCVA and BCVA of better than 6/12.<BR/>2. Visual acuity recording postoperatively at six weeks and one year. (Six weeks post operatively is the time at which refraction is recommended as vision is thought to have stabilised). <BR/>3. Near vision to be recorded pre and postoperatively.</P>
<P>Further randomised controlled trials are required: <BR/>1. To compare ECCE with PCIOL and MSICS with PCIOL with longer term follow-up (preferably one, three and five years) to assess whether PCO occurs more frequently with either technique.<BR/>2. A larger study with at least one year follow up is required to compare PHACO and MSICS in terms of corneal endothelial cell loss (<LINK REF="STD-George-2005" TYPE="STUDY">George 2005</LINK> is the only RCT that looks at this and is a small study with N = 53), and posterior capsular opacification. Other outcomes of interest are intraoperative complications, visual acuity and surgically induced astigmatism. <BR/>3. MSICS is performed by different techniques with variation in incision shape and site (superior or temporal), type of capsulotomy (continuous curvilinear, can opener or endocapsular) and use of viscoelastic or AC maintainer. A study of the optimal surgical technique comparing these variations is required. <BR/>4. To compare both the costs (providers and patients) and outcomes of PHACO, ECCE and MSICS techniques.<BR/>5. To assess the effect of the surgical techniques on quality of life.<BR/>6. To assess the effect of the surgical techniques on near vision as well as distance vision. </P>
<P>Techniques in cataract surgery are always changing but they are not usually subjected to trials, rather trial and error. It is important when considering trial design that a single surgeon performing both procedures does not produce a surgeon effect. This is bias introduced by a surgeon having more expertise in one intervention as compared to the other. To reduce bias the patient should be randomised to expert surgeons in each technique rather than having the same surgeon performing both procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Devereaux-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devereaux 2005</LINK>). It is difficult for large scale randomised controlled trials (which take many years to execute, require long follow-up for rare but important outcomes and are expensive) to keep pace with the changing techniques and fashions but the evidence is needed before these changes are implemented.</P>
