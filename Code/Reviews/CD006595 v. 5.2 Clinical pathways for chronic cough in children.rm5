<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Clinical pathways serve as a tool or algorithm (like a flow chart) that can be used in the treatment of patients with various chronic diseases. They provide a clear guide that assists doctors in diagnosing an illness and in making decisions with the patient about what treatment is needed or which specialists should be seen or tests ordered at each stage of progression of the disease. Overall the aim of clinical pathways is to provide efficient care for patients. Examples of patient decision aids are provided by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK at http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/index.php/shared-decision-making/about-the-pdas/.</P>
<P>Chronic cough in children is a significant medical problem that in some situations warrants thorough investigation. This review examined whether using clinical pathways was effective for evaluating and managing children with chronic cough (cough lasting longer than 4 weeks).</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Only a single multi-centre study could be included in this review. Evidence is current to January 2014. This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This study of 272 children in five Australian hospitals reported that those randomly assigned to earlier treatment according to a clinical pathway showed improved clinical outcomes (cough resolved earlier and quality of life was better) compared with those who were randomly assigned to later use of the pathway. No adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence was graded as moderate. Evidence is limited, as only one study could be included in this review. This study was unable to completely blind participants to the clinical pathway.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-05 09:47:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Chronic cough (a cough lasting longer than four weeks) is a common problem internationally. Chronic cough has associated economic costs and is distressing to the child and to parents; ignoring cough may lead to delayed diagnosis and progression of serious underlying respiratory disease. Clinical guidelines have been shown to lead to efficient and effective patient care and can facilitate clinical decision making. Cough guidelines have been designed to facilitate the management of chronic cough. However, treatment recommendations vary, and specific clinical pathways for the treatment of chronic cough in children are important, as causes of and treatments for cough vary significantly from those in adults. Therefore, systematic evaluation of the use of evidence-based clinical pathways for the management of chronic cough in children would be beneficial for clinical practice and for patient care. Use of a management algorithm can improve clinical outcomes; such management guidelines can be found in the guidelines for cough provided by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS).</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>One study was included in the review. This multi-centre trial was based in five Australian hospitals and recruited 272 children with chronic cough. Children were randomly assigned to early (two weeks) or delayed (six weeks) referral to respiratory specialists who used a cough management pathway. When an intention-to-treat analysis was performed, clinical failure at six weeks post randomisation (defined as &lt; 75% improvement in cough score, or total resolution for fewer than three consecutive days) was significantly less in the early pathway arm compared with the control arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.58). These results indicate that one additional child will be cured for every five children treated via the cough pathway (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5, 95% CI 3 to 9) at six weeks. Cough-specific parent-reported quality of life scores were significantly better in the early-pathway group; the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.60 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.01). Duration of cough post randomisation was significantly shorter in the intervention group (early-pathway arm) compared with the control group (delayed-pathway arm) (MD -2.70 weeks, 95% CI -4.26 to -1.14).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-05 09:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Current evidence suggests that using a clinical algorithm for the management of children with chronic cough in hospital outpatient settings is more effective than providing wait-list care. Futher high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to perform ongoing evaluation of cough management pathways in general practitioner and other primary care settings.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-09-05 09:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-05 09:49:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cough is the most common symptom presenting to primary care internationally (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cherry-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cherry 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>). In Australia, 5.8 of every 100 visits to general practitioners are result of cough (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2008</LINK>). Chronic (prolonged) cough is also one of the most common symptoms presenting to respiratory physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 2006</LINK>). Thus, in Australia alone, these visits on a population level would equate to millions of dollars per year in Medicare rebates for general practitioner (GP) visits. Further, studies have shown that more than 80% of children who have seen specialists for chronic cough have had more than five medical visits, and over 20% had seen a doctor more than 20 times (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2008</LINK>). The burden of chronic cough (defined in children as cough lasting longer than four weeks) (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2006</LINK>) is significant, both in terms of personal cost and impaired quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2008</LINK>) and at a societal level when medication costs are substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chronic cough in children causes a significant burden of distress for parents (<LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2008</LINK>). Furthermore, although cough may be seen as a merely troublesome symptom with no serious consequences, ignoring cough that may be the sole presenting symptom of an underlying respiratory disease may lead to delayed diagnosis and progression of serious illness or chronic respiratory morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Barr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barr 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karakoc-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karakoc 2002</LINK>). Thus for the management of chronic cough in children, it is important for clinicians to define which patients will benefit from which interventions and treatment approaches (including 'watchful waiting') (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The major aim of clinical pathways or guidelines is to improve diagnosis and/or management of the specific condition or symptom. They provide a step-by-step approach for the clinician that is based on preceding criteria. Currently, treatment recommendations for cough vary among published guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kohno-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohno 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>), but none have been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). We (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2006</LINK>) and others (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2006</LINK>) have argued that children with chronic cough should be evaluated and treated in accordance with guidelines specific to children, as both causative factors and treatment in children are significantly different from those in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-09-05 09:49:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Clinical guidelines have been shown to provide more efficient and effective patient care (<LINK REF="REF-Fessler-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fessler 2005</LINK>) and, if well designed, can facilitate clinical decision making. This approach in turn should reduce variations in delivery of care and delays in diagnosis or treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kwan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwan 2004</LINK>). Cough guidelines, which were first provided by Irwin (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1990</LINK>), were designed to facilitate the management of chronic cough. Subsequent cough guidelines have been published by various societies.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Cohort studies suggest that use of cough clinical pathways or algorithms improves outcomes (resolution of cough and accurate diagnosis) in children (<LINK REF="STD-Asilsoy-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Asilsoy 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Karabel-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karabel 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Rehman 2009</LINK>) and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Irwin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 1990</LINK>). However, use of guidelines is not universally popular in medical circles (<LINK REF="REF-Preiser-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiser 2004</LINK>) and may arguably result in negative outcomes (e.g. from missed or delayed diagnosis). Clinical guidelines are regarded by some as 'cook-book medicine,' as bothersome and as negating critical thinking (<LINK REF="REF-Berg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berg 1997</LINK>). Examination, through a systematic review, of the effectiveness of using a clinical pathway in treating children with chronic cough would be useful for guiding clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). This is an update of a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Bailey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bailey 2004</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_RESULTS>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The sole study included in the review was a multi-centre study supported by a competitive, non-commercial grant (National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia). The study protocol was published previously (<LINK REF="REF-Chang--2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2010</LINK>). Study authors described the trial as a pragmatic RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2013</LINK>) utilising a standardised clinical management pathway for management of chronic cough in children (i.e. two weeks (early) vs six weeks (delayed) of referral by their referring physician). Children were randomly assigned by their referring physician to an early management pathway (within three weeks of referral to the specialist practice) or to usual care (i.e. later management with the pathway around the six-week waiting period required to obtain a regularly scheduled specialist appointment) (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2013</LINK>). The RCT did not strictly explore intervention versus standard care (i.e. use vs non-use of a clinical pathway), as all participants received the intervention within the timing of the intervention (i.e. merely delayed). Study authors justified the study design by stating that a cluster-blind RCT would not be feasible, as all centres involved in the study had similar standard clinical practices, in line with current recommendations (upon which the cough pathway was designed), and physicians were not comfortable withholding treatment for the purpose of a study. Similarly, the study authors acknowledged that strict time point adherence (rather than "early" and "delayed" use of the pathway) would introduce greater rigour to the study but stated that a pragmatic design was required for the real-life clinical settings in which the study operated (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2013</LINK>). This study was conducted in paediatric hospital outpatient clinics at five centres in Australia, and investigators recruited children who were newly referred with chronic cough (lasting longer than four weeks). A total of 272 participants were included in the study; 152 were male. The mean age of study participants was 4.5 (standard deviation (SD) 3.7) years, and the median duration of cough at enrolment was 16 (interquartile range (IQR) 8 to 32) weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nineteen children were not treated according to the clinical pathway, as they did not attend their first scheduled appointment with the respiratory physician (n = 8 from the intervention group; n = 11 from the control group). A further 22 children were withdrawn from the study (parents withdrew n = 3; lost to follow-up n = 17; protocol violation n = 1; non-adherence n = 1). Baseline data for 253 participants were therefore available, as were complete primary outcome data for 226 participants. Although the study was undertaken to evaluate outcome measures four weeks post use of the pathway in the early-pathway arm and before use of the pathway in the delayed-pathway arm, participating children were seen (hence the pathway was used) at 1.9 (SD 1) weeks and 5.1 (SD 1.8) weeks, respectively. Outcomes of the study were likely diluted.</P>
<P>The study used proportions of cough-free (&gt; 75% improvement in cough or total resolution of cough for three or more days according to cough diary) children and parent-proxy quality of life score, both measured at week six, as the primary outcome measures. Excluded were children with a known chronic respiratory illness (previously diagnosed by a respiratory physician or confirmed on objective tests) such as cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Only a single study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This multi-centre study involved 272 children enrolled from hospital outpatient departments in Australia. This body of evidence was graded as moderate quality through the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. An ITT analysis revealed that clinical failure was significantly lower in the early-pathway arm (clinical review within two weeks) compared with the control arm (delayed use of pathway; clinical review at six weeks) (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.58). For the secondary outcome of mean score for cough-specific parent-reported quality of life, the score was significantly better in the early-pathway group (0.60 units, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.01) compared with the control group. This is seen just at the minimum important difference (MID) (using the distribution method for calculating MID) (<LINK REF="REF-Newcombe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcombe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Newcombe-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Newcombe 2010b</LINK>).

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:49:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Clinical pathways are used for various chronic diseases to facilitate diagnosis; aid decision making; and provide efficient care to patients. Chronic cough in children is a significant medical problem that in some situations warrants thorough investigation. This review is limited, as only data from a single study are available. Nevertheless, data support the use of clinical management pathways for chronic cough in children in a tertiary care setting.</P>
<P>Although the RCT in this review planned to compare outcomes four weeks post use of the pathway in the early-pathway arm and before use of the pathway in the delayed-pathway arm (i.e. within six weeks of referral), pragmatically this was not feasible, and children entered the protocol at times that were not strictly adhered to, resulting in treatment of children by respiratory paediatricians in accordance with the pathway at 1.9 (SD 1) weeks and 5.1 (SD 1.8) weeks, respectively. This flexibility in treatment time means that study results are likely to be diluted, as children in the delayed-pathway arm received treatment before measurements were undertaken.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Limitations</HEADING>
<P>The algorithm applied in the included study was used by respiratory physicians (all but one person was a respiratory physician); therefore, any effect that might be attributed to expertise required to use the algorithm cannot be identified. However, steps within the algorithm are simple and explicit, and most (85%) of the children had diagnoses that could be made easily in primary care. For example, key steps such as distinguishing between wet and dry cough (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2005b</LINK>) and categorising specific versus non-specific cough (<LINK REF="REF-Marchant-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marchant 2006b</LINK>) are both feasible and reliable.</P>
<P>Thus, although the same pathway could be used in general practice, treatment outcomes may be different, as the pathway is dependent on thorough history taking and examination (including identifying the presence of crepitations). In general practice, agreement of items in preschool children (most children with chronic cough are of preschool age) such as wheeze and chest examination findings has been shown to be poor (kappa values range from 0.12 to 0.39) (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2004</LINK>). Thus, applicability of the pathway (without concurrent education) in general practice cannot be ascertained. Further education for primary care providers on how to use the algorithm is likely required for the algorithm to be as successful as was reported in the included study.</P>
<P>A wait-list RCT pragmatic approach was used in the included study. The design of this study is similar to the wait-list approach used for some RCTs, such as those examining psychological interventions or paediatric surgery (e.g. tonsil-adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea), for which primary outcomes are selected before the intervention is decided. Arguably, early versus delayed use of the algorithm represents an alternative valid approach (c.f. use vs non-use of an algorithm) that can be used to determine whether the algorithm is efficacious, as effectively timing the primary outcome (at week six) tests use versus non-use of the algorithm.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-04 11:48:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Given that only one study could be included in this review, the extent of the evidence is limited. Other than the unclear risk of bias associated with blinding of participants, the risk of bias for other criteria was low. This multi-centre study involved a relatively large number of participants (i.e. for cough-related studies). The consistency of favourable outcomes in the intervention arm (including duration of cough post randomisation) supports the unlikely presence of bias. Also, the generic quality of life measure used (PedsQL), which is a less sensitive measure for cough, was not significantly different between groups, but the cough-specific quality of life score (PC-QOL) was significantly better in the early-pathway arm. Arguably, if quality of life was subject to clinically important bias, PedsQL score would also be significantly better in the intervention group (early-pathway arm) compared with the control group (delayed-pathway arm).</P>
<P>In addition to significant differences between groups in primary outcomes (PC-QOL and proportion 'cough-free'), the duration of cough post randomisation was significantly different between groups (early-pathway vs delayed-pathway groups). Cough duration at baseline (Table 1 in the included study) and post use of the algorithm was similar in the two groups. Thus, it is most likely that use of the algorithm accounted for differences between groups.</P>

<P>Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed for ongoing evaluation of the use of clinical pathways for the management of chronic cough in children. In these trials, settings should include general practitioner and other primary care settings and use of the cough algorithm should be compared with non-use of the algorithm. A cluster-randomised trial design is likely the most feasible study design in general practice. Use of validated cough outcome measures is essential. The ascribed diagnostic criteria and the definition of cough resolution should be decided a priori. Ideally, an objective cough outcome (such as cough counts) should also be included as an outcome.</P>

<P>The first review was written primarily by EJB and ABC, who also reviewed the abstracts and articles. In this updated review, EJB and ABC reviewed the searches from 2008 to 2012; GBM and ABC reviewed search data from 2012 to 2014. GBM and ABC extracted and entered data for the 2014 update and drafted the review. All review authors approved the review before submission.</P>

<P>Differences between the protocol and the review are described throughout the text. We updated the risk of bias tool and other methods to bring the review in line with current recommendations provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> and added a summary of findings table. We removed many of the sensitivity analyses specified in methods used previously for this review.</P>
