<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-01-26 15:13:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a long-term, chronic, illness with a worldwide lifetime prevalence of about one per cent. It has a high disability rate and the cost to individuals, their carers and health services is substantial. Although the majority of people with schizophrenia learn to cope in the community, there are some people who need help and reminders if they are to manage self-care and other aspects of day-to-day living. In many countries these people end up as long stay patients on hospital wards. This review aims to look at the economic costs and quality of life of people in 24 hour non-hospital care compared to those still in hospital. Only one trial of 22 people and lasting two years was identified, and it took place in the UK. Most of the participants but not all had schizophrenia. Half were assigned to live in a house staffed by a psychologist, and enough nurses and nursing assistants to provide 24 hour care. The staff were expected to help prepare and share meals with the residents and the residents had a programme of domestic work and some self-care tasks. The psychologist worked with each individual to improve social interaction and behaviour. The control group had normal hospital care with access to occupational therapy, industrial therapy and recreational facilities. They were also allowed home on leave and were counted as part of the group if they were discharged, transferred to hostels or in prison. The majority of the data were difficult to interpret because the numbers needed to make statistical comparisons were not given. Three people from the house had to be readmitted to the hospital and several of the others had short stays there. Those people who were resident in the house were reported to be significantly more likely to use social facilities and spent more time in socially constructive activities (self-care, eating with the group). All other measures reported were not significantly different between the groups. The costs for each group were similar, however if cost was calculated for those in the house who did not use the hospital at all, it was slightly less expensive. This was a small study which was not designed well. A larger, well-designed trial would answer the question of whether 24 hour care would benefit this group of people.</P>

<P>Despite modern treatment approaches and a focus on community care, there remains a group of people who cannot easily be discharged from psychiatric hospital directly into the community. Twenty-four hour residential rehabilitation (a 'ward-in-a-house') is one model of care that has evolved in association with psychiatric hospital closure programmes.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-11-29 15:02:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (May 2002 and February 2004).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-12-03 14:36:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that compared 24 hour residential rehabilitation with standard care for people with severe mental illness.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-12-03 14:21:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. Data were excluded where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes we calculated the relative risk and its 95% confidence interval.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-14 13:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified and included one study with 22 participants with important methodological shortcomings and limitations of reporting. The two-year controlled study evaluated "new long stay patients" in a hostel ward in the UK. One outcome 'unable to manage in the placement' provided usable data (n=22, RR 7.0 CI 0.4 to 121.4). The trial reported that hostel ward residents developed superior domestic skills, used more facilities in the community and were more likely to engage in constructive activities than those in hospital - although usable numerical data were not reported. These potential advantages were not purchased at a price. The limited economic data was not good but the cost of providing 24 hour care did not seem clearly different from the standard care provided by the hospital - and it may have been less.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-12-17 14:03:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>From the single, small and ill-reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. Currently, the value of this way of supporting people - which could be considerable - is unclear. Trials are needed. Any 24 hour care 'ward-in-a-house' is likely to be oversubscribed. We argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. With follow-up of all eligible for the placements - those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care - real-world evaluation could take place. In the UK further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. The broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-12-03 15:50:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-12-03 14:40:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Schizophrenia is a long-term, chronic illness with high disability rates and disease burden. Interventions for the purpose of reintegration into society are even more important than acute intervention. Maintenance on medication alone is often inadequate, especially for aspects of social functioning.</P>
<P>Despite modern treatment approaches and a focus on community care, there remains a group of people who cannot be discharged from psychiatric hospital directly into the community. This group is mainly comprised of people whose psychotic illness has proved resistant to treatment and may be complicated by additional personality problems, substance abuse or a forensic history. These people have been called "new long stay patients" (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 1976</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-12-03 14:45:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-four hour residential rehabilitation is a model of care which has evolved in association with psychiatric hospital closure programmes in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 1999</LINK>). Early descriptions of 24 hour residential rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1998a</LINK>), suggested that specialised residential units for the care of this group should have the following characteristics.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Location removed from a hospital, into a 'normal' house.</LI>
<LI>Intensive staff input with individual treatment programmes.</LI>
<LI>Expectation of resident involvement in domestic activities.</LI>
<LI>Good access to community day care/therapeutic facilities.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-12-03 14:52:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The intention of 24 hour nursed care is to provide an environment which maximises the social functioning and independence of the patient, while optimising medication and psycho-social interventions. The multi-disciplinary approach to treatment would involve detailed assessment of the patient leading to a range of treatment plans targeting problem areas. Regular review of progress in these areas would aim to maintain progress to the point of discharge, which would be to the least dependent form of accommodation possible, ideally fully independent living.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-12-03 15:50:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the UK, policy makers have advised that units providing 24 hour nursed care are an "essential component of a comprehensive psychiatric service" (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1996</LINK>). The National Service Framework for Mental Health (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1999</LINK>) noted that such services were an effective alternative to long-term hospital care and advised that "further development of this element of the mental health system of care is a high priority". In reality, however, few hospital beds have been replaced by residential facilities in the community, leaving only one third of the residential placements (hospital or hostel) that existed 40 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Lelliott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lelliott 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effect of the reduction of these residential placements is not clear, but it has been argued that adequate provision of 24 hour nursed care will lead to a reduction in the need for acute beds (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-Exec-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS Exec 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1998b</LINK> has pointed out that this issue can only effectively be considered in a "systems perspective" and that different elements of community psychiatric services must be well co-ordinated and targeted for the whole system to work efficiently. A range of provisions is required to solve the problem of the shortage of acute psychiatric beds. Simply opening more acute beds or developing any other single component of the residential care system is not enough (<LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1997</LINK>). There is a paucity of information available on the effects of 24 hour care within this patient group. This review aims to evaluate all relevant trials.</P>

<P>Again working independently, the authors assessed risk of bias using the tool described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. We would not have included studies where sequence generation was at high risk of bias or where allocation was clearly not concealed. If disputes arose as to which category a trial has to be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion, after working with the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Editorial Base.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:02:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Binary data<BR/>For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For statistically significant results we calculated the number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using Visual Rx (<A HREF="http://www.nntonline.net/">http://www.nntonline.net/</A>) taking account of the event rate in the control group.</P>
<P>2. Continuous data<BR/>2.1 Summary statistic<BR/>For continuous outcomes we estimated a fixed-effect weighted mean difference (WMD) between groups. We did not calculate effect size measures.</P>
<P>2.2 Endpoint versus change data<BR/>We preferred to use scale endpoint data, which typically cannot have negative values and is easier to interpret from a clinical point of view. Change data are often not ordinal and are very problematic to interpret. If endpoint data were unavailable, we used change data.</P>
<P>2.3 Skewed data<BR/>Continuous data on clinical and social outcomes are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data, we aim to apply the following standards to all data before inclusion: (a) standard deviations and means are reported in the paper or obtainable from the authors; (b) when a scale starts from the finite number zero, the standard deviation, when multiplied by two, is less than the mean (as otherwise the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution, (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>); (c) if a scale starts from a positive value (such as PANSS which can have values from 30 to 210) the calculation described above will be modified to take the scale starting point into account. In these cases skew is present if 2SD&gt;(S-S min), where S is the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be applied. When continuous data are presented on a scale which includes a possibility of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200 participants were entered in additional tables rather than into an analysis. Skewed data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample size is large and were entered into syntheses.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:02:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated. This causes type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where clustering is not accounted for in primary studies, we presented data in a table, with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain the intraclass correlation coefficient of their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Where clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we present these data as if from a non-cluster randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.</P>
<P>We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per cluster (m) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) [Design effect = 1+(m-1)*ICC] (<LINK REF="REF-Donner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donner 2002</LINK>). If the ICC was not reported it was assumed to be 0.1 (<LINK REF="REF-Ukoumunne-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukoumunne 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>If cluster studies has been appropriately analysed taking into account intraclass correlation coefficient and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis with other studies would have been possible using the generic inverse variance technique.</P>
<P>2. Cross-over trials<BR/>A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence on entry to the second phase the participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if the condition of interest is unstable (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). As both effects are very likely in schizophrenia, we used only data of the first phase of cross-over studies.</P>
<P>3. Studies with multiple treatment groups<BR/>Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant, the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data were not reproduced.</P>

Should more than 50% of data be unaccounted for we did not reproduce these data or use them within analyses.</P>

We are aware that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but are of limited power to detect small-study effects. We did not use funnel plots for outcomes where there were ten or fewer studies, or where all studies were of similar sizes. In other cases, where funnel plots were possible, we sought statistical advice in their interpretation.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-12-08 12:45:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where possible we employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for use of fixed or random-effects models. The random-effects method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are estimating different, yet related, intervention effects. This does seem true to us, however, random-effects does put added weight onto the smaller of the studies - those trials that are most vulnerable to bias. For this reason we favour using fixed-effect models employing random-effects only when investigating heterogeneity.</P>

<P>If data are clearly heterogeneous we checked that data are correctly extracted and entered and that we had made no unit of analysis errors. If the high levels of heterogeneity remained we did not undertake a meta-analysis at this point for, if there is considerable variation in results, and particularly if there is inconsistency in the direction of effect, it may be misleading to quote an average value for the intervention effect. We would have wanted to explore heterogeneity. We pre-specify no characteristics of studies that may be associated with heterogeneity except quality of trial method. If no clear association could be shown by sorting studies by quality of methods a random-effect meta-analysis was performed. Should another characteristic of the studies be highlighted by the investigation of heterogeneity, perhaps some clinical heterogeneity not hitherto predicted but plausible causes of heterogeneity, these post-hoc reasons will be discussed and the data analysed and presented. However, should the heterogeneity be substantially unaffected by use of random-effect meta-analysis and no other reasons for the heterogeneity be clear, the final data were presented without a meta-analysis.</P>

</SEARCH_RESULTS>
<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:04:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Design<BR/>We included one randomised study (<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK>) which used a total of 22 people. The participants were approximately matched in pairs at baseline according to their rehabilitation potential, based upon duration of their illness, hospital diagnosis, extent of psychological impairments and extent of remediable problem behaviours. Both groups were also comparable on age, sex and diagnosis. The participants were randomised to the 24 hour care group or standard care using the toss of a coin. Neither participants nor investigators were blind to treatment allocation. The study lasted for two years.</P>
<P>2. Participants<BR/>The majority of participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia (14/22). The remainder suffered from epilepsy, organic mental states and manic-depressive illness. The study did not report using any type of operationalised criteria for the diagnoses. The participants age ranged from 16-65 years with an average of 42 years. All participants had been in a large psychiatric hospital for at least six months and were not thought to constitute a serious hazard to public safety. Despite an active rehabilitation programme, the use of local authority hostels and community psychiatric nurse input, all participants had remained in hospital for more than six months. <BR/>
<BR/>3. Interventions<BR/>3.1 24 hour care<BR/>New long-stay patients were provided with accommodation at Douglas House which is a ward within Withington Hospital (UK) and its residents are legally in-patients in receipt of 24 hour nursing care, based in a Victorian house approximately one mile from the main hospital. During the study period, the number of participants in residence at Douglas House was no more than ten.</P>
<P>Douglas House has been operational since 1982, with the intent of avoiding institutionalised care. The facilities included a kitchen, dining room, staff office, patient bedrooms and an office for use by the psychologist and also for staff meetings. The facility also includes a garden and patio area. The nursing levels were initially planned to include nine nurses, with a Sister, a Charge Nurse, a Staff Nurse, 3.75 Enrolled Nurses and 2.25 Nursing Assistants, although rarely has there been a full complement of nursing staff. This has been acknowledged as resulting in some difficulties with patient care. The nurses were given a weekly allowance to cover the cost of meals that nurses were expected to share with participants. The hospital paid for the rates, electricity and telephone bills. No occupational therapists were deployed in the study.</P>
<P>Residents were given a programme of domestic chores and self-care activities, judged as being within the individual's abilities, as well as personal target behaviours which had been agreed with the psychologist. Fines were given for serious misconduct such as theft or violence, but these were used sparingly as the intentions were to facilitate positive enforcement. Points gained throughout the week were exchanged for money at a weekly payout meeting, attended by all patients and available nursing staff and usually chaired by the psychologist (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1985</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>3.2 Standard care<BR/>This patient group had access to comprehensive occupational therapy facilities, industrial therapy, and social/recreational departments of the hospital. They were also able to use community amenities as they wished. Patients who were discharged into the community were still considered within the control group.</P>
<P>The District General Hospital (DGH) opened in 1972 and did not have any medium and long-stay wards, except for a multi-user disturbed ward. The long-stay patients were consequently cared for on the short-term wards. The rehabilitation facilities found within the District General Hospital were those usually found within a modern day hospital of the time and included an industrial workshop, woodwork and craft rooms, provision for clerical and household tasks, as well as other activities organised by the nurses and occupational therapists. Other facilities included a daily social skills group, which most of the long-term patients had attended on occasions, as well as a literacy group and a rehabilitation flat. Also hostel provision was available for chronic patients, who did not require 24 hour nursing care. Furthermore, many other patients were reported to be living with their families or in lodgings, with input from community psychiatric nurses (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Outcomes<BR/>The one included study examined the effect of 24 hour care verses standard care upon a number of variables. These included any reduction in problem behaviours, the number of episodes of acute psychosis, improvement in levels of socially acceptable behaviour, the level of enhancement in socially useful activities and the degree of satisfaction in their living conditions between the two patient groups. The study also recorded the number of patients who were unable to manage in the new environment of Douglas House over the time period of the study. The majority of the data were reported without providing mean scores and standard deviations.</P>
<P>The financial effects of the two types of care were examined, although several confounding variables made comparisons difficult. For example, the DGH patients spent a far greater period of time outside of hospital in other institutionalised care (hostels or prison). Furthermore, none of the 24 hour care group were discharged to other institutional care facilities, during the time of the study period.</P>
<P>4.1 Redundant data<BR/>Those patients who were unable to manage being in Douglas House during the time period of the evaluation were included in certain areas of evaluation within the study. These included three patients who had to be returned from Douglas house to the local District General Hospital. The study reported that one participant could not remain at Douglas House due to a progressive ataxia, whilst the two other residents showed unremitting behavioral problems when confronted with the demands of ordinary domestic living and behavioural programmes.</P>
<P>4.2 Incomplete data<BR/>We found no numerical data on global impression, social functioning, mental state or quality of life.</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:04:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Fairness of rating<BR/>The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> acknowledged that, as residents became more familiar with the research team, this may have influenced their assessment interviews. However, the authors acknowledged that the psychiatrists also had a clinical responsibility for some of the patients in the control group and aimed to be as fair as possible. To minimise potential bias by assessors they used standardised assessment measures, but, nevertheless bias may have been hard to avoid.</P>
<P>2. Size of study<BR/>Small studies are not inherently biased. It is, however, widely acknowledged that small positive studies are more likely to be published than their small negative equivalents (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).

<P>3. Clarity<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> evaluated the service irrespective of whether patients were able to benefit from it or not. The analyses were therefore made on the original 11 pairs of matched patients. This had effects upon areas such as the comparison of service utilisation by the two groups where, for example, 1286 ward nights were recorded for patients from the Douglas House group, who, by design, were residing back on the ward at the local DGH during the time period of the study. The study also examined the effect of the new service at Douglas House on those patients who were able to be managed in this environment. This situation did generate some challenges understanding the results, and it is possible that our understanding has led to the introduction of further biases.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:05:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>COMPARISON 1. TWENTY-FOUR HOUR CARE versus STANDARD HOSPITAL CARE<BR/>1. Behaviour - binary data<BR/>1.1 Unable to manage in the placement (by 24 months)<BR/>The single small study (n=22) reported the outcome of having to be moved off the experimental community placement ward. Three participants (3/11) at Douglas House had to be returned to the home ward at the District General Hospital. The information concerning the control group were less explicit in this regard. We found no significant difference (RR 7.0 CI 0.4 to 121.4) between groups for the outcome of unable to manage in the placement (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>1.2 Behaviour - scale derived data<BR/>1.2.1 The Psychological Impairments Rating Scale - PIRS<BR/>We were unable to report data from the PIRS scale because no standard deviations were available. The trialists, however, reported that the 24 hour care group were less non-assertive and significantly less indifferent compared with participants on the ward. They also reported additional outcomes for psychomotor inhibition, parathymia and overall impression (total score) but found no significant difference between groups.</P>
<P>1.2.2 The Remediable Problem Behaviours Scale - TRPBS<BR/>Again we were unable to report numeric data because no mean scores and standard deviations were available. However, again, trialists reported that participants demonstrated no consistent change with time nor any significant differences between the groups for 'publicly undesirable behaviours', hygiene, social skills and self care. Regarding domestic skills, there were significant differences favouring the 24 hour care group, which demonstrated a large improvement in the first six months, but then no later improvement. The control group, however, showed a steady improvement with time. Improvements in community skills were also reported but no significant inter-group differences were found.</P>
<P>1.2.3 Socially Adaptive Behaviour<BR/>The authors reported that participants who remained at Douglas House in 24 hour care increased their use of social facilities after arriving. The differences between the two groups were reported by trialists to be significantly different and were mainly attributable to the increased use of the community setting, cinema and post office. No significant differences were reported in social deficits or communication skills recorded in the television study. No numeric data were reported.</P>
<P>1.3 Behaviour - time<BR/>The trialists consolidated time spent on socially useful behaviours into three categories because some outcomes were of very low frequency i.e. 'constructive' e.g. eating, self care, 'non-constructive' e.g. doing nothing, lying in bed and 'indeterminate e.g. on leave, whereabouts unknown. The 24 hour care group were found to be spending significantly more time undertaking socially constructive activities compared with the control group. Both groups were found to be similar for the proportion of the time spent doing non-constructive activities, but the paper did not provide any usable data.</P>
<P>2 Mental state<BR/>2.1 Episodes of psychosis - Krawiecka scale/PSE<BR/>No numeric data were available but <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> reported that there were no significant differences between groups for all the measures on the Krawiecka scale, (including affective and positive symptoms). Also, no differences were found between the two groups at any stage, using the Present State Examination scale.</P>
<P>3. Satisfaction<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> reported no numeric data on patient satisfaction and only assessed satisfaction in the 24 hour care group, citing the reason being that some of the control group were either in the community or in other forms of institutionalised care. Two of the residents at Douglas House were transferred back to the hospital because they felt dissatisfied with the facility and the ensuing demands from such an environment. Remaining participants, however, were found to be satisfied with the facility based on the attitude scale. At the two year study stage, participants reported that they liked the other residents, the food and that they had enough to do. A majority, (7/8), said that they had sufficient privacy, liked their room, were able to talk to staff and found them friendly. In addition, they considered that they had enough freedom, that any complaints were dealt with and had been given sufficient information about their illness. Also, five of the residents at Douglas House had thought of leaving, four stated that they had plans to do so and three wished to stay indefinitely. Six patients said that they preferred Douglas House to life in the District General Hospital, one had no preference and only one slightly preferred the DGH setting to Douglas House.</P>
<P>4. Economic outcomes: relative costs<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> indicated that 24 hour care is more economical than standard hospitalisation. The included study acknowledged that certain aspects of care which provide advantages that were unable to be expressed in financial terms, such as the advantages of not needing to be in hospital, also contributed to the 'hard costs' of providing the service. These aspects were therefore included in the economic outcomes rather than the non-financial effects.</P>
<P>1.4.1 Average costs per day for the UK's National Health Service<BR/>Capital costs for Douglas House were somewhat lower than those for the psychiatric unit of the DGH, but the nursing costs for Douglas House were much greater. This was thought to be due to the smaller number of patients being cared for and the intensity of nursing input being given at Douglas House. Non-nursing care costs were very similar but general services costs at Douglas House were less. This was due to Douglas House residents conducting many of the general tasks of administration and maintenance themselves.</P>

<P>1.4.2 Average annual costs of providing care for the two groups<BR/>Residents at Douglas House continued to require the services of the DGH unit. A number needed short admission episodes during periods of relapse that were unmanageable at Douglas House. Others required transfer for medical emergencies e.g. suspected heart attack or surgical care for a fractured hip. The control group at the DGH unit spent much more time out of hospital than the index group at Douglas House. However, this group spent 48% of the time in other institutionalised settings (hostels, night shelters or prison). <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> acknowledged that time spent in prison is considered as a non-financial disadvantage. Medical staff were found to spend less time in direct or indirect contact with those at Douglas House, compared to those at the DGH unit. Participants at Douglas House, however, were reported to be more satisfied with the information given to them about their illness and their medication, as depicted by the results from the attitudes scales. As stated previously, some patients had to be returned from Douglas House to the DGH. Patients in both groups required medical and surgical care, as well as psychiatric day-care. A number of patients from the control group required local authority or Home Office care during the period of the study. None of the Douglas House group were discharged to another institution.</P>

<P>The costs of providing this care, irrespective of where they were during the two year period showed little difference between the two groups, although the attention of the reader was drawn to the slightly less expensive costs of Douglas House. This was made more pronounced when the analysis is restricted to the reduced group of eight pairs. (This occurred because the costs of providing care to participants who were returned to the DGH unit were added to the expenditure of Douglas House for the complete group of 22 patients).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:05:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We examined the effects of 24 hour care, compared with standard hospital care in people with severe mental illness. Randomised controlled trials in this area of mental health care provision are difficult and the findings we have to report are a reproduction of those of one, small and far from perfect, trial, where outcomes were rated by people clearly supportive of one mode of management who were not blind to the person's allocated group.</P>
<P>1. COMPARISON 1. TWENTY-FOUR HOUR CARE versus STANDARD HOSPITAL CARE<BR/>1.1 Unable to manage in the placement (by 24 months)<BR/>Data are few and difficult to interpret. Three of the participants at Douglas House were returned to the home ward at the District General Hospital whilst none of the participants in the control group were reported to be unable to manage in the hospital setting. However, the authors were not explicit regarding how the control group were assessed, if at all, although the data were not significantly different. The authors also reported on the number of nights spent by the control group in other settings, away from the district hospital. Although none of the intervention group at Douglas House were discharged to another institution, the circumstances as to why participants in the control group spent far more time out of hospital than the intervention group, (48% of this time spent in other forms of institution), were not elaborated upon by the authors.</P>
<P>The nature of the outcomes for participants in the control group having spent time in local authority hostels are not entirely clear, nor whether these were permanent and/or successful arrangements. Although the time spent by participants from the control group in prison and night shelters is recognised as having a 'non-financial disadvantage'; the exact division of the time spent by the control group in local authority hostels or night shelters was also not made explicit. During the study period, the control group spent exactly three times the length of time (1599 nights versus 533 nights) either at home with relatives, or in lodgings compared with the intervention group. The authors did not provide any further details for this finding.</P>
<P>1.2 Economic outcomes: relative costs<BR/>There were several difficulties with quantifying the cost effectiveness for 24 hour care but <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> tended to report that 24 hour care is less expensive than the DGH. The data are not convincing, however, and more quantitative data are needed to determine the true costs of delivering 24 hour care.</P>
<P>1.3 All other outcomes<BR/>Many outcomes were reported without mean scores and standard deviations which rendered the data impossible to use in this systematic review. We think, should those data have been usable, that their inclusion would have furthered our understanding of the effects of the intervention. Unfortunately the opportunity to highlight the potential benefits - or drawbacks - of 24 hour care in patients with severe and enduring mental illness was not realised in this important and ground-breaking trial.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2008-12-08 15:13:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is possible that the search did not identify all relevant work. The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register is comprehensive, but may still not contain all the studies in this area. Such work may not be published in journals and could be reported in conference proceedings or dissertations which are more difficult to identify. Furthermore, the political context of mental health service provision in such areas as 24 hour nursing care may mean that relevant conference material was not identified. The increasingly expansive nature of Internet-based databases of medical literature and related data may mean that such material will be easier to identify in the future.</P>
<P>We aimed to report all important measures of treatment effect such as mental state, global functioning, social functioning, quality of life and service utilisation. The included study only reported one usable outcome - unable to manage in the placement (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Further outcomes were reported, but mostly without any associated numeric data. The quality of the evidence is affected by including only 22 participants in the study. The sample size is small and unlikely to be adequately powered to detect genuine treatment effects.</P>

<P>The quality of evidence was low. As can be seen in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> most parameters by which quality was measured in this review were either unknown or rated as 'poor'. Conduct, design and reporting all had limitations and these are likely to be reflected in the results. Despite all this, <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> proves, in its own imperfect way, that such studies are possible and it is easy to criticise this difficult study in retrospect. <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> sets a standard which now can be - and should be - surpassed.</P>

<P>We started this review with an interest in 24 hour care and generally supportive of the concept in comparison to hospital admission. We have, however, endeavoured to be as thorough and as fair as possible in undertaking the review. We may, nevertheless, have failed to identify other small studies - although we think it unlikely that a large study would not have come to light. We have tried to extract data objectively and present them clearly - but we did find the report of <LINK REF="STD-Hyde-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Hyde 1987</LINK> difficult to fully understand and it is possible that we failed to use all data as best is possible.

<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>In the UK the option of living within a hostel ward has now diminished greatly, with the closure of many such facilities since the time of the included study. In other countries hostel wards remain accessible and offer a real and viable option to long-term use of hospital. Where such hostel wards exist, should there be pressure on spaces available, the only fair way to allocate beds would be to randomise.</P>
<P>2. Clinicians<BR/>From the single study included, the hostel ward type of facility appeared as though it may have been cheaper and might have actually been doing something useful as a resource. Further randomised control trials have not been conducted when the facilities were more widely available and many of these types of facilities have since closed down. If anything is to be learnt from this review, it should be to evaluate carefully these fashionable innovations in a timely fashion so their continuation - or abolition - is supported by good evidence.</P>
<P>3. Managers or policymakers<BR/>In view of the closure of psychiatric hospital beds over recent decades, an adequate and appropriate level of service development in providing 24 hour nursed care outside of the hospital setting is crucial for the 'new long stay' patient population. The effects of this type of community psychiatric provision does need further evaluation to facilitate further debate and policy-making decisions on a systems approach to an overall comprehensive psychiatric service.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-01-14 14:09:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. General<BR/>More information could have been drawn from the one included study had more foresight been given at its inception. In addition, the introduction of the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> statement in 1996, provides recommendations on the reporting of randomised controlled trials, endorses the need for accurate recording of such information and would maximise its usability to its readership. The recommendations may have come too late though for this study. The quality of future research would be greatly improved by implementing the <A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</A> statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Specific<BR/>As stated by <LINK REF="REF-Shepherd-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepherd 1995</LINK>, in the discussion of the included study, there needs to be more than one evaluation of this type of care verses acute patient hospital stay for the 'new long stay' patient population. However, as this review demonstrates, no such further evaluations have taken place - despite there being a continued closure of hospital beds since that time. Whilst such terms as the 'new long stay' can be very stigmatising and perhaps self-fulfilling, the very existence of this particular patient population may be a function of deficits in current service provision rather than really being a truly new group of service users. A 'ward-in-a-house' represents one solution. This aims to deliver high-quality care, over a long period of time. Furthermore, the aim of resettling people, where possible, is an objective in itself. Changes in service provision should not, at the very least, add to the disengagement and disability of the people within this population group.</P>
<P>This review demonstrates an important gap in research which is strategically important to mental healthcare management and in the drive towards providing effective and efficient psychiatric services. In addition, the move in recent years towards public-private partnerships with new builds - at least in high-income country psychiatric service provision - should highlight to agencies the need for further research in this area to facilitate financial and non-financial justification for such proposals as 24 hour nursing care provision.</P>
<P>We feel that identifying only one included trial is not as a consequence of overly-stringent inclusion criteria, but reflects a genuine lack of appropriate research in this area. This review has demonstrated the near absence of randomised control trials examining the effectiveness of 24 hour nursing care verses standard treatment in hospital care for people with 'severe mental illness'. There is an ongoing need for well-designed, and reported, randomised controlled trials of the effects of 24 hour care verses standard hospital care for the patient population with 'severe mental illness'. The 'new long-stay' patient population is small in number in any one catchment area. Any study, therefore, is likely to have to cover a large population and wide catchment to achieve adequate power. As a result, the financial commitment and likelihood of multi-centre involvement of any such trials is increased. We acknowledge the real difficulty of undertaking such a study but have now given this some thought and suggest an outline for consideration (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
