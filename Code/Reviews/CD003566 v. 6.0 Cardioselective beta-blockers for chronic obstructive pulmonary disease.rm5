Signed off for Peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRS notes October 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Emma's editorial changes are fine. For the MD reporting, I have removed the comma after &amp;quot;95% CI&amp;quot; in some places for consistency, as most were reported without the comma. I am happy to report them with the comma as in &amp;quot;95% CI,&amp;quot; if that is standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I did not see Emma's changes as track changes in the review, so I did not go in to globally accept tracked changes. I did look through the changes in the attached PDF, though, and they are fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The results in the sensitivity analysis that were highlighted are for longer-duration FEV1 (not for response to beta-agonists). I could not see any error so I did not make any change. Please let me know if there something that needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the methods, I clarified that the net treatment effects for each of the FEV1 analyses were recorded as the mean percent change from baseline with SD, and pooled to get a weighted average of the study means using the random-effects model for continuous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The general standard is to use p &amp;lt; 0.1 to assess for evidence of potential heterogeneity. I don't believe we clarified in the original protocol what we would use because there was no heterogeneity until we added Hawkins 2009 for this update. I don't think a note is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The contributions section is fine. I just added that I did the statistical management for the 2010 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the results, under the results of search section, I wrote that two new trials were added to this update. For longer duration treatment results, I again wrote that two new trials were added to this update. I report that Hawkins 2009 showed a statistically significant reduction in FEV1 without affecting symptoms or response to beta-agonist. I report the differences in baseline FEV1 for placebo and treatment for this trial, with a resulting 10% increase in FEV1 for placebo. I also report that the other recent trial, Change 2010, found no significant effect on FEV1, symptoms or bronchodilator response. In the section on inter-study heterogeneity I also report on the heterogeneity related to the Hawkins trial, and how there is no evidence of heterogeneity when this study is removed from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In the discussion I added in a paragraph in the summary section on the results of Hawkins 2009 and Butland 1983. Butland did not provide baseline FEV1 or change with treatment, so the data could not be included in this analysis, but there was a significant reduction in peak flows. The results table states that for both beta-blockers pooled, there was no significant difference in FEV1 for treatment vs placebo. I report that there was a trend towards improved quality of life and functional status in Hawkins and an improvement in exercise tolerance related to reduced heart rate, oxygen consumption, and minute ventilation in Butland, without any effect on respiratory symptoms or response to beta-agonist. This indicates that small reductions in airflow that may be seen with cardioselective beta-blocker treatment do not pose clinical problems. In fact, treatment still results in improvements in exercise tolerace and functional status, as has been consistently shown with beta-blocker treatment in cardiac disease (&lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Abdulla 2006&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Abdulla 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Hulsmann 2001&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Hulsmann 2001&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a link_type=&quot;REFERENCE&quot; href=&quot;Poulsen 2000&quot; protected=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Poulsen 2000&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- These recommendations for changes have been very helpful. Please let me know if there are further changes you suggest. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing Oct 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we must make the new information provided from the two new trials much more prominent in this update. There is currently no separate description of these trials and their results. Moreover, there is no mention of the significant reduction in FEV1 in Hawkins or Butland. I think this review needs fine-tuning to report that selective Beta-agonists have been successfully used in patients with COPD and heart failure in the Hawkins study (by titrating the dose up to maximum tolerated). There is a small reduction in FEV1 seen in these two studies but it did not seem to pose clinical problems and was not reflected in proven alteration in response to beta-agonists. I think this would be of more help to readers than to say that the combined effect across all the studies is not significant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Welsh Comments 14 Oct 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very well written review - succinct and clear :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I made some very minor changes to do with copy editing and presentation of the effect estimates in the standard way. Please double check and accept tracked changes (go to edit &amp;gt; global replace &amp;gt; globally accept tracked changes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- we are trialing phrasing the title of plain language summaries as questions, so I have changed this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- * I think there is a typo in the sensitivity analysis for longer-duration response to beta-agonists - I marked this in yellow - could you check this please? *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The measures of treatment effect is not quite what it is supposed to be (probably due to the changing recommendations for Cochrane reviews!) - does it need a statement that continuous outcomes were entered as mean and SD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- should there be a note in the differences between protocol and review that a threshold was set as p &amp;lt; 0.1 for heterogeneity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I changed the what's new section&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- removed W from WMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I added in the new contributions of authors sent by Shelley - please check you are happy with format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;best, Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Notes PJP 17October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelley- very good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All changes look fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have slightly changed the synopsis for readability, and also added the units (% change from baseline) onto comparison 01 and 03, otherwise no other changes.&lt;br&gt;Have forwarded it to CAG base for speedy attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes PJP 9 Oct 2001 Respnse SRS Oct 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelley - looks really good. The review findings suggest that strong conclusions an be drawn as you have done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are not too many queries!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for you to incorporate your response to my comments here in this log so that Paul Jones and others can see what we have discussed.&lt;br&gt;- OK. We made several changes in the abstract, methods and results sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven't changed the review except to close up gaps and change the odd word - you should work off this version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggested improvements- let me know if you disagree or need to discuss further:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. References- there are extra full stops that could be tidied up&lt;br&gt;- Done. Good pick-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. For clarity instead of the term &amp;quot;baseline airway obstruction&amp;quot; use &amp;quot;chronic airway obstruction&amp;quot; - more recognisable as COPD and also you use 'baseline' in other ways.&lt;br&gt;- Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. state why you didn't write for more data from authors- presumably studies old!&lt;br&gt;- ... as all of the trials were small and published many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. units for FEV1 are litres, not l/sec&lt;br&gt;- Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. in Metaview: because a higher FEV1 is better, need to relabel axes in comparisons 01 and 03 so that to the right favours treatment&lt;br&gt;- Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. You need to provide a synopsis - this is a short ( 3 sentence) lay summary&lt;br&gt;- Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Main issue revolves around description of methodology&lt;br&gt;(i) can you give the rationale of the studies where b agonist was given after the study drug. How long after the b blocker were they given the bagonist, and when were measurements made?&lt;br&gt;- We have tried to clarify it in the objectives and methods section. The purpose of beta-agonist administration was to evaluate the response to beta-agonists for patients treated with beta-blockers compared to placebo. We gave the times for beta-agonist treatment in the Types of Interventions section, and times for measurements in the Types of Outcomes section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ii) need to clarify this statement &amp;quot;In order to include more trials in this patient group, trials studying FEV1 treatment effects were included even if they used baseline controls without placebo&amp;quot; . Were these all randomised trials? If so clarify meaning of randomisation (a) that some pts were randomised to get the bblocker and some randomised to observation, or (b) cross overs- that the order of the study periods was randomised between getting b blocker and not getting b blocker ( and no placebo either! -observation only), or (c) pts were randomised bet different b blockers (and no placebo). Need to satisfy the reader that all trials had randomised allocation and a control, and explain how you have done the comparisons.&lt;br&gt;- The statement now is &amp;quot;It was decided a priori to data extraction that randomised comparative trials studying FEV1 effects of cardioselective beta-blockers would be included even if they used baseline controls without placebo&amp;quot;. We also clarified that cross-over trials were considered to be randomised if different interventions were administered in random order, and that all included trials were randomised. Controlled trials were those with placebo or comparative controls. In the Methods section we clarified that for studies without placebo the treatment response for each intervention was measured and the placebo response was estimated from the available placebo-controlled trials. The results section show that excluding these trials do not signficantly change the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which baseline was used in the cross over studies where there was no placebo ?study day baseline or another day, and if so was this before or after the end of the defined time period that would have been used on the day the subject received bblocker?&lt;br&gt;- The baseline FEV1 used for measurements are now described in the Methods section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long and frequently after administration of the b blocker were the measurements made- was there any adjustment for the half lives of the drugs? Did the time period make sense phamacologically. Are you sure they got the lowest FEV1. (it does seem internally consistent with the fact that there was no exacerbation of symptoms)&lt;br&gt;- The times of the FEV1 measurements are now described in the Types of outcomes section. They were chosen differently for iv and po med administration and seems consistent with the onset of action of these medications, but we don't write about the pharmacological onset of action in the manuscript. In the Methods we add a sentence &amp;quot;For all trials in which more than one FEV1 measurement was reported after the study drug was administered the lowest FEV1 used for the analysis&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were there any other comparisons such as FEV1 at the end of the study period , PEFR, exacerbations, no. symptoms throughout the study period that could be included&lt;br&gt;- Two longer duration trials state that there was no change in beta-agonist inhaler use, but we don't have good data to analyse so we left this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iii) the sensitivity analyses are really good and add to the robustness of the review, but should you also say how many trials were missing SD?&lt;br&gt;- We have added references to the sensitivity analysis for those without placebo or SD data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(iv) can you comment on the symptom scales used- presumably you decided if there was or wasn't an increase in respiratory symptoms from the myriad of possible scales used in the studies. it seems odd that in a longer duration study in COPD patients that there were so few respiratory symptoms reported. Did they use self reporting or did they actually ask subjects to rate on e.g. a Likert or a VAS?&lt;br&gt;- In the Types of outcomes section we describe in general terms the self-reporting symptom scales that were used in the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes PJP 13 Aug 2001&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent! So little editing to do! I have seen your other review and I'm sure this will be as good a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only point I have relates to clarification of the types of studies you want to include.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will you include both acute and long term dosing studies? Perhaps include a statement to that effect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably you plan to meta analyse these separately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these be studies in which the primary aim is only to look at the effects (esp. adverse) of Beta blocker in pts with COPD or are there likely to be trials where these COPD patients were given the beta blocker primarily for some other indication e.g. hypertension or angina/ heart failure. I guess what I am saying is could there be significant sub groups of pts with comorbidities ( or indications for treatment) that should be specified in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses could also be done on setting, duration of therapy, comorbidity in addition to severity and type of b blocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look forward to seeing the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillippa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technical editing CJC 6/11/2001&lt;br&gt;Checklist for Technical Editing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors and contributions - no problems&lt;br&gt;References - good but there are dozens of studies in classification pending (why is this?)&lt;br&gt;- They have been removed (they were imported with a MEDLINE file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies - this is a bit thin with no details of patient numbers, locations, how COPD was defined (or asthma excluded) or details of the intervention drug dose or duration, or how and when the outcomes were measured, etc.... Is it possible to include more details here?&lt;br&gt;- Information has been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels - Phillippa has already addressed this. The scales have been adjusted to show the results more clearly. I do not understand the labels of treatment minus placebo in the dichotomous outcomes, (what does this mean?)&lt;br&gt;- This has been changed to Participants with symptoms (Treatment minus Placebo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text of the review -&lt;br&gt;The first paragraph under &amp;quot;Types of studies&amp;quot; belongs in the results or methods section and should be cut out from here. This should only about the type of study for inclusion not how many were found and how they were evaluated.&lt;br&gt;- Moved to Methods section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unusual to exclude unblinded studies but this may be justified if you think that bias in unblinded studies is a serious threat to the results? However there is an intrinsic inconsistency in excluding studies that are not blinded, yet allowing those that compare with baseline and have no control (as these by definition cannot be blinded). I do not think you can do both together!&lt;br&gt;- We have explained that we included only blinded studies, in order to decrease the risk of reporting bias, that is inherent in unblinded studies. We explain that comparative trials without placebo controls were included as long as they compare various interventions in a blinded randomised manner. We already state that sensitivity analysis will evaluate the effect of including these trials. There were a few open-label trials that were excluded (that showed no difference between beta1-blockers and baseline). I don't think they would add much at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For those studies without placebo controls the treatment response for each intervention was measured and the placebo response was estimated from the available placebo-controlled trials. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of including these trials.&amp;quot; This is a non-standard approach and I would like a clear label on the studies to indicate which did not have a placebo arm. As mentioned above this is not compatible with the exclusion of unblinded trials as they are likely more reliable than those with no placebo arm at all (in my view).&lt;br&gt;- We state that the trials can be found in the Table of Included Studies, that are clearly marked which do not have placebo controls. In the Results section, the text is linked to the references for these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For those trials that did not report the standard deviation for the distribution of study results (SD), the average SD was obtained from the available information and calculated separately for placebo and treatment responses.&amp;quot; Again I would like to see clear indications of where this has taken place (eg in table of included studies).&lt;br&gt;- These are clearly labeled in the Table, and linked to references in the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot see which trials tested with beta-agonist - could these be shown as a sub-group?&lt;br&gt;- We list these trials in the Description of Studies section and the Results section, and now have a Table of Comparison for these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Results for respiratory symptoms were measured as a risk difference, by subtracting the incidence of events after treatment from the incidence of events after placebo. The risk differences were then pooled using the fixed effects model for dichotomous outcomes.&amp;quot; For dichotomous outcomes the unit of analysis must be the patient who suffered adverse events NOT the number of events. These results are not suitable for pooling as presented in the textual description.&lt;br&gt;- We have changed the events to participants with symptoms, in order to be used as dichotomous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUBGROUPS: these sound important and could be presented as separate COMPARISONS in RevMan so they can be viewed by the reader. I am sorry that this means more work but if new comparisons are created the outcome can be dragged into it by holdind down the control key and pulling the outcome over. Answer yes to copyind studies and data and then the studies that should be excluded can then be deleted.&lt;br&gt;- We have added 6 Tables of comparisons for the subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Single doses of cardioselective beta-blockers were not associated with a change in FEV1 compared to placebo or to baseline controls with an estimated placebo response Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) -2.08% [95% CI, -5.25 to 1.09]. There was no change in results when only placebo-controlled trials were included. &amp;quot; Could you insert links to the studies in the text to identify which are the placebo controlled studies.&lt;br&gt;- The results are reported in detail in the sensitivity analysis section, with links to the references. The sentence here has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the 2 trials that measured response to inhaled beta2-agonist after treatment and after placebo, there was no significant change in the net treatment effect (-1.2% [CI, -10.8 to 8.4]). &amp;quot; Again please insert links to show which these two studies are and show how the results were derived. &amp;quot;In the one trial that measured FEV1 response to inhaled beta2-agonist after treatment and placebo, there was no significant difference in the net treatment effect after treatment compared to placebo -2.0% [CI, -11.8 to 7.8]. &amp;quot; Again please insert a link to the relevant study.&lt;br&gt;- Links are included, as well as new Table of comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*****IF you have pooled beta-agonist results for FEV1 with beta-blocker results I do not think this makes clinical sense and suggest that these are put into separate sub-groups and not pooled overall.&lt;br&gt;- Sorry for the confusion, but they are not pooled. See the Table of Comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the longer duration trials, when cardioselective beta-blockers with ISA were compared to those without ISA, there was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect (6.2% [CI, -0.7 to 13.1]). &amp;quot; Where does this result come from please and how have you derived it? It should come from putting the two types of beta-blockers in separate intervention categories and assessing the residual Chi squared result with one df when the sum of the sub-group Chi squared results is subtracted from the total....... These needs to be shown as a separate comparison so the reader can see what is going on.&lt;br&gt;- There was very little data on beta-blockers with ISA - none in the single-dose studies and just 2 in the longer-duration trials. We have taken out the subgroup analysis,and briefly mention the differences in the Discusision section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; When the analysis was limited to those with severe obstruction there still was no significant difference in FEV1 treatment effect for single-dose trials (-0.71% [CI, -5.69 to 4.27]) or for longer duration trials (-3.11% [CI, -8.62 to 2.41]), and there was no increase in symptoms in any of these trials. &amp;quot; Thanks for putting in the trials here to help identify them, but this also would helpfully be shown as a further comparison to show the results as separate subgroups and compare them.&lt;br&gt;- Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see that the studies are listed to show which had SD estimated (almost all of them!!!) etc at the end of the results section - this is really helpful; the reader cannot manipulate the results to include or exclude such studies and thus I suggest a new comparison to show each of the splits as separate subgroups to help the reader. Please get back to me if this is not clear.&lt;br&gt;- We have added 2 Tables on beta-agonists, and 6 tables for the various subgroup analyses. So far, we report the results of the sensitivity analysis for those trials without placebo or SD in the text only, with links to the refererences. Readers can easily deselect those listed trials to come up the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris@nntonline.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS I started adding WMD before all the pooled results and indicating 95% CI in the brackets but I have not done this throughout as you may wish to make other changes. However this is the usual convention in Cochrane Airways reviews.&lt;br&gt;- We list WMD, and RD for Risk Difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also if you feel that a 2% difference in FEV1 is of no clinical significance do you want to say this in your discussion of the results. Finally I am not certain how robust this accumulated evidence is (partly in view of no SDs reported and small numbers of patients in cross-over studies that cannot be analysed properly in RevMan without paired t-test results anyway!)&lt;br&gt;- We state in the discussion that there is no change in FEV1 for single-dose and longer duration trials and no change in symptoms. I believe it is clear that there is no clinical significance of a 2% difference that is not statistically significant and is associated with no change in symptoms. I also believe the results of the accumulated evidence is robust in this homogeneous group of trials, all that show no change in FEV1 or symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SS section &amp;amp; refs. checked 16/06/2005 Liz&lt;br&gt;Old title: Cardioselective beta-blocker use in patients with COPD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;========================================================================&lt;br&gt;CJC edit june 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's new: fine.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-11-15 12:13:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Long term treatment with beta-blocker medication reduces the risk of death in patients with high blood pressure, heart failure and coronary artery disease. But patients who have both COPD and cardiovascular disease sometimes do not receive these medicines because of fears that they may worsen the airways disease. This review of data from 22 randomised controlled trials on the use of cardioselective (heart-specific) beta-blockers in patients with COPD demonstrated no adverse effect on lung function or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo. This finding was consistent whether patients had severe chronic airways obstruction or a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be withheld from patients with COPD.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Beta-blocker therapy has a proven mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period.

<P>A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (derived from systematic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) was carried out to identify randomised blinded controlled trials from 1966 to August 2010. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2010-10-13 17:14:51 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Randomised, blinded, controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-10-31 01:49:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 11 of treatment for longer durations, ranging from 2 days to 16 weeks, met selection criteria. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given as a single dose or for longer duration, produced no change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, and did not affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction, those with a reversible obstructive component, or those with concomitant cardiovascular disease.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with COPD in the identified studies did not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be routinely withheld from patients with COPD. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-11-15 12:21:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Beta-adrenergic blocking agents, or beta-blockers, are indicated in the management of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia and thyrotoxicosis, as well as to reduce complications in the perioperative period (<LINK REF="REF-Beattie-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beattie 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doughty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doughty 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fitzgerald-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzgerald 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Freemantle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freemantle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heidenreich-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heidenreich 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-IPPSH-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPPSH 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koch_x002d_Weser-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch-Weser 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lechat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mangano-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mangano 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McGory-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McGory 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinbeck-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinbeck 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wadworth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadworth 1991</LINK>). Despite clear evidence of their effectiveness and mortality benefit, clinicians are often hesitant to administer beta-blockers in the presence of a variety of common conditions for fear of adverse reactions (<LINK REF="REF-Chafin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chafin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egred-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egred 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kennedy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kennedy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viskin-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viskin 1996</LINK>). Review articles and practice guidelines have often listed asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as contraindications to beta-blocker use, citing cases of acute bronchospasm occurring during non-cardioselective beta-blocker use (<LINK REF="REF-Belli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belli 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Craig-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Craig 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1990</LINK>). Cardioselective beta-blockers, or beta1-blockers, have over 20 times greater affinity for beta-1 receptors as for beta-2 receptors, and theoretically should have significantly less risk for bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Wellstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellstein 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane review demonstrated that cardioselective beta1-blockers, given to patients with mild to moderate reversible airway disease, do not produce clinically significant adverse respiratory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2002</LINK>). The study was not designed to make recommendations about people with significant chronic airway obstruction because only a few COPD patients met the reversibility criteria for the study. Patients with COPD are at greater risk of ischemic heart disease than asthmatics, so would benefit from the use of beta-blockers. However, they also have more severe airways obstruction, so may be more sensitive to small changes in FEV1 due to beta-blockade.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effect of cardioselective beta1-blockers on respiratory function in patients with COPD, as assessed by FEV1 and the incidence of symptoms. Another objective was to evaluate the FEV1 response to beta2-agonists for those patients treated with beta1-blockers as compared to placebo.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2010-10-13 17:48:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>A search was performed to identify all relevant published clinical trials that address the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on airway function in patients with COPD. Trials were included if they: (1) reported FEV1 measured at rest, either as litres or as a percent of the normal predicted value at baseline and follow-up, or reported symptoms for study drug and placebo, (2) were randomised, controlled, and single or double-blinded, and (3) included only subjects with COPD, demonstrated by a baseline FEV1 of &lt; 80% normal predicted value, or as defined by the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>). Cross-over trials were considered to be randomised if different interventions were administered in random order. Controlled trials were those with placebo or comparative controls.</P>
<P>The decision was made to evaluate only cardioselective beta1-blockers in this study as these are the ones most frequently used in clinical practice. Studies were included only if participants had documented COPD, in order to evaluate the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with chronic airway obstruction. Only blinded studies were included in order to decrease the risk of reporting bias that is inherent in unblinded studies. It was decided a priori to data extraction that comparative trials studying FEV1 treatment effects of cardioselective beta-blockers without placebo controls would be included as long as they compared various interventions in a blinded randomised manner. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of including these studies. For studies that evaluated symptoms, only those that have placebo controls for comparison to active treatment were included.<BR/>
</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Participants studied were those with COPD, defined as a disease state with chronic airway obstruction according to the guidelines of the ATS (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>), or with a baseline FEV1 of less than 80% normal predicted value. Participants were not included or excluded on the basis of reversibility of their airway obstruction.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2010-10-28 18:11:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>The main intervention studied was the use of intravenous or oral cardioselective beta-blockers versus placebo or other interventions, given either as a single dose or for an extended period. A second intervention studied was the administration of a beta2-agonist, either intravenously or by inhalation, given after the study medication or placebo. For single-dose trials the beta-agonist was given one hour after the administration of an intravenous agent, and three to six hours after an oral agent was given.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2010-10-28 18:11:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two investigators (SS, TO) independently extracted data on three outcomes: (1) the change in FEV1 from baseline in response to study group or placebo, (2) FEV1 response to beta2-agonist administered after placebo or study drug, and (3) reported symptoms during the trial, such as wheezing, dyspnea, or COPD exacerbation, for study drug or placebo.</P>
<P>For single-dose trials of oral medications the FEV1 measurements were recorded from one to six hours after drug administration, with all trials measuring FEV1 at least three hours after treatment was given. When intravenous medications were used, the FEV1 was measured repeatedly for one hour after the treatment was given. For trials using beta2-agonists, FEV1 measurements were taken 10 minutes after intravenous beta-agonist and 20-30 minutes after inhalation of the agent.</P>
<P>Respiratory symptoms were measured according to a self-reporting system used for each trial, and were reported as the number of patients with symptoms. For single-dose trials respiratory symptoms were described as wheezing, dyspnea or breathlessness. For trials of longer duration patients were to record symptoms such as acute shortness of breath, increased respiratory symptoms, asthma attacks or COPD exacerbations.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2010-10-28 18:11:16 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Two investigators (SS, TO) jointly developed search strategies, with the help of an information service librarian and the Cochrane Airways Group Trial Search Co-ordinator. A search was performed using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register to identify blinded controlled trials on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The Specialised Register is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, and hand-searching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts (please see the <A HREF="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clabout/articles/AIRWAYS/frame.html">Airways Group Module</A> for further details). All records in the Specialised Register coded as 'COPD' were searched using the following terms:</P>
<P>(adrenergic* and antagonist*) or (adrenergic* and block*) or (adrenergic* and beta-receptor*) or (beta-adrenergic* and block*) or (beta-blocker* and adrenergic*) or (blockader* or Acebutolol or Alprenolol or Atenolol or Betaxolol or Bisoprolol or Bupranolol or Butoxamine or Carteolol or Celiprolol or Dihydroalprenolol or Iodocyanopindolol or Labetalol or Levobunolol or Metipranolol or Metoprolol or Nadolol or Oxprenolol or Penbutolol or Pindolol or Practolol or Propranolol or Sotalol or Timolol)</P>
<P>This search was adapted for use in CENTRAL and combined with the Airways Group 'COPD' search (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). The most recent searches were conducted in August 2010.</P>
<P>Trials were not excluded on the basis of language. The search was further augmented by scanning references of identified articles or reviews, and of abstracts at clinical symposia.</P>

<P>Two independent reviewers (SS, TO) extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Only published data from the trials were included in the analysis.

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2010-10-12 00:24:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The baseline FEV1 used for single-dose trials was that measured on the study day prior to the administration of study drug. For longer-duration trials baseline FEV1 measurements were taken prior to the initiation of treatment. For all trials in which more than one FEV1 measurement was reported after administration of the study drug the lowest FEV1 was used for the analysis.</P>
<P>To estimate the net treatment effect, the ratio of the lowest measured FEV1 value seen after study drug to baseline FEV1 were measured for both placebo and active treatment, and recorded as the percent change from baseline. The treatment response was then compared to the placebo response. For those studies without placebo controls (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) the treatment response for each intervention was measured and the placebo response was estimated from the available placebo-controlled trials. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of including these trials.</P>
<P>Results for respiratory symptoms were measured as a risk difference, by subtracting the number of participants with symptoms in the placebo group from the number of those with symptoms in the treatment group. The risk differences were then pooled using the fixed-effects model for dichotomous outcomes.</P>

<P>The net treatment effects for each of the FEV1 analyses were recorded as the mean percent change from baseline with SD, and pooled to get a weighted average of the study means using the random-effects model for continuous outcomes (DerSimonian-Laird method) (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Confidence intervals (CI) with 95% significance were obtained for the pooled study means. The random-effects model was used as there was evidence of potential inter-study heterogeneity in some of the analyses. The results using the random-effects model were then compared to that using the fixed-effects model for continuous outcomes (Mantel-Haenszel method) (<LINK REF="REF-Mantel-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mantel 1959</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yusuf-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>In order to evaluate the response to beta2-agonist given after active treatment or placebo, the new baseline used was the FEV1 taken after study drug but prior to beta-agonist.

<P>Cardioselective beta-blockers included in the study were atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, practolol, celiprolol and acebutolol (See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, Beta-blocker Categories).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Single-Dose Treatment Results:</HEADING>
<P>Eleven studies on single-dose treatment included 131 patients, 80% of whom were men. There was an average of 11.9 patients per study, and the dropout rate was 1.5%. From the available information the mean age of participants was 53.8 (+/- 11.1) years. These baseline characteristics were the same for the placebo and treatment groups because all of the trials were crossover by design. The baseline FEV1 measured in the treatment group was 1.64 (+/- 0.63) litres, and in the placebo group was 1.66 (+/- 0.64) litres.</P>
<P>Single doses of cardioselective beta-blockers were not associated with a change in FEV1 compared to placebo or to baseline controls with a mean difference (MD) of -2.08% (95% CI -5.25 to 1.09). No increase in respiratory symptoms were seen for beta1-blockers compared to placebo in any of the trials, with a risk difference (RD) of 0.0% (95%CI -0.04 to 0.04). In the two trials that measured response to inhaled beta2-agonist after treatment and after placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1979</LINK>), there was no significant change in the net treatment effect (MD -1.21%; 95% CI -10.97 to 8.56).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Longer Duration Treatment Results:</HEADING>
<P>Data from 11 studies involving 185 participants and 1,436 patient-weeks were evaluated for treatment effects of longer duration ranging from 2 days to 16 weeks, with a mean trial duration of 5.3 weeks. There was an average of 16.8 participants in each study (78% of whom were men), with a 4.5% dropout rate. The average baseline FEV1 in the treatment group was 1.81 (+/- 0.72) litres, and for the placebo group was 1.80 (+/- 0.73) litres.</P>
<P>When cardioselective beta-blockers were compared to placebo, there was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect (MD -2.73; 95% CI -6.03 to 0.57) or respiratory symptoms (RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04). In the three trials that measured FEV1 response to inhaled beta2-agonist after treatment and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-der-Woude-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van der Woude 2005</LINK>), there was no significant difference in the net treatment effect after treatment compared to placebo (MD -0.70; 95% CI -5.02 to 3.63).</P>
<P>Two new trials have been added to this update (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2010</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>) showed a statistically significant reduction in FEV1 for treatment compared with placebo (MD -14.6%; 95% CI -24.16 to -5.04). In this trial, the placebo group had a 10% increase in FEV1 over the course of the study, possibly because the baseline FEV1 before treatment was lower in the placebo group (1.26 L) compared with the treatment group (1.37 L). Treatment had no effect on respiratory symptoms or response to subsequent beta2-agonists. The other trial added to this update (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2010</LINK>) found no significant effect of treatment on FEV1, respiratory symptoms or bronchodilator response. No other trial in the meta-analysis showed significant results for FEV1 treatment effect, symptoms, or beta2-agonist response.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Inter-study Heterogeneity:</HEADING>
<P>There was minimal inter-study variance in the measurement of FEV1 for single-dose studies (p = 0.62), or for respiratory symptoms in single-dose studies (p = 1) and longer-duration trials (p = 0.99). For these analyses, the results were the same whether the fixed-effect model or the random-effects model were used.</P>
<P>There was evidence for potential inter-study heterogeneity in the measurement of FEV1 in studies of longer duration (p = 0.07). The results for this analysis were similar when using the random-effects model (MD -2.73; 95% CI -6.03 to 0.57) or the fixed-effects model (MD -2.34; 95% CI -4.71 to 0.02). One of the trials in this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>) showed a statistically significant reduction in FEV1 for treatment compared with placebo. When this trial was removed from the analysis, there was no evidence of inter-study heterogeneity among the remaining trials (p = 0.54).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup Analyses:</HEADING>
<P>In order to evaluate the effect of treatment in patients with severe chronic airways obstruction, six trials that demonstrated an average baseline FEV1 of &lt; 1.4 litres or &lt; 50% normal predicted values were analysed separately (<LINK REF="STD-Butland-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Butland 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGavin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McGavin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wunderlich-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderlich 1980</LINK>). When the analysis was limited to those with severe obstruction there still was no significant difference in FEV1 treatment effect for single-dose trials (MD -0.71; 95% CI -5.69 to 4.27) or for longer-duration trials (MD -3.11; 95% CI -8.62 to 2.41), and there was no increase in symptoms in any of these trials.</P>
<P>Another subgroup analysed patients who had COPD with a reversible component, as demonstrated by an improvement in FEV1 of at least 15% after beta2-agonists (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorow-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Dorow 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dorow-1986b" TYPE="STUDY">Dorow 1986b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macquin_x002d_Mavier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Macquin-Mavier 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Wichert-1982" TYPE="STUDY">von Wichert 1982</LINK>). When these seven trials were analysed separately, there still was no significant change in FEV1 seen in single-dose trials (MD -1.80; 95% CI -7.01 to 3.41) or those of longer duration (MD -1.27; 95% CI -6.04 to 3.49), and no increase in symptoms were found in any study.</P>
<P>In eight of the trials, all participants had comorbid cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, angina or heart failure (<LINK REF="STD-Adam-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Anderson-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Anderson 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Macquin_x002d_Mavier-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Macquin-Mavier 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perks-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Perks 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tivenius-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Tivenius 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-von-Wichert-1982" TYPE="STUDY">von Wichert 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wunderlich-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wunderlich 1980</LINK>). When only these trials were included in the analysis, there was no significant FEV1 treatment effect seen for single-dose studies (MD -1.80; 95% CI -7.01 to 3.41) or for those of longer duration (MD -3.85; 95% CI -13.37 to 5.66). No respiratory symptoms were seen in the treatment group in any of the studies.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Sensitivity Analyses:</HEADING>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect on FEV1 of including studies that did not provide placebo controls (<LINK REF="STD-McGavin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McGavin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorbini-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sorbini 1982</LINK>).

All seven of the longer-duration trials of FEV1 provided placebo controls, although 2 of these did not provide data on the baseline FEV1 prior to placebo administration (<LINK REF="STD-Dorow-1986a" TYPE="STUDY">Dorow 1986a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>).

<P>Another sensitivity analysis evaluated the effect of including trials that did not provide study SDs for the FEV1 treatment effect (<LINK REF="STD-Fenster-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Fenster 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogari-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fogari 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ranchod-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Ranchod 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McGavin-1978" TYPE="STUDY">McGavin 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sinclair-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Sinclair 1979</LINK>). Excluding trials that did not provide SD data did not significantly effect the results for single-dose trials (MD -3.01%; 95%CI -7.12 to 1.09), or for those of longer duration (MD 2.48%; 95%CI -8.11 to 3.14). Another analysis was performed by replacing the pooled SD with the lowest and highest available SD. For the single-dose trials and longer duration trials, the difference in results between the highest and lowest SD was not significantly different, with an absolute change in FEV1 of less than 1%.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-15 12:34:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Summary:</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis pooled 22 randomised, blinded controlled trials on the use of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with COPD. These trials demonstrated that cardioselective beta-blockers, given as a single dose or for longer durations, produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, and did not effect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. These findings were unchanged in subgroup analyses of COPD patients with FEV1 &lt; 1.4 litres or &lt; 50 % normal predicted values, or for those with a reversible obstructive component (FEV1 increase of &gt; 15% to beta2-agonists). In addition, beta-blockers were found to be well tolerated in trials that evaluated patients with comorbid cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, angina and heart failure. The findings of this analysis are supported by the results of another meta-analysis that demonstrated that cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with reversible airway disease did not produce clinically significant adverse respiratory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In one of the 22 trials, beta-blocker treatment resulted in a small reduction in FEV1 compared with placebo, without affecting respiratory symptoms or bronchodilator response (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 2009</LINK>). In this trial, a four-month course of bisoprolol in patients with moderate to severe COPD and concomitant symptomatic heart failure was associated with a non-significant trend towards improved quality of life and functional status compared with placebo. Another trial reported a reduction in peak flow rate for beta-blocker treatment compared with placebo, but did not provide sufficient FEV1 data to be included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Butland-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Butland 1983</LINK>). In this trial, atenolol and metoprolol treatment in patients with severe COPD (FEV1 &lt; 30% normal predicted values) increased exercise tolerance due to a reduction in heart rate, oxygen consumption, and minute ventilation, without affecting respiratory symptoms. None of the other trials in the analysis found a treatment effect on FEV1, respiratory symptoms or bronchodilator response. This indicates that small reductions in airflow that may be seen with cardioselective beta-blockers do not pose clinical problems. In fact, treatment still results in improvements in exercise tolerance and functional status, as has been consistently shown with beta-blocker treatment in cardiac disease (<LINK REF="REF-Abdulla-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdulla 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hulsmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulsmann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poulsen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poulsen 2000</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Limitations of the Review:</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis has several limitations, some that are similar to those found with most meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Ionnidis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ionnidis 1999</LINK>). The analysis only reports on published literature and is therefore subject to publication bias. Most of the studies were small and 80% of the participants were men. The randomisation process was not well delineated in many of the studies and some were single-blinded rather than double-blinded. A few studies did not have placebo controls, and many did not provide individual study standard deviations for FEV1 treatment effects. However, sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of including these trials and the results were found to be consistent throughout, due to the relatively homogeneous nature of the individual trial results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Generalisability and Applicability of Results:</HEADING>
<P>This current meta-analysis indicates that the use of cardioselective beta-blockers is safe in patients who have COPD, with or without a reversible component. Treatment was also found to be safe for a subgroup of patients with concomitant angina, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure or hypertension. These findings are consistent with other studies that have investigated the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD and concomitant hypertension or cardiac disease and have found that these medicines were well tolerated, without any worsening of respiratory symptoms or FEV1 (<LINK REF="STD-Camsari-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Camsari 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Falliers-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Falliers 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Formgren-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Formgren 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-George-1983" TYPE="STUDY">George 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jabbour-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Jabbour 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krauss-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krauss 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mooss-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mooss 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quan-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Quan 1983</LINK>). Observational studies have evaluated beta-blocker use in patients with COPD and concomitant cardiac disease and have showed a significant reduction in total mortality for those treated with beta-blockers compared to those who were not (<LINK REF="REF-Au-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Au 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Gestel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Gestel 2008</LINK>). Other studies have shown that beta-blocker use in patients with COPD are associated with a significant reduction in COPD exacerbations and COPD deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Dransfield-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dransfield 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutten-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutten 2010</LINK>), possibly as a result of improved myocardial and ventilatory efficiency.</P>
<P>The standard of care in the 1980s and 1990s was to avoid the use of beta-blockers in patients with reactive or obstructive airway disease (<LINK REF="REF-Belli-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Belli 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-JNC-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Malley-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Malley 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tattersfield-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tattersfield 1990</LINK>). This reluctance to use beta-blockers was based on case reports of acute bronchospasm in patients with reversible airway disease precipitated by high doses of non-cardioselective beta-blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNeill-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNeill 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raine-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raine 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zaid-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zaid 1966</LINK>). Only a small fraction of patients with heart disease who would benefit from beta-blockers were being given this treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Krumholz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumholz 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sial-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sial 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soumerai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soumerai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 1998</LINK>). A study by Heller and colleagues published in 2000 showed that COPD and asthma were the comorbidities most commonly associated with beta-blockers being withheld in elderly patients after a myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Heller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heller 2000</LINK>). More recently, evidence of the safety of beta-blockers in obstructive airways disease has been accumulating, but still there is significant underutilization of beta-blockers in patients with concomitant COPD and cardiac disease (<LINK REF="REF-Egred-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egred 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cardioselective beta-blockers such as atenolol, bisoprolol and metoprolol are at least 20 times more potent at blocking beta-1 receptors than beta-2 receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Wellstein-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wellstein 1987</LINK>). The studies in this meta-analysis gave doses of beta-blockers ranging from therapeutic to supra-therapeutic doses, those that are not generally used for initiation of treatment. For example, subjects were given single doses of metoprolol or atenolol ranging from 50 to 200 mg, without a clinically apparent effect on respiratory function.</P>
<P>The cardioselective beta-blockers used in this trial included those with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In the single-dose trials that measured FEV1 treatment effect, only beta1-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity were studied, so these could not be compared to those with sympathomimetic activity. In the longer duration trials, when cardioselective beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (acebutolol and celiprolol) were compared to those without activity (atenolol and metoprolol), there was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect. Of note, the cardiovascular benefits seen with beta-blockers appear to be lost when intrinsic sympathomimetic activity is present (<LINK REF="REF-Wadworth-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wadworth 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Due to the proven mortality benefit of beta-blockers in numerous conditions, many of the other relative or absolute contraindications traditionally listed for beta-blockers have been questioned and disproved, including impaired left ventricular function, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, depression, and advanced age (<LINK REF="REF-Beto-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beto 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bright-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bright 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gottlieb-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gottlieb 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jonas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kjekshus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjekshus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krumholz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krumholz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lechat-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lechat 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Opie-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opie 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Radack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosenson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wicklmayr-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wicklmayr 1990</LINK>). This meta-analysis suggests that cardioselective beta-blockers can safely be given to patients with COPD, even for those with a reversible component or with severe baseline obstruction. It is clear from this evidence that the proven benefit of cardioselective beta-blocker treatment far outweighs the risks in these patients, as found in the studies identified in this review.<BR/>
