<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-09-20 13:18:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is now evidence to show beneficial effect of heparin for preventing complications when used with central catheters to give access to the tiny veins of premature and critically ill babies</P>
<P>Critically ill or premature babies (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) often need medication and feeding through their veins. These veins are small and fragile so repeated injections can be hard and painful for the baby. A central catheter is a small tube that can be inserted into the vein, allowing medications and other liquids to be given to the baby for a prolonged period. It can get dislodged, blocked or infected. The drug heparin allows to complete intended therapy in more patients without increasing complications of bleeding or allergic reactions. The review found that there was now evidence to show benefit of heparin. If it is used routinely, careful monitoring of side effects is warranted.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-12-28 23:43:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complications associated with peripherally placed percutaneous central venous catheters (PCVC) in neonates include catheter thrombosis, occlusion or dislodgement and infection. Strategies to prevent catheter thrombosis and occlusion include the use of heparin. However, heparin is known to be associated with complications such as bleeding and thrombocytopenia.</P>

<P>Randomized or quasi-randomised clinical trials of neonates where heparin infusion was compared to placebo or no treatment for prevention of any of the complications related to peripherally placed PCVC were included.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-12-28 23:47:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We collected and analysed the data in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-12-28 23:49:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four randomised trials were identified. Three trials (including 477 infants) of adequate methodology met the eligibility criteria. There was reduced risk of catheter occlusion (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.67; and NNT 9, 95% CI 6 to 20). There was no statistically significant difference in the duration of catheter patency; however, in one study survival analyses identified benefit with heparin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.36, 0.83). This could be due to higher incidence of elective removal of catheters in neonates at the completion of therapy in the heparin group in that study (63% vs. 42%; p = 0.002). There was no statistically significant differences in the risk of thrombosis (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.51), catheter related sepsis (typical RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.57), or extension of intraventricular haemorrhage (typical RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.28) between the two groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-12-28 23:43:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic use of heparin for peripherally placed PCVC allows a greater number of infants to complete their intended use (complete therapy) by reducing occlusion. Evidence from this systematic review support the prophylactic use of heparin for PCVC in neonates. None of these studies was powered to evaluate a lower incidence rate of adverse events. If this therapy is adopted in routine practice, monitoring of side effects is indicated.</P>

<P>Vascular access is a major challenge in the management of preterm and critically ill term infants in neonatal intensive care units. <LINK REF="REF-Shaw-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 1973</LINK> first described the successful placement of peripherally inserted percutaneous central venous catheters (PCVC) in neonates. In sick neonates these catheters have been shown to provide long-term vascular access necessary for the prolonged administration of parenteral nutrition and intravenous medications (<LINK REF="REF-Dolcourt-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dolcourt 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chathas-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chathas 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durand-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durand 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Loeff-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeff 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Puntis-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puntis 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harms-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harms 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite perceived benefits in neonates, peripherally inserted PCVC are associated with mechanical and infectious complications. Mechanical complications including occlusion, extravasation, dislodgement and thrombosis occur in 15 to 48% of inserted PCVC (<LINK REF="REF-Harms-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harms 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chathas-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chathas 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Durand-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Durand 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Nakamura-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakamura 1990</LINK> found complete (33%) and partial (33%) occlusion in catheter tips on electron microscopic examination. In addition, 39% of all catheter tip sheaths had evidence of thrombosis. Factors that have been associated with initiation and propagation of thrombosis include endothelial damage during catheter placement, blood vessel occlusion, low flow states, turbulent flow, patient and infusate characteristics and catheter composition (<LINK REF="REF-Pottecher-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pottecher 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krafte_x002d_Jacobs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krafte-Jacobs 1995</LINK>). Infectious complications include bacterial or fungal sepsis. Thrombosis of the line can act as a nidus for infection.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-01-01 08:01:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heparin has been administered by intermittent injection or continuous infusion to prevent thrombus formation and prolong catheter patency (<LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brismar-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brismar 1982</LINK>). In a systematic review involving all ages including neonates, <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of heparin (administered intermittently or as continuous infusion) on catheter patency and prevention of complications associated with peripheral arterial or venous catheters. The authors concluded that the use of heparin flushes at concentrations of 10 units/ml demonstrated no effect on catheter patency for peripheral venous lines; however, low dose heparin infusion through peripheral arterial catheters prolonged the patency of the catheter. The benefits of using heparin have to be weighed against the risks involved. Risks include allergic reactions, bleeding complications due to dosing error and occurrence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia which has been described in 3% of patients exposed to heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Spadone-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spadone 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Barrington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 2000</LINK> documented that heparin infusion is effective in improving umbilical arterial catheter patency in neonates, with no statistically significant evidence of adverse outcomes. The effectiveness of heparin use to prevent thrombosis in neonates with peripherally placed PCVC has not been systematically evaluated.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-01-01 08:19:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess methodological quality of studies.</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies Table. </P>
<P>In addition, for the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias Table: </P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data); </P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data): </P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); </P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear.  </P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear.  </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

Three studies met eligibility criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK>: Randomized 68 neonates (36 neonates in heparin group and 32 neonates in no heparin group). Each infant received only one catheter for the purpose of the study. The eligible neonates were stratified in three groups according to birth weight before randomisation. Neonates in the heparin group received 1 IU of heparin per ml of parenteral nutrition solution. The neonates in the no heparin group did not receive heparin in the parenteral nutrition solution. Premicath (27G) and Epicutaneocava (23 G) silicone catheters were used depending upon the size of infants. All patients were monitored for hyperbilirubinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, coagulation profile and platelet counts prior to insertion of catheter, at four days and eight days after catheter insertion or on removal of catheter if it was removed before four days. Catheter blockage was diagnosed (a) when there was inability to infuse fluid and (b) when clots were noted at the time of removal of catheter. The duration of catheter patency was defined as number of days the catheter stayed in situ. Catheter related sepsis was diagnosed when clinical symptoms and signs of sepsis were associated with positive catheter tip culture and blood culture for the same organism. There was protocol violation for two patients (one in each group). The details of the patients enrolled in this study are described in the table Characteristics of included studies.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK>: Randomized 201 neonates (100 neonates in heparin group and 101 neonates in no heparin group) at four centres in Ontario, Canada. One catheter per patients was studied. The eligible neonates were stratified in two groups according to gestational age (GA) before randomisation (&lt; 30 weeks GA and <U>&gt;</U> 30 weeks GA). Neonates in the heparin group received 0.5 IU/kg/hr of unfractionated heparin mixed in 5% or 10% dextrose solution (depending upon plasma glucose level) via a separate infusion pump but &#8220;Y&#8221;ed in to the running solution (TPN or normal saline). The solution was infused at 0.5 ml/hr (for neonates &lt; 30 weeks GA and 1 ml/hr for infants &gt; 30 weeks GA). Neonates in the placebo group received either 5% or 10% dextrose solution (depending upon plasma glucose level) running at similar rate as heparin infusions. Neo-PICC, L-cath, V-cath or Per-Q-cath catheters were used depending upon the choice and availability of catheter at study sites. All patients were monitored for clinical signs of sepsis and thrombosis. The primary outcome<I> </I>was<I> </I>duration of catheter use was defined as the time between insertion and removal (elective or because of complications) of the catheter in hours. Secondary outcomes included catheter occlusion defined as inability to infuse fluid; catheter-related sepsis defined as symptoms and signs suggestive of sepsis with a positive blood culture obtained from catheter fluid and a normally sterile site (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid) for the same organism; thrombosis was defined as the detection of a thrombus along the catheter path diagnosed by ultrasonography and Doppler examination within 72 hours after catheter removal and/or when clinically indicated (distal swelling and persistent thrombocytopenia); and other causes of catheter removal such as accidental dislodgment, leakage, extravasation, or breakage of the catheter. Each infant was monitored for haemorrhage from &gt; 2 noncontiguous sites and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), defined as a platelet count of &lt; 50,000/mL after exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia and a positive antibody test. Duration of catheter patency was compared using survival analyses (Kaplan Meir curve and Log-rank test).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>: Randomized 243 neonates (118 neonates in heparin group and 125 neonates in no heparin group). It appears that one catheter per patient was studied. The eligible neonates were stratified in three groups according to birth weight (&lt; 850 g, 850 to 2000 g and &gt; 2000 g). Sixteen patients in heparin group and 17 patients in no heparin group were excluded after randomisation due to no need for long line, inability to place long line, death before long line insertion, lack of parental consent and commencement of non-protocol infusion. Neonates in the heparin group (n = 102) received 0.5 IU/ml of unfractionated heparin mixed in total parenteral solution (TPN). The solution was infused at rates prescribed by attending team. Neonates in the control group received TPN without heparin. Epicutaneo Cava Katheter (23 gauge) and PremiCath (27 gauge) were used depending upon the choice of inserting physician. All patients were monitored for clinical signs of sepsis and extravasation. The primary outcome<I> </I>was<I> </I>number of episodes of catheter related sepsis and rate of catheter related sepsis per 1000 long line days. Secondary outcomes were bacteraemic episodes with organisms not commonly associated with line sepsis, definite or probable candida line infection, progression of IVH, catheter removal due to extravasation or occlusion and elective removal of catheter. Definite catheter related sepsis was defined as two positive blood cultures for the same organism taken from two separate sites within 72 hours of each other. Probable sepsis was defined as single positive blood culture and a peak C-reactive protein level &gt; 9 mg/l recorded from 24 hours before or 72 hours after the positive culture was drawn. Possible catheter related sepsis was defined as a single positive blood culture without elevation of C reactive protein.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK> performed a double blind placebo controlled randomised trial of use of heparin for peripherally inserted central venous catheters in neonates. The randomisation was done by one of the investigators (pharmacist) from previously prepared randomisation cards. No other investigators were aware of the treatment allocation. The heparin was mixed in the parenteral nutrition fluid. One patient each from both heparin and placebo group was removed from analysis because of the protocol violation. The authors have not reported masking of outcome assessment; however, the attending team was unaware of allocation when making decision regarding discontinuation of the catheter among the patients in whom the randomisation codes were not broken. The randomisation codes were broken prior to completion of the study in 13 patients (n = 5 heparin group and n = 8 no heparin group). The reasons for the breaking the code were development of bleeding tendencies (n = 2 heparin group and n = 4 no heparin group) and thrombocytopenia (n = 3 heparin group and n = 4 no heparin group). After breaking the code heparin was removed from the parenteral solutions from patients in heparin group and none of the patients developed blocked catheters. None of the patients were described to have more than one outcome.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK> performed a multicenter double blind placebo controlled randomised trial of the use of heparin for peripherally inserted central venous catheters in neonates. The randomisation was done centrally by pharmacist at all four hospitals from non-transparent sealed envelopes. No investigators or parents were aware of the treatment allocation. The heparin and placebo were delivered in identical containers labelled as study medication. Investigators and parents were unaware of randomisation through out the study. Two randomisation envelopes (one each in heparin and placebo group) were inadvertently opened for patients who did not have central venous catheters. These were excluded from analyses. Outcome assessment was masked. Radiologist reporting ultrasonography was unaware of treatment allocation. The randomisation codes were not broken for safety reasons in any patient. Primary outcome data were complete for all patients. Secondary outcome data especially for ultrasonography were missing for patients transferred to community centres or due to non-availability of machines and/or technicians.</P>

The randomisation was done centrally by a pharmacist. Neither investigators nor parents were aware of the treatment allocation. The heparin was added to the total parenteral solution. Of 243 patients randomised, 33 (16 in heparin group and 17 in control group) were excluded because of various reasons (catheter no longer required, inability to place catheter, death before catheter placement, lacked consent, initiation of non study nutrition).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-14 18:15:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In our previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2007</LINK>) of this systematic overview, two randomised controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK>) were identified. In our current update, another adequately powered randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>) was identified. All three studies are of good methodological quality. The combined estimate of effect reveals that addition of heparin for percutaneously placed central venous catheters allows completion of intended therapeutic use of catheter in neonates. There is reduced risk of catheter occlusion. The duration of catheter use was not significantly different between heparin and placebo groups (duration of catheter patency was not different); however, this could be explained by the fact that these catheters are removed at the end of their intended use and duration. Traditional continuous outcome assessment may not capture this adequately. Survival analysis with censoring of data is probably the correct method for such analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK>). The authors reported a hazard ratio of 0.55 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.83) for catheter usability in favour of heparin. This difference is clinically meaningful and strongly indicates efficacy.</P>
<P>There were no significant side effects reported in study by <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK>, whereas 20% of patients required opening of randomisation code because of safety issues in <LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK>. Increased incidences of complications (bleeding tendencies and thrombocytopenia) reported in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK>) may have resulted due to higher dose of heparin used. Infants in the heparin group received heparin in the dose of 1 IU/ml of parenteral nutrient solution, which could result in on an average &gt; 100 IU/kg/d of heparin delivered to those infants. Most of the studies of heparin for peripheral intravenous catheters and umbilical artery catheters have used 0.25 to 0.5 IU/kg/hr resulting in a maximum of 12 IU/kg/d delivered to infants and have shown no increase in these complications. <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> used half dose 0.5 IU/ml than <LINK REF="STD-Kamala-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Kamala 2002</LINK> and did not observe increased incidence of side effects. A dose of 0.5 U/kg/hr used by <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK> resulted in elimination of such side effects; however, it must be recognized that neither studies were adequately powered to detect side effects, which are rare. There is heterogeneity between studies in terms of dose of heparin used; however, this keeps in with clinical heterogeneity in practice that we see in neonatal units. <LINK REF="STD-Shah-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shah 2007</LINK> showed an increase in longevity of catheter and higher numbers of patients were able to complete the intended use (0.5 IU/kg/hr) whereas <LINK REF="STD-Birch-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Birch 2010</LINK> showed reduction in incidence of catheter related sepsis (0.5 IU/ml of total parenteral solution). Thus, it will be difficult to generalize a specific dose; however, we can indicate that use of heparin is efficacious.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 2000</LINK> has evaluated the effectiveness of heparin for umbilical arterial catheter placement in a systematic review. Even in concentrations as low as 0.25 units/ml heparin was found to prolong umbilical artery catheter patency without significant adverse outcomes. However, the data from that review cannot be extrapolated to PCVC placement as the size of the catheters (internal diameter) used for umbilical arterial catheters is larger than that used for PCVC placement. In addition, the flow patterns in the aorta, where umbilical catheters are usually placed, differ from the relatively sluggish circulatory states of the venous system in which PCVC are placed, thus making PCVCs more prone to thrombus formation. In another systematic review, <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK> found that heparin was effective in preventing complications for peripheral arterial catheters but not for venous catheters. However, that review was not limited to the neonatal population.</P>
<P>With the new information available from this updated review, it could be concluded that heparin is effective in allowing increased number of patients to complete their therapy or intended use of PCVC, and reduces the risk of catheter occlusion. It is important that if this practice is adopted a careful reporting of side effects associated with the use of heparin for PCVC is indicated.</P>
