<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Some asthma sufferers rely on oral corticosteroids to control their disease. Corticosteroids help reduce the inflammation of the airways associated with asthma. Long-term use of these drugs has serious side effects, so other ways to reduce the need for corticosteroids are sometimes tried. Dapsone does have anti-inflammatory properties, and may have an effect on asthma symptoms and steroid doses taken. However, this review found that there was no evidence for or against the use of dapsone in the treatment of corticosteroid-dependent asthmatic patients. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2011-03-09 16:39:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Asthma is now considered an inflammatory disease that usually responds to treatment that focuses on reducing airway inflammation. To achieve control of the inflammation of the airways, inhaled and systemic corticosteroid drugs have been shown to be of proven benefit in asthmatic patients. However, since large doses of systemic corticosteroid drugs can result in unwanted and potentially serious side effects, the treatment of choice has focused on inhaled corticosteroids. Unfortunately, there remains a small sub-section of patients who do not respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. These patients tend to fall into two categories. Either they cannot be controlled by high doses of inhaled corticosteroids and, therefore need frequent or continued use of oral corticosteroids, or they simply fail to respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy altogether. While this sub-section of patients is indeed small (it has been estimated that this occurs 1:1000 to 1:10,000) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1996</LINK>) the clinical course of these types of asthma are often characterised by greater severity and more persistent symptoms. As a result of this clinical dilemma there has been a number of clinical trials examining the use of 'second-line' steroid sparing agents. The concept that these drugs may be of benefit in asthma has arisen from studies showing their benefits in other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. It has been proposed that these agents might have a similar effect in reducing steroid dosage in asthmatics. Various drugs have been suggested and include methotrexate, cyclosporin as well as dapsone. Whilst a systematic review of methotrexate and cyclosporin have been carried out, to date the benefit of using dapsone in asthma has not been established. </P>
<P>Dapsone is a sulfone with known anti-inflammatory and neutrophil-inhibiting properties used primarily in the treatment of leprosy, cutaneous and inflammatory disorders. Asthma is a consequence of airway inflammation with migration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils. Since the pathogenesis of asthma is now based mainly on an inflammatory model in which neutrophils may play a prominent role, it has been speculated that, at least in theory, dapsone may have a potentially beneficial effect (<LINK REF="STD-Ruhl-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ruhl 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>Side effects are dose-related and uncommon at doses used for leprosy, but may include nausea, anorexia, headache, insomnia and psychosis. Other more serious side effects include anaemia, theophylline intoxication, psychosis, rash and thrombocytopenia. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency cannot use dapsone since hypersensitivity reactions occur (<LINK REF="STD-Karpel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Karpel 1999</LINK>). Dapsone's long-term toxicities, however, compare favourably with those of gold salts and methotrexate. Dapsone is available in tablet form in 50 mg. and 100 mg. doses. The usual dose used for leprosy is 1 to 2 mg/kg daily.</P>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the effects of adding dapsone to oral corticosteroids in adults with stable asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids with the intention of eventually minimizing or eliminating the use of these steroids. Previous narrative reviews give the overall impression that dapsone it is of benefit, but a systematic review is needed.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to conduct a systematic assessment of the evidence to support the use of the agent dapsone in chronic stable asthmatics who are dependent on oral corticosteroids.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-03-09 11:13:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>There is a lack of RCTs addressing the efficacy of adding dapsone as an oral corticosteroid-sparing agent for asthma. This oral corticosteroid-dependent sub-section of asthmatic patients is small, but they often have asthma of greater severity and more persistent symptoms. They are also often at risk from the side effects of chronic oral steroid dosing. There is thus a need for trials that assess 'add on' therapies. There are two separate outcomes to consider in assessing these types of therapies: the efficacy of dapsone in terms of improved asthma control and the ability to reduce the level of oral corticosteroids needed to maintain control. The objective of this review was to assess the steroid -sparing effect of dapsone.</P>
<P>There has only been one open controlled trial, conducted <LINK REF="STD-Berlow-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berlow 1991</LINK>. Positive effects were noted in this trial of 10 subjects with stable, steroid-dependent asthma who were given oral dapsone 100 mg, twice daily. No tapering of oral steroids took place prior to commencement of the trial, although the paper states that this had been attempted independent of the trial, one or more times within the previous 12 months. The results showed average cumulative monthly prednisone dose was reduced from 428 mg to 82 mg (P&lt;0.02). Seven out of the ten patients stopped all oral steroids and were maintained on dapsone for periods of 7.4 to 20 months. None of the patients had required emergency care or hospitalisation. However, one responder had required three short courses of prednisone during a period of 9.5 months and one patient a single course in 13 months of follow-up.</P>
<P>It is difficult to interpret this study because it was unblinded and involved only small numbers of patients. Further, three patients out of the ten failed to complete the study because of side effects, namely one because of malaise, one having a rash and thrombocytopenia and one patient because of a psychotic episode.</P>
<P>Given the lack of high quality randomised controlled trials, there is no level 1 unbiased evidence to support the effect of dapsone in steroid-dependent asthmatics. Future studies must be carried out double-blind, since oral corticosteroid reduction requires a judgement on the part of the physician, who may be open to bias if the treatment allocation is known.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No relevant trials have been published, so this review concludes that there is no evidence to indicate that dapsone is beneficial or otherwise in the management of steroid-dependent asthmatic patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for robust, well-designed randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy of adding dapsone to steroid-dependent asthmatic patients in order to reduce corticosteroid consumption.</P>
