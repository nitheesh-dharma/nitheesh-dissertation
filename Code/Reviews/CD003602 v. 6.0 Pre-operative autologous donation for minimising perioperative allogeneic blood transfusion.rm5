<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Not certain that people are better off giving their own blood before surgery in case they need transfusion, when there is a safe blood bank</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Although in developed countries the safety of blood supplies is high, there is still concern about contracting illness from transfusion. People often give their own blood before surgery for use if transfusion is needed (autologous donation). However, the review of trials found that it is not certain that people benefit. While pre-operative donation may reduce the chances of needing someone else's blood, it increases the chances of transfusion overall. It may be that donation causes some anaemia (low red blood cells), or surgeons are more likely to transfuse if autologous blood is available. Over-transfusion has risks, especially for older people.</P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-01-20 13:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<P>Articles were identified by searches of the electronic databases; MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to Week 31, 2009), ISI Web of Science (inception to August 2009), <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2009, Issue 3, and The Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched August 7 2009). Reference lists in relevant publications were checked and authors were contacted to identify additional studies. The searches were updated in August 2009.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials with a concurrent control group in which adult patients, scheduled for non-urgent surgery, were randomised to PAD, or to a control group who did not receive the intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:46:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Data were independently extracted and the risk of bias was assessed. Relative risks (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The principal outcomes were the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic red blood cells (RBCs) and the amount of blood transfused. Other clinical outcomes are detailed in the review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:31:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Fourteen trials were included. Overall PAD reduced the risk of receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion by a relative 68% (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). The absolute reduction in risk of allogeneic transfusion was 44% (risk difference (RD) -0.44; 95% CI -0.68 to -0.21). In contrast, the results show that the risk of receiving any blood transfusion (allogeneic and/or autologous) is increased by PAD (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.51). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity for both of these outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:31:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Although the trials of PAD showed a reduction in the need for allogeneic blood, the methodological quality of the trials was poor and the overall transfusion rates (allogeneic and/or autologous) in these trials were high, and were increased by recruitment into the PAD arms of the trials. This raises questions about the true benefit of PAD. In the absence of large, high quality trials using clinical endpoints, it is not possible to say whether the benefits of PAD outweigh the harms.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-01-20 14:03:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Blackhall">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:31:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Public concern regarding the safety of transfused blood has prompted a reconsideration of the role of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion (whole blood or packed red cells from an unrelated donor). The risks associated with receiving transfusion of allogeneic blood that has been screened by a competent blood transfusion program are considered minimal, with very low risks of transmission of HIV, and hepatitis C (<LINK REF="REF-Whyte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 1997</LINK>). However, this only applies where there is a safe, plentiful, well-regulated supply. The majority of the world's population does not have access to such a system, and the risks of transfusion in developing countries may be much higher (<LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1997</LINK>). Concerns of patients and clinicians regarding blood safety have generated enthusiasm for the use of technologies intended to reduce the need for allogeneic blood (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forgie-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forgie 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huet-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huet 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laupacis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laupacis 1998</LINK>). Some of the alternatives to allogeneic blood have their own risks, and are expensive (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Generally, such interventions fall into two groups: (1) techniques for reinfusing a patient's own blood (pre-operative autologous donation, acute normovolemic haemodilution, cell salvage), and (2) the administration of agents to diminish blood loss (aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid, fibrin sealant) or to promote red blood cell production (erythropoietin). Erythropoietin (EPO) may be used in association with autologous blood donation.</P>
<P>Pre-operative autologous donation (PAD) is applicable to patients scheduled for elective surgery who are judged likely to have blood losses that require red blood cell replacement. PAD involves the patient donating one or more units of his/her own blood pre-operatively; this blood is held within the blood bank where it is available to the anaesthetist to administer during or after surgery.</P>
<P>This review examines the clinical evidence of the efficacy of pre-operative autologous blood donation (PAD) in reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusion in elective surgery, and whether there is a greater reduction in allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in identifiable patient sub-groups. The review uses methods developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, and the International Study of Perioperative Transfusion (ISPOT) study group (a ten-country study of evidence, attitudes and practices relating to the use of alternatives to perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion) (<LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 1999b</LINK>). More detailed consideration of the benefits and harms of allogeneic red cell transfusion and the advantages of avoiding transfusion is provided in an accompanying review of the efficacy of anti-fibrinolytic drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Henry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2001</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To examine the evidence for the efficacy of PAD in reducing allogeneic blood transfusion and the evidence for any effect on clinical outcomes, such as mortality and infection rates. </P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2009-12-17 23:53:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The titles and abstracts identified in the electronic searches were screened independently by two authors (by one author for the 2009 update). To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to include adult patients, scheduled for elective non-urgent surgery, who were randomised to PAD or to a control group who did not receive PAD. To be eligible study reports had to have collected data on the proportion of patients transfused with red blood cells or the volumes of blood transfused.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:49:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Two authors (one author for the 2009 update) independently selected trials that met the defined inclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>One author performed data extraction. The following information was recorded on the data extraction form: the number of patients exposed to allogeneic blood; the amount of allogeneic blood transfused; the number of patients receiving any transfusion (allogeneic blood and/or autologous blood); the number of patients experiencing postoperative complications (thrombosis, infection) and mortality. Data were collected on pre-operative haemoglobin levels when this was reported. Information regarding demographic characteristics (age, sex), the type of surgery, and the presence or absence of a transfusion protocol was also recorded. Data were extracted for allogeneic blood transfusion if it was expressed as whole blood or packed red cells. Information regarding the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or platelets was also recorded.</P>
<P>Data were entered into the Review Manager database by one author. Articles identified as duplicate publications were combined to obtain one set of data. The report with the greatest number of patients for that study was then represented in the analysis. Data on the numbers of patients exposed to allogeneic blood, and the numbers of patients in each treatment group, were entered into Review Manager. The relative risks (RR) for allogeneic blood transfusion in the intervention group as compared with the control group, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for each trial.</P>

<P>Fourteen eligible studies were identified and included in the analysis. The included trials were conducted in Canada (n = 1), Germany (n = 3), Greece (n = 2), Japan (n = 1), Sweden (n = 3), The Netherlands (n = 2), and the USA (n = 2). Six trials involved orthopaedic surgery, four involved curative surgery for colorectal cancer, two involved liver surgery, one involved maxillofacial surgery and one involved cardiac surgery.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Autologous donation range</HEADING>
<P>The volume of blood donated by each participant varied. Seven trials used predonation of two units of autologous blood and one trial evaluated predonation of three units (450 mL per unit) of autologous blood. The remaining trials studied a range of predonation volumes. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Kajikawa-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kajikawa 1994</LINK>, 2-6 units (200 mL per unit) were withdrawn from each patient prior to surgery. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Elawad-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elawad 1991</LINK>, three study groups of 15 patients each donated on average between 2.8 to 3.0 units each prior to surgery. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Ekback-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ekback 1995</LINK> study participants predonated 2-3 units of autologous blood within six weeks prior to surgery. In <LINK REF="STD-Bezwada-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwada 2003</LINK> two units were predonated for participants undergoing bilateral or revision arthroplasty and one unit for those undergoing primary unilateral arthroplasty. Participants in <LINK REF="STD-Billote-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Billote 2002</LINK> predonated two units, although two patients only donated one unit. In <LINK REF="STD-Christopoulou-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Christopoulou 2001</LINK> 24 patients predonated two units while four others undergoing bimaxillary osteotomies, donated two units. In <LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 2008</LINK> two units of 350 mL were predonated.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Transfusion 'triggers'/thresholds</HEADING>
<P>Of the 10 trials that reported the use of transfusion protocols, all included a transfusion 'trigger'. The transfusion threshold or 'trigger' was either the haemoglobin or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF) value at which point a transfusion of autologous and/or allogeneic blood was considered appropriate. There was significant variation between trials in the transfusion threshold value used. <LINK REF="STD-Lorentz-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lorentz 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kostopanagiotou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Kostopanagiotou 2007</LINK> commenced blood transfusion if the haemoglobin of the patient fell to less than 9.0 g/dL in the operating room, or less than 10.0 g/dL in the intensive care unit postoperatively. <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1997</LINK> commenced blood transfusion if the haemoglobin of the patient fell to less than 9.0 g/dL. <LINK REF="STD-Hoynck-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoynck 1992</LINK> commenced blood transfusion when the haemoglobin concentration repeatedly fell below 10.5 g/dL. <LINK REF="STD-Busch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Busch 1993</LINK> initiated blood transfusion if blood loss exceeded 500 mL or when the haemoglobin concentration fell below 10.5 g/dL. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1993</LINK> blood transfusion was recommended when the haemoglobin level fell below 10.0 g/dL. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Ekback-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Ekback 1995</LINK> study participants were transfused to correct the EVF to greater than 27%. <LINK REF="STD-Bezwada-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bezwada 2003</LINK> initiated blood transfusion if the haemoglobin level reached 80 g/L or less and/or there was persistent tachycardia or hypotension requiring large volumes of crystalloid.

In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1996</LINK> study participants donated four weeks and two weeks prior to surgery. Study participants in the <LINK REF="STD-Elawad-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Elawad 1991</LINK> trial donated 31 to 40 days before operation, with nine to 16 days between each phlebotomy. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Hoynck-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hoynck 1992</LINK> participants donated two units, seven to 14 days before the operation, with at least a three-day interval between donations. In the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Busch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Busch 1993</LINK> patients assigned to the autologous-transfusion group were required to donate blood twice.

<P>Details are presented in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>.</P>
<P>Ten trials reported giving iron supplementation to study participants in conjunction with pre-operative autologous blood donation. All patients in the trial conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Hedstrom-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hedstrom 1996</LINK>, received iron supplementation, consisting of 100mg of iron given orally, twice a day, after the first donation until the day of the operation.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-01-20 10:55:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Evidence of benefit</HEADING>
<P>The results of the meta-analysis indicate that pre-operative donation of autologous blood reduces exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion by 68%. However, for those patients who donated autologous blood the risk of receiving any transfusion (allogeneic and/or autologous) was increased by 24%. The increased rate of exposure to any transfusion may be attributed to two factors: (1) patients who donate autologous blood in general have lower preoperative haemoglobin levels than those patients who do not predonate autologous blood, and therefore have an increased probability of requiring an intra-operative and/or postoperative blood transfusion; (2) the availability of predonated autologous blood engenders a more liberal transfusion policy (<LINK REF="REF-Faught-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faught 1998</LINK>). An analysis we performed of 35 non-randomised studies of PAD (<LINK REF="REF-Carless-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carless 2004</LINK>) showed that the overall transfusion rate (allogeneic and/or autologous) was 67% in patients allocated to PAD. This result is similar to what was seen in this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, which showed an overall transfusion rate (allogeneic and/or autologous) of 78% in those patients randomised to PAD.</P>
<P>On the basis of the current evidence, PAD appears effective in reducing exposure to allogeneic blood. However, pre-operative autologous donation exposes patients to other potential risks associated with blood donation and blood transfusion. As reported by <LINK REF="REF-McVay-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McVay 1990</LINK> the incidence of reactions occurring at the time of donation is similar for allogeneic and autologous donors (between 2% and 5%), with most reactions being mild and of a vasovagal origin. Autologous blood can become contaminated with bacteria, and can cause circulatory overload, particularly in elderly patients if used in a liberal fashion without a transfusion protocol. As with any transfusion there is the ever present risk of transfusing the wrong blood due to clerical, laboratory, or ward error (<LINK REF="REF-Faught-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Faught 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The overall benefits of PAD probably outweigh the harms for some groups, for instance those who have been alloimmunized through repeated transfusion and are contemplating elective surgery. However, a full assessment of the balance of benefit and harm requires a better understanding of the clinical value of legitimate indications for red cell transfusion. The trend in the last decade has been to promote lower transfusion thresholds (i.e. the haemoglobin or haematocrit levels below which transfusion is indicated) (<LINK REF="REF-Carson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carson 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1999</LINK>). This is the best way of reducing exposure to allogeneic blood and conserving it for patients who really need it. The same rule should be applied in centres where donated blood is inadequately screened for viral contamination. However, it can be argued that there may be a stronger case for PAD where there are doubts about the safety of the blood supply.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>In individual studies the numbers of adverse events were small. Although we found a small decrease in the rate of infection in those patients randomised to PAD, the treatment effect did not reach statistical significance. There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effect of PAD on mortality, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolus. PAD predisposes patients to pre-operative anaemia, which increases a patient's risk of requiring a perioperative blood transfusion. The results of the meta-analysis showed that on average the pre-operative haemoglobin levels of those patients randomised to PAD was 1.09 g/dL (95% CI 0.68 to 1.50 g/dL) less than in those patients who did not donate their blood.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>In our review we found a number of small trials. Reliance on small trials raises concerns about the effects of publication bias. The degree to which publication bias may have impacted on the overall results of this review is difficult to determine as the small number of trials hampered any formal evaluation. However, the presence of publication bias cannot be discounted as the asymmetry of the generated funnel plot for allogeneic blood transfusion suggests a 'missing population' of small negative trials (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality of the assessed trials was generally poor. Only one trial was rated as being at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, with the remainder being rated as unclear. Additionally, none of the trials were judged to have been adequately blinded. The lack of allocation concealment and adequate blinding indicates that most of the trials assessed may have been open to bias, which may have been in favour of the intervention. The inadequate reporting of the methods used to generate allocation sequences also raises questions as to whether selection bias may have been introduced. In light of the poor methodological quality of the trials reviewed, the results may need to be viewed with some degree of caution.</P>
<P>As the decision to transfuse (the primary outcome in the meta-analysis) is a practice variable (rather than a measured clinical variable), it therefore involves a degree of subjectivity. This raises concerns about blood transfusion exposure as an outcome variable in unblinded trials, particularly in the absence of transfusion protocols. There is little consensus on appropriate transfusion thresholds, and even in centres where transfusion triggers were promulgated, there was probably a large degree of subjectivity in the decision. To some degree the decision to transfuse will be based on the type of procedure, the anticipated degree of blood loss and the particular susceptibility of the patient to hypovolemia or anaemia. As the haemoglobin level used as the transfusion threshold was rather high (&gt; 10.0 g/dL) for most of the trials assessed, it suggests perioperative blood transfusion was used quite liberally, and in unblinded studies this may have inflated the differences in the frequency of transfusion between groups. If a more conservative transfusion threshold (&lt; 8.0-9.0 g/dL) had been adopted then the frequency of allogeneic blood transfusion observed in the control group might have been significantly reduced. Therefore, it is conceivable that the choice of the primary outcome (the decision to transfuse with allogeneic red cells) has introduced bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sources of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Marked heterogeneity in trial outcomes was observed in some outcomes. Overall the variation was in terms of the size, not the direction, of effect. We considered a number of factors that might explain variation in the size of the treatment effect. These included the concomitant use of clinical transfusion thresholds (or transfusion triggers), the type of operation, the clinical setting, and the type of clinical outcome studied. Most of the observed heterogeneity seemed to be explained by the type of surgery and the use of a transfusion protocol. As transfusion requirements (allogeneic and/or autologous) were assessed over the intra-operative and postoperative periods (from surgery to hospital discharge), for all of the included trials, variation in the length of outcome assessment does not appear to be a source of heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical significance of the results</HEADING>
<P>The true value of avoiding allogeneic red cell transfusion is debatable. Conceivably, patients who are concerned about the risks of contracting illness through transfusion will be more interested in avoiding it completely, rather than reducing the volume of transfused blood. However, the importance of avoiding transfusion depends on the probability of avoiding disease transmission, or other adverse effects that have been attributed to blood transfusion (for instance immunosuppression) (<LINK REF="REF-Blumberg-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blumberg 1997</LINK>). The rate of transmission of HIV or viral hepatitis in most developed countries is very low, because of the quality of screening of donated blood (<LINK REF="REF-Coyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyle 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 1997</LINK>). As noted earlier in this review, this assumption does not apply equally in developing countries. Allogeneic red cell transfusion is administered frequently in developing countries, blood may be inadequately screened, and the prevalence of viral pathogens amongst donors is high (<LINK REF="REF-Kimball-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimball 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McFarland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McFarland 1997</LINK>). In these settings there may be greater clinical value in pre-operative blood donation by individuals who are seronegative.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Conclusions</HEADING>
<P>Although the trials of PAD showed a reduction in the need for allogeneic blood, they were unblinded, and transfusion practices may have been influenced by knowledge of the trial status of individual patients. Furthermore, the overall transfusion rates in these trials were very high, and were increased by recruitment into the PAD arms of the trials. This raises questions about the true benefit of PAD in the field. Over-transfusion could lead to volume overload in elderly patients and those with left ventricular and renal impairment. Additional concerns about the use of PAD include handling errors, and the infection of the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1997</LINK>). Any benefit from avoidance of short-term immunosuppression and reduction in the risk of viral diseases, have to be set against the risks associated with the technique itself.</P>

<P>Whilst the results of the meta-analysis showed that PAD apparently reduced exposure to allogeneic blood, the poor methodological quality of the trials may have impacted on the magnitude of the beneficial effect of PAD. The lack of adequate allocation concealment and blinding is of concern, as the primary outcome, the decision to transfuse (a practice variable rather than a measured clinical variable), requires a degree of subjectivity, which may have been influenced by prior knowledge of the patient's treatment status. The subjective nature of blood transfusion raises concerns about the use of blood transfusion exposure as an outcome variable, particularly in unblinded trials.</P>
<P>Although the use of PAD provides the patient with a sense of wellbeing, knowing they will receive their own blood if needed, the process is not without its own risks. The use of PAD would appear to be most justified in some patients who have developed immune responses to repeated transfusions, and in situations where there is doubt about the safety of the blood supply. However, where there is a safe, plentiful, and well-regulated blood supply, the value of PAD is uncertain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further trials of PAD, of the type reviewed here, are not warranted. Further research should attempt to establish the true clinical benefits of avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion.</P>
