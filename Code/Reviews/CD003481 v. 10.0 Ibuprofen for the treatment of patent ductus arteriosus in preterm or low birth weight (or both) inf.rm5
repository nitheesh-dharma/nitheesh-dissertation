<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review updates the existing review "Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants", published in Issue 4, 2005 of The Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2005</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>This update of the review conducted in August 2007 identified four previously not included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Adamska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Adamska 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Aly-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aly 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gimeno-Navarro-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gimeno Navarro 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pezzati-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pezzati 1999</LINK>). In addition, two trials previously included as abstracts have now been published as full articles (<LINK REF="STD-Chotigeat-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Chotigeat 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Supapannachart-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Supapannachart 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The current review includes a total of 16 trials enrolling 876 infants. The increase in sample size made the point estimates more precise and changed the results of one important outcome. In the previous review there was a statistically significant increase in chronic lung disease in the ibuprofen group. Although a trend towards an increase in chronic lung disease remained in this review, the summary estimates did not reach statistical significance. In this review, the outcome of serum/plasma levels of creatinine following treatment was included and the results showed significantly lower levels in the ibuprofen group. As in previous reviews, the risk of decreased urine output was lower in the ibuprofen group. There is not enough data available regarding the effectiveness of oral ibuprofen to close a patent ductus arteriosus. One case of pulmonary hypertension associated with ibuprofen treatment was reported in one trial.<BR/>
<BR/>Long-term neurodevelopmental data are still lacking.<BR/>
<BR/>Based on the available evidence clinicians may prefer one of the two drugs currently available for closure of a patent ductus arterious over the other:<BR/>a) Either drug is effective in closing a patent ductus arterious<BR/>b) Ibuprofen may be preferred because of its less negative impact on the kidney function<BR/>c) Indomethacin may be preferred because of the trend towards increase in chronic lung disease in the ibuprofen group and the potential risk of pulmonary hypertension associated with the use of ibuprofen<BR/>
<BR/>This review has previously been updated in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2005</LINK>). An updated search in July 2005 identified one trial of ibuprofen versus placebo, but the results were not reported unblinded to group. However, the search identified three trials that compared ibuprofen to indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. The addition of the results from these three trials confirmed our previous findings that ibuprofen is no more effective than indomethacin and may cause more adverse effects. There were no important changes to the conclusions of that review.<BR/>
<BR/>An updated search in October 2004 found no new eligible trials for inclusion in this review.<BR/>
<BR/>There was no trial identified using mefenamic acid in the original review or in any of the updates.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-02-05 16:00:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is the use of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, placebo or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) safe and effective in improving the rate of ductal closure and other important clinical outcomes in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>A common complication for very preterm (premature) or very small babies is PDA. PDA is an open vascular channel between the lungs and the heart. It should close after birth, but sometimes remains open because of the baby's immature stage of development. PDA can lead to life-threatening complications. The usual treatment for PDA has been indomethacin, a medicine that will successfully close the PDA in the majority of babies, but can cause serious side effects. Another option is the drug ibuprofen.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in preterm infants (born at less than 37 weeks into pregnancy), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, or preterm and low birth weight infants with a PDA. The treatments were ibuprofen, indomethacin, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, placebo or no treatment. The evidence is current to May 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
</P>
<P>This review of 33 trials (2190 infants) found that ibuprofen was as effective as indomethacin to close a PDA and caused fewer transient side effects on the kidneys and reduced the risk of necrotising enterocolitis, a serious condition that affects the gut. Whether ibuprofen confers any important long-term advantages on development is not known. Additional long-term follow-up studies to 18 months of age and to the age of school entry are needed to decide whether ibuprofen or indomethacin is the drug of choice for closing a PDA.</P>

<P>We included 33 studies enrolling 2190 infants.</P>
<P>Two studies compared intravenous (iv) ibuprofen versus placebo (270 infants). In one study (134 infants) ibuprofen reduced the incidence of failure to close a PDA (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.99; risk difference (RD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 3 to 100). In one study (136 infants), ibuprofen reduced the composite outcome of infant mortality, infants who dropped out, or infants who required rescue treatment (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; RD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 17). One study (64 infants) compared oral ibuprofen with placebo and noted a significant reduction in failure to close a PDA (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; RD -0.44, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.23; NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4).</P>
<P>Twenty-one studies (1102 infants) reported failure rates for PDA closure with ibuprofen (oral or iv) compared with indomethacin (oral or iv). There was no significant difference between the groups (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%). The risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) was reduced for ibuprofen (16 studies, 948 infants; typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.01; NNTB 20, 95% CI 13 to 100; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD). The duration of ventilatory support was reduced with ibuprofen (oral or iv) compared with iv or oral indomethacin (six studies, 471 infants; mean difference (MD) -2.4 days, 95% CI -3.7 to -1.0; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 19%).</P>
<P>Eight studies (272 infants) reported on failure rates for PDA closure in a subgroup of the above studies comparing oral ibuprofen with indomethacin (oral or iv). There was no significant difference between the groups (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09). The risk of NEC was reduced with oral ibuprofen compared with indomethacin (oral or iv) (seven studies, 249 infants; typical RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; typical RD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.05; NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 20; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD). There was a decreased risk of failure to close a PDA with oral ibuprofen compared with iv ibuprofen (four studies, 304 infants; typical RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.64; typical RD -0.21, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.12; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 8). Transient renal insufficiency was less common in infants who received ibuprofen compared with indomethacin. High dose versus standard dose of iv ibuprofen, early versus expectant administration of iv ibuprofen, echocardiographically guided iv ibuprofen treatment vs. standard iv ibuprofen treatment and continuous infusion of ibuprofen vs. intermittent boluses of ibuprofen and long-term follow-up were studied in too few trials to draw any conclusions.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-05 14:13:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA and currently appears to be the drug of choice. Ibuprofen reduces the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency. Oro-gastric administration of ibuprofen appears as effective as iv administration. To make further recommendations, studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose ibuprofen, early versus expectant administration of ibuprofen, echocardiographically guided versus standard iv ibuprofen, and continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of ibuprofen. Studies are lacking evaluating the effect of ibuprofen on longer-term outcomes in infants with PDA.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-05 14:04:49 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 13:10:07 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Normal fetal circulation is dependent on the placenta and the patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1998</LINK>). Following birth and with the separation of the placenta and initiation of breathing, the circulation changes and closure of the ductus starts immediately (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1998</LINK>). However, in about a third of low birth weight (LBW; less than 2500 g) infants, the PDA remains open, especially during the early days of life (<LINK REF="REF-Ellison-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellison 1983</LINK>). In preterm neonates, the PDA often fails to close. The haemodynamic instability caused by the left to right shunt and associated run off causes renal or gastrointestinal effects including spontaneous perforation and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), chronic lung disease (CLD) and, if not managed, may lead to mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1979</LINK>). The presence of a PDA is associated with reduced middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Weir-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weir 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The surgical closure of the symptomatic PDA reduces duration of mechanical ventilation, improves haemodynamics and improves lung compliance (<LINK REF="REF-Cotton-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotton 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naulty-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naulty 1978</LINK>). However, medical treatment is still considered the treatment of choice in the majority of cases because of the risks related to the surgery. In a large Canadian cohort of 3779 very low birth weight (VLBW, less than 1500 g) infants, 28% required treatment for a PDA; 75% were treated with indomethacin alone, 8% with surgical ligation alone and 17% required both indomethacin and surgical ligation (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>). Infants with lower birth weight (BW) were more likely to be treated surgically (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-05 14:03:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Prostaglandins play a significant role in keeping the ductus arteriosus patent (<LINK REF="REF-Mathew-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathew 1998</LINK>). PDA-related morbidity and mortality reduce with the use of indomethacin, which acts as an inhibitor of prostaglandin-forming cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (<LINK REF="REF-Mahony-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahony 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stefano-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stefano 1991</LINK>). However, indomethacin use has been associated with transient or permanent derangement of renal function, NEC, gastrointestinal haemorrhage or perforation, alteration of platelet function and impairment of cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood flow velocity (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seyberth-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seyberth 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1989</LINK>). These negative effects of indomethacin are possibly related to mechanisms other than inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.</P>
<P>In one large trial of 1202 extremely low-birth-weight infants, indomethacin prophylaxis did not significantly improve the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months despite the fact that it reduced the frequency of PDA and severe periventricular and intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (<LINK REF="REF-Schmidt--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>). One Cochrane review confirmed that prophylactic treatment with indomethacin has a number of short-term benefits, in particular a reduction in symptomatic PDA, the need for ductal ligation and severe IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2010</LINK>).

<P>The complications associated with the use of indomethacin have encouraged the search for an alternate drug to treat a PDA. Ibuprofen, a propionic acid derivative and non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, has been reported to close a PDA, but without gastrointestinal haemodynamic disturbance and potentially harmful cerebral adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Chemtob-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chemtob 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coceani-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coceani 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Varvarigou-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Varvarigou 1996</LINK>).

Ibuprofen enhances cerebral autoregulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism, or intestinal or renal haemodynamics (<LINK REF="REF-Grosfeld-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grosfeld 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hardy-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hardy 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 1994</LINK>).</P>

Mefenamic acid is currently being used in Japan to close a PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Uchiyama-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uchiyama 2011</LINK>), but as of July 2014, we have not been able to identify any randomised studies.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-02-05 13:45:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>One previous meta-analysis of three trials of small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Overmeire-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Van Overmeire 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Overmeire-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Overmeire 1998</LINK>) suggested that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2000</LINK>). The meta-analysis included 176 neonates who were randomised to either ibuprofen (10 mg/kg followed at 24 and 48 hours later by a dose of 5 mg/kg) or indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg at 12-hour interval for three doses). The risk ratio (RR) for failure of PDA closure using ibuprofen versus indomethacin was 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.17) (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2000</LINK>). This meta-analysis was included in a commentary on a publication of a randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2000</LINK>), and the publication type did not allow for detailed description of the methodology used or the inclusion of outcomes other than ductal closure (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2000</LINK>). Additional trials have been published since the year 2000. Therefore, a systematic review according to Cochrane methodology was justified as were the current and previous updates as we identified new trials.</P>

<P>See: Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) search strategy.</P>
<P>This review is the fifth update of the original review. We searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I>, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clincialtrials.gov, Controlled-trials.com, www.abstracts2view.com/pas, the reference lists of identified studies, meta-analyses and personal files in May 2014. We subscribed to weekly updates from Ovid AutoAlert on the topic (Ovid AutoAlert (autorun@ovid.com)).</P>
<P>For this update, as with previous updates, the search started by review of personal files and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, <I>The Cochrane Library</I>); we searched MEDLINE (1966 to May 2014) using MeSH terms: ibuprofen (or mefenamic acid), newborn, infant, premature (or preterm) or low birth weight infant, patent ductus arteriosus or PDA. Other data bases searched included: EMBASE (1980 to May 2014), CINAHL (1982 to May 2014) and the reference list of identified trials and abstracts published in <I>Pediatric Research</I> (1991 to April Issue, 2005, and electronically on the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) website from 2006 to 2014) (www.abstracts2view.com/pas) from conference proceedings of PAS and the European Society of Pediatric Research. We identified no new trials since the first publication of this review in the searches undertaken in October 2004. The searches in July 2005 identified four new trials of which one was published in abstract form. A search by first review author (AO) and co-authors of any abstracts identified in <I>Pediatric Research</I> was done in July 2005 in MEDLINE and EMBASE to try to identify any corresponding full manuscripts published. The searches in August 2007 identified four additional studies. In the 2012 update of the review, we identified six additional trials. In this 2014 update of the review, we identified seven relevant publications, six were reports of previously unpublished trials and one was a follow-up study of a previously published trial. We reviewed reference lists of published narrative and systematic reviews. We sought unpublished data. We contacted authors of some published trials to clarify or provide additional information. We searched the literature for any reports (regardless of publication type) of pulmonary hypertension associated with the treatment with ibuprofen or indomethacin. We did not apply any language restrictions.</P>

<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as: </P>
<UL>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</LI>
<LI>adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding, for example where outcomes were self reported by unblinded participants but they were recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment. Where needed, 'partial' was added to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, drop-outs, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as: </P>
<UL>

<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<UL>
<LI>adequate (where it was clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>inadequate (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study did not include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear. </LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</LI>
</UL>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>yes, no or unclear.  </LI>

<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>For the original review, two review authors independently conducted quality assessments of studies not blinded to authors, institution or journal of publication.

<UL>
<LI>Objective: to explore the efficacy of ECHO-guided pharmacological closure of the ductus arteriosus in reducing the number of required ibuprofen doses without increasing the re-opening rate.</LI>
<LI>Population: 49 preterm infants with an ECHO-confirmed PDA measuring 1.5 mm or greater (PMA 24 to 34 weeks).</LI>
<LI>Intervention: infants received the first dose of ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and were then randomised to receive either standard treatment (21 infants) or ECHO-guided treatment (28 infants). Infants in the standard group received two additional doses of ibuprofen 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals after the initial dose of 10 mg/kg, independently of ductal size, as long as additional doses were not contraindicated. Infants in the ECHO-guided group received additional doses of ibuprofen 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals only if the PDA was still 1.5 mm or greater at the time of the corresponding ibuprofen dose. Decision on whether to treat the PDA when the diameter was less than 1.5 mm in the ECHO-guided group was at the discretion of the treating consultant. Additional ibuprofen doses were administered only when the PDA was greater than 1.5 mm 24 hours after a complete ibuprofen course (therapeutic failure) or when a re-opening was documented.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: primary outcome was re-opening of PDA; secondary outcomes included failure to close a PDA, number of ibuprofen doses used, need for surgical ligation, mortality, BPD (need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' PMA), IVH (grade II or III), PVL, oliguria, creatinine after treatment and laser therapy for ROP.</LI>

<LI>Population: 112 VLBW infants (mean (SD) PMA 27.2 (2) weeks; weight 1019 (330) g).</LI>
<LI>Intervention: 56 infants were given iv ibuprofen in conventional 15-minute intermittent boluses, while the other 56 were administered iv ibuprofen as a 24-hour continuous infusion, both at standard doses (10/5/5 mg/kg). One infant in the continuous infusion group was excluded because informed consent was withdrawn, leaving 55 infants in that group.</LI>
<LI>Outcomes: primary outcome: PDA closure rate after two standard-dose ibuprofen courses. Secondary outcomes included mortality, PDA closure after one ibuprofen course, rate of PDA re-opening, need for surgical ligation, oliguria (urine output 1 mL/kg/hour or less), creatinine after treatment, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, isolated intestinal perforation, NEC (according to modified Bell's criteria (all stages), BPD (supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' PMA), IVH (any grade and grade III or IV), cystic PVL, duration of hospital stay and survival without morbidity. Brain ultrasound was performed on admission and before starting each ibuprofen course, then twice a month or when clinically indicated. Any IVH was graded according to Papille's classification, and PVL was defined as periventricular white matter cysts. Any other gastrointestinal and pulmonary bleeding disorders due to interference with local prostaglandin metabolism were also recorded. BPD was defined as the need for oxygen supplementation and typical chest X-ray features at a postconceptional age of 36 weeks. ROP was diagnosed according to international criteria.</LI>

<P>One study was published as a full article in 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Aranda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 2005</LINK>). The primary outcome in that study was 'Infant mortality, infants who dropped out or required rescue treatment' and as there was only one study available in 2009 for the comparison of iv ibuprofen versus placebo we included that outcome. For this update, we identified one additional study comparing iv ibuprofen versus placebo that reported on 'Failure to close a PDA after single or three doses' (<LINK REF="STD-Bagnoli-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bagnoli 2013</LINK>), and we made this the primary outcome for this comparison as was planned at the protocol stage.</P>

<P>Since first published in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2003</LINK>), the review has been regularly updated (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2013</LINK>), and this update in 2014 includes data from 33 studies. A total of 2190 infants were randomised in these studies. Two ongoing studies were identified in the previous update and they are still ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01149564" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01149564</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01630278" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01630278</LINK>), and we identified two additional ongoing studies in the 2014 update (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01758913" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01758913</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02128191" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02128191</LINK>).

<P>Researchers have reported on additional comparisons that we did not include in the original review in 2003 (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2003</LINK>), and we have added these comparisons.</P>
<P>Ibuprofen is more effective than placebo in closure of a PDA. In the one trial that compared ibuprofen with placebo, the closure rates were 57% for ibuprofen versus 39% for placebo. There was strong evidence that ibuprofen (iv or orally) was as effective as indomethacin (iv or orally) to close a PDA (21 studies; 1102 infants). None found a statistically significant difference in failure to close a PDA. In the meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05). There was no between-study heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD). The CIs around the point estimates were very narrow for the primary outcome (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Likewise, there was good evidence that ibuprofen (iv or orally) compared with indomethacin (iv or orally) reduced the risk of NEC (16 studies, 948 infants). In the meta-analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; typical RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.01; NNTB 20, 95% CI 13 to 100). There was no statistically significant between-study heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% for both RR and RD).</P>
<P>In a previous update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2005</LINK>), 'Chronic lung disease defined as oxygen requirement at 28 days postnatally' was statistically significantly more likely to occur in the ibuprofen group. In the 2012, 2013 and this update in 2014 there was no significant difference in the incidence of CLD for any of the comparisons.</P>
<P>Data on long-term follow-up were still largely missing, which is a serious concern. Long-term follow-up to 18 to 24 months has been reported in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gokmen-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Gokmen 2011</LINK>) of oral versus iv ibuprofen. Only 57 of the original cohort of 102 infants were seen at follow-up. To date, no long-term follow-up studies have been published for the other comparisons included in this review. As mentioned in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>, prophylactic use of indomethacin does reduce the risk of severe IVH and surgical duct ligation but does not confer any significant advantages at 18 months' corrected age with regards to intact survival (<LINK REF="REF-Fowlie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowlie 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmidt--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmidt 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study of the prophylactic use of ibuprofen was stopped after 135 infants had been enrolled (<LINK REF="REF-Gournay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gournay 2002</LINK>). Three infants developed severe hypoxaemia in the ibuprofen group. Hypoxaemia was thought to be due to pulmonary hypertension, as ECHO showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow. Hypoxaemia resolved quickly on inhaled nitric oxide (<LINK REF="REF-Gournay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gournay 2002</LINK>). The authors postulated that this could be due to early administration of ibuprofen (less than six hours) preventing the normal fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, acidification of their ibuprofen solution (buffered with tromethamine) causing precipitation and microembolism in the lungs or due to a specific effect of ibuprofen. This adverse effect has not been reported in other trials using ibuprofen for prophylaxis of PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2011</LINK>). In the 2007 update of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2008</LINK>), one randomised controlled trial reported one case of pulmonary hypertension in the ibuprofen group (<LINK REF="STD-Adamska-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Adamska 2005</LINK>). In the 2010 update, there were three cases of pulmonary hypertension reported in the study by Aranda and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-Aranda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 2005</LINK>); two in the ibuprofen group and one in the placebo group.</P>
<P>In an extensive search of the literature, including study designs other than randomised controlled trials, one additional case-report following L-lysine ibuprofen therapy in a preterm infant with a PDA (<LINK REF="REF-Bellini-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellini 2006</LINK>) was identified in the 2008 update of the review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2008</LINK>). A repeat literature search in 2010 did not identify any new case of pulmonary hypertension associated with the treatment of a PDA in neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>). For the 2013 update (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2013</LINK>), the literature was searched in July 2012 and three additional case reports of pulmonary hypertension in preterm infants treated with ibuprofen were identified (<LINK REF="REF-Amendolia-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amendolia 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sehgal-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sehgal 2013</LINK> the study was Epub 2012 Jul 29). A repeat PubMed search in July 2014 did not identify any additional cases of pulmonary hypertension following ibuprofen treatment.</P>
<P>In the 2008 update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2008</LINK>), we stated, "In view of the lack of long-term outcome data and potential side effects for both drugs, one drug cannot be recommended over the other as the therapy of choice for a PDA". In the 2010 update of the review, we found a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC in the ibuprofen versus indomethacin group (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>). As the closure rates for PDA by ibuprofen and indomethacin are similar, the reduced rate of NEC is an important finding and favours the use of ibuprofen over indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. Kidney function is less affected by ibuprofen. In this update in 2014, the closure rates for ibuprofen versus indomethacin were identical with no heterogeneity and the risk of NEC remained reduced as does the risk of adverse effects on the kidneys. Some results favour oral ibuprofen over iv ibuprofen. Oral ibuprofen is more readily available in some countries. For the comparisons 'high-dose versus standard-dose ibuprofen'; 'early versus expectant administration of ibuprofen' and 'ECHO-guided iv ibuprofen treatment versus standard iv treatment' evidence is lacking for which treatment is preferable.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-05 13:09:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Study quality was variable and the results of this review were based on small to moderately large trials. The sample sizes varied from 16 (<LINK REF="STD-Mosca-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Mosca 1997</LINK>) to 175 (<LINK REF="STD-Lago-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lago 2002</LINK>) infants enrolled. For many of the outcomes, the sample size was too small to detect a significant difference and the estimates were imprecise. The studies were conducted in 18 different countries (Albania, Belgium, China, Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Poland, Qatar, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, the UK, the US). There was no heterogeneity for the primary outcome of 'Failure to close a PDA' in any of the comparisons or for NEC in the comparisons of ibuprofen versus indomethacin. These findings increased the validity of these results. In addition, the funnel plot for the primary outcome 'Failure to close a PDA' was symmetrical, with no obvious absence of smaller studies having a protective effect of ibuprofen versus indomethacin (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). For the important secondary outcome of 'NEC', the funnel plot was also symmetrical (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was high heterogeneity for the outcome of 'NEC' in Comparison 1 (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77% for RR) and moderate heterogeneity for RD (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 67%). There was moderate between-study heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) for four of the secondary outcomes ('pulmonary haemorrhage', 'time to regain birth weight', 'oliguria' and 'serum/plasma creatinine levels 72 hours after treatment' for Comparison 3. For Comparisons 4 and 5 there was moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50%) for 'serum/plasma creatinine levels 72 hours after treatment'.</P>
<P>In the 2010 update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Ohlsson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohlsson 2010</LINK>), we identified one study (136 infants) that compared iv ibuprofen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Aranda-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aranda 2005</LINK>). The study showed a statistically significant reduction in a composite outcome of infant mortality, infants who dropped out or required rescue treatment with a low NNTB of 5 (95% CI 3 to 17). There were no statistically significant effects on common neonatal short-term outcomes. For the update in 2012, one new inclusion compared oral ibuprofen with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2012</LINK>). There was a significant reduction in the failure to close a PDA with a low NNTB of 2 (95% CI 2 to 4). The report of the study was written in Chinese and we could include only the primary outcome in that update. For this update, we identified one additional study comparing iv ibuprofen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bagnoli-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Bagnoli 2013</LINK>), and that study reported on 'Failure to close a PDA after single or three doses' and we made that outcome the primary outcome for this comparison as was planned at the protocol stage.</P>
<P>As can be seen in <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>, 'Risk of bias summary: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item for each included study' and in <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>, 'Risk of bias graph: review authors' judgements about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies', we identified concerns about bias in most individual studies and therefore for the group of studies included as well. The main concerns were the lack of blinding and unclear information about concealed allocation to the treatment groups.</P>

<P>Ibuprofen is effective in closing a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) compared with placebo. We found no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin in closing the PDA. Ibuprofen reduced the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), time on assisted ventilation and had less negative effects on renal function. Pulmonary hypertension was observed in three infants after the prophylactic use of ibuprofen, and in one case in this review and in an additional case report for the treatment of a PDA. Three new cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported. Either ibuprofen or indomethacin can be used to close a PDA. Based on currently available information, ibuprofen does appear to confer net benefits over indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA, but the clinician needs to be aware that both drugs are associated with adverse effects.</P>

<P>Dr. Fatemeh Nayeri (corresponding author) has kindly provided us with an English translation of the article in January 2013. We are still awaiting some clarifications regarding the trial. In email dated 24 May 2014, we asked for clarification regarding how the randomisation sequence was generated and how the infants were allocated to 1 of the 2 groups. We asked if it was possible for the investigators and the clinicians to determine the difference between the 2 dosing regimens? As of 17 August 2014, we have not received a response</P>
