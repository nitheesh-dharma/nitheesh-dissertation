<TITLE MODIFIED="2013-07-30 08:14:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">Is telephone counselling effective as part of a programme help people stop smoking?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-30 14:05:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>
<B>Background</B>: People trying to quit smoking can be helped with medication or by face-to-face behavioural support such as counselling and group therapy.<BR/>
<B>Objectives</B>: We wanted to to find out whether support was also effective when it was provided by telephone.<BR/>
<B>Search methods:</B> The most recent search for evidence was in May 2013. We identified 77 controlled trials with a total of almost 85,000 participants.<BR/>
<B>Results</B>:This review identified trials evaluating the effect of any type of telephone counselling. We included trials where the participants had called helplines offering support for people trying to quit smoking (quitlines). We also included trials where people had received telephone calls from counsellors or other healthcare providers. Some of these compared telephone support with very minimal support such as self-help leaflets, and others looked at whether adding telephone calls was more helpful than just face-to-face support, or just providing a smoking cessation medication such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Some trials only recruited people who were trying to stop smoking, whislt others offered support even if people were not actively planning to quit. Trials had to be randomized, and to follow up participants for at least six months.</P>
<P>A small number of trials were judged to be at risk of bias but we did not think that the overall results were likely to be biased. Trials in quitline populations were more likely to be unable to contact everyone for follow-up and generally relied on participants' self report of not smoking, rather than checking using biochemical tests. Trials used a wide range of numbers and lengths of calls, and there was some variation between the results of different trials which means that we cannot be certain that all types of counselling have the same effect.</P>
<P>Twelve trials involving over 30,000 people tested the effect of additional telephone calls from a counsellor for people who had called a quitline. When we pooled their results there was evidence that people receiving call-back counselling were more likely to have stopped smoking than those only sent self-help materials or given brief advice and support during the initial call. Calls increased the relative success by between 25% and 50%, but since the proportion quitting in the control groups was quite low this was equivalent to an absolute increase of only 2 to 4 percentage points.</P>
<P>Fifty-one trials involving over 30,000 people tested the effect of telephone counselling for people who had not called a quitline, some of whom might not have been actively planning to quit. Overall when pooled these showed a small benefit of the telephone calls, increasing the relative success by between 20% and 36%, equivalent to an absolute increase of 2 to 3 percentage points. In an analysis that took into account different characteristics of the trials (metaregression) there was evidence that offering a larger number of calls, and having participants who were interested in trying to quit, increased the effect. Trials which tested the additional benefit of telephone counselling for people who were using a smoking cessation medication had a slightly smaller relative benefit, but since people in these studies were benefitting from the medication the absolute benefit from adding telephone calls was about the same. Two trials that compared different numbers of calls detected a benefit of more calls compared to a single contact.</P>
<P>Six other trials tested other uses of telephone counselling including systems for referral of smokers to support. We did not pool these and none of them showed clear evidence of an effect.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:55:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Telephone services can provide information and support for smokers. Counselling may be provided proactively or offered reactively to callers to smoking cessation helplines.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-05-13 08:30:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>To evaluate the effect of proactive and reactive telephone support via helplines and in other settings to help smokers quit.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-07-23 11:51:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register for studies of telephone counselling, using search terms including 'hotlines' or 'quitline' or 'helpline'. Date of the most recent search: May 2013.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:55:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>randomized or quasi-randomised controlled trials in which proactive or reactive telephone counselling to assist smoking cessation was offered to smokers or recent quitters.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-23 10:24:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>One author identified and data extracted trials, and a second author checked them. The main outcome measure was the risk ratio for abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up. We selected the strictest measure of abstinence, using biochemically validated rates where available. We considered participants lost to follow-up to be continuing smokers. Where trials had more than one arm with a less intensive intervention we used only the most similar intervention without the telephone component as the control group in the primary analysis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity amongst subgroups of clinically comparable studies using the I² statistic. We considered trials recruiting callers to quitlines separately from studies recruiting in other settings. Where appropriate, we pooled studies using a fixed-effect model. We used a meta-regression to investigate the effect of differences in planned number of calls, selection for motivation, and the nature of the control condition (self help only, minimal intervention, pharmacotherapy) in the group of studies recruiting in non-quitline settings.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:55:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Seventy-seven trials met the inclusion criteria. Some trials were judged to be at risk of bias in some domains but overall we did not judge the results to be at high risk of bias. Among smokers who contacted helplines, quit rates were higher for groups randomized to receive multiple sessions of proactive counselling (nine studies, &gt; 24,000 participants, risk ratio (RR) for cessation at longest follow-up 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.50). There was mixed evidence about whether increasing the number of calls altered quit rates but most trials used more than two calls. Three studies comparing different counselling approaches during a single quitline contact did not detect significant differences. Of three studies that tested the provision of access to a hotline two detected a significant benefit and one did not.</P>
<P>Telephone counselling not initiated by calls to helplines also increased quitting (51 studies, &gt; 30,000 participants, RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.36). In a meta-regression controlling for other factors the effect was estimated to be slightly larger if more calls were offered, and in trials that specifically recruited smokers motivated to try to quit. The relative extra benefit of counselling was smaller when it was provided in addition to pharmacotherapy (usually nicotine replacement therapy) than when the control group only received self-help material or a brief intervention.</P>
<P>A further eight studies were too diverse to contribute to meta-analyses and are discussed separately. Two compared different intensities of counselling, both of which detected a dose response; one of these detected a benefit of multiple counselling sessions over a single call for people prescribed bupropion. The others tested a variety of interventions largely involving offering telephone counselling as part of a referral or systems change and none detected evidence of effect.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-11 13:20:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill" NOTES="&lt;p&gt;This wording is now identical to the abstract conclusions&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-07-11 13:20:10 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Proactive telephone counselling aids smokers who seek help from quitlines. Telephone quitlines provide an important route of access to support for smokers, and call-back counselling enhances their usefulness. There is limited evidence about the optimal number of calls. Proactive telephone counselling also helps people who receive it in other settings. There is some evidence of a dose response; one or two brief calls are less likely to provide a measurable benefit. Three or more calls increase the chances of quitting compared to a minimal intervention such as providing standard self-help materials, or brief advice, or compared to pharmacotherapy alone.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2013-08-01 10:58:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-08-01 10:58:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Behavioural and pharmacological interventions help people to quit smoking. Behavioural approaches range from brief advice from a physician to intensive specialist counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stead-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2008</LINK>). Support can be given in individual counselling sessions (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005a</LINK>) or in group therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2005</LINK>) where clients can share problems and derive support from one another. Standard self-help materials have at best a small effect helping quitting while those tailored to the characteristics of individuals are more likely to be effective (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005b</LINK>). Telephone counselling may supplement face-to-face support, or substitute for face-to-face contact as an adjunct to self-help interventions or pharmacotherapy. Counselling may be helpful in planning a quit attempt, and helping prevent relapse during the initial period of abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Brandon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brandon 2000</LINK>). Although intensive face-to-face intervention increases quit rates, there are difficulties in delivering it to large numbers. Telephone counselling may be a way of providing individual counselling more cheaply. Telephone contact can be timed to maximise the level of support around a planned quit date, and can be scheduled in response to the needs of the recipient.</P>
<P>Telephone counselling can be proactive or reactive (<LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 1996</LINK>). In a proactive approach the counsellor initiates one or more calls to provide support in making a quit attempt or avoiding relapse. This can be offered as part of an intervention including face-to-face counselling, or provided as an adjunct to a mailed self-help programme, or to pharmacotherapy. Reactive counselling in contrast is available on demand to people calling specific services; quitlines, helplines or hotlines. These services take calls from people who smoke, or their friends and family (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2006</LINK>). These telephone services may offer information, recorded messages, personal counselling or a mixture of components (<LINK REF="REF-Ossip_x002d_Klein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ossip-Klein 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2007</LINK>). They may provide a regional or national service. They are often advertised in conjunction with population-wide campaigns such as No-Smoking Days. Helplines may also be provided on a smaller scale for a specific project or population. When contact is initiated by the client, any counselling during a call is reactive. In some services, people may be enrolled in a formal programme, with further proactive calls from counsellors (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummins-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 2007a</LINK>). Hotlines have the potential to provide access to information for large numbers of people. Some services have reported reaching substantial proportions of the target population (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Platt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1997</LINK>). They have the potential to reach under-served populations such as ethnic minorities (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2000a</LINK>) or younger people (<LINK REF="REF-Gilbert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilbert 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2008</LINK>). A further development of hotlines uses computers and expert systems to provide a menu of automated responses (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schneider-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Schneider 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramelson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramelson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Telephone-based services may be specific to smoking, as for example the California Smokers' Helpline (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2000a</LINK>), the Quitlines in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2001</LINK>) or in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2000</LINK>), or they may be embedded in broader health information services such as the Cancer Information Service in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-La-Porta-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">La Porta 2007</LINK>). They may also be provided as part of an integrated smoking cessation support service (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Glasgow-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glasgow 1991</LINK>). Access to hotlines or the opportunity to register to receive calls from a counsellor may also be offered as a part of a cessation programme including pharmacotherapy.</P>
<P>Controlled evaluation of reactive helplines has been limited by a reluctance among providers to refuse support to those requesting help. Evaluations usually compare variants in service rather than including a no-intervention control (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK>). Proactive services have been more widely evaluated because they can more easily be compared with a minimal intervention. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK> used an innovative approach for evaluating the benefit of the counselling component for callers to a quitline. Because the number of requests for counselling sometimes exceeded the quitline's capacity, all callers at these times were sent a self-help pack and invited to call back. Counselling capacity could then be equitably allocated by randomizing some callers to a group who were contacted proactively, whilst the control group were counselled only if and when they called back.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-07-30 11:55:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>We identified controlled studies where an intervention arm included telephone contact. One author (LS) extracted data from included studies and a second author (TL) checked them. We recorded the following information in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table and in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> table:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The country and setting of the trial</LI>
<LI>The method of recruitment to the study</LI>
<LI>The method of randomization and allocation concealment</LI>
<LI>Details of participants, including whether they were selected according to motivation to quit, and their age, gender and average baseline cigarette consumption</LI>
<LI>Description of intervention and control, including the schedule of telephone contacts</LI>
<LI>Definition of smoking abstinence used for the primary outcome, including timing of longest follow-up and whether quit status was based on recent behaviour (point prevalence abstinence, e.g. in past seven days) or on abstinence for an extended period since a quit date or a previous follow-up (continuous or sustained abstinence)</LI>
<LI>Description of method of any biochemical validation or other method used to confirm self-reported quitting</LI>
<LI>Description of numbers lost to follow-up by treatment condition</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, we describe studies not meeting the inclusion criteria because of short follow-up, or use of an intervention that combined telephone and face-to-face counselling, or because they were uncontrolled evaluations of helplines.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Items in the 'Risk of bias' table were judged to be at low, unclear, or high risk of bias.<BR/>The quality of the procedure for sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias if an acceptable method for generating a randomization sequence was described, at unclear risk if the study was described as 'random' but no further information given, and at high risk if based on, for example, record number.<BR/>The quality of the allocation concealment was judged to be at low risk if the group to which a participant was to be allocated remained unknown to investigators and participant until enrolment was complete.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Choice of outcome and treatment of missing data</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome was the number of quitters at the longest follow-up, using the strictest measure of abstinence reported. We preferred sustained and biochemically validated abstinence to point prevalence and/or self-reported quitting. If a less strict definition of quitting seemed more appropriate for showing an effect of the intervention on recovery from lapses or relapses, we planned a sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Where possible and appropriate we used as denominators the number randomized to each condition, with losses to follow-up assumed to be continuing smokers. We noted any exceptions in the 'Risk of bias' table for a study. Population-based studies typically have relatively high loss to follow-up because of change of address or disconnected telephones. Non-reponse might be independent of both treatment condition and smoking status, although possibly associated with other variables such as age or socio-economic status. Drop-out might be related to smoking status but not to treatment condition. Imputing as smoking all those missing, irrespective of, for example, whether they could not be contacted, or declined to respond, may not be appropriate. For individual studies it is possible to use analysis methods such as generalised estimating equations (GEE) for imputing missing data (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2001</LINK>). We noted whether studies that explored alternative assumptions about missing data reported any impact on the conclusions. When proportions lost are similar across conditions, and trial arms are balanced, the choice of denominator does not alter the relative effect, although the percentage quit and the absolute difference between conditions will be conservative.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We summarised individual study results as a risk ratio (RR), calculated as: (number of quitters in intervention group/ number randomized to intervention group) / (number of quitters in control group/ number randomized to control group). Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model to estimate a pooled risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Greenland-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenland 1985</LINK>). When trials had more than one arm with a less intensive intervention we used only the most similar intervention without a telephone component as the control group in the primary analysis. We considered pooling of study results if both the intervention and control arms were sufficiently similar across trials. We assessed statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I² statistic which describes the percentage of total variation between studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We used threshold values of 50% and 70% as suggesting moderate and substantial heterogeneity respectively.</P>
<P>We also ran a meta-regression in STATA to test the association of intensity - defined as maximum number of calls -, motivation (binary: Yes/No), and type of baseline support (minimal/brief/adjunct to pharmacotherapy) with effect size. The effect size was summarised using the (natural) logarithm of the risk ratio per trial with weights given by the standard error of the logarithm of the risk ratio. All three independent variables were used with intensity defined as the maximum number of calls allowed in the intervention arm of the trial and included as a continuous variable while the other two were categorical (two and three categories respectively). We fitted these trial characteristics in a univariate meta-regression to test for association and also all of them in a single multivariate meta-regression model to estimate independent associations with the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We did not combine proactive and reactive approaches to counselling, so studies that provided access to a telephone helpline but did not call participants form a separate category. In earlier versions of this review we noted heterogeneity between studies of proactive telephone counselling, which was not explained by using subgroups based on the amount of support given for the control group. <LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2002a</LINK> has suggested that studies recruiting smokers who call quitlines should be considered separately. These studies share the characteristics that participants were actively seeking support at the time of their call, and that telephone counselling was the primary intervention. We therefore distinguish between trials in quitline callers and in other populations.</P>
<P>We expected differences between the relative effect of telephone support depending on whether it was being tested as the main intervention to aid cessation, or as an extra part of a multicomponent cessation programme. Therefore a priori we treated as separate subgroups those studies in which telephone counselling was the most intensive component of a minimal contact intervention and studies in which telephone counselling was assessed as an adjunct to face-to-face counselling. Where results of studies differed within the broad groupings described above we considered the following possible explanations: the difference between the intensity of the counselling based on the number of calls, the counselling strategy used, and the characteristics of the participants, in particular their motivation to quit or stage of change at baseline.</P>

Three recruited pregnant women (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>) and a further five recruited only women (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fl_x00f6_ter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Flöter 2009</LINK>).

<P>Most of the studies were trials of proactive calls from a counsellor, or from an automated interactive voice response system (IVR) (<LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK>, IVR only, <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2007</LINK> IVR with counsellor follow-up in case of need). Only five assessed interventions that did not involve a counsellor contacting a participant (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McFall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McFall 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2009</LINK>). Twelve studies recruited participants who had phoned a quitline, but the intervention evaluated the addition of further proactive contacts (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 2013</LINK>). One study recruited proactively to quitline counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Tzelepis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tzelepis 2011</LINK>). Three studies recruited participants in healthcare settings and referred them to services provided by quitlines, involving proactive counselling for those following through referral (<LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ellerbeck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellerbeck 2009</LINK> repeatedly mailed primary care patients an offer of free pharmacotherapy and tested two levels of disease management including proactive calls, or no contact. One study offered either a proactive or reactive service as covered benefit (<LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>). Additional details are in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>The number, duration and content of the telephone calls was variable. The potential number of calls ranged from one to twelve (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2005</LINK>) and in some studies was flexible. The length of calls was also varied; a duration of 10 to 20 minutes was common, although the initial call might be longer. The call schedule could be spaced over weeks or months. Amongst studies that did not recruit participants on the basis of their willingness to make a quit attempt, the content was typically individualised to enhance motivation in those undecided about quitting or to support a quit attempt where appropriate. Counselling was most commonly provided by professional counsellors or trained healthcare professionals. One trial used trained postgraduate students (<LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>). Three trials used trained peer counsellors, in one case survivors of childhood cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Emmons-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Emmons 2005</LINK>), and in the other two, women ex-smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>We grouped trials into three broad categories: trials of interventions for smokers who contacted a helpline, trials assessing the effect of providing access to a helpline, and trials that offered support proactively in other settings. Finally there are eight trials (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Swan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Girgis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK>) that do not fit into any of these categories, so are considered individually.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">1 Trials of interventions for people calling helplines</HEADING>
<P>Fifteen trials recruited people who had phoned helplines/quitlines. We distinguished between trials where the intervention involved further proactive contact by the counsellor, and those that tested different interventions at the initial call. Twelve studies tested proactive calls back to people who had initiated the contact with the quitline. The number of calls varied, with three studies comparing more than one schedule. There were small differences in the support for the control group. In one trial, all participants had brief counselling during their initial call (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2001</LINK>), in three, some control group participants received some counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK> was a factorial trial comparing proactive counselling to standard support which included further contact by email, letter or text, and the offer of proactive calls. Participants were also randomized to an offer of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In the others the control group received self-help materials (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three trials compared different interventions at the time a participant called the helpline; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2009</LINK> compared counselling at the initial call to mailed self-help materials only. <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK> compared different counselling interventions provided during the initial call; <LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK> compared a counselling approach based on the stage of change model to the provision of more general information; <LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK> compared counselling and materials targeted at African-American smokers to standard advice and materials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">2 Trials providing access to a helpline</HEADING>
<P>Two studies assessed the impact of offering reactive counselling by providing access to a helpline/quitline/hotline. One randomized counties to hotline access or not, and followed up smokers who were planning to stop and had registered for a smokers' self-help project (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1991</LINK>). One combined newsletter mailings and hotline access compared to no follow-up support for smokers who had registered for a self-help televised cessation programme (<LINK REF="STD-McFall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McFall 1993</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK> compared four different levels of benefit for Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older. The most intensive intervention offered a choice of accessing either a reactive hotline or multisession proactive counselling, along with self-help materials and coverage of nicotine patch with a small co-payment. Other arms offered coverage of brief provider counselling with or without coverage of pharmacotherapy, and usual care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">3 Trials of proactive counselling, not initiated by calls to quitlines</HEADING>
<P>There were 51 trials in this category that were judged to have sufficient common features to consider pooling their results. There were some differences in the intensity of the telephone component, the amount of cessation support that was common to both the control and intervention groups, and the populations recruited.</P>

The control groups generally had mailed self-help materials but <LINK REF="STD-Graham-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Graham 2011</LINK> provided access to a cessation website. In six studies in healthcare settings the telephone intervention was an adjunct to usual care that involved at most a brief smoking intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Stotts-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stotts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duffy-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Duffy 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rigotti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rigotti 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hanssen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hanssen 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holmes_x002d_Rovner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes-Rovner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Young-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Young 2008</LINK>). In two further studies that recruited participants through healthcare systems, advice and support were part of usual care but not all participants had clinic visits; the telephone counselling was delivered independently of any clinic visit rather than being an adjunct to a specific episode of care (<LINK REF="STD-Lipkus-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lipkus 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-An-2006" TYPE="STUDY">An 2006</LINK>). Pharmacotherapy was not systematically offered to all intervention participants in any of the above trials but in two there was greater use of pharmacotherapy by intervention participants (<LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-An-2006" TYPE="STUDY">An 2006</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-McClure-2005" TYPE="STUDY">McClure 2005</LINK> all participants could enrol in the Free &amp; Clear phone-based support programme which could also provide access to pharmacotherapy; this was used more by intervention than control groups. <LINK REF="STD-An-2006" TYPE="STUDY">An 2006</LINK> encouraged the use of NRT or bupropion for intervention group participants making a quit attempt and this increased their use, although pharmacotherapy was available to all participants as part of their usual care.</P>

<P>All studies reported the numbers randomized to each group, so that we could use these in the meta-analysis. Most studies reported findings based on treating all drop-outs as smokers although some did not note the number lost to follow-up who were assumed to be continuing smokers. Many also reported complete case analyses (excluding drop-outs), or used methods for imputing missing data. In most cases this had little impact on the relative effect, because numbers lost were similar across conditions. We did not identify any studies where using complete cases or using adjusted estimates of quit rates would have changed the relative effect enough to alter the conclusions of a meta-analysis.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definitions of abstinence</HEADING>
<P>Many trials reported both short-term point prevalence (seven-day or 24-hour) abstinence and sustained abstinence, at one or more follow-ups. We were able to use long-term sustained abstinence, or abstinence at both the longest and earlier follow-ups as the outcome for 43/77 (56%) trials. For the remainder the outcome was based on point prevalence abstinence at the longest follow-up. Length of longest follow-up ranged from six months from start of intervention in 24 trials, to 30 months (<LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK>) or 12 months postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>). One trial reported both self-reported continuous abstinence and validated seven-day abstinence (<LINK REF="STD-Abdullah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullah 2005</LINK>). We used the validated outcome; this gave a larger effect favouring the intervention group.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.1 Effect of additional proactive support</HEADING>
<P>Twelve studies (N = 30,182) that compared an intervention involving multisession proactive counselling with a control condition providing self-help materials or brief counselling at a single call showed evidence of a benefit from the additional support. With the addition of three new studies published since the last update (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 2013</LINK>) the heterogeneity increased markedly (from I² = 57% to I² = 71%). The pooled risk ratio (RR) was almost unchanged; 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.49, <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Because of the heterogeneity we also conducted a sensitivity analysis, pooling using a random-effects model; this gave a very similar estimate (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.66). The three studies with the largest weights in the meta-analysis all detected significant effects, as did three other studies, suggesting that there is a benefit from these types of interventions in many settings but perhaps not all. We examined the characteristics of the three studies in which the point estimates suggested no effect of counselling (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sims-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 2013</LINK>). The first two were conducted in the UK whereas all others were done in North America (8) or Australia (2). In the earliest UK trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>), the authors thought that the unstructured counselling might have explained the lack of effect, but in the second a more structured protocol was used. In both cases the control groups would have received some support at the original call as well as mailed or emailed materials The context of the UK healthcare system may contribute to the difference, since there is a well-developed Stop Smoking Service with access to support and medication. <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK> also failed to detect an effect of offering free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), in a factorial design. The other study with a point estimate suggesting no effect, although with wide confidence limits, <LINK REF="STD-Sims-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sims 2013</LINK> was conducted in young adults, for whom there is limited evidence for any effective interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Villanti-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Villanti 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the main analysis we pooled more than one intensity of intervention into the treatment arms of four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK>). Using only the more intensive interventions in the two trials that reported outcomes for two different interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>) marginally increased the pooled effect size (data not shown). <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK> did not detect a difference between groups receiving two or six follow-up calls after an initial 50-minute session, and results have not been reported separately. <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK> tested six different intervention formats, varying the number of calls, their duration and the use of brief booster calls at four and eight weeks after counselling. There was no clear dose response effect; five brief counselling calls plus boosters were no less effective than the standard American Cancer Society protocol of five longer calls and boosters</P>
<P>Using only the <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK> trial data for intervention and control arms that were not offered NRT also had minimal impact on the pooled effect since NRT increased quit rates in all behavioural conditions. Direct comparison between the more and less intensive interventions tested in two trials showed marginally significant differences in favour of the more intensive intervention in one (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>, RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74), but not in the other (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>, RR 1.05 95% CI 0.89 to 1.23, data not shown).</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2009</LINK>) compared reactive counselling to mailed self-help materials alone. All participants in the intervention group had counselling at the time of their call and had the option to get repeated support. No effect of the intervention was detected (N = 490; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.30).</P>
<P>Two studies compared different reactive support for helpline callers during a single session. They failed to detect a significantly increased benefit from either counselling and materials designed for African-Americans (<LINK REF="STD-Orleans-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Orleans 1998</LINK>) or stage-based counselling designed for blue-collar workers (<LINK REF="STD-Thompson-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thompson 1993</LINK>) compared to standard support. Quit rates in these trials were from 15% to 20% for point prevalence rates at six months. In the first of these trials, extended follow-up for early enrollers found some evidence that quit rates were higher after 12 months in the experimental group.</P>

<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1991</LINK>), provision of a hotline was associated with an increase in quit rates from 4.0% amongst smokers sent self-help materials only, to 6.6% amongst smokers in areas where an advertised hotline was provided in addition to materials. This difference was statistically significant using the unit of allocation (the county) as the unit of analysis.</P>
<P>In a second trial (<LINK REF="STD-McFall-1993" TYPE="STUDY">McFall 1993</LINK>), smokers who had enrolled to be sent materials for a self-help programme with a televised component were randomized to receive follow-up newsletters and access to a helpline for six months. Although the intervention combined a helpline and written materials, quit rates were non-significantly lower in the intervention than control condition after 24 months.</P>
<P>In a third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Joyce-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Joyce 2008</LINK>), enrollees for a Medicare Stop Smoking Programme were randomized to different benefits. The intervention was access to a quitline that offered the choice of a reactive hotline with prerecorded messages and ad hoc counselling, or a proactive service, in addition to coverage for the nicotine patch. The control group had pharmacotherapy coverage only. The quitline significantly increased quitting at 12 months, from 15.8% to 19.3% (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39).</P>

<P>There were 51 trials (N = 30,246) in this comparison. (<LINK REF="STD-Ockene-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ockene 1991</LINK> contributed different data to two subgroups making a total of 52 in the analysis).

Our prespecified categories based on the intensity of support common to the control and intervention groups did not fully explain the heterogeneity, nor was heterogeneity reduced by excluding the trials amongst teenagers or pregnant women.</P>
<P>In 30 trials (N = 19,134) telephone counselling was the main component of a cessation intervention and the control group had only self-help materials or very brief support. In this subgroup the effect estimate was similar to that for all 51 trials (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.46) and with slightly more evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 55%).</P>
<P>In the group of 11 trials (N = 3520; part of <LINK REF="STD-Ockene-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ockene 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osinubi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Osinubi 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ebbert-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ebbert 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Metz-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Metz 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Reid 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borland-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fl_x00f6_ter-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Flöter 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cossette-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cossette 2011</LINK>), where the telephone support followed on from a face-to-face intervention, the point estimate and confidence intervals were again broadly similar and there was low heterogeneity (I² = 5%, RR 1.41; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.66)</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.2 The effect of counselling intensity</HEADING>
<P>A second subgroup analysis of the same 51 trials explored the impact of the number of calls, using three categories; two or fewer sessions; three to six sessions, or seven or more.

Another source of clinical heterogeneity was that five of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ellerbeck-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Ellerbeck 2009</LINK>) offered counselling as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy; in a post hoc subgroup these studies did not show evidence of an effect when pooled. The influence of the control condition is examined further in section 3.3 below. A further source of heterogeneity was that <LINK REF="STD-Velicer-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Velicer 2006</LINK> used an automated voice response system to provide tailored but prerecorded support.</P>
<P>We had no strong a priori rationale for the choice of cut points, although the 1 to 2 call group predominantly captured trials with 'brief' interventions. Because the categories were not prespecified we also conducted a meta-regression analysis in STATA 11.2 using the maximum number of planned calls for each study as a measure of intensity. In a univariate analysis there was no evidence that a larger number of planned calls increased the effect.</P>
<P>We also considered whether including the 12 trials of proactive counselling for quitline callers in their intensity subgroups would alter these conclusions. This confirmed the benefit of more intensive interventions (data not shown). Two of the quitline trials included a test of a brief intervention, and when these were included in the one- or two-session categories the estimate just reached significance, although the relative effect was small. One of these trials offered a single session lasting 50 minutes (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK>) and the other a session of 30 to 40 minutes followed by a second briefer call, with tailored self-help materials (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>). These were considerably longer than the sessions used in the other 1 to 2 session trials, suggesting that their results might not be generalisable outside the quitline setting or to interventions with a small number of short calls.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.3 The effect of motivation</HEADING>
<P>A third subgroup analysis for the 51 trials explored the effect of motivation (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>). Sixteen studies (N = 10,612) specifically recruited smokers who wanted to make a quit attempt, including most of the studies where pharmacotherapy was common to both intervention and control. Thirty-five studies (N = 19,634) did not state that participants were included on the basis of motivation, although relatively high proportions may have been interested in quitting. The effect sizes and confidence intervals in the two subgroups were similar, although there was less heterogeneity in the 'unselected' subgroup.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3.4 Results of a meta-regression</HEADING>
<P>We also explored the combined effects of differences in baseline support, maximum number of calls and motivation in a meta-regression (Stata 11.2). In univariate analyses none of these significantly moderated the effect size. However in a multivariate model incorporating all three factors, each was significant in the model. Controlling for other factors, selection for motivation, and increasing number of calls were associated with similar impacts on the effect increasing the RR by around 20% (number of calls increasing from 2 to 7, as this was treated as continuous). In this same analysis, telephone counselling as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy had a reduced effect when compared to telephone counselling versus self help or as an adjunct to brief intervention or counselling (difference of 30% and 40% on the RR respectively).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">4. Other studies</HEADING>
<P>Eight other studies were judged too dissimilar for pooling. Two studies compared different intensities of telephone support. <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1997</LINK> compared a hospital-based intervention followed by a single call with an intensive intervention in which participants could receive up to four calls after discharge from hospital. The more intensive intervention increased the continuous one-year quit rate from 14% to 19%, a difference which just reached statistical significance (P = 0.05). <LINK REF="STD-Swan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Swan 2003</LINK> compared two intensities of telephone support as an adjunct to bupropion. This study found a significant benefit of the Free &amp; Clear programme which offered a telephone assessment and counselling intervention with four brief prescheduled follow-up calls, compared to the Zyban Advantage Plan which included a single scripted call (N = 1524, RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.54). These two studies provide further evidence that higher numbers of calls are associated with greater benefit.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2013</LINK> failed to detect any additional benefit of a counselling component to increase adherence to the NRT which was provided to all participants who received counselling from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line. Thirty-day abstinence at six months was 36.7% with adherence counselling and 37.5% without. This six-arm factorial trial also compared two-week and six-week courses of NRT, and patch alone versus patch and gum. Although the effect of pharmacotherapy is not within the scope of this review, we note that the combination of NRT types for either course duration increased abstinence rates over two weeks of nicotine patch alone, but six weeks of patch did not significantly improve abstinence over two weeks.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Roski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roski 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2004</LINK> evaluated system-level interventions for changing the organisation of care for smoking cessation, with telephone counselling being the main method for providing cessation support. <LINK REF="STD-Roski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Roski 2003</LINK> failed to detect any benefit of introducing a smoker registry and referral system on cessation rates. Few of the smokers surveyed at the participating clinics reported using any counselling services, and only 25% to 30% of eligible smokers were estimated to have been referred. <LINK REF="STD-Katz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 2004</LINK> tested an intervention to implement clinical practice guideline recommendations including the offer of telephone counselling and/or NRT; this showed a significant increase in sustained abstinence at six months (10.9% versus 3.8%, adjusted odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.8 to 6.3).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Girgis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Girgis 2011</LINK> tested the offer of referral to counselling for Arabic smokers identified at primary care visits. Take-up was low with only a quarter of intervention participants receiving one call and only eight completing all six sessions.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Halpin-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Halpin 2006</LINK> compared benefit designs. There was no significant difference between groups; the quit rate at six months was 19% in the group given access to pharmacotherapy, 18% for the group who could access pharmacotherapy if enrolled for telephone counselling (24% accessed TC), and 13% for those who could access either (only 8% enrolled in counselling).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hennrikus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hennrikus 2002</LINK> compared the offer of telephone counselling or group programmes or a choice in a workplace setting.

No difference in six-month sustained quit rates was detected at 24-month follow-up, although point prevalence quit rates favoured the telephone condition. Quit rates for programme participants were also similar. Incentives increased participation but did not appear to increase cessation rates.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-08-01 10:58:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>This review considers telephone services for delivering behavioural counselling and support both proactively and reactively. Interventions studied in trials range from brief contact with the potential to motivate a quit attempt to intensive support for smokers already engaged in quitting.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions for callers to quitlines</HEADING>
<P>This update of the review continues to provide evidence of a benefit from providing proactive telephone counselling for smokers who initiate contact with quitlines (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Compared to smokers who have only a single contact with the quitline, and are either sent self-help materials or receive brief counselling or both, those who are randomized to one or more additional calls increase their chance of quitting by approximately 25% to 50%. This estimate remains almost unchanged after the inclusion of three new trials contributing over 5,000 participants to this update in 2013. Seven out of 12 trials in this meta-analysis had statistically significant effects including the three that cumulatively contribute 55% of the weight (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK>). Two trials, both conducted in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>) had lower quit rates in the intervention group and these contribute to statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. We have still chosen to present a pooled estimate because most of the trials show evidence of benefit. In a sensitivity analysis we also pooled using a random-effects model and the effect size was similar and the confidence interval (CI) was not much wider. Because the trials in this area have been so large, the estimated effect size, although statistically significant, is small. In an exploratory analysis we pooled the trial outcomes expressed as risk differences to estimate the absolute increase in quit rates attributable to the additional counselling. Risk differences may be much more heterogeneous than risk ratios if trials have very different definitions of abstinence. In this group of 12 trials the definitions of smoking cessation were relatively similar, with seven having final follow-up at around 12 months, of which six required an extended period of self-reported abstinence. Only one used biochemical validation (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>), which is not judged to be necessary in large population-based studies (<LINK REF="REF-SRNT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">SRNT 2002</LINK>). The quit rate in the control groups ranged from 1.5% (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>) to 12%, or 17% when free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was also offered (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>). The intervention group quit rates ranged from 5% (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK>) to 14%, or 21% when NRT was offered (<LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK>). Despite the variation in quit rates, pooling trial outcomes expressed as risk differences showed the same level of heterogeneity as for risk ratios, and the estimated absolute increase in quit rates was 3% (95% CI 2% to 4%). The three trials added in this update have not altered this estimate. These estimates are based on treating all people lost to follow-up as continuing smokers. Excluding losses to follow-up from all conditions, reducing the total numbers by about 35%, would increase the estimate of absolute effect, but only by a percentage point.</P>
<P>All these trials provided multisession counselling, with a variety of schedules. Evidence for a dose response effect is unclear, with <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1996</LINK> suggesting a benefit from additional calls, but neither <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2004</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Hollis-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hollis 2007</LINK> detecting differences between two different protocols. The most detailed investigation, <LINK REF="STD-Rabius-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rabius 2007</LINK>, suggested that fewer shorter calls could be as effective as more and longer ones. They observed that "The finding that different protocols generally yielded similar outcomes may be because they all contained the same basic elements and because those with five or more sessions had similar completion rates". If only a minority of participants are willing to accept all sessions, differences between more and less intensive protocols will have little impact.</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2009</LINK>) compared reactive counselling for quitline callers with a control condition of mailed self-help materials only. No difference was detected, although the upper confidence interval was 1.30. Because the counselling was reactive, with no further contact initiated by a counsellor, we did not pool it with the trials discussed above. It is not clear how many further calls to the quitline the intervention group participants subsequently made. Whilst this study fails to support the benefit of reactive helplines, it does not exclude the possibility of an effect.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interventions for people not calling quitlines</HEADING>
<P>Proactive telephone counselling may also be offered to people who have not contacted quitlines, but are being offered cessation support in other settings (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). These people may or may not be motivated to make a quit attempt when recruited. There is also evidence of benefit from telephone counselling under these conditions. Estimates from pooling studies suggested a 20% to 36% increase in quitting. Based on a control group quit rate of 10% this is equivalent to an absolute increase of 2 to 3 percentage points. There was only a moderate level of heterogeneity, and this was not explained by considering subgroups of trials based on the amount of support common to both intervention and control groups. In the largest subgroup of studies this consisted of mailed self-help materials but some trials included brief face-to-face advice and some offered pharmacotherapy to all participants. The telephone intervention was associated with significantly higher quit rates in each subgroup, but the estimate was smaller and less certain when participants had access to pharmacotherapy.</P>
<P>In the subgroup by intervention intensity, the effect was small and the confidence interval did not exclude no effect when the intervention consisted of only one or two calls. This analysis used the maximum possible number of calls as the measure of intervention intensity. Alternative measures include the average number of calls delivered, which is generally considerably lower than the number intended, and the total contact time. These process measures are less consistently reported. Unless there were particular problems with contacting participants, the planned number of calls is probably a reasonable measure of the 'dose' of support provided for those who were receptive to the intervention. In a meta-regression there was evidence that the amount of support relative to the control condition, the total number of calls and whether participants were selected for motivation to quit at the time of recruitment may all have had some influence on the effect size. Offering more calls, and having participants who were motivated to make a quit attempt increased the estimated effect, but using pharmacotherapy made the additional effect of counselling smaller. This finding is consistent with the results of a separate Cochrane review of behavioural interventions as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2012</LINK>) which also found a relatively small, although clinically important, benefit from increasing the amount of behavioural support. Studies that offered pharmacotherapy, with or without behavioural support, to all participants and evaluated the additional effect of telephone counselling were eligible for inclusion in both reviews. That review found that in a post hoc subgroup of trials in which all contact was by telephone, there was a clearer benefit of the telephone counselling over and above the pharmacotherapy. In this review some trials provided both pharmacotherapy and face-to-face support to all participants, and in these the addition of the telephone component did not show such a clear effect.</P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Tzelepis-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Tzelepis 2011b</LINK>) distinguished between trials which proactively recruited participants and those with reactive recruitment. The seven trials they classified as active recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdullah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullah 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2008</LINK>) were all in our subgroup of studies that did not select participants of the basis of motivation to quit. We also found a benefit of intervention in this group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Completeness, applicability and quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>Rigorous evaluation of reactive services (quitlines, hotlines or helplines) has been difficult because of a reluctance to undertake randomized trials that would require callers who sought help to be refused support. This review restricted formal inclusion to randomized or quasi-randomized trials. A single large trial provides the main evidence that hotlines are beneficial (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1991</LINK>). In this study use of the hotline was relatively high: 36% of the intervention participants called the hotline for recorded messages of support, and 8.7% spoke to counsellors. The hotline appeared most effective for those people who enrolled face-to-face, despite the fact that telephone enrollees made more use of the service. There is much more evidence about the benefit of counselling once smokers have called a telephone-based service. One study was able to evaluate the impact of the proactive counselling element of a helpline by capitalising on the constraints on capacity at certain times (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2002</LINK>). One recent study (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2009</LINK>) did allocate callers to immediate reactive counselling, or self help only. This study did not detect an effect of the counselling; the evidence of a relationship between the number of calls and the effect suggests that it may be important to engage callers into a multisession protocol as used by most quitlines, at least in North America (<LINK REF="REF-Cummins-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 2007a</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Agreements and disagreement with other studies or reviews</HEADING>
<P>The 2008 update of the US Clinical Practice Guideline &#8216;Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence&#8217; (<LINK REF="REF-Fiore-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fiore 2008</LINK>) supports the use of proactive telephone counselling and quitline counselling. The meta-analysis on quitline counselling gives an estimated odds rate of 1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.8, table 6.16), consistent with the estimate in this review. The guideline also identifies a benefit of adding quitline counselling to pharmacotherapy (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6, table 6.17). The six studies that contributed to this analysis are all included our analysis 4.1.3, and show a similar effect, but we pool a further five studies resulting in a smaller estimate.</P>
<P>The US <LINK REF="REF-Community-Preventive-Services-Taskforce" TYPE="REFERENCE">Community Preventive Services Taskforce</LINK> has issued updated guidance on quitline interventions based partly on the last version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Stead-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stead 2009</LINK>). In addition to supporting the effectiveness of quitline interventions, this evaluated interventions to increase the use of quitlines. It recommends (1) mass-reach health communication interventions tagged with the quitline number (2) offers of free evidence-based tobacco cessation medications to eligible callers; and (3) quitline referral interventions for healthcare systems and providers.</P>
<P>A recent meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Tzelepis-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tzelepis 2011b</LINK>) distinguished between trials which proactively recruited participants and those with reactive recruitment, showing benefits in each subgroup. The seven trials they classified as active recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Curry-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McBride-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">McBride 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prochaska-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Prochaska 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aveyard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Aveyard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abdullah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullah 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lichtenstein-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lichtenstein 2008</LINK>) were all in our subgroup of studies that did not select participants of the basis of motivation to quit. We also found a benefit of intervention in this group.</P>
<P>Uncontrolled evaluations have followed up quitline users in a number of places (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Abdullah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abdullah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helgason-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgason 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Willemsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Willemsen 2008</LINK>) and typically report encouraging quit rates. Estimates of the proportion of smokers that call a quitline have varied by country; 6% in Scotland (<LINK REF="STD-Platt-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Platt 1997</LINK>); 3.6% in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>); 4% in England (<LINK REF="STD-Owen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2000</LINK>). Although estimates of a reach of 4% to 6% of the smoking population over a year are encouraging, they are likely to be at the upper end of what can be expected, even with the help of mass media campaigns. In the USA the average usage ranges from 0.01% to 4.28% across states, with the states that spent the most on quitlines services having the highest use (<LINK REF="REF-Cummins-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 2007a</LINK>). Quitlines may help reduce disparities in access to cessation support (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Promotion of quitlines by mass media antismoking campaigns helps to attract callers (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Farrelly-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrelly 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mosbaek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosbaek 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farrelly-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrelly 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2012</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Community-Preventive-Services-Taskforce" TYPE="REFERENCE">Community Preventive Services Taskforce</LINK>), and the use of targeted advertising may increase calls from specific minority or underserved groups (<LINK REF="STD-Cummings-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Cummings 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pierce-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Owen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Owen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummins-2007b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 2007b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maher-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2007</LINK>). There are a number of models for quitlines, using various methods to provide initial support for callers and pass them to specialist counsellors where requested and available (<LINK REF="REF-Ossip_x002d_Klein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ossip-Klein 2003</LINK>). Callers do not necessarily ask for or want counselling, and services can increase population quitting just by mailing self-help materials, even though the effect of this minimal intervention may not be large (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005b</LINK>). Using the telephone contact to collect sufficient data to provide tailored materials may be a useful strategy for enhancing the effect of self-help materials (<LINK REF="STD-Borland-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Borland 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 2005b</LINK>). One strategy that has been used in a pilot project for increasing access to treatment for underserved populations is to provide a cellular phone, allowing smokers to receive proactive counselling (<LINK REF="REF-Lazev-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazev 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In North America a third of quitlines distribute free NRT (<LINK REF="REF-Cummins-2007a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummins 2007a</LINK>). Evaluations suggest that this increases call volume, and pre-post comparisons also suggest that quit rates are increased (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-An-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">An 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cummings-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fellows-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fellows 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tinkelman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinkelman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bush-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bush 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-2009a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zawertailo-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Zawertailo 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Telephone-based services can provide support for users of medications such as NRT, varenicline or bupropion. One trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Fiore-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fiore 2004</LINK>) tested the Committed Quitters<SUP>®</SUP> programme as an adjunct to free nicotine patch therapy, but did not detect an additional benefit of the single counselling call even though this was supported by tailored self-help materials. One short-term randomized trial (<LINK REF="STD-Shiffman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Shiffman 2000</LINK>) failed to detect an effect of a single telephone call after the target quit date compared to mailed, tailored self-help materials alone for purchasers of nicotine gum. In both trials the lack of effect may be attributed to the insufficient dose of the telephone component. Another trial compared multiple to single calls for users of bupropion, and there was a clear benefit of the four-call protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Swan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Swan 2003</LINK>). Support provided by pharmaceutical companies may also be underused. In their trial of proactive calls as an adjunct to nicotine patch, Lando and colleagues noted that fewer than 1% of participants called the company helpline, whether they were scheduled to receive calls or simply encouraged to call the helpline themselves (<LINK REF="STD-Lando-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lando 1997</LINK>). It may be possible to use brief proactive calls to encourage use of quitline services (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holtrop-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Holtrop 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Telephone counselling may also have a role in increasing the appropriate use of pharmacotherapy. In a trial with one of the largest effects, part may be attributable to the greater use of pharmacotherapy amongst those receiving counselling even though NRT and bupropion were also available in the usual care condition (<LINK REF="STD-An-2006" TYPE="STUDY">An 2006</LINK>). Increased use of pharmacotherapy was also noted in the intervention groups in <LINK REF="STD-Emmons-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Emmons 2005</LINK>. A study of callers to the California Smokers' Helpline provides useful information about the acceptability of a telephone referral service as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2000</LINK>). Participants in this follow-up study all planned to use NRT and had a pre-quit counselling session. Those who chose to receive further counselling were more likely to attempt to quit, and to remain nonsmokers for up to a year. Seventy-nine per cent of participants continued with counselling, and 26% of these stayed quit for a year. Of the 21% who had only a single session of counselling, 16% quit. More than half the smokers had called the helpline as a requirement for obtaining free NRT, and the high uptake of further behavioural support suggests that it was popular as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy. However a recent UK trial which failed to show a benefit of additional calls, also failed to detect a benefit of offering free NRT (<LINK REF="STD-Ferguson-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ferguson 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Quitlines may exert an impact beyond that which can be measured by quit rates amongst callers. They may have a symbolic role, emphasising the importance of smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Wakefield-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wakefield 2000</LINK>), and may increase the number of smokers making a quit attempt each year because of awareness generated by the campaigns to promote them (<LINK REF="REF-Ossip_x002d_Klein-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ossip-Klein 2003</LINK>). Their availability may alter provider behaviour and encourage referral (<LINK REF="REF-Boldemann-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boldemann 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Telephone-based support systems are increasingly well established as part of comprehensive tobacco treatment initiatives (<LINK REF="REF-Borland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borland 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McAfee-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAfee 2007</LINK>). The US Department of Health &amp; Human Services has introduced a single national quitline number allowing access to the National Network of Tobacco Cessation Quitlines (<LINK REF="REF-Anon-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anon 2005</LINK>). The <A HREF="http://www.naquitline.org/">North American Quitline Consortium</A> promotes and supports evidence based quitline services in the USA, Canada and Mexico. The <A HREF="http://www.enqonline.org/public/articles/viewarticle.php?id=34">European Network of Quitlines</A> had 30 member quitlines in 2010. There is also a <A HREF="http://globalqlnetwork.wordpress.com/">Global Quitline Network.</A> Other countries where national or state quitlines are known to be established include Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2003</LINK>), New Zealand (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2005</LINK>), United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Gilbert-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbert 2006</LINK>), Sweden (<LINK REF="REF-Helgason-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helgason 2004</LINK>), Italy (<LINK REF="REF-Pizzi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pizzi 2009</LINK>) Hong Kong (<LINK REF="STD-Abdullah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Abdullah 2005</LINK>), Korea (<LINK REF="REF-Myung-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myung 2008</LINK>) and Iran (<LINK REF="REF-Heydari-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heydari 2011</LINK>). The evaluation of systems that encourage and facilitate healthcare providers to refer people to specialist quitline services for extended support is an important area of current research (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Winickoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winickoff 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sherman-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sherman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfenden-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfenden 2008</LINK>). Possible future developments include the use of direct mail or 'cold calling&#8217; to initiate contact with smokers (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Deusen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Deusen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tzelepis-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tzelepis 2011b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Vidrine-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vidrine 2011</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-11 13:20:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsay Stead">
<P>Proactive telephone counselling aids smokers who seek help from quitlines. Telephone quitlines provide an important route of access to support for smokers, and call-back counselling enhances their usefulness. There is limited evidence about the optimal number of calls. Proactive telephone counselling also helps people who receive it in other settings. There is some evidence of a dose response; one or two brief calls are less likely to provide a measurable benefit. Three or more calls increase the chances of quitting compared to a minimal intervention such as providing standard self-help materials, or brief advice, or compared to pharmacotherapy alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-24 09:02:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Cahill">
<P>Further research on ways to combine face-to-face counselling with telephone follow-up to support quit attempts and reduce relapse rates may be useful. Research on reactive helpline services which compares different counselling protocols and different schedules of call-back sessions may also lead to improved outcomes.</P>
