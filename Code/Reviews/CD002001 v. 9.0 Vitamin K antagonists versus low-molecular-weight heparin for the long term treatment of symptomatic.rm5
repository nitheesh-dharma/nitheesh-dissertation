<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:43:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Blood clots (venous thromboembolism) sometimes cause blockages in veins after surgery, during bed rest, or spontaneously. These clots can be fatal when they travel to the lungs. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), 99% of which consist of warfarin, are effective in preventing renewed blood clot formation, because they thin the blood. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are drugs that thin the blood and are used for people who are at risk of major bleeding, people who cannot take vitamin K antagonists, and pregnant women.</P>
<P>
<B>Purpose of the review</B>
</P>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of long term treatment (three months) of venous thromboembolism with LMWH compared with long term treatment with VKAs.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>This systematic review of 16 trials with a combined total of 3299 participants (current until November 2016) found no clear differences in recurrent blood clots and deaths between LMWH and VKA, and fewer bleeding episodes with LMWH than with VKA. However, comparison of only high-quality studies for bleeding revealed no clear differences between LMWH and VKA.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for the outcomes recurrent blood clots and death was moderate. The quality of this evidence was downgraded because of the small number of events reported, leading to imprecision. For the outcome bleeding, the quality of evidence was low because of inconsistency between studies and risk of bias. Continued research into long term treatment of blood clots in the veins with LMWH and VKA is needed.</P>
<P>
<B>Authors' conclusions</B>
</P>
<P>This review found no clear differences in recurrent blood clots and death between LMWH and VKA, and fewer bleeding episodes with LMWH than with VKA. However, when only high-quality studies were compared for bleeding, no clear differences were observed between LMWH and VKA. LMWH may offer an alternative for some patients, for example, those in geographically inaccessible areas, those unable or reluctant to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those for whom taking VKA may be harmful. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:42:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with venous thromboembolism (VTE) generally are treated for five days with intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), followed by three months of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Treatment with VKAs requires regular laboratory measurements and carries risk of bleeding; some patients have contraindications to such treatment. Treatment with LMWH has been proposed to minimise the risk of bleeding complications. This is the second update of a review first published in 2001.</P>

<P>For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched November 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10), The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialistalso searched clinical trials registries for ongoing studies.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:42:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by discussion and performed meta-analysis using fixed-effect models with Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Outcomes of interest were recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality. We used GRADE to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting these outcomes.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:43:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen trials, with a combined total of 3299 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence was moderate for recurrent VTE, low for major bleeding, and moderate for mortality. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for imprecision (recurrent VTE, mortality) and for risk of bias and inconsistency (major bleeding).</P>
<P>We found no clear differences in recurrent VTE between LMWH and VKA (Peto OR 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.15; P = 0.27; 3299 participants; 16 studies; moderate-quality evidence). We found less bleeding with LMWH than with VKA (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.80; P = 0.004; 3299 participants; 16 studies; low-quality evidence). However, when comparing only high-quality studies for bleeding, we observed no clear differences between LMWH and VKA (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07; P = 0.08; 1872 participants; seven studies). We found no clear differences between LMWH and VKA in terms of mortality (Peto OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.56; P = 0.68; 3299 participants; 16 studies; moderate-quality evidence).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:43:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows no clear differences between LMWH and VKA in preventing symptomatic VTE and death after an episode of symptomatic DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests fewer cases of major bleeding with LMWH than with VKA. However, comparison of only high-quality studies for bleeding shows no clear differences between LMWH and VKA. LMWH may represent an alternative for some patients, for example, those residing in geographically inaccessible areas, those who are unable or reluctant to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those with contraindications to VKA.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is defined as formation of thrombus in the deep veins, most commonly in the legs (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT), and/or subsequent embolisation of all or part of the thrombus to the pulmonary circulation (pulmonary embolisation, or PE). DVT of the lower limbs may be associated with localised pain, swelling, and erythema, as well as with development of pulmonary emboli (PE) and later occurrence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS; persistent swelling, erythema, and ulceration). PE presents acutely with shortness of breath, pain on inspiration, tachycardia, and right heart overload, and, if untreated, can lead to circulatory collapse and death; over the longer term, PE can cause chronic post-thrombotic pulmonary hypertension. In this era of more liberal central venous catheterisation, DVT may more often involve the upper extremities. Rarely, other venous circulation (within cerebral veins, portal and mesenteric veins, etc.) can be affected.</P>
<P>In addition to DVT and PE, thrombus can form in the superficial veins, where it is associated with local pain and inflammation (superficial venous thrombosis). This event tends to be associated with lower rates of mortality and morbidity than are seen with DVT, although some patients may be at higher risk of DVT formation depending on the location of the clot (<LINK REF="REF-Chengelis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chengelis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nasr-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nasr 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) comprises DVT and PE and can occur spontaneously. However, risk factors for VTE are many and include periods of inactivity, dehydration, hospitalisation, trauma, clotting disorders and previous thrombosis, varicose veins with phlebitis, pregnancy, use of oral combined hormonal contraceptives, malignancy, obesity, smoking, and advanced age (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The incidence of VTE in mostly Caucasian populations is between 100 and 200 per 100,000 person-years (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>). Of these, it is estimated that 45 to 117 per 100,000 person-years are due to DVT (without PE) and 29 to 78 per 100,000 person-years to PE (with or without DVT) (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>). Recurrent VTE occurs in approximately 7.4% of patients at one year and in 30.4% of patients by 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Cushman-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cushman 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-White-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2003</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:44:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary aim of treatment of symptomatic VTE is prevention of its recurrence, including prevention of potentially fatal PE. Clinical guidelines provide recommendations for treatment of VTE in different settings (<LINK REF="REF-Kearon-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearon 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2012</LINK>). In general, anticoagulation is the recommended treatment of choice. The recommended initial treatment consists of a direct oral anticoagulant (with or without initial parenteral anticoagulation as indicated) or a parenteral anticoagulant given in conjunction with a VKA. Long term therapy (usually for a minimum duration of three months of anticoagulation) is indicated for treatment of acute VTE.</P>
<P>Prolonged use of a VKA has proven efficacy in comparison with placebo and low-dose heparin (unfractionated heparin) for treatment of VTE (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lagerstedt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lagerstedt 1985</LINK>). Use of adjusted therapeutic doses of subcutaneous unfractionated heparin is as effective as use of a VKA for preventing recurrence of symptomatic VTE, but both require regular laboratory monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1982b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1982b</LINK>). Usual practice is to administer VKAs to achieve an international normalised ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1982a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1982a</LINK>). However, use of VKAs continues to present considerable risk of major bleeding (approximately 3% to 4%) during the first three months of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hutten-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutten 1999</LINK>). Moreover, for some patients, it is difficult to achieve a stable INR in the therapeutic range, and this leads to increased risk of bleeding complications.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:44:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Long term treatment of symptomatic VTE with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been proposed to minimise risk of bleeding complications. Comparison of LMWH versus unfractionated heparin for initial treatment of symptomatic VTE reveals that LMWH is associated with a reduction in major bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Hettiarachchi-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hettiarachchi 1998</LINK>), and that treatment with LMWH is less frequently complicated by thrombocytopaenia (<LINK REF="REF-Warkentin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warkentin 1995</LINK>) and osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Kelton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monreal-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monreal 1994</LINK>); also, these compounds do not require laboratory monitoring.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:44:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If the efficacy and safety of LMWH are found to be comparable with those of VKAs, LMWH could be used for long term treatment of symptomatic VTE. This would be especially important for patients in whom VKAs are contraindicated or impractical, for example, pregnant women and those living in geographically inaccessible places.</P>

<P>Two review authors working independently (AA, MS) used the 'Risk of bias tool' as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) to assess sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias, judging each item to be at low, unclear, or high risk of bias according to guidance provided in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. 
</P>
<P>We then classified trials into two categories. Category I trials were those with high methodological quality, that is, clearly concealed randomisation and double-blind treatment or blinded assessment of outcome measures. Category II trials were those with lower methodological quality, that is, unclear or clearly not concealed randomisation or blind outcome assessment. We sought all information regarding adequacy of the randomisation process, allocation concealment, blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, and completeness of follow-up. </P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 15:56:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review detected no clear differences between low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for two of the three primary outcomes (recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and overall mortality). For the third outcome, major bleeding, data show a reduction in favour of LMWH (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.80; P = 0.004). However, pooling of data from category I trials alone (clearly concealed randomisation, double-blind or blinded outcome assessment) revealed no clear differences in major bleeding between treatment groups (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07; P = 0.08). Although this review found no evidence that LMWH has greater efficacy than VKAs for long term treatment of VTE, evidence shows that long term treatment of symptomatic VTE with LMWH versus long term treatment with VKAs may be safer with respect to major bleeding. The largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>) reported no clear differences for any of the three outcomes. Results were similar for recurrent symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and mortality during an additional six to nine months after cessation of the allocated three months of treatment for symptomatic VTE.</P>
<P>In interpreting the findings of this review, one must consider several points. Five category I trials did not use the same initial treatment in both treatment arms, and these differences may threaten the validity of data derived from these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003</LINK>). A previous report suggests that the inferior quality of initial unfractionated heparin treatment may be associated with higher recurrence of VTE during follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1997</LINK>), and two trials included in the review did not report the quality of unfractionated heparin treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1999</LINK>). In the largest trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>), initial treatment with unfractionated heparin was adequate but produced no differences in effect between treatment modalities. Doses of the various LMWH compounds used in individual trials ranged from 100 IU/kg reviparin sodium to 175 anti-Xa IU/kg tinzaparin and 4000 anti-Xa IU enoxaparin. <LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulos 2005</LINK> and Hull (<LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2009</LINK>) used the same dose of LMWH for both initial and long term treatment of symptomatic VTE. <LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003</LINK> recruited only children and adjusted the dose accordingly. These five category I trials found no clear difference in the incidence of recurrent VTE between LMWH and VKAs (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; P = 0.07).</P>
<P>In contrast, the two category I trials that provided the same initial treatment for both treatment arms observed a trend in favour of VKAs for prevention of recurrent symptomatic VTE when using relatively low doses of LMWH during long term treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (<LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>); dosages were approximately twice those normally used for prophylaxis of symptomatic VTE and were not adjusted for weight. The relatively low dose used is reflected in the very low levels of anti-Xa activity found after 22 hours (0.04 U/mL after injection of 4000 anti-Xa IU enoxaparin) (<LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2001</LINK> included 25 participants (14 participants in the LMWH treatment group and 11 in the VKA treatment group; n = 158) with infrapopliteal DVT (calf vein thrombosis) diagnosed by duplex ultrasonography. Excluding these data from the sensitivity analysis did not affect findings. Two considerations are of interest here. First, duplex ultrasonography is not as sensitive and specific for distal thrombosis as it is for proximal DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 1991</LINK>). Second, the natural history of distal DVT is unclear. It is estimated, from trials of diagnosis, that approximately only 20% of calf vein thrombi develop into a proximal DVT within two weeks of presentation, whereas the remainder, which probably are small and self-limiting, do not (<LINK REF="REF-Heijboer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heijboer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huisman-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huisman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huisman 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hull-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>The difference in major bleeding complications favouring LMWH during allocated treatment of three months has to be considered with caution. Different LMWH compounds and relatively low doses of medication were used, as has been mentioned. Although a difference in bleeding incidence favouring LMWH was found when all trials were combined (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.80; P = 0.004), no clear difference between LMWH and VKA was observed (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07; P = 0.08) when only category I trials were considered. These trials used higher dosages of LMWH. On the other hand, the only trial that found a difference in favour of LMWH treatment used the same dose of LMWH for initial treatment as for long term treatment of symptomatic DVT (Peto OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.89) (<LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2001</LINK>). <I>Post hoc</I> analyses showed no clear differences between LMWH and VKA when subsets of fatal and intracranial haemorrhage were assessed.</P>
<P>Overall, the data show no substantial differences in efficacy for long term treatment of patients with DVT with LMWH or VKAs, but long term treatment with LMWH may cause fewer episodes of major bleeding than occur with VKA therapy.</P>
<P>Currently, many patients are treated at home with a course of subcutaneous LMWH administered by the patients themselves. After this initial treatment, patients continue with a three-month course of VKA with the dose adjusted to achieve an international normalised ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0. Treatments used in <LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulos 2005</LINK> do not represent current practice.</P>
<P>Important practical considerations involving mainly patient and local preferences also influence the choice between LMWH and VKAs. The major disadvantage of VKA treatment compared with LMWH treatment is the need for regular laboratory monitoring. Furthermore, VKA compounds have some major drug interactions, but drug interactions of LMWH are uncommon. In addition, treatment with LMWH is relatively safe during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Sanson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanson 1999</LINK>). A major disadvantage of treatment with LMWH is that the patient has to self-administer subcutaneous injections on a daily basis. Among the included trials, only a few participants stopped treatment with LMWH, mainly as the result of problems other than administration of subcutaneous injections. <LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK> reported that 8% of patients refused to participate in the trial because of reluctance to administer subcutaneous injections by themselves.</P>

<P>Participants with symptomatic VTE included in these trials constituted a representative mix of people with this disease. All trials included approximately similar participants; therefore, these data can be generalised to the wider population. Several published trials included only participants with a diagnosis of cancer who had symptomatic VTE. We did not include these trials in our review because participants do not represent the normal cohort of patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic VTE, and because this is the topic of another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only scant data have been gathered on patients with symptomatic pulmonary embolisation (PE). This review includes data from only 202 people with PE, and review findings should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are changing the ways that patients are treated (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2015b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2015b</LINK>). Therefore, in the future, as more and more patients are prescribed DOACs instead of VKA and LMWH, the analysis performed for this review may become outdated. We will reconsider the focus and future of this review in future updates.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-07-19 07:23:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fifty-nine per cent of included patients (1872/3299) participated in trials with category I classification yielding evidence of highest quality on direct treatment comparisons.</P>
<P>All randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review were conducted in an unblinded manner because the two different interventions were delivered in different settings (hospital and home), making participant blinding impossible. When participant outcomes were assessed by individuals who were blind to treatment allocation, we considered threats to the validity of trial conclusions to be reduced. When it was not reported that those collecting outcome measures data were unaware of treatment allocation, trial findings may have been compromised. Trials in which allocation is not concealed and outcomes are not collected in a blind manner are essentially observational rather than experimental in nature. Analysis for only category I trials (clearly concealed randomisation, double-blind or blinded outcome assessment) shows similar results to those of analyses for all studies combined, except for bleeding, which showed no clear differences between treatment groups.</P>
<P>We downgraded the quality of evidence for recurrent VTE and mortality to moderate owing to imprecision resulting from the small number of events and the relatively large confidence interval. We decided not to downgrade for risk of bias due to blinding because a sensitivity analysis excluding studies deemed of low methodological quality confirmed no clear differences between LMWH and VKA.</P>
<P>We downgraded the quality of evidence for major bleeding to low owing to risk of bias and inconsistency: a sensitivity analysis including only category I trials (clearly concealed randomisation, double-blind or blinded outcome assessment) showed no clear differences between VKA and LMWH. Bleeding outcomes are more susceptible to biased outcome reporting than outcomes such as VTE and mortality, and only two studies (studies of low methodological quality) have reported less bleeding with LMWH; the remainder showed no clear differences because confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect.

<P>Methods used to conduct this review are described in detail in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>); particular strengths include independent application of review eligibility criteria, independent data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, and assessment of quality of evidence according to GRADE. The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist, who is highly skilled in identification of randomised controlled trials, devised and conducted the search strategies. We are confident that we have included all relevant studies. However, the possibility remains that some relevant trials, particularly in the 'grey' literature (e.g. conference proceedings), have been missed. Other potential biases in the review process are the missing information from three trials regarding aspects of their conduct (<LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Romera-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Romera 2009</LINK>).</P>

This meta-analysis included six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veiga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veiga 2000</LINK>) and one abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 2000</LINK>).

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Ferretti-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferretti 2006</LINK> reviewed only recurrent VTE after treatment with LMWH compared with oral anticoagulants for people with VTE and found no clear differences between treatments when assessing recurrent symptomatic VTE (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.02). This meta-analysis included three trials of patients with cancer, which we excluded for the purpose of this Cochrane review, three other trials that we judged to be of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>), four that we considered of lower methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veiga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veiga 2000</LINK>), and an abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Hull-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hull 2002</LINK>) of the included trial <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>.</P>
<P>The third systematic review did detect a difference between treatments. <LINK REF="REF-Bochenek-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bochenek 2012</LINK> reviewed the efficacy and safety of long term treatment of VTE with LMWH compared with oral anticoagulants and found a reduction in episodes of VTE (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.97) and in the outcome major bleeding (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.74). This review did not evaluate mortality as an outcome. The <LINK REF="REF-Bochenek-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bochenek 2012</LINK> review included six trials that we judged to be of high methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Das-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Das 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Daskalopoulos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Daskalopoulos 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gonzalez-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gonzalez 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hull-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Hull 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massicotte-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Massicotte 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pini 1994</LINK>) and six trials that we judged to be of lower methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Beckman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Beckman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kakkar-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kakkar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kucher-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Kucher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopaciuk-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Lopaciuk 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lopez-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lopez 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Veiga-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Veiga 2000</LINK>). The meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Bochenek-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bochenek 2012</LINK> included two trials that considered only patients with cancer, who were excluded for the purpose of this Cochrane review. One of these studies showed a significant effect of LMWH heavily influencing the overall outcome and contributing approximately one-third of the overall weight; this was likely the reason for the difference between <LINK REF="REF-Bochenek-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bochenek 2012</LINK> and the current Cochrane review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:16:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:15:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate-quality evidence shows no clear differences between LMWH and VKA in preventing symptomatic VTE and mortality after an episode of symptomatic DVT. Low-quality evidence suggests fewer cases of major bleeding with LMWH than with VKA. However, when only high-quality studies are compared for bleeding, no clear difference between LMWH and VKA is evident. LMWH may present an alternative for some patients, for example, those in geographically inaccessible areas, those who are reluctant or unable to visit the thrombosis service regularly, and those with contraindications to VKAs. Only limited data are available for patients with symptomatic PE.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-18 20:16:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For more definitive conclusions, additional adequately designed randomised controlled clinical trials are needed, especially in the field of symptomatic PE. These trials must include patients with contraindications for VKAs (e.g. pregnant women), patients who are unable or reluctant to go to the thrombosis service on a regular basis, and patients living in geographically inaccessible areas.</P>

<P>We modified the original protocol as follows for the update published in 2012.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We excluded trials that randomised only participants with cancer, as patients with malignancy are the topic of a different review (<LINK REF="REF-Akl-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akl 2014</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>We added secondary outcomes that were the same as primary outcomes but were measured over a different time frame. Primary outcomes now are measured during initial treatment covering three months, and secondary outcomes are considered for an additional nine months, or longer if data are available.</LI>
<LI>We changed assessment of the methodological quality of included trials to include the updated and recommended Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>For the 2017 update, we added a 'Summary of findings' table, according to current Cochrane guidelines.</P>
