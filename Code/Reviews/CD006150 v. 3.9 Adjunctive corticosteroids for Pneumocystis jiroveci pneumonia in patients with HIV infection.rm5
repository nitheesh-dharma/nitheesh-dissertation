<P>
<I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>jiroveci</I> pneumonia (PCP), formerly called <I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>carinii</I> pneumonia, is the most common opportunistic infection among patients infected with HIV. In 1990, based on evidence from five randomised controlled trials, an expert panel recommended the use of corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood).</P>
<P>The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of adjunctive (additional) corticosteroids on mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients co-infected with HIV and PCP. We searched for eligible studies up to April 2014. We included seven studies in this review and six in the meta-analysis (combining of study data).</P>
<P>The number and size of the trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients co-infected with PCP is small (the six trials included in the meta-analysis comprised 242 individuals in the intervention groups and 247 individuals in the control groups; the trial on infants comprised 47 individuals in the intervention group and 53 in the control group). Follow-up ranged from three to 14 months. The evidence from this review was of high quality for mortality and of moderate quality for need for mechanical ventilation and suggests a beneficial effect for adult patients with substantial hypoxaemia. For infants (18 months or younger) with HIV and suspected PCP there is insufficient evidence on whether the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids could improve survival (the confidence interval for the estimate of effect is wide, includes both clinically relevant benefit and harm and is of moderate quality).</P>

<P>
<I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>jiroveci</I> pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10% to 20% during the initial infection and this increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation. It has been suggested that corticosteroids adjunctive to standard treatment for PCP could prevent the need for mechanical ventilation and decrease mortality in these patients.</P>

<P>For the original review we searched <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (2004, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1980 to December 2004) and EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2004) without language restrictions. We further reviewed the reference lists from previously published overviews, searched UptoDate version 2005 and Clinical Evidence Concise (Issue 12, 2004), contacted experts in the field and searched the reference lists of identified publications for citations of additional relevant articles.</P>
<P>In this update of our review, we searched the above-mentioned databases in September 2010 and April 2014 for trials published since our original review.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:12:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of 2029 screened records, we included seven studies in the review and six in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias varied: the randomisation and allocation process was often not clearly described, five of seven studies were double-blind and there was almost no missing data. The quality of the evidence for mortality was high. Risk ratios for overall mortality for adjunctive corticosteroids were 0.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 0.98) at one month and 0.59 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) at three to four months of follow-up. In adults, to prevent one death, numbers needed to treat are nine patients in a setting without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) available, and 23 patients with HAART available. The three largest trials provided moderate quality data on the need for mechanical ventilation, with a risk ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.73) in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids. One study was conducted in infants, suggesting a risk ratio for death in hospital of 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.29; moderate quality evidence).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:13:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) more than two decades ago, the incidence of <I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>jiroveci</I> pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Stringer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stringer 2002</LINK>) has decreased significantly in the Western hemisphere. However, PCP (the acronym stands for <U>p</U>neumo<U>c</U>ystis <U>p</U>neumonia) still remains one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<LINK REF="REF-Kaplan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaplan 2000</LINK>). Among patients with HIV infection and PCP the mortality rate is 10% to 20% during the initial infection and this increases substantially with the need for mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Randall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randall 2000</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:13:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two to three days after starting anti-PCP therapy, the respiratory situation of PCP patients often worsens because of increased inflammation in the lungs as a reaction to pneumocystis particles from killed organisms. Corticosteroids given in conjunction with anti-PCP therapy may help to better control the inflammatory process. Therefore the corticosteroid treatment should be started as early as possible but within 72 hours after starting the PCP-specific therapy. So far, there is no evidence about an optimal dose or duration of adjunctive corticosteroids. The following 21-day oral regimen with prednisone has been recommended: 40 mg orally twice daily for days one to five, 40 mg once daily for days six to 10, and 20 mg once daily for days 11 to 21 (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EACS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">EACS 2013</LINK>). If parenteral administration is necessary, it is recommended to use methylprednisolone at 75% of the respective prednisone dose (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>). In children with severe PCP, it is recommended to start the corticosteroid treatment as early as possible but within 72 hours after diagnosis. The recommended dose of prednisone for children is 1 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for days one to five, 0.5 mg/kg once daily for days six to 10, and 0.5 mg/kg once daily for days 11 to 21 (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>). The alternative regimen with methylprednisolone (intravenous) is 1 mg/kg/dose every six hours for days one to seven, 1 mg/kg/dose once daily for days eight to nine, 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily for days 10 to 11, and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily for days 12 to 16 (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:13:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Within two to three days of the initiation of anti-PCP therapy, the health status of patients often worsens. It is presumed that the patient's alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and the inflammatory processes in the lungs increase as organisms are killed (<LINK REF="REF-Sax-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sax 2012</LINK>). Adjunctive corticosteroids administered with initiation of anti-PCP therapy may reduce the inflammatory process and prevent this clinical worsening.</P>

<P>In 1990, an expert panel recommended the use of corticosteroids for HIV-infected patients with PCP and substantial hypoxaemia (initial arterial oxygen partial pressure of &lt; 70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial gradient &gt; 35 mmHg on room air) based on the evidence from five randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1990</LINK>). The studies used for the consensus statement still represent the basis for the current guidelines for the treatment of adults (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>). However, at the time of the first consensus statement, one trial was not yet completed (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1992</LINK>), two trials had been stopped prematurely (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1990</LINK>), and one trial was not published in full (<LINK REF="STD-Clement-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Clement 1989</LINK>).

<P>In our original search, we screened 1591 titles and abstracts. We excluded 1583 records and assessed eight in full text. Of these, two trials did not meet our inclusion criteria and we excluded them. One trial investigated only patients with mild hypoxaemia and had a short follow-up of only three days (<LINK REF="STD-Jeantils-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jeantils 1993</LINK>), and another trial, <LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1993</LINK>, was a subgroup analysis of a larger included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1990</LINK>). The remaining six trials investigated adults with HIV and moderate-severe PCP; one was only published in abstract form (<LINK REF="STD-Clement-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Clement 1989</LINK>), two were stopped prematurely due to apparent benefits in the treatment groups with adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Gagnon-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Gagnon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1990</LINK>), and one was stopped early due to published evidence from other studies in favour of adjunctive corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Nielsen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Nielsen 1992</LINK>).

<P>Overall, the risk of bias of the six studies included in the meta-analysis varied. Details of random sequence generation were reported in three of seven studies. Patient follow-up was almost complete for all included studies due to short follow-up periods (the total number of patients lost to follow-up was four). In the six studies conducted in adults, concealed allocation of participants was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bozzette-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bozzette 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 1995</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Overall mortality</HEADING>
<P>Risk ratios for overall mortality were significantly reduced for adjunctive corticosteroids in adult patients with HIV at one month (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>) and at three to four months of follow-up (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). We found some evidence of heterogeneity among trials at one month (test of heterogeneity P value = 0.12; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 43%), whereas at three to four months treatment effects looked more homogenous (P value = 0.78; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). We judged the quality of the evidence for these outcomes to be high as the influence of blinding is not of significant importance for the outcome mortality.</P>
<P>We explored inconsistencies among studies in sensitivity analyses. Heterogeneity was considerably reduced when the analysis was limited to trials reporting early adjunctive corticosteroids (within three days) that were published in full, i.e. excluding <LINK REF="STD-Clement-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Clement 1989</LINK> (summary risk ratio for mortality at one month 0.44; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69, heterogeneity P value = 0.49; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). We carried out further sensitivity analyses for the mortality endpoint at one month. In trials that reported concealed allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Bozzette-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bozzette 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Montaner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Montaner 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Walmsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Walmsley 1995</LINK>), the summary risk ratio was 0.54 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.92, heterogeneity P value = 0.49; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

The assumption that patients lost to follow-up at one month died gives a summary risk ratio of 0.56 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.97, heterogeneity P value = 0.11; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 44%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk ratio for in-hospital mortality in infants receiving adjunctive corticosteroids was 0.81 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.29) (<LINK REF="STD-Terblanche-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terblanche 2008</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).

Again, the risk ratio for this endpoint was largely reduced in the group with early adjunctive corticosteroids (0.38; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.73; P value = 0.40; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-03-11 14:39:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meta-analysis of six randomised controlled trials in HIV-infected adults with <I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>jiroveci</I> pneumonia (PCP) and substantial hypoxaemia found a significant reduction in the relative risk of death with adjunctive corticosteroids of 44% at one month and 41% at three to four months. The average weighted mean mortality in the control groups of these trials at one month was 25%. This initial mortality rate of 25% can be assumed in settings where highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not available, which is still the case for most developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Fisk-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisk 2003</LINK>). In this situation we estimated that nine (95% confidence interval (CI) 6 to 200) HIV-infected adults with PCP have to be treated early with adjunctive corticosteroids to prevent one death during the first month after PCP diagnosis. In Western countries, where HAART is widely available, we estimated the respective number needed to treat to be 23 patients (95% CI 15 to 500), assuming an initial mortality rate of 10% (<LINK REF="REF-Sepkowitz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepkowitz 2002</LINK>). With regard to the need for mechanical ventilation, the risk reduction with adjunctive corticosteroids was even greater in the investigated patient population, but the number of trials was small (n = 3).</P>
<P>Only one trial reported overall mortality during the hospitalisation of infants under 18 months of age diagnosed with PCP. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that adjunctive corticosteroids had an effect on mortality (confidence intervals were wide, including both clinically relevant benefit and harm). Due to limited resources, the authors of that trial fixed the number of participating infants at 100 (<LINK REF="STD-Terblanche-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Terblanche 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review has several strengths and limitations. We conducted an extensive literature search and updates to retrieve all eligible trials. However, formal testing for publication bias was not powerful because of the small number of included trials. Even with a symmetric funnel plot (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>), such bias cannot be ruled out. Moreover, with a small number of included trials the uncertainty interval for the inconsistency among trials may not be very informative (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). We focused mainly on mortality data, which may be less prone to ascertainment bias, and we analysed the data according to the intention-to-treat principle to get more conservative estimates. Finally, the trials included in this meta-analysis used different corticosteroid regimens. So far, neither the dosing nor the length and tapering schedule of corticosteroids has been adequately addressed in randomised trials. In former and current recommendations for adults (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>), the corticosteroid schedule of the largest trial was adapted (<LINK REF="STD-Bozzette-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bozzette 1990</LINK>). The former (<LINK REF="REF-Frieden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frieden 2009</LINK>) and current guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>) for children have taken the trials in adults into account as well as three comparative observational studies in children (<LINK REF="REF-Bye-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bye 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McLaughlin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLaughlin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sleasman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sleasman 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been some concern among physicians treating patients with AIDS that further immunosuppression due to corticosteroid therapy could accelerate the onset of other HIV-related opportunistic complications (<LINK REF="REF-Lambertus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lambertus 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1993</LINK>). However, with the exception of an increase in muco-cutaneous herpes simplex infection episodes (<LINK REF="STD-Bozzette-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bozzette 1990</LINK>), adjunctive corticosteroids were not associated with an increase in opportunistic complications in any of the included trials. A large cohort study that used a standard 21-day tapering course of adjunctive corticosteroids found no difference in the risk of AIDS-related complications apart from an increase in oesophageal candidiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Gallant-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallant 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is possible that adjunctive corticosteroids are also beneficial for HIV-infected patients with mild hypoxaemia due to PCP (<LINK REF="STD-Jeantils-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Jeantils 1993</LINK>). However, in this situation the short-term mortality is low and possible unfavourable effects of corticosteroids might outweigh the benefits. Evidence from randomised controlled trials for non-HIV-infected patients with severe PCP is still lacking. Retrospective observational studies have shown conflicting results: while <LINK REF="REF-Pareja-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pareja 1998</LINK> found that corticosteroids might be beneficial, <LINK REF="REF-Delclaux-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delclaux 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Moon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moon 2011</LINK> did not find an improvement of outcomes in non-HIV-infected patients with severe PCP.</P>

<P>This systematic review has confirmed and quantified the benefit of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy in HIV-infected adults with moderate-severe <I>Pneumocystis</I> <I>jiroveci</I> pneumonia (PCP). We estimated a relative risk reduction for overall mortality of 44% at one month and 41% at three to four months. We calculated that nine patients must be treated with adjunctive corticosteroids in order to prevent one death in a setting where highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not available, and that 23 patients must be treated with adjunctive corticosteroids to prevent one death in a setting where HAART is available. The results corroborate the conclusions of the 1990 consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1990</LINK>), and support current recommendations for the management of PCP in HIV-infected adults (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>). In adults, it is recommended to start the corticosteroid treatment as early as possible but within 72 hours after starting the PCP-specific therapy. The recommended dose for prednisone is 40 mg orally twice daily for days one to five, 40 mg once daily for days six to 10, and 20 mg once daily for days 11 to 21 (<LINK REF="REF-Benson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benson 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EACS-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">EACS 2013</LINK>). If parenteral administration is necessary, it is recommended to use methylprednisolone at 75% of the respective prednisone dose (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 2013</LINK>). In children with severe PCP, it is recommended to start the corticosteroid treatment as early as possible but within 72 hours after diagnosis. The recommended dose of prednisone is 1 mg/kg of body weight twice daily for days one to five, 0.5 mg/kg once daily for days six to 10, and 0.5 mg/kg once daily for days 11 to 21 (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>). The alternative regimen with methylprednisolone (intravenous) is 1 mg/kg/dose every six hours for days one to seven, 1 mg/kg/dose once daily for days eight to nine, 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily for days 10 to 11, and 1 mg/kg/dose once daily for days 12 to 16 (<LINK REF="REF-NIH-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIH 2013</LINK>).</P>

<SUP>4</SUP>The confidence interval of the summary estimate from all trials has an upper boundary close to 1 (no effect); however, if <LINK REF="STD-Clement-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Clement 1989</LINK> (the trial introducing heterogeneity and initiating steroids later than other trials) is excluded in a sensitivity analysis, the upper boundary of the summary estimate changes to 0.7, i.e. all plausible effects are clinically relevant.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Quality of evidence downgraded from high to moderate as there was only a single trial with a wide confidence interval of treatment effect including clinically relevant benefit and clinically relevant harm.</P>
<P>
<SUP>6</SUP>Quality of evidence downgraded from high to moderate because lack of blinding could influence the decision of a caregiver to initiate mechanical ventilation.</P>

<P>Funnel plot to evaluate the presence of publication bias in trials investigating adjunctive corticosteroids for <I>Pneumocystis jiroveci </I>pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. The funnel graph plots the log of the treatment odds ratio against the standard error (SE) of the log odds ratio (an indicator of sample size). Open circles represent trials included in the meta-analysis. The line in the centre indicates the summary log odds ratio. In the absence of publication bias, the log odds ratio estimates from smaller trials are expected to be scattered above and below the summary estimate, producing a symmetric triangular or funnel shape. When smaller trials with larger log odds ratios are missing, the funnel plot appears asymmetric and may indicate the presence of publication bias. In our systematic review the funnel plot looks symmetric. The Egger test for publication bias was not statistically significant (P value = 0.91).</P>
