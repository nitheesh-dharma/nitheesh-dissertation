<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-18 09:39:26 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Cochrane review authors investigated whether IVF leads to more live births than other management options in women with unexplained subfertility.</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> IVF is frequently used for couples with unexplained subfertility, as it may bypass a variety of undiagnosed biological problems. However, it is expensive and invasive and can lead to complications. Other management options for unexplained subfertility include trying naturally for a pregnancy, introducing washed sperm within the womb (insemination) and performing insemination after use of drugs ('fertility drugs') to stimulate the ovaries.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> The eight randomised parallel-group trials included 1622 women. Some were multi-arm trials with several comparisons. Two compared IVF with expectant management, two compared IVF with insemination alone (IUI) and five compared IVF with insemination plus stimulation of the ovaries. Evidence is current to May 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results:</B> IVF may be associated with higher live birth rates than expectant management, but there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. IVF may also be associated with higher live birth rates than unstimulated IUI. In women pretreated with clomiphene + IUI, IVF appears to be associated with higher birth rates than IUI plus gonadotropins. However in women who are treatment-naive there is no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI + gonadotrophins or between IVF and IUI + clomiphene. Adverse events associated with these interventions could not be adequately assessed owing to lack of evidence.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence:</B> Quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitation was serious imprecision resulting from small study numbers and low event rates.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-10-12 14:49:48 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF compared with expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI) or intrauterine insemination along with ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (IUI + gonadotropins) or clomiphene (IUI + CC) or letrozole (IUI + letrozole) in improving pregnancy outcomes.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-10-12 14:59:42 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, first quarter), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (1985 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (May 2015) and reference lists of articles. We searched the following trial registries: clinicaltrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We searched the Web of Science (http://wokinfo.com/) as another source of trials and conference abstracts, OpenGrey (http://www.opengrey.eu/) for unpublished literature from Europe and the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database (http://regional.bvsalud.org/php/index.php?lang=en). Moreover, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and contacted study authors to ask about additional publications.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary review outcome was cumulative live birth rate. Multiple pregnancy and other adverse effects were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-18 09:55:06 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-11-13 08:04:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-13 08:04:41 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infertility is said to be unexplained when standard investigations fail to reveal any obvious barrier to conception such as absent ovulation, poor semen quality or tubal pathology. The prevalence of unexplained infertility among couples attending a fertility clinic has been shown to be 21% among women younger than 35 years of age and 26% in women older than 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-Maheshwari-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maheshwari 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the absence of a known cause for infertility, treatment options have included expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI), stimulated IUI with clomiphene or gonadotropins and in vitro fertilisation (IVF). IVF is expected to overcome any subtle biological deficiencies that could affect conception. However, it is invasive and is associated with risks such as multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK> recommends offering IVF to women with unexplained infertility who have not conceived after two years of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. In the UK, estimated live birth rates (LBRs) per IVF treatment for all indications of IVF vary between 32.2% in women younger than 35 years and 13.4% in women between 40 and 42 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-HFEA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">HFEA 2012</LINK>), and the average LBR per cycle started is 25% (<LINK REF="REF-HFEA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">HFEA 2012</LINK>). The Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-VARTA-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">VARTA 2013</LINK>) and the <LINK REF="REF-FIVNAT-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIVNAT 2012</LINK> report from France have noted pregnancy rates per commenced cycle of 18.3% and 20.8%, respectively. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine/Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Registry (ASRM/SART) reported that 40.7% of cycles resulted in a live birth in women younger than 35 years (<LINK REF="REF-SART_x002f_ASRM-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">SART/ASRM 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The chance that pregnancy will lead to live birth is influenced by the prognostic profile of a couple such as female age, duration of infertility and previous pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1995</LINK>). Invasive treatments such as IVF are thought to be more effective than expectant management for couples with limited chances of natural conception, but less so in couples with good prospects of natural conception.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-10-16 15:04:52 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In vitro fertilisation involves using standard protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval under ultrasound guidance, insemination, embryo culture and transcervical replacement of embryos at cleavage or blastocyst stage. In comparison with cleavage stage transfer, blastocyst transfer results show a significant increase in LBR per fresh IVF cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Glujovsky-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glujovsky 2012</LINK>). IVF is invasive and is associated with several potential complications. The multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) (including twins and triplets) associated with IVF is approximately 18.8% (<LINK REF="REF-HFEA-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">HFEA 2012</LINK>). In 2006, the risk of having twins following IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was 19.9%, and that of having triplets was 0.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Mouzon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzon 2010</LINK>). MPRs after single embryo transfer and double embryo transfer have been reported to be 1.5% and 32.4%, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-SART_x002f_ASRM-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">SART/ASRM 2014</LINK>). The incidence of OHSS in stimulated IVF cycles in Europe was reported to be 0.8% in 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Mouzon-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mouzon 2010</LINK>). OHSS can present with different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe). The intravascular depletion associated with OHSS can lead to dehydration, hypovolaemia, electrolyte disturbances and thrombosis due to haemoconcentration.</P>
<P>Other treatments that have been used in unexplained subfertility include IUI (with or without superovulation (SO)) and expectant management (spontaneous pregnancy).</P>
<P>IUI, with or without concomitant use of clomiphene citrate (CC) or gonadotrophins, or letrozole, is a widely used treatment for unexplained infertility (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). By bypassing the cervical barrier and increasing the number of motile spermatozoa that reach the uterus and tubes, thereby bringing the sperm in close proximity to one or more eggs, IUI can improve fertilisation and could increase LBRs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Unstimulated IUI</HEADING>
<P>In a spontaneous cycle, single or dual IUI is normally performed 20 to 30 hours after an endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) surge is detected in the serum or urine. Women are asked to monitor urinary or serum LH levels daily from day 10 to day 12 of the treatment cycle. Normally, a maximum of 0.5 mL suspension of processed spermatozoa is introduced into the uterine cavity with a suitable catheter. Semen is prepared by using a standard pure sperm preparation (a procedure used to prepare semen to isolate a population of sperm with a higher percentage of motile forms and with a more uniform morphology than those found in untreated ejaculates). The procedure involves processing fresh and liquefied ejaculates over a pure sperm gradient of 80/40, followed by centrifugation. Couples are advised to abstain from intercourse from the day of LH monitoring until the day of insemination. Additional luteal support is not required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins</HEADING>
<P>For ovarian stimulation + IUI cycles, CC (antiestrogen) or gonadotropins are used. The aim is to achieve ovulation from a maximum of two mature follicles. The enhanced fertility induced by ovarian stimulation can be attributed to the increased number of fertilisable oocytes, improved sperm selection and assisted migration. The advantage of this approach is that some of the risks associated with IVF are avoided, particularly those related to oocyte retrieval. However, significant risks of OHSS and multiple pregnancy remain if gonadotropins are used concomitantly.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">IUI + gonadotropins</HEADING>
<P>When gonadotropins are used concomitantly with IUI, a baseline ultrasound scan is carried out between days 1 and 3 of the treatment cycle. A daily or alternate-day dose of 75 IU of gonadotropins is started from day 3, and follicular tracking is carried out from around day 5 of stimulation. Subtle variations in clinical protocol would be found with different clinics. When one or two follicles reach 17 mm in maximum diameter, urinary or serum LH levels are estimated to rule out endogenous surge, a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger is given intramuscularly and the IUI is planned 36 to 40 hours later. In the case of excessive response of more than two mature follicles, the cycle is cancelled to avoid risk of high-order multiple pregnancies. Luteal support generally is not required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>

<P>Clomiphene therapy involves oral administration of CC tablets at a dose of 50 mg to 250 mg daily for five days in the early follicular phase (usually from day 2 to day 6) of the cycle.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Expectant management</HEADING>
<P>In the absence of an identified cause, couples with unexplained infertility have a relatively high chance of spontaneous pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Lenton-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenton 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Snick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snick 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2008</LINK>). A cumulative LBR of 33% at 36 months was estimated from a Canadian multi-centre cohort study (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1995</LINK>). Following this report, <LINK REF="REF-Snick-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snick 1997</LINK> presented data from a primary care study in the Netherlands and suggested a cumulative LBR of 60% at 36 months.</P>
<P>In an RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Steures-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2006</LINK>) that compared expectant management with IUI plus SO in couples with unexplained subfertility, of the 253 couples enrolled, 127 were assigned IUI with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, and 126 expectant management. In the intervention group, 42 (33%) women conceived and 29 (23%) pregnancies were ongoing. In the expectant management group, 40 (32%) women conceived and 34 (27%) pregnancies were ongoing (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.1). One twin pregnancy occurred in each study group, and one woman in the intervention group conceived triplets. This study concluded that a large beneficial effect of IUI with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation can be excluded in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis. Expectant management for six months was therefore justified in these couples and is an efficient way to prevent multiple pregnancies.</P>
<P>In a Scottish multi-centre trial, 580 couples with unexplained infertility that included mild endometriosis and mild male factor infertility were randomly assigned to three arms: expectant management, CC and IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK>). Live birth rates of 17% and 23% were obtained after expectant management and IUI, respectively, and no evidence suggested differences (odds ratio (OR) 1.46, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.43). Clinical pregnancy rates were similar in the two groups (expectant group 17% vs 23% in the IUI group) (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.74). This study suggested that 17 women would need to undergo IUI for one extra live birth to be achieved.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2010</LINK>) pooled data from two trials comparing CC with IUI and expectant management and showed no clinical benefit with CC and IUI (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.70 to 8.19).</P>

<P>Review authors considered whether clinical and methodological characteristics of included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis to provide a meaningful summary. Even when trials included in a comparison group were statistically homogeneous, we noted potentially large differences in clinical features (clinical heterogeneity). We took these differences into account when analysing and interpreting pooled results. Clinical heterogeneity in subfertility (such as variation in entry criteria and subtle differences in treatments used, which are important from a clinical perspective) cannot be avoided because most centres use their own protocols, which can vary in different aspects. When trials met the inclusion criteria and investigators had provided the same intervention, we considered it appropriate to pool their results. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by inspecting scatter in the data points and overlap in the confidence intervals and, more formally, by checking results of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test and measuring the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic. We considered an I<SUP>2</SUP> value greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

In one trial, women were included if the duration of infertility was three years (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>). A minimum duration of infertility of two years was an inclusion criterion in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>).

One study included couples who had a poor prospect of pregnancy, defined as a chance of natural conception within 12 months below 30% (Custers 2011a). One study that included only women between 38 and 42 years of age had an eligibility criterion of six months of attempted conception (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>).

Another used an online randomisation programme with biased coin minimisation stratified for study centre (<LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>). One study based randomisation on a blocked schedule by using numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2004</LINK>). Another study performed randomisation using permuted blocks of varying sizes, stratified by the woman's age (&lt; 35 vs &#8805; 35 years), laparoscopy within the past year (yes or no) and study site (Boston IVF or Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates) (<LINK REF="STD-Reindollar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reindollar 2010</LINK>).

<P>In vitro fertilisation (IVF) results in higher live birth rates (LBRs) compared with expectant management or unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI). LBRs with IVF are also higher compared with those seen with IUI + gonadotropins in women pretreated with clomiphene citrate (CC), but no evidence suggests differences in LBR between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins in treatment-naive women. Nor does evidence show differences in LBR between IVF and IUI + CC. IVF results in higher clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) compared to IUI + gonadotropins in treatment naive women. Adverse events associated with these interventions have not been adequately reported; additional research is necessary.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-11-16 14:38:15 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Evidence for each comparison was limited. The primary outcome for this review was LBR per woman. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>) followed couples for 12 months after randomisation, during which time they underwent a maximum of three IVF cycles with subsequent transfer of a single fresh and (when appropriate) frozen embryo, or a maximum of six cycles of IUI + gonadotropins. Duration of infertility among couples included in the trials varied significantly. No trials compared IVF with IUI + letrozole. The paucity of trials and possible clinical heterogeneity among included trials suggest that evidence for the effectiveness of IVF is inconclusive.</P>
<P>Meta-analysis was possible for three comparisons (IVF vs expectant management, IVF vs unstimulated IUI, IVF vs IUI + gonadotropins), but as few outcomes were reported, pooling was limited because data were insufficient. One of the included trials, which compared IVF with expectant management, dates from 1993 (<LINK REF="STD-Soliman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Soliman 1993</LINK>). IVF versus CC + IUI was represented by a single trial. Although risk of bias was not substantial in the trial included in this comparison, it is difficult to be confident about this, as all trials share similar weaknesses, as discussed above. Adverse events associated with these interventions have not been adequately reported.</P>
<P>The applicability of studies comparing IVF versus expectant management is questionable, as they included extensively pretreated women who had been subfertile for several years (mean 58-65 months) and the duration of expectant management was only three to six months.</P>
<P>Small studies of treatment-naive women found no significant differences in LBR per woman between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins.Clinical pregnancy rates were significantly higher with IVF compared with IUI+ gonadotropins. However, a large study of women pretreated with CC + IUI reported a significant increase in pregnancy and LBR rates following IVF. Couples in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Reindollar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reindollar 2010</LINK>) were randomly assigned to (1) a conventional pathway involving CC plus intrauterine insemination (CC + IUI) followed by IUI + gonadotropins, then IVF, or (2) an accelerated pathway (CC + IUI followed by six cycles of IVF). Randomly assigned groups included similar numbers of women. However, study populations in the other studies in this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>) differed from those of <LINK REF="STD-Reindollar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reindollar 2010</LINK>, as women in these studies did not undergo CC + IUI treatment before receiving IUI + gonadotropins or IVF. Despite pretreatment with CC + IUI in both randomly assigned arms, we believe the comparison between IUI + gonadotropins and IVF is valid. Thus our analysis suggests that IVF may be more effective than IUI + gonadotropins in terms of pregnancy rate in treatment naive women and IVF may be more effective than IUI+ gonadotropins in terms of pregnancy rate and LBR per woman among pretreated women, but these results should be interpreted with caution. The single study that compared CC + IUI with IVF in women 38 to 42 years of age (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>) also showed that pregnancy rates with IVF were significantly higher than with CC + IUI.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Multiple pregnancy, an important adverse effect of superovulation, was seen in four studies that compared IVF with IUI + gonadotropins (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>). Results of the analysis suggest higher MPRs in women who underwent IUI + gonadotropins compared with IVF, but findings did not reach statistical significance. The maximum number of embryos transferred was two among women younger than 35 years, and three in women 35 years of age and older in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>); up to two embryos were transferred in the second study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). One good-quality embryo was transferred in one study (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>), and two embryos were transferred if no good-quality embryos were available. Elective single embryo transfer (eSET) was followed in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>). A further study used American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines for day 3 embryo transfers (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>). Both twin pregnancies that occurred in the IVF group in one included study occurred after transfer of two non-top-quality embryos (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). Protocols used for ovarian stimulation also differed among the studies that tested this comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). A long protocol was followed that included a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and gonadotropins in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>) used an IVF protocol consisting of 21 days of an oral contraceptive followed by a microdose gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, followed by the addition of gonadotropins at a twice-daily dosage for three days, beginning on day 3 or 4 of the agonist. Standardisation of the number of embryos transferred and the protocols used for ovarian stimulation should be considered in trials related to subfertility.</P>

<P>Few high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have conducted head-to-head comparisons of relevant interventions in the context of unexplained subfertility. Most studies are methodologically inadequate. Only eight trials were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Meta-analysis was possible in three comparisons. One comparison was represented by a single trial only. This was compounded by insufficient information on some outcomes. All trials reported LBR per woman or couple, although duration of follow-up in most trials was limited. The method of randomisation was unclear in some trials, and most had small sample sizes. Blinding could not be performed in most studies because of the nature of the interventions, but this was unlikely to affect outcomes measured in the review. One trial was unpublished. Another study reporting only per-cycle data was excluded from the review (<LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>Existing trials have several limitations. The definition of unexplained infertility and the clinical procedures and protocols used vary among studies. It is unreasonable to expect absolute experimental uniformity among study centres, and different centres inevitably display variation in the application of assisted reproduction treatments (ARTs). Duration of follow-up is limited and unequal between studies. Sample sizes of the studies included in this review are also limited. Most trials show poor methodological quality. Methods of randomisation and reasons for and numbers of dropouts and withdrawals often are not clearly stated. Inadequate methods of randomisation can lead to bias in estimates of treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Allocation concealment is inadequate in most trials. Intention-to-treat analysis is not always performed, possibly leading to exaggerated estimates of treatment effect and possible influence on inferences and clinical decisions. Most trials have determined pregnancy rates per cycle as the endpoint, but LBR per woman is the most important outcome to the couple. The latest updated Cochrane guidelines for analysing and presenting results emphasise the use of pregnancy and LBRs per woman or couple in the final meta-analysis. However, in practice such data are seldom available. Therefore, only a limited number of trials could be included in this review. Most trials had limited duration of follow-up. Information on costs associated with various fertility treatments is also very limited. Reported cost-effectiveness analyses are lacking in their definitions of outcome measures and extent of cost analysis.</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity between trials is present as the result of differences between studies in terms of investigation protocols and inclusion criteria. The protocols used for ovarian stimulation also differ. Timing of IUI and method of sperm preparation are not clearly defined in some studies. The sample size of these studies is limited. The following three analyses are included.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">IVF versus expectant management for unexplained subfertility</HEADING>
<P>Evidence for live birth or pregnancy per randomly assigned woman was downgraded by three levels because of very serious imprecision: The 95% confidence interval (CI) was too large, and relatively few events were reported in the included studies.

<P>Evidence for live birth or pregnancy per randomly assigned woman was downgraded by two levels because of serious imprecision: The 95% CI was relatively wide.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">IVF versus IUI + ovarian simulation with gonadotropins or clomiphene for unexplained subfertility</HEADING>
<P>Evidence for outcomes in this comparison was downgraded from one to two levels for various reasons (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), including imprecision, risk of bias in one trial and few events in the included trials.</P>
<P>We identified three studies that determined the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women who underwent IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). However, as data were reported per cycle in one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>), only two trials were included in the analysis for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 2014</LINK>). Although no significant differences were noted in the incidence of OHSS between these two treatment groups, the sample size was too small to allow firm conclusions. In the trial that reported OHSS per cycle (<LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>), two of 48 couples in the IVF group that reached embryo transfer were cancelled as the result of OHSS, and of the 142 started cycles of IUI + gonadotropins, 14 cycles were cancelled because of the risk of multiple pregnancy (10%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Definition of unexplained infertility</HEADING>
<P>Wide inconsistency can be seen in the definition of unexplained infertility. The definition used for this review follows here.</P>
<P>Couples with unexplained infertility were defined as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>couples who have tried to conceive for 1 year;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>those with no abnormality identified during the full infertility investigation, laboratory evidence of ovulation (normal luteal progesterone in serum), evidence of tubal patency and exclusion of other tubal or pelvic abnormalities by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, or both; and</LI>
<LI>those producing a normal semen sample according to the definition of normality provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), in accordance with the year the study was performed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Only three trials reported secondary outcomes such as costs per cycle and costs per couple. Economic evaluation of fertility treatment is an important factor in decision making. Trials evaluating the cost-effectiveness of available treatments for unexplained infertility are very limited. To date, no studies have compared costs of IVF treatment versus expectant management and CC in the context of RCTs. Only four studies of cost-effectiveness in ART were based on RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Karande-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karande 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reindollar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reindollar 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK>). The study of <LINK REF="STD-Karande-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Karande 1998</LINK> compared an assumed equity in costs based on mathematical modelling between IVF as first-line treatment and a traditional treatment algorithm and showed a much higher cost per pregnancy for IVF. <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK>, in a prospective, parallel-group study, reported that costs of one IVF treatment cycle were 3.5 and 5 times higher than those of one IUI treatment for stimulated and spontaneous cycles, respectively. <LINK REF="STD-van-Rumste-2014" TYPE="STUDY">van Rumste 2014</LINK> reported an additional cost of EUR 600 per couple with IVF with eSET compared with IUI + superovulation. <LINK REF="STD-Reindollar-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Reindollar 2010</LINK> also reported cost-effectiveness of various treatments; however, specific costs for IVF and IUI + superovulation could not be extracted from the data provided.</P>

<P>IVF may be associated with higher live birth rates than expectant management, but there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. IVF may also be associated with higher live birth rates than unstimulated IUI. In women pretreated with clomiphene + IUI, IVF appears to be associated with higher birth rates than IUI plus gonadotropins. However in women who are treatment-naive there is no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI plus gonadotrophins or between IVF and IUI plus clomiphene. Adverse events associated with these interventions could not be adequately assessed owing to lack of evidence.</P>
<P>Clinicians and couples should balance the invasive nature of IVF and related costs against chances of success with other treatment modalities.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-16 15:02:23 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some of the difficulties encountered in preparation of this review can be avoided by planning infertility trials with similar study designs and methods and presentation of results. This will allow pooling of data for statistical meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Large RCTs with sufficient power are warranted. Unexplained infertility should be clearly defined. Participant characteristics should be clear (age, duration of infertility, parity, infertility investigations and previous therapy). These trials should have a prolonged duration of follow-up (e.g. six cycles of treatment). Treatment protocols, methods of sperm preparation, numbers of embryos transferred and inclusion and exclusion criteria should be clearly stated.</P>
<P>Outcome measures should include LBRs per woman. As comparison of cumulative LBRs is also important, trialists should endeavour to follow participants until frozen transfers accruing from a single oocyte retrieval procedure are completed. In trials in which controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is used, the number of multiple pregnancies and the incidence of OHSS should be stated.</P>
<P>Future trials should use adequate methods of randomisation, and numbers of and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals should be clearly stated. Allocation concealment should be adequate, and intention-to-treat analysis performed. A power calculation should be performed with a clear description of the improvement in treatment outcome that is considered clinically significant. Use of parallel-group rather than cross-over trials is favoured in the study of events, as the latter may exaggerate the effectiveness of treatment.</P>
<P>IVF versus expectant management and IVF versus IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins or clomiphene or letrozole require comparison in large RCTs with participants of varying prognostic profiles. It is important to identify the group of patients with certain prognostic profiles who would benefit by proceeding from expectant management to more invasive treatment. The most appropriate time to switch over from expectant management in this group should be identified.</P>

<P>States: "During our trial the results of a pilot study, randomising women to three cycles of IUI-COH or one cycle of IVF-SET, were published. This pilot study demonstrated that the policy of transferring two embryos when no good quality embryos are available is not effective in preventing multiple pregnancies. The study protocol was amended, and from February 2010, after allocation of 48 women to the IVF-SET group, a strict single embryo transfer policy (i.e. single embryo transfer was performed irrespective of embryo quality) was implemented"</P>

<SUP>a</SUP>The GRADE quality rating was downgraded by 3 levels due to very serious imprecision, questionable applicability and (for the analysis of clinical pregnancy) serious inconsistency. Very few events were reported in the included studies (12 births and 18 pregnancies altogether). There was also substantial statistical heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=80%) in the analysis of clinical pregnancies (with differing directions of effect) and applicability was unclear due to the long duration of unexplained infertility and use of co-interventions.<BR/>
