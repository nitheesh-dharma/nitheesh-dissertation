Please also make this clear in 'types of participants'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background &lt;/b&gt;I don't understand this sentence &amp;quot;Mortality from these episodes is closely related to the degree of hypercapnia and acidosis at admission, and to the presence of non-comorbidities&amp;quot; Does 'non-comorbidities' mean people without comorbidities? Or did you mean comorbidities? I assume in the sentence after you mean that people without comorbidities and hypercapnia and acidosis (sorry I know this is from the existing review text!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Included studies.&lt;/b&gt; You must add Shepperd 1998 into the characteristics of excluded studies table and include a reason why you decided to exclude it prominently in the text of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made a heading to distinguish between ED visits and hospitalisations to reflect that made in the forest plots . I think you should say whether of not you contacted trialists to try and find out if there were any data on ED visits as hospital at home could potentially prevent ED visits, and not hospitalisations? What was the follow up period for this study? (I understand that you may not have this info for the original trials).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mortality - the following sentence has been rephrased with emphasis on the confidence interval; &amp;quot;but we observed a strong trend towards lower mortality among participants in the hospital at home group&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HRQL - please include a total number of people randomised&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patient/carer satisfaction. How was the data dichotomised? I would have thought that this would have been done on a scale. You must explain in the text (and SOF table) or reconsider the data entered - perhaps there is better data in the papers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Costs - were the costs associated with supplying the care only, or did cost analyses take account of money saved e.g. by preventing exacerbations? Please make this clear for the reader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was there any information on exacerbations which was an outcome but for which you did not report any data? Either check through the papers, or say that this info was not reported. Was this data the same as the hospitalisations/ED visits? Please explain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please check through the review as there are some edits made using tracked changes. Once you are happy with them, please accept all the changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In general, I'm not sure that it is enough information to refer to the SOF table and say that therefore the evidence is of a high quality (which you have done throughput the 'measure of treatment effect' section). I don't think that all readers are 'up to speed' enough on SOF to understand what this means fully and so I think that it might add a bit too much weight to the descriptions of the results. I came up with two options: 1) create a heading called summary of findings table in the results where you can discuss the findings in the SOF table. We haven't use this approach yet in the Airways group, but it would be interesting to see how this works out. 2) to flesh out the sentences a bit more. remember that the evidence is not of high quality because it is in a SOF table, it is of high quality because you dd not downgrade it according to criteria outlined in chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data and analyses.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have changed the structure of the comparison tree so that it is in line with recommendations (this is not your fault!). This must have made creating your summary of findings table very difficult so sorry about that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have ordered the studies by date. There must be a rationale for ordering the studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characteristics of included studies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make it clear how many people were randomised in each study - shouldn't be too hard, but it is a little unclear at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOF table.&lt;/b&gt; I deleted the one you had within the results as it will automatically be printed below the abstract in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PLease include ED visits and remove lung function which people would not want to base guidelines on. Change the order to 1) hospital admission; 2) EDvisits; 3) SGRQ; 4) patient satisfaction; 5) carer satisfaction; 6) direct costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;include follow up times here as indicated. Pls double check that Hernadez was 8 wks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder if it is fair to downgrade for a subjective outcome when it is not possible to blind the person? If a patient has a better quality of life or prefers one treatment over another this will always be objective. I am interested in your comments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;suggest downgrading SGRQ to low quality (1 downgrade for blinding and one for few people and large CI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not sure that it is fair to downgrade for heterogeneity for direct costs when you decided not to pool. I added a comment here which might be more helpful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SGRQ the corresponding risk is not in a helpful format and require some interpretation - I'm not sure why you have a corresponding risk when you did not pool this outcome?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do the satisfaction domains mean? please see comment above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suggest re-expressing the absolute risks as people out of 100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I query if it is fair to downgrade satisfaction twice for wide confidence intervals and also for few events, when mortality was only downgraded once?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add number of participants to direct costs section&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.7&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.1&lt;br&gt;Exported from Review Manager 4.2.2&lt;br&gt;Reply from Felix Ram 08/02/02&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mike,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your message and explanation. I shall change the protocol to include patients recruited up to 72 hours (3 days). I will email the revised protocol to Steve Milan for Paul Jones to look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for your help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply from Mike Greenstone 07/02/02&lt;br&gt;Dear Felix ,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke yesterday to Robin Stevenson- he's the senior author on the Glasgow studies ( Gravil et al , Cotton et al ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reckons that their mean length of stay for COPD exacerbators treated in hospital is between 6 and 8 days. The lower figure applies to the control arm of his trial where there were lots of exclusions in people with co-morbidities and that &amp;quot; in real life &amp;quot; patients tend to stay even longer (ie mean 8 days) . Therefore he reckons that the in-patient stay prior to randomisation to assisted discharge ( hospital at home )or conventional care could validly be up to 3 days which is what they used . Certainly he felt within 24 hrs was much too rapid to allow safe assessment.This would certainly concur with my own experience of COPD and just about every other known disease ie it is almost impossible to turn round the simplest clinical problem within 24 hrs even if they're completely healthy. Perhaps we should go with Robin's suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes ,&lt;br&gt;Mike&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25 January 2002&lt;br&gt;Reply from reviewer: FR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mike,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review: Hospital at home for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your comments regarding the above-mentioned review. We have incorporated all except two of your comments,&lt;br&gt;which are detailed below (our replies below your comments in &amp;quot;CAPS&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope our changes and explanations are satisfactory. Please find attached the revised version of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look forward to your reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix Ram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;WHY 24 HRS? SOME SCHEMES GET PATIENTS OUT IN 48 HOURS. GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE LENGTH&lt;br&gt;OF STAY IS ABOUT 7 DAYS YOU COULD ARGUE THAT ANY SCHEME DISCHARGING PATIENTS IN UNDER&lt;br&gt;72 HOURS WOULD BE SAVING A LOT OF BED-DAYS&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons for choosing a time limit of 24 hours. Firstly, any success with home support can solely be ascribed&lt;br&gt;to this group as distinct from early in-hospital care. Secondly, extending the time limit beyond 24 hours may cause trialists to&lt;br&gt;discharge patients to the home support group who would not have warranted in-hospital admission and would have been&lt;br&gt;discharged following a short in-hospital visit (e.g. admissions other than for medical intervention). However, we are hoping that&lt;br&gt;randomisation (with allocation concealment) would reduce the chances of this occuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have added the above statement to the review under &amp;quot;Types of studies&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;SURELY ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE HERE AND ALSO INAPPROPRIATE&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not agree with the above statement. It is very important that the allocation of patients to either the home support or&lt;br&gt;hospital admission group is conducted in a concealed manner. However, from previous experience we do not expect this to be&lt;br&gt;the case or trialists not to report such information (but only in a ideal world). We are hoping that the randomisation&lt;br&gt;code/procedure is done prior to the assessment of the patients and that the person/clinician allocating the patients to the two&lt;br&gt;study groups (home support vs admission) is not aware of the sequence of randomisation (in effect allocation concealment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result we have left the review text unchanged and will be using the Cochrane (A-D) grading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;REPLIES FROM FELIX RAM IN CAPS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2_5_3 Editing by CJC&lt;br&gt;Authors' Contributions: fine (if rather vague for contibutions for John Wright and WW)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: 'To evaluate the efficacy of &amp;quot;hospital at home&amp;quot; compared to hospital inpatient care in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.' I have changed this to efficacy because it is assessed in RCTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine (can you confirm that dropouts due to re-admission are included in the data entered for hospital readmission in RevMan? For example are the nine readmitted patients included in the numbers in Metaview? I THINK THIS COULD BE A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE VALIDITY OF THE REVIEW.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PATIENTS WHO WERE REPORTED TO BE READMITTED WERE INCLUDED IN THE READMISSION OUTCOME, THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN FOR VARIOUS REASONS. THE SAME APPLIES TO THE MORTALITY DATA - ONLY THOSE STATED AS DEAD WERE INCLUDED IN THE MORTALITY OUTCOME (DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WITHDRAWN FROM THE STUDY).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: I have switched off totals for single studies and where a study contributes more than one (1~2, 4~1and 5~1). I am not sure I understand the A&amp;amp;E attendance without admission outcome or the preference data (how can they have a preference in a parallel trial?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWITCHING OFF TOTALS WHERE THERE ARE SINGLE STUDIES ARE FINE NOW BUT WHEN WE COME TO UPDATING THE REVIEW AND WHEN MORE STUDIES ARE INCLUDED WE WOULD ONLY HAVE TO SWITCH THE TOTALS ON AGAIN - I DON'T THINK THIS IS A WORTHWHILE PROCESS AS IT DOES NOT HELP IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE META-VIEW AND CREATES MORE WORK WHEN THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPARISONS (E.G MY INHALER DEVICE REVIEWS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A&amp;amp;E ATTENDANCE WITH ADMISSION&amp;quot; MEANS EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS - PATIENTS WHO PRESENT AT A&amp;amp;E BUT ARE TREATED THAN DISCHARGED WITHOUT REQUIRING IN-PATIENT ADMISSION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;PREFERENCE&amp;quot; IS POSSIBLE IN THIS INTERVENTION AS THESE PATIENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL OR WOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED HOSPITAL CARE AT SOME STAGE IN THEIR LIFES (ALTHOUGH I CANNOT BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN 100% OF THE PATIENTS HAVE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH IN-PATIENT CARE) BUT CONSIDERING MOST OF THESE PATIENTS ARE WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE DISEASE SEVERITY, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THEY ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE IN-PATIENT CARE SOMETIME IN THEIR LIVES. IN ANY CASE THE DATA FOR PREFERENCE WAS VERY LIMITED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: fine but again effectiveness taken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: &amp;quot;Selection criteria&lt;br&gt;Only randomised controlled trials were considered where patients presented to the emergency department with an exacerbation of their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies must not have recruited patients that are usually deemed obligatory admissions.&lt;br&gt;*****You have included patients selected in casualty and those admitted already and then offered early discharge. Is this what you suggested in the protocol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE CRITERIA WAS RANDOMISED WITHIN 72 HOURS OF PRESENTING AT ED NOT WHETHER THEY WE IN CASUALTY OR ADMITTED AS IN-PATIENTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Main results&lt;br&gt;Seven studies with 754 patients were included in the review. Studies provided data on hospital readmission and mortality both of which were not significantly different when the two study groups were compared (RR 0.89; 95%CI 0.72 to 1.12 &amp;amp; RR 0.61; 95%CI 0.36 to 1.05, respectively). Other reported outcomes included few studies. &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;*** I have altered the final sentence slightly. I have also added significant to the differences not found in the conclusion!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Types of participants&lt;br&gt;All patients with a diagnosis of COPD with an acute exacerbation presenting to an emergency department for treatment. Studies must not have recruited patients that are usually deemed obligatory admissions (BTS 1997). This includes patients with an impaired level of consciousness, acute confusion, acute changes on the radiograph or electrocardiogram, arterial pH of less than 7.35, concomitant medical conditions or those patients presenting at the emergency department for social reasons.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;*** Could you clarify whether social reasons are part of exclusion on the grounds of obligatory admission or in their own right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I FAIL TO SEE HOW THIS MATTERS AS SOCIAL REASONS ARE AN EXCLUSION CRITERIA NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. IN ANY CASE NONE OF THE STUDIES MENTIONED THIS AS A REASON FOR EXCLUSION, BUT IN &amp;quot;REAL LIFE&amp;quot; THIS IS IMPORTANT AND OCCURS FREQUENTLY (HENCE WRITTEN IN THE PROTOCOL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods of the review: **** Could you put something in about planned subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Also about fixed and random models. Funnel plot for publication bias?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;br&gt;'LUNG FUNCTION [Comparison 02:01 &amp;amp; 02 &amp;amp; 03]:&lt;br&gt;Three studies reported data on lung function (Davies 2000; Hernandez 2003; Ojoo 2002). All studies reported FEV1. The individual study data werre not combined in the meta-analysis as the three studies used different methods to measure changes in FEV1.'&lt;br&gt;****I have altered this to were not combined as it is possible to combine these WMDs as they are all on the same scale. Weights may be different for absolute and change scores but in fact the SDs are all pretty similar as it happens. I am quite happy to leave your decision not to combine them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO - THIS IS WRONG. IT SHOULD BE AS STATED IN THE TEXT ORIGINALLY &amp;quot;....the three studies used different methods to measure changes in FEV1&amp;quot;. I AM AWARE THEY ARE MEASURED ON THE SAME SCALE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE, THERE WERE ACTUALLY CLINICALLY MEASURED USING DIFFERENT METHODS (AS STATED IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT). FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE A COMBINATION OF PRE AND POST-BRONCHODILATOR VALUES, ANOTHER REPORTED FEV1 ONLY ON A SELECTION OF PATIENTS. ORIGINAL TEXT REPORTED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;PREFERENCE FOR TYPE OF CARE [Comparison 05:0]&lt;br&gt;One study reported retrospective preference for type of care by both participants and carers at the end of the study(Ojoo 2002). Both the participants who were treated at home and their carers had a higer preference for &amp;quot;hospital at home&amp;quot; care than those who had received inpatient care (RR 1.62; 95%CI 1.18 to 2.24 &amp;amp; RR 1.98; 95%CI 1.05 to 3.73, respectively) with the combined overall preference in favour of &amp;quot;hospital at home&amp;quot; care (RR 1.73; 95%CI 1.29 to 2.34). &amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;I have rewritten this to make it clearer ( I hope).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK - THANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COSTS: **** YOU MUST AT LEAST REPORT A RANDOM EFFECTS CI AS WELL AS FIXED EFFECTS WITH THIS DEGREE OF HETEROGENEITY PLEASE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK - DONE, BUT CAN'T SEE THE POINT OF THIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion:&lt;br&gt;' This review found no significant differences between &amp;quot;hospital at home&amp;quot; patients and hospital inpatients for readmission rates and mortality two to three months after the initial exacerbation. This suggests that selected patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely and successfully treated at home when discharged to &amp;quot;hospital at home&amp;quot; care with support from visiting respiratory nurses.'&lt;br&gt;I have swopped this around to report the findings first and you conclusion afterwards (but you have not proved that this is safe, so toned down to suggests).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Implications for practice&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Hospital at home&amp;quot; schemes for exacerbations of COPD can be used as an alternative to hospital admission for about one in four COPD patients and are safe, effective and preferred option for suitable patients. The results of this review should encourage clinicians to consider this form of management. '&lt;br&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK WITH SWOPPING THE SENTENCE AROUND BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY WE HAVE NOT PROVED THIS TO BE SAFE, IF MORTALITY WAS NO DIFFERENT WHEN THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARED AND IN ADDITION HOSPITAL RE-ADMMISSION WAS ALSO NO DIFFERENT. HOW MORE SAFE CAN ONE GET, BESIDES SHOWING MORTALITY WAS NO DIFFERENT IN THE TWO GROUPS . I UNDERSTAND THAT MORE DATA ON OTHER RELEVANT OUTCOMES ARE LACKING (E.G. ADVERSE EVENTS, ETC) BUT FROM WHAT WE HAVE TO DATE I THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION. PLEASE EXPLAIN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: Handling of withdrawals. The table of included studies reports that withdrawals are often not described but the text says all studies report this???? Also there is no overall summary of the failure rate across studies (number of withdrawals due to readmission in the H@H arms). Could this be added as an additional table please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONLY THREE STUDIES DID NOT REPORT ANY DETAILS ON WITHDRAWALS OTHER THAN DETAILS ON MORTALITY AND HOSPITAL READMISSIONS (SHEPPARD 1998A, NICHOLSON 2001, HERNANDEZ 2003). TEXT REVISED TO REFLECT THIS. THE TEXT MATCHES WHAT THE TABLE OF INCLUDED STUDIES STATES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST FOR THE &amp;quot;NUMBER OF WITHDRWALS DUE TO READMISSION&amp;quot; AS THESE WOULD SURELY EQUAL JUST THE NUMBER OF READMISSIONS. A PATIENT IS CONSIDERED WITHDRAWN FROM THE STUDY IF HE OR SHE IS READMITTED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE DID NOT THINK IT WAS WISE TO REPORT WITHDRAWALS FROM STUDIES AS IT WAS NOT FULLY REPORTED BY ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. MORE USEFUL OUTCOMES REPORTED BY MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES WERE MORTALITY (REPORTED BY 6/7 STUDIES) AND READMISSIONS (REPORTED BY 7/7 STUDIES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WE DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR A TABLE OF WITHDRAWALS AS IT WOULD ONLY COMPLICATE THE PICTURE, AND ESPECIALLY AS THE TEXT DETAILS ALL WITHDRWALS PER INCLUDED STUDY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: left for copy editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPELL CHECK DONE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: back to Toby for Felix.&lt;br&gt;_____________________________&lt;br&gt;29may2003&lt;br&gt;Dear Felix,&lt;br&gt;Thanks for checking through this. Thanks for adding subgroup and sensitivity analysis. I am afraid switching off totals for single studies is group policy. I did not understand what you meant by differences in FEV1 so quite agree to changing this back. I have changed WMD to mean difference for single study results. Thanks for reporting the random effects cost result (needed as part of sensitivity analysis on the methods used for pooling). The issue of safety is difficult. The well-monitored environment of skilled personnel in an RCT will not always translate into routine practice, but I take your point about the mortality and admission data. The upper limit of the CI is a 5% and 12% possible increase in risk respectively which many readers would be happy with but I think they will have to look at the data for themselves. Your argument about withdrawals is fine as long as the number of admissions and deaths is largely similar to the total withdrawals. The trouble is that trialists could massage their results if there were more withdrawals in total for other reasons from the H@H arm than the in-patient arm. This is the information that is currently not accessible to readers and that could be usefully shown in an additional table for the studies where the total withdrawals are reported (all bar 3 I think you mention above). If there are very few extra withdrawals this may not be necessary - can we discuss?&lt;br&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;br&gt;PS part of the conceptual problem that I have with this is that in-patients cannot be re-admitted in the acute phase, whereas H@H patients can. Re-admissions therefore could be early or late. If they are all put together there will be an inherent difference between the two groups. I guess there were time-frames specified for re-admission? If there were large proportions of patients withdrawn (for whatever reason) from the H@H arm this is a threat to the conclusion that the H@H model is safe etc.&lt;br&gt;If you wish we can send this for peer review as it stands at present and take an outside opinion on these issues?&lt;br&gt;Old title: #Hospital at home for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;======================================================&lt;br&gt;24 June 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your explanations (re above). I can understand your problem with the issue regarding re-admisison rates, but as you had sort of figured-out. Re-admission for the H@H group was only considered as such after they were discharged from nurse/medical team care and of course similarily with the inpatient group (once they left hospital). None of the studies specifically listed the number of re-admissions in the H@H group while they were under care of the nurse/medical team. And as stated in text, data on withdrawals was not available from all studies and what was available is detailed, creating a table and tallying up withdrawals would be misleading as the data is incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that we should send the review out for peer review - but disagree that we should highlight the above issue to the peer reviewer (as I think you are assuming what would or could be an issue with the H@H group as regards re-admission).&lt;br&gt;__________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;Peer review feedback 1 August 2003&lt;br&gt;Substantive issues:&lt;br&gt;1. Some of the trials used low intensity intervention. Were the patients in these trials of lower severity? Is it possible to compare the occasional care with 24 hour care as a sub-goup analysis?&lt;br&gt;2. The author of one of the trials has not been contacted, so it is not accurate to say that all authors have been contacted.&lt;br&gt;3. The results of the cost minimisation analysis (Shepperd 1998a) have been completely omitted from the review. Also the following additional data has been offered from this author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We published the results of a cost minimisation analysis and this is not included in the review [Shepperd. S., Gray, A., Harwood, D., Vessey, M., Morgan, P. A (1998) Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Hospital at Home with In-Patient Hospital Care (2): a cost minimisation analysis. BMJ, 316, 1791-6, although the reference is included in the references to included trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data we could have made available includes:&lt;br&gt;&amp;#183;About 1% of all patients admitted for medical conditions during the study period were recruited to either the elderly medical or chronic obstructive airways disease groups.&lt;br&gt;Preference for type of care: we failed to detect a difference in patient and carer preference:&lt;br&gt;&amp;#183;Patient preference for hospital at home 73% compared with 54.5% preferring hospital care (95% CI -21.3% to 57.7%).&lt;br&gt;&amp;#183;Carer preference hospital at home 87.5% and carer preference for hospital care: 71.4% (95% CI -24.5% to 56.6%)&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;4. The implications for research suggest that trialists need to determine models of care and patient groups, but this is in conflict with the implication for practice that the review contains valuable data to drive change.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 August 2003: reply from reviewers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have added the median cost data from the Sheppard 1998a paper in the text. It is not correct to say that &amp;quot;...considerable cost were generated by readmission in the H@H group and the patients look more severe&amp;quot;. Readmission rate was not different between the two groups in the Sheppard 1998a study (p=0.56) for completion mortality was also not different in the two groups. We have also failed to see how you can state that &amp;quot;... H@H group and the patients look more severe...&amp;quot;. The details provided in the Sheppard 1998 paper (Table 7, page 1790) on baseline outcome measures certainly does not hint that the two groups have different severity. We would be happy to say in the conclusion that the take home message is that more severe patients end up back in hospital - but we do not have this data to say this (regardless, whether we agree that this would be a logical assumption). I guess we are trying to be purist and stick with the data we have. We do mention in our conclusions that the majority of patients would still need to be treated as inpatients and that careful screening of patients for H@H schemes is important. We do not believe the conclusions need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer Reviewers comments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low intensity intervention was not due to lower disease severity but rather due to the design of the intervention as some studies used minimal intervention strtegy and some more intense - however, it is not possible to separate (or subgroup) according to these criteria. In any case any sub-grouping now would be post-hoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All authors were contact at the time of the conduct of the review, but only a handful replied. Thanks for providing additional data for the Sheppard 1998 study on preference, it has been added to the meta-analysis and the text updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not believe it is wrong to state that the review provides &amp;quot;valuable data to drive change&amp;quot; as stated in our implications for practice. We believe our statement implies that we need to define the best model of care for these patients and that this review results should encourage us to pursue/investigate this option further. Implications left unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;8 August 2003&lt;br&gt;Thanks Felix,&lt;br&gt;I agree that this is a post hoc comment about the cost differences between groups, but table 3 in the cost paper by Shepperd (1791) clearly shows that the DURATION of readmission was very different for the two groups, median of 5 days for H@H and zero days for hospital patients. This makes a substantial difference to the total hospital costs (which are higher for H@H even though initial stay in hospital is lower). Thus the analysis by number readmitted conceals a big cost difference in these admissions. I think it is at least bringing this point out in the discussion on costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover it is much too selective to report a non-significant difference in total hospital costs for the Shepperd study and not mention the significant overall cost difference in favour of the hospital care group (2379 v 1247 P=0.01 as shown in Table 3). I think you must report this significant finding, but do not think you should pool it with the other studies in view of the clinical heterogeneity as below. I have highlighted the sentence in red that needs a rewrite. The paragraph in red in the discussion also needs revising as it has woven together early discharge to H@H schemes (viz Shepperd) which are what is currently used in the UK with avoidance of discharge (used in some studies such as Hernandez and Nicholson).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My comment on severity is also post hoc, but in this study all the patients had been admitted to hospital and were then discharged to H@H (with 24 hour care if needed) and in my clinical experience these are not the same as those presenting in casualty who can be sent home with occasional nurse follow-up. You do mention this in the conclusions I agree. It looks to me as if money can be saved by avoiding unnecessary admissions with education and follow-up but not necessarily by discharge home early to an intensive H@H package, and I think the peer reviewer has a point about the clinical heterogeneity of the studies that needs to be brought out more. This may in fact be more about differences in intervention more than differences in baseline severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take your point about post hoc sub group analysis by severity and do not suggest that you attempt this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;12 August 2003: Authors reply&lt;br&gt;Dear Chris,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your feedback. As this is a systematic review I am relunctant to just highlight the results from one study, especially when as they are reported as medians (in this case Sheppard et al). However, I can understand your comments and that of the peer reviewer so have revised the review accordingly, resolving all issues as detailed in your message above. I hope the review is now satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;22 Aug 2003&lt;br&gt;Thanks for making these changes Felix. I have made minor alterations as shown below (partly as we have now had another peer review come in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selection of studies:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There are two main reasons for choosing a time limit of 72 hours. Firstly, any success with home support can solely be ascribed to this intervention as distinct from in-hospital care. Secondly, extending the time limit beyond 72 hours may cause trialists to discharge patients to the home support group after a short period as inpatients (e.g. admissions other than for medical intervention).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have removed this section as one of the peer reviewers commented that they did not understand it and I do not think it adds anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Following this the bibliography of each RCT was searched for additional papers that might contain further RCTs. Authors of identified RCTs were written to, asking for other published and unpublished studies. Known trialists in the field were also contacted for any unpublished or ongoing trials. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have amended the above as 2 of the peer reviewers commented that they were not contacted by you. I assume that you wrote to them and did not get a reply? Is this correct? Change made to para below is similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methodological Quality:&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All except three studies (Hernandez 2003; Nicholson 2001; Shepperd 1998a) adequately reported withdrawals and dropouts. All included studies were of high methodological quality, therefore it is unlikely that study quality would influence heterogeneity tests or the overall results. The authors of all included studies were written to, asking for additional information or verification of study quality and to obtain further data. To date two authors(Nicholson 2001;Shepperd 1998a) have responded.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Description of studies:&lt;br&gt;Peer reviewer suggested minor rewording of number of patients eligible and then recruited. I have changed this to make it clearer. (x patients were eligible for inclusion).&lt;br&gt;Results&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One study that reported median days of readmission (Shepperd 1998a) showed that at 3 month follow-up readmissions tended to be of longer duration in the hospital at home group than in the hospital in-patient group (5 and 0, p=0.08, respectively). &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One study (Shepperd 1998a) reported significantly higher median cost with hospital at home schemes compared to in-patient care (&amp;#163;2,379 and &amp;#163;1,247 respectively). This study (Shepperd 1998a) also reported higher median readmission duration with hospital at home scheme (5 days versus 0), which would contribute substantially to the total cost of hospital at home care group.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have changed the above as it was the median duration of readmission that was longer for H@H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you check that you are happy with the above and then this can go forward for submission this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;26 August 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Chris ,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for making these minor alterations as mentioned above. I am happy with these changes and for the review to go forward for submission later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix&lt;br&gt;Old title: =Hospital at home for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-04-12 07:29:09 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Kjetil Brurberg" REVIEW_NO="ACU-COP" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.1.6" REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="8.6">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-17 16:05:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People recovering from an exacerbation of COPD have traditionally done so in hospital. We wanted to find out if peoples' recovery could be aided by treating them at home. So called "hospital at home" support is where a person is sent home and looked after by a specialist respiratory nurse under the guidance of a hospital medical team. People receive regular scheduled visits from the nurse as well as additional visits as requested by the patient and these visits continue until the person has made a full recovery and is discharged from care.<BR/>
<BR/>We found eight trials on 870 people comparing hospital at home with  hospital care. The results from these trials show that fewer people are readmitted to hospital if they received their care at home. There was no significant difference in quality of life, although patients and carers said they preferred treatment at home. There was no significant difference in the number of deaths. These results are only applicable to a subgroup of patients who could be treated at home, but for a majority of the patients with acute COPD exacerbations, "hospital at home" schemes are probably not an suitable option.</P>

<P>Eight trials with 870 patients were included in the review and showed a significant reduction in readmission rates for hospital at home compared with hospital inpatient care of acute exacerbations of COPD (risk ratio (RR)0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). Moreover, we observed a trend towards lower mortality in the hospital at home group, but the pooled effect estimate did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07).

<P>Selected patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely and successfully treated at home with support from respiratory nurses. We found evidence of moderate quality that hospital at home may be advantageous with respect to readmission rates in these patients.

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-22 23:02:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julia A.E. Walters">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-03-19 16:22:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to a group of closely related diseases recognised by irreversibly impaired lung function and airflow obstructions. COPD is usually progressive in the long term, but many COPD patients also experience acute exacerbations. Exacerbations of COPD are the most common cause of admission to hospital due to respiratory illness and account for a large percentage of all acute medical admissions in the UK with increasing pressure of demands on hospital beds especially during winter months (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2006</LINK>). The annual cost of COPD to the UK National Health Service in 2000/2001 was estimated to £982 million and the average cost per patient per year was £819 of which 54.3 % was due to inpatient hospitalisation, 18.6 % for treatment and 16.4% for GP and specialist visits (<LINK REF="REF-Britton-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britton 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mortality from acute COPD exacerbations is closely related to the degree of hypercapnia and acidosis at admission, and to the presence of co-morbidities (<LINK REF="REF-Connors-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connors 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jeffrey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jeffrey 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seneff-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seneff 1995</LINK>). Many patients presently admitted to hospital do not have these features and it may be possible to manage them equally well with sufficient support outside the hospital environment (i.e. hospital at home care), either to shorten hospital stays or to avoid hospital admittance. To shorten hospital stays patients can be discharged early from hospital to receive hospital at home care (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2009</LINK>). Alternatively, patients can be treated in hospital at home without prior hospital admittance.</P>
<P>If hospital at home services are available, patients who would usually be managed in hospital have most of their care undertaken by a specialist, typically a respiratory nurse, who makes regular visits to the patient's home and offers telephone support. The rationale is that such services increase patient satisfaction (quality of life) and reduce the costs, without adverse effects on clinical outcomes. A recent review suggests that hospital at home does not lead to adverse effects on outcomes compared with inpatient hospital care (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2008</LINK>). This review covered a wide range of medical conditions, whereas the present review examines the effect of hospital at home services for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.</P>

<P>We assessed the risk of bias for all included studies using the five criteria recommended in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. For each of the items 'sequence generation', 'allocation concealment', 'blinding of patients', 'blinding of carers and assessors', 'incomplete outcome data', 'selective reporting', and 'other bias', we scored the risk of bias to be low, high or unclear. The 'Risk of bias' assessments were done at the outcome level, implying that the risk of bias may vary between different outcomes in the same study. All 'Risk of bias' assessments were performed independently by at least two review authors (EJ, KGB and GEV). We discussed our judgements and tried to reach consensus. A third review author (GEV) was involved in resolving any persisting disagreements. If the published material did not include the details needed to assess the risk of bias, we tried to obtain additional information by contacting the study authors.</P>

<P>For dichotomous data, we calculated pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), where appropriate. For similar comparisons and continuous outcome measures, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI with a random-effects model. If similar but not identical scales were used to measure an outcome parameter (e.g. FEV1 measured as per cent predicted versus FEV1 measured in mL), we pooled the data by calculating standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI. Standardised mean differences are unit-less measures that are not easy to interpret in a clinical context. We used a random-effects model for pooling data from multiple studies.</P>

<P>We synthesised data following the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), including the use of GRADE to prepare a 'Summary of findings' table for the following outcomes: hospital inpatients' readmissions, mortality, lung function (FEV1), satisfaction with care, health-related quality of life, and direct costs. GRADE defines the quality of a body of evidence as the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is close to the quantity of specific interest. Quality of a body of evidence involves consideration of within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and risk of publication bias,<I> </I>strong associations, dose-response, and plausible confounding. The GRADE system entails an assessment of the<I> </I>quality of a body of evidence for each individual outcome. In the &#8216;Summary of findings&#8217; table we provide key information concerning the quality of evidence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on all important outcomes in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>The electronic searches yielded a total of 2,487 unique references.

The eight trials originated from Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and the UK (four trials). All trials included patients who presented at emergency rooms with acute exacerbation of COPD. Discharge from hospital and subsequent readmission to &#8220;hospital at home&#8221; was accomplished within 72 hours following the initial hospital admission.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Inpatient hospital readmission rate (after discharge from inpatient or home care)</HEADING>
<P>All eight included studies reported hospital readmission data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). A total of 870 participants contributed data towards this outcome and showed a small but significant reduction in hospital readmission in favour of hospital at home (risk ratio (RR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI)0.59 to 0.99; P = 0.04; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding the study associated with a high risk of bias <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2001</LINK>, resulting in a larger effect estimate and narrower confidence interval (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91; P = 0.006). The statistical test for heterogeneity did not show statistical significance in any of the cases (P = 0.15 and P = 0.30, respectively), but the I<SUP>2</SUP> was reduced from 34% to 16% when <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2001</LINK> was excluded. Taken together, we are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true risk ratio is likely to be close to 0.76, but because the confidence interval ranges from a large positive effect to no important difference, there is a possibility that the true effect is substantially different (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mortality</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies with 845 participants reported mortality data (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). No significant difference was found in mortality rates when the two study arms were compared, but the confidence interval for the reduction in mortality included the possibility of a 60% relative reduction up to a 4% relative increase in the risk of mortality among participants in the hospital at home group (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.04; P = 0.07; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). No unexplained heterogeneity was observed (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%), and all studies reporting mortality were associated with low risk of bias for this outcome. Again, we are moderately confident that the true risk ratio is close to 0.65, but as reflected by the confidence interval, there is a possibility that the true effect is substantially different (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

All studies reported changes in FEV<SUB>1</SUB> on different measurement scales, and we decided to pool the results in a meta-analysis by the use of standardised methods (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The pooled effect estimate showed no statistically significant difference between hospital at home and inpatients in FEV1 (SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.36; P = 0.28) with I<SUP>2</SUP> estimated at 25%. Our GRADE assessment suggest that this effect estimate is based on low quality evidence, implying that the true effect may be substantially different 0.13. Our limited confidence in the effect estimate is primarily caused by the wide confidence interval and a concern that the lack of blinding may have influenced the measured effect (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).Two studies <LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK> reported FVC, but no difference was found between the treatment groups (MD 0.14L; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.33; P = 0,13, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK>) reported FEV<SUB>1</SUB>/FVC ratio which also failed to differ between the two study groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Health-related quality of life scores</HEADING>
<P>Three studies on 432 people reported health-related quality of life scores for 332 patients using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK> reported percentage improvement in SGRQ (discharge score - initial admission score) in 60 participants (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK> reported absolute mean change in SGRQ (discharge score - initial admission score), but could not be included in meta-analysis because standard deviations (SD) were not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2000</LINK> reported absolute mean change in SGRQ (discharge score - initial admission score), but only provided SGRQ scores in a subgroup of 50 participants. This can introduce bias into the overall combined result, and we decided not to combine the results in meta-analysis. Taken together, we have very limited evidence with regard to the association between hospital at home and health-related quality of life (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Satisfaction with care</HEADING>
<P>Two studies reported data on patient's satisfaction with care that could be combined in meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricauda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ricauda 2008</LINK>). In both trials, satisfaction was measured by completing a questionnaire where patients or carers were asked to categorise their satisfaction (e.g. "excellent", "very good", "poor", or "unsatisfactory"). Most people seem to be satisfied with the treatment irrespective of treatment site, and no statistically significant difference in the number of people more than average satisfied with their treatment was observed (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.17; P = 0.26, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). However, our confidence in this effect estimate is limited, in particular because the effect estimate is based on a small number of participants (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK>) reported carer satisfaction for 34 carers reporting no difference between hospital at home and inpatient strategies (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; P = 0.77, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Again, our confidence in the effect estimated is limited because it is based on a single study with relatively few participants (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Another included study (<LINK REF="STD-Skwarska-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Skwarska 2000</LINK>) also administered a satisfaction questionnaire with 95% of respondents reporting complete satisfaction with hospital at home service. Unfortunately, the authors in this study did not ascertain the degree of satisfaction of those participants randomised to inpatient care, nor did they document the views of the carers.</P>
<P>One study reported retrospective preference for the type of care by both participants and carers at the end of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK>). Patients who were treated at home and their carers had higher preference for hospital at home care than those who had received inpatient care (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.24; P = 0,003) and (RR 1.98; 95% CI 1.05 to 3.73; P = 0.03), respectively (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Direct economic costs</HEADING>
<P>Three studies with 339 randomised participants included mean cost analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricauda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ricauda 2008</LINK>). The three studies report direct costs associated with supplying the care and do not account for possible saving related to prevention of exacerbations, reduction in absence from work, improved QoL etc<I>. </I>We considered it inappropriate to combine the results in a meta-analysis, but we presented them next to each other in a forest plot (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). Two studies conducted in Spain and Australia reported a significant reduction in direct costs for hospital at home (<LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK>). The last study showed a trend towards lower cost for hospital at home, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.38). The direction of effect  in the three studies favoured  reduction for hospital at home , however it is likely that the true effect size will vary substantially between different countries and various conditions. and consequently, we consider the existing evidence to be of very low quality for this outcome (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-20 09:22:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Traditionally, patients with acute COPD exacerbations have been admitted to hospital, but in this review we have demonstrated that treatment in hospital at home schemes may be a safe alternative for some of these patients. Home hospital did not seem to increase mortality, and for readmission rates there was even a little improvement in favour of hospital at home. This suggests that selected patients presenting at hospital emergency departments with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely and successfully treated at home if they receive appropriate support and follow-up from qualified health personnel. Although results are heterogeneous, three studies reports cost analysis in a usable format (<LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nicholson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nicholson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricauda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ricauda 2008</LINK>). Available data from individual studies suggest hospital at home schemes may be associated with cost savings in comparison to inpatient care, but current evidence is found to be of very low quality. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Ojoo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ojoo 2002</LINK>) contributed data on patient and carer satisfaction, but confirmatory studies are needed before making firm conclusions. Limited data are available for lung function measures and quality of life, and therefore, no firm conclusion could be derived regarding these outcomes.</P>
<P>It is important to emphasize that only ~25 % of the patients were found appropriate for treatment in hospital at home in the studies included in this review. A large fraction of the patients with COPD exacerbations were not eligible for treatment in home hospital due to poor lung function, severe co-morbidities (e.g. heart disease), or other factors such as confusion.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-03-22 23:02:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Julia A.E. Walters">
<P>We have included studies from different countries, and due to the world wide variability of healthcare systems, the applicability of the presented results may be context dependent. It is important to emphasise that most of COPD admissions do not occur as a result of severe exacerbations, but rather as a consequence of co-morbidities or social circumstances (e.g. frail partner, patient living alone and unable to cope, respite for partner or carer, social isolation, low social class with no food or heating) (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 2006</LINK>). Even though hospital at home will only be suitable for a minority of the patients with COPD exacerbations, its utilization may reduce the financial burden with regard to direct costs and increased availability of hospital beds. More importantly, however, hospital at home may also offer patient and their care givers a choice.</P>
<P>Further studies are required to address the potential financial saving and the number of hospital bed days saved. Such studies should incorporate the "real" and overall cost of running such services so that comparisons with hospital inpatient care can be justified. As our experience and confidence with hospital at home schemes grows, and as multidisciplinary organisations begin to work in unison, we will be better able to discharge patients earlier with nursing and other relevant healthcare support. It is also important that more strategies are developed to prevent exacerbations from happening in the first instance, and to increase the patient's awareness of their deterioration at an earlier stage.</P>
<P>We encountered some challenges during the preparation of this review. First, the hospital at home schemes used in different primary studies differ considerably with regard to the organisation of health professionals and follow-up visits. Second, there are differences in the patient recruitment strategies. In some studies the patients were randomised and enrolled without prior admission whereas other studies admitted all patients presenting at casualty and randomised them into hospital at home or inpatient groups within 72 hours. Third, there is a lack of data on some important outcomes such as information on the speed of recovery of exacerbations. Further research is required to define the optimal level and organisation of home support.<BR/>

<P>Shepperd and co-workers have previously published systematic reviews on the effectiveness of hospital at home (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2008</LINK>) and early discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2009</LINK>). In their hospital at home review, Shepperd et al. found a non significant reduction in mortality at three months for the admission avoidance hospital at home group, but the authors also observed a non significant increase in admissions among the patients allocated to hospital at home (<LINK REF="REF-Shepperd-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shepperd 2008</LINK>). With respect to the effectiveness of early discharge, the authors conclude that the objective evidence of economic benefit or improved health outcomes is insufficient. To some extent, the results reported by Shepperd et al. contrast the results of the current review, but this difference may be explained by the fact that only patients with acute COPD exacerbations were included in the present review whereas Shepperd includes patients with a wide range of conditions, and by the fact that the primary studies included in the present review are different from that reported by Shepperd (e.g. the recent studies <LINK REF="STD-Nissen-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nissen 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ricauda-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ricauda 2008</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-03-19 17:04:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma Jackson">
<P>Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in hospital at home may lead to fewer readmissions in comparison with conventional hospital treatment (moderate quality evidence). Moreover, hospital at home schemes for treatment of acute exacerbation of COPD demonstrate a statistically insignificant trend towards reduced mortality over two to six months when compared with conventional treatment in hospital (moderate quality evidence). There is no evidence to suggest that patient or relative satisfaction is altered by either method of care. There were no significant differences in health-related quality of life, lung function (FEV1) or direct costs although we were unable to pool this latter outcome due to heterogeneity in the country, but this evidence was found to be of low or very low quality. More studies are required to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment in the home hospital for selected patients with acute exacerbation of COPD.</P>
<P>Although this review has shown that treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in a hospital at home scheme is safe, acceptable and as effective as inpatient care, it is clear that the majority of patients cannot be managed in this way and many will continue to need hospital treatment for their exacerbation.</P>
<P>This review provides valuable data to drive change. It has shown that hospital at home services can be safely used to care for properly selected patients with acute exacerbations of COPD who would otherwise be admitted to hospital. The conclusions in this review are based on studies that assessed participants suitability for a hospital at home scheme at enrolment. Patients with COPD exacerbations applying to clinical practice should undergo an initial hospital assessment (e.g. radiography, blood gas analysis, clinical assessment, etc.) in order to assess suitability for a hospital at home when presenting to the emergency department.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-02-27 17:35:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of this review are promising, but further well conducted trials are required in this area. Future studies should include and report more relevant outcomes including patient and carer satisfaction, patient preference, speed of recovery, and health-related quality of life.</P>
<P>There is a lack of evidence in regards to cost-effectiveness. Future trials should incorporate an economic evaluation of both indirect and direct costs, which describe the resources required to establish hospital at home services, the cost savings from early discharge and decreased hospital admissions.</P>
<P>Future hospital at home schemes need to determine which models of care are appropriate in particular patient groups. These schemes also need to consider which medical professionals are most appropriate to deliver this care safely and effectively.  </P>

<P>30 patients underwent early discharge. Patients were monitored daily by the nurses who also carried out patient and carer education and reassurance. Nurses filled in daily progress and symptom score charts for patients in both study arms. Assessment involved vital signs, spirometry, oxygen saturation and supplemental oxygen and nebuliser usage. All patients were discharged with nebulised or inhaled bronchodilators, oral and inhaled steroids, antibiotics and oxygen as necessary. The GPs were aware but were not involved with the early discharge patients.</P>
<P>50 inpatients received in-hospital care according to BTS guidelines for the management of acute exacerbations of COPD.</P>
<P>Nurses monitored the patients daily.</P>
<P>Two weeks after discharge an independent person administered a satisfaction questionnaire to both the patient and the carer. Evening and night cover was provided by a direct line to the Medical Chest Unit.</P>

<B>Location</B>: Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.</P>
<P>
<B>Recruitment</B>: A team of nursing and medical staff was created known as the ARAS (acute respiratory assessment service) who screened all acute COPD presentations on weekdays from 09.00 hrs to 17.00 hrs and patients presenting overnight were assessed at 09.00 hrs the following morning.</P>

Four patients were withdrawn from the early discharge group after randomisation due to the recognition of some other medical problem. In retrospect, in three of the four cases this problem could have been recognised on admission resulting in exclusion from the study. In one case pulmonary embolism occurred the day after admission and the patient was withdrawn from the study and anticoagulated. This patient, the one death in the early discharge group, died suddenly at home several weeks after discharge. Thirty six patients underwent nurse supported early discharge".</P>

<I>[The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Records are coded by condition, e.g COPD. Therefore searches are limited to the relevant condition.]</I>
