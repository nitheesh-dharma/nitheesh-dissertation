<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-05 15:05:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prolapsed lumbar discs ('slipped disc', 'herniated disc') account for less than five percent of all low-back problems, but are the most common cause of nerve root pain ('sciatica'). Ninety percent of acute attacks of sciatica settle with non-surgical management. Surgical options are usually considered for more rapid relief in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow.</P>
<P>This updated review considers the relative merits of different forms of surgical treatments by collating the evidence from 40 randomized trials and two quasi-randomized controlled trials (5197 participants) on:<BR/>(i) Discectomy - surgical removal of part of the disc<BR/>(ii) Microdiscectomy - use of magnification to view the disc and nerves during surgery<BR/>(iii) Chemonucleolysis - injection of an enzyme into a bulging spinal disc in an effort to reduce the size of the disc</P>
<P>Despite the critical importance of knowing whether surgery is beneficial, only three trials directly compared discectomy with non-surgical approaches. These provide suggestive rather than conclusive results. Overall, surgical discectomy for carefully selected patients with sciatica due to a prolapsed lumbar disc appears to provide faster relief from the acute attack than non-surgical management. However, any positive or negative effects on the lifetime natural history of the underlying disc disease are unclear. Microdiscectomy gives broadly comparable results to standard discectomy. There is insufficient evidence on other surgical techniques to draw firm conclusions.</P>
<P>Trials showed that discectomy produced better outcomes than chemonucleolysis, which in turn was better than placebo. For various reasons including concerns about safety, chemonucleolysis is not commonly used today to treat prolapsed disc.</P>
<P>Many trials provided limited information on complications, but generally included recurrence of symptoms, need for additional surgery and allergic reactions (chemonucleolysis).</P>
<P>Many of the trials had major design weaknesses that introduced considerable potential for bias. Therefore, the conclusions of this review should be read with caution.</P>
<P>Future trials should be designed to reduce potential bias. Future research should explore the optimal timing of surgery, patient-centred outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness of treatment options, and longer-term results over a lifetime perspective.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Disc prolapse accounts for five percent of low-back disorders but is one of the most common reasons for surgery.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of surgical interventions for the treatment of lumbar disc prolapse.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Spine and abstracts of the main spine society meetings within the last five years. We also checked the reference lists of each retrieved articles and corresponded with experts. All data found up to 1 January 2007 are included.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized trials (RCT) and quasi-randomized trials (QRCT) of the surgical management of lumbar disc prolapse.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data from published papers. Additional information was sought from the authors if necessary.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Forty RCTs and two QRCTs were identified, including 17 new trials since the first edition of this review in 1999. Many of the early trials were of some form of chemonucleolysis, whereas the majority of the later studies either compared different techniques of discectomy or the use of some form of membrane to reduce epidural scarring. </P>
<P>Despite the critical importance of knowing whether surgery is beneficial for disc prolapse, only four trials have directly compared discectomy with conservative management and these give suggestive rather than conclusive results. However, other trials show that discectomy produces better clinical outcomes than chemonucleolysis and that in turn is better than placebo. Microdiscectomy gives broadly comparable results to standard discectomy. Recent trials of an inter-position gel covering the dura (five trials) and of fat (four trials) show that they can reduce scar formation, though there is limited evidence about the effect on clinical outcomes. There is insufficient evidence on other percutaneous discectomy techniques to draw firm conclusions. Three small RCTs of laser discectomy do not provide conclusive evidence on its efficacy, There are no published RCTs of coblation therapy or trans-foraminal endoscopic discectomy.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Surgical discectomy for carefully selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapse provides faster relief from the acute attack than conservative management, although any positive or negative effects on the lifetime natural history of the underlying disc disease are still unclear. Microdiscectomy gives broadly comparable results to open discectomy. The evidence on other minimally invasive techniques remains unclear (with the exception of chemonucleolysis using chymopapain, which is no longer widely available).</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-05 15:14:23 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Lumbar disc prolapse ('slipped disc') accounts for less than five percent of all low-back problems, but is the most common cause of nerve root pain ('sciatica'). Ninety percent of acute attacks of sciatica settle with conservative management. Absolute indications for surgery include altered bladder function and progressive muscle weakness, but these are rare. The usual indication for surgery is to provide more rapid relief of pain and disability in the minority of patients whose recovery is unacceptably slow. </P>
<P>The primary rationale of any form of surgery for disc prolapse is to relieve nerve root irritation or compression due to herniated disc material, but the results should be balanced against the likely natural history. Surgical planning should also take account of the anatomical characteristics of the spine and any prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Carlisle-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlisle 2005</LINK>), the patient's constitutional make-up and equipment availability. Of the techniques available, open discectomy, performed with (micro-), or without the use of an operating microscope, is the most common, but there are now a number of other less invasive surgical techniques. Ideally, it would be important to define the optimal type of treatment for specific types of prolapse (<LINK REF="REF-Carragee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carragee 2003</LINK>). For example, different surgical procedures may be appropriate if disc material is sequestrated rather than contained by the outer layers of the annulus fibrosus and the choice of treatment should reflect these. </P>
<P>Many of the early trials relate to the use of chemonucleolysis (dissolution of the nucleus by enzyme injection) using chymopapain. Chemonucleolysis became popular in the 1970s after its introduction as a therapy for a contained lumbar disc prolapse, i.e. without fragment sequestration into the spinal canal (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1964</LINK>). Concerns about its safety and controversy about its effectiveness led to it being withdrawn for a while by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but it was re-released in 1982. Its use is currently in decline, so this is an appropriate time to synthesise the evidence on its effectiveness. </P>
<P>There are several non-systematic reviews that consider the relative merits of microdiscectomy, automated percutaneous discectomy and various types of arthroscopic microdiscectomy. In all these treatments, smaller wounds are said to promote faster patient recovery with earlier hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Kahanovich-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahanovich 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onik-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onik 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kambin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kambin 2003</LINK>) but the question remains whether that is actually associated with improved clinical outcomes. RCTs are required to provide Level 1 evidence of treatment efficacy. Moreover, treatment may prove to be of marginal benefit yet expensive and hence not cost effective. It is particularly important that the safety, efficacy and cost benefits of all new innovative procedures should be compared with currently accepted forms of treatment.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>We aimed to test the following null hypotheses. In the treatment of lumbar inter-vertebral disc prolapse, there is no difference in effectiveness or incidence of adverse complications between: <BR/>(i) any form of discectomy and conservative management <BR/>(ii) microdiscectomy and open 'standard' discectomy<BR/>(iii) forms of minimally invasive therapy including automated percutaneous discectomy, laser discectomy, percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, trans-foraminal endoscopic discectomy and microdiscectomy<BR/>(iv) chemonucleolysis and placebo injection<BR/>(v) chemonucleolysis and discectomy<BR/>(vi) discectomy with and without materials designed to prevent post-operative scar formation</P>

<P>Relevant published data from randomized controlled trials in any language, up to 1 January 2007 were identified by the following search strategies:</P>
<P>(i) Computer aided searching of MEDLINE (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>) with specific search terms (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) and PUBMED (www.ncbi.nlm.nih,.gov/).<BR/>(ii) Personal bibliographies.<BR/>(iii) Hand searching of Spine and meeting abstracts of most major spinal societies from 1985.<BR/>(iv) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.<BR/>(v) Communication with members of the Cochrane Back Review Group and other international experts.<BR/>(vi) Citation tracking from all papers identified by the above strategies.</P>
<P>The International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register and Clinical Trials Register were searched from their beginning to September 20, 2006 to identify ongoing studies (http://www.controlled-trials.com/; clinicaltrials.gov).</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Eligible trials were entered into RevMan 4.2 and sorted on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For each included trial, assessment of methodological quality and data extraction were carried out as detailed below. </P>
<P>1. Two review authors (JNAG, GW) selected the trials to be included in the review. Disagreement was resolved by discussion, followed if necessary by further discussion with an independent colleague.</P>
<P>2. The methodological quality was assessed and internal validity scored by the review authors, assessing risk of pre-allocation disclosure of assignment, intention-to-treat analysis, and blinding of outcome assessors (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). The quality of concealment allocation was rated in three grades: A: Clearly yes - some form of centralized randomization scheme or assignment system; B: Unclear - assignment envelopes, a "list" or "table", evidence of possible randomization failure such as markedly unequal control and trial groups, or trials stated to be random but with no description; C: Clearly no - alternation, case numbers, dates of birth, or any other such approach, allocation procedures which were transparent before assignment. Withdrawal, blinding of patients and observers, and intention-to-treat analyses were assessed according to standard Cochrane methodology and tabulated in the results tables.</P>
<P>The nature, accuracy, precision, observer variation and timing of the outcome measures were tabulated. Initially any outcomes specified were noted. The data were then collated and the most frequently reported outcome measures (in five or more studies) used for meta-analysis. In fact, only three outcomes were consistently reported: the patient's rating of success, a surgeon's rating of success and the need for a second procedure (treatment failure). To pool the results, ratings of excellent, good and fair were classified as 'success' and poor, unimproved and worse as 'failure'. The pooled data are given in the analysis table. </P>
<P>3. For each study, Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence limits (95% CI) were calculated. Results from clinically comparable trials were pooled using random effects models for dichotomous outcomes. It should be noted that in several instances the test for heterogeneity was significant, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of the pooling. Nevertheless, there is considerable clinical justification for pooling the trials in this way and in view of the clinical interest, these results are presented as the best available information at present, with the qualification that there may be statistical weaknesses to the results.</P>

<RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 15:07:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Forty-two studies have been included in this review as detailed below. Details of individual trials are presented in the Characteristics of Included Studies table.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Many of the trials, particularly of surgery, had major design weaknesses. Some of the trials were of a very small number of patients. Methods and published details of randomization were often poor and there was lack of concealment of randomization. Because of the nature of surgical interventions, double blinding was not possible. Blinded assessment of outcome was generally feasible yet often not even attempted. There were few proper clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Deyo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deyo 1998</LINK>), and the most common surgical outcomes were crude ratings by patients or surgeons. Some of the assessments were by the operating surgeon, or by a resident or fellow beholden to the primary investigator. Although 35 of the trials had follow-up rates of at least 90%, there was often considerable early code break or crossover of patients which was not always properly allowed for in the analysis or presentation of results. Only ten of the 42 trials presented two-year follow-up results as recommended for surgical studies, although two of these trials also presented 10-year results. </P>
<P>These defects of trial design introduced considerable potential for bias. Most of the conclusions of this review are based upon six to twelve-month outcomes and there is a general lack of information on longer-term outcomes.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-05 15:07:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Forty RCTs and two QRCTs are included in this updated review. This an increase of 15 reports over the first edition of the review (1998), but 17 new papers are actually included, as two were deleted from the original set (<LINK REF="STD-North-1995" TYPE="STUDY">North 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Petrie-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petrie 1996</LINK>) due to a lack of publication of substantive results within a five-year period. One additional new abstract was excluded for the same reason (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1999</LINK>). Sixteen of the original trials were found on MEDLINE, five by searching on-line OVID and the final six by handsearching conference proceedings and personal bibliographies and correspondence with experts. The new trials were mainly collected by the authors from personal literature review or after notification by colleagues from the Cochrane Back Review Group. Nine additional trials are currently labelled 'ongoing' as insufficient data are available to allow critical analysis.</P>
<P>It was not possible to analyse patients according to duration of their symptoms, previous conservative treatment, type of disc prolapse, or indications for surgery, as few of the trials provided these data in usable form. Many trials provided limited information on selected complications, but these were not comparable between trials. Moreover, relatively small RCTs do not have sufficient statistical power to produce any meaningful conclusions about complications of low incidence. That requires a completely different kind of database, which is much larger and more representative of routine clinical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies attempted to estimate costs (<LINK REF="STD-Lavignolle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lavignolle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muralikuttan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muralikuttan 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1999</LINK>) and three of these estimated cost-effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malter 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1999</LINK>), although their methodology has been criticised (<LINK REF="REF-Goosens-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goosens 1998</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">a) Discectomy</HEADING>
<P>There are now four trials included in the review comparing surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse with some form of natural history, conservative treatment, or placebo but one of these is still only published as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 2003</LINK>). In the first trial, Weber (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1983</LINK>) compared long-term outcomes of treatment by discectomy versus initial conservative management followed by surgery if conservative therapy failed. The trial was not blinded and 26% of the 'conservative' group actually came to surgery, i.e. crossed-over, though there was an intention-to-treat analysis. Both patient and observer ratings showed that discectomy was significantly better than 'conservative therapy' at one year, but there were no significant differences in outcomes at four and ten years. Regardless of treatment, impaired motor function had a good prognosis, whereas sensory deficits remained in almost one-half of the patients. Malter (<LINK REF="REF-Malter-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malter 1996</LINK>) re-analysed Weber's data and suggested that discectomy was highly cost-effective, at approximately $29,000 per QALY gained.</P>
<P>In November 2006, the multi-center US Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial was published (<LINK REF="STD-Weinstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstein 2006</LINK>). This trial compared standard open discectomy with nonoperative treatment individualized to the patient. Primary outcomes were changes from baseline in the 36-item Short-Form bodily pain and physical function scales and modified Oswestry Disability Index. The major limitation of the trial was lack of adherence to assigned treatment and the amount of cross-over: only 50% of patients assigned to surgery actually received surgery and 30% of those assigned to non-operative treatment received surgery within three months of enrolment. Both surgically and conservatively treated groups improved substantially on all outcomes over two years follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that the results tended to favour surgery, but the treatment effects on the primary outcomes were small and not statistically significant. In contrast, as-treated analysis based on treatment received showed strong, statistically significant advantages for surgery on all outcomes at all follow-up times. The amount of cross-over makes it likely that the intention-to-treat analysis underestimates the true effect of surgery; but the resulting confounding also makes it impossible to draw any firm conclusions about the efficacy of surgery. Greenfield (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 2003</LINK>) also compared microdiscectomy with a low-tech physical therapy regime and educational approach . Although at twelve and eighteen months there were statistically significant differences in pain and disability favouring the surgical group, by 24 months this was no longer the case. It should be noted that the patients studied had all presented with low-back pain and sciatica and were selected to include those with a small or moderate disc prolapse only.</P>
<P>Butterman (<LINK REF="STD-Butterman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Butterman 2004</LINK>) compared results following microdiscectomy with those after an epidural steroid injection. Although the authors considered that the control arm was microdiscectomy it is probably more useful to consider this as the intervention. Patients undergoing discectomy had the most rapid decrease in their symptoms. Twenty-seven of 50 patients receiving a steroid injection had a subsequent microdiscectomy. Outcomes in this cross-over group did not appear to have been adversely affected by the delay in surgery. The patients who had a successful epidural steroid injection were twice as likely to have an extruded or sequestered disc as those in whom the injection failed. Very limited data are available from a trial comparing microdiscectomy plus isometric muscle training with plain muscle training (<LINK REF="STD-Osterman-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Osterman 2003</LINK>) and this trial is labelled 'ongoing'.</P>
<P>Nine of the forty-two trials were of different forms or techniques of surgical discectomy. Three trials compared microdiscectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Tullberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Tullberg 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagarrigue-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lagarrigue 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Henriksen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Henriksen 1996</LINK>) and one micro-endoscopic discectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>) with standard discectomy. Use of the microscope lengthened the operative procedure, but did not appear to make any significant difference to peri-operative bleeding or other complications, length of in-patient stay, or the formation of scar tissue. Clinical outcome data were not comparable and could not be pooled. The place for micro-endoscopic discectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>) is uncertain as the number of patients studied (22) was too small to draw any clear conclusions. Data from a further trial by Hermantin (<LINK REF="STD-Hermantin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hermantin 1999</LINK>) and from a now excluded trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1999</LINK>) suggest that video arthroscopy may be worth further study. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Thome-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Thome 2005</LINK>) compared early outcomes and recurrence rates after sequestrectomy and microdiscectomy. There was a trend toward better outcome and a lesser rate of secondary surgery after sequestrectomy alone, than after removal of the herniated material and resection of disc tissue from the intervertebral space.</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Revel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Krugluger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Krugluger 2000</LINK>) compared automated percutaneous discectomy (APD) with chymopapain and two compared it with microdiscectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Chatterjee-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chatterjee 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haines-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Haines 2002</LINK>). Results from these trials suggest that APD produces inferior results to either more established procedure. However, we do note that Onik (<LINK REF="REF-Onik-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onik 1990</LINK>), the original proponent of APD, suggested that the therapy was only suitable for small-sized herniations, strictly localized in front of the intervertebral space and without a tear of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Ideally, the disc herniation should not occupy more than 30% of the spinal canal. This figure was clearly exceeded in Revel's series (<LINK REF="STD-Revel-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Revel 1993</LINK>) in which the disc herniation size was 25 to 50% in 59% of the APD and 63% of the chemonucleolysis patients. A fifth trial compared percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (cannula inserted into the central disc) with microdiscectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Mayer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mayer 1993</LINK>). This trial showed comparable clinical outcomes after the two procedures but the study group of 40 patients was small. No trial looked specifically at transforaminal endoscopic discectomy or foraminotomy.</P>
<P>There are now two included trials of laser discectomy. In their QRCT, Paul and Hellinger (<LINK REF="STD-Paul-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paul 2000</LINK>) compared the effects of a Nd-YAG-laser (1064 nm) with that of a diode laser (940 nm). Both produced only slight vaporisation but excellent shrinkage of disc tissue. However, no comparative outcome results were published. Steffen and Wittenberg (<LINK REF="STD-Steffen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Steffen 1996</LINK>) published three abstracts detailing results from a comparative study of chemonucleolysis and laser discectomy. The limited results favoured chemonucleolysis. In a third trial, no significant difference was demonstrated between outcomes following laser use and that obtained after an epidural injection (<LINK REF="STD-Livesey-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Livesey 2000</LINK>) but the trial was aborted before its conclusion and therefore 'excluded'. Statistical pooling was not possible due to the clinical heterogeneity of the trials and there were insufficient data to calculate effect size.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">b) Chemonucleolysis</HEADING>
<P>Seventeen of the forty-two trials were of some form of chemonucleolysis. Use of chymopapain is now rare, so this may turn out to be a final summary of the historical evidence on chemonucleolysis.</P>
<P>Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Schwetschenau-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Schwetschenau 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Javid-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Javid 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feldman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Feldman 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dabezies-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Dabezies 1988</LINK>) compared the efficacy of chemonucleolysis using chymopapain versus placebo. These trials had the highest quality scores in this review, with generally adequate randomization, double-blinding, and independent outcome assessment. In all the trials, chymopapain was injected by standard technique. The combined results from the five trials compared data from 446 patients with an average follow up of 97%, and are summarised in the analysis tables. The meta-analysis clearly showed that chymopapain was more effective than placebo whether rated by the patients (random effects model OR 0.24; 95%CI 0.12 to 0.49; Graph 01.03), or rated by surgeons conducting the study or an independent observer (random OR 0.40; 95%CI 0.21 to 0.75; Graph 01.14). Fewer patients after chymopapain injection proceeded to open discectomy (random OR 0.41; 95%CI 0.25 to 0.68; Graph 01.16).</P>
<P>Another five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ejeskar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ejeskar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Crawshaw-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Crawshaw 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavignolle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lavignolle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alphen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">van Alphen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muralikuttan-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Muralikuttan 1992</LINK>), one of which was a QRCT (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alphen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">van Alphen 1989</LINK>), compared chemonucleolysis using chymopapain and surgical discectomy. In each instance, a set dose of chymopapain was injected by standard technique, and compared with standard discectomy. In all the trials there was a poor description of the method of randomization and the nature of these studies precluded blinding of the patients. The combined results from the five trials compared data from 680 patients with an average follow up of 97%, and are summarised in the analysis tables. Note that the test for homogeneity was significant in this group of trials. Nevertheless, there is strong clinical rationale for pooling this group of trials and in view of the clinical importance of the issue these results are presented as the best available information at present, with the qualification that there may be statistical weaknesses to the results. All of the analyses showed consistently poorer results with chemonucleolysis, though this did not reach statistical significance in the random effects model. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ejeskar-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ejeskar 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alphen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">van Alphen 1989</LINK>) showed a worse result at one year as rated by the patients (random OR 0.61; 95%CI 0.30 to 1.24; Graph 02.01). Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Crawshaw-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Crawshaw 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lavignolle-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lavignolle 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alphen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">van Alphen 1989</LINK>) showed a poorer result at one year as rated by the surgeon (fixed OR 0.52; 95%CI 0.35 to 0.78; graph not shown; random OR 0.37; 95%CI 0.13 to 1.05; Graph 02.02). About 30% of patients with chemonucleolysis had further disc surgery within two years, and meta-analysis showed that a second procedure was more likely after chemonucleolysis (random OR 0.07; 95%CI 0.02 to 0.18; Graph 02.05). However, chemonucleolysis is a less invasive procedure, which may be regarded as an intermediate stage between conservative and surgical treatment, and surgery following failed chemonucleolysis is not strictly comparable to repeat surgery after failed discectomy. There was some suggestion that the results of discectomy after failed chemonucleolysis are poorer than primary discectomy, but there were insufficient data to allow meta-analysis and in any event, the patient sub-groups so derived were unlikely to be comparable. The main meta-analysis shows that the final outcome of patients treated by chemonucleolysis, including the effects of further surgery if chemonucleolysis failed, remained poorer than those treated by primary discectomy.</P>
<P>No statistically significant differences were demonstrated between low dose and standard dose chymopapain (<LINK REF="STD-Benoist-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Benoist 1993</LINK>), between chymopapain and collagenase (<LINK REF="STD-Hedtmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hedtmann 1992</LINK>), or between chymopapain and steroid injection (<LINK REF="STD-Bourgeois-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bourgeois 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bontoux-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Bontoux 1990</LINK>). It should be noted that although one trial suggested that collagenase was more effective than placebo, that was a small study and there was 40% code break by eight weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Bromley-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bromley 1984</LINK>). A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Yu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Yu 2001</LINK>) shows a marginally better effect of collagenase if injected into a disc protrusion rather than into the main disc itself.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">c) Barrier membranes</HEADING>
<P>Eight trials considered the effect of different types of inter-position membrane on the formation of intra-spinal scarring following discectomy, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or enhanced computerised tomography. Three of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-MacKay-1995" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bernsmann-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bernsmann 2001</LINK>) failed to show any improvement in clinical outcomes following use of fat or gelfoam, although a lesser number of painful episodes one year after surgery was recorded in a fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gambardella-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gambardella 2005</LINK>). There are three trials of ADCON-L an anti-adhesion gel derived from porcine collagen and dextran sulfate. Results from the European (<LINK REF="STD-De-Tribolet-1998" TYPE="STUDY">De Tribolet 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richter-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Richter 2001</LINK>) and U.S. (<LINK REF="STD-Geisler-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Geisler 1999</LINK>) multicentre studies show conflicting results. Twelve month results are reported from a pilot study of Oxiplex/SP gel (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2004</LINK>). Although there is a trend suggesting that treatment diminishes leg pain severity and lower limb weakness, the study had very low power and the results reported are not significant. A polylactic acid membrane was shown to prevent epidural scar adhesion without effect on outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2004</LINK>).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The results from 40 RCTs and two QRCTs of surgical interventions for lumbar disc prolapse are now presented, including 17 new trials since the first issue of this review. Although, as we have pointed out, there were many weaknesses of trial design and data have to be interpreted with caution, it is possible to draw a number of provisional conclusions.</P>
<P>The trial by Weber ( <LINK REF="STD-Weber-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1983</LINK>) is widely quoted as a direct comparison of discectomy and conservative treatment, and as showing a temporary benefit in clinical outcomes at one year, but no difference on longer term follow up at four and ten years. We believe that this is an inaccurate interpretation of the results (See also <LINK REF="REF-Bessette-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bessette 1996</LINK> for a critique of this trial). Weber (<LINK REF="STD-Weber-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Weber 1983</LINK>) actually reported on a subgroup of patients with uncertain indications for surgery: of a total series of 280 patients, 67 were considered to have definite indications for surgery, 87 patients improved with conservative management, and only the intermediate 126 were randomised in the trial. The intervention consisted of primary discectomy compared with initial conservative management followed by discectomy as soon as clinically considered necessary if the patient failed to improve. The trial did show clearly that discectomy produced better clinical outcomes at one year, particularly for relief of sciatica. What it also showed is that if the clinical indications are uncertain, postponing surgery to further assess clinical progress may delay recovery but does not produce long-term harm. There are now three further trials comparing discectomy with conservative treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Greenfield-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Greenfield 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Butterman-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Butterman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinstein-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstein 2006</LINK>), the conclusions of which appear broadly comparable to those from Weber. </P>
<P>At present, the best scientific evidence on the effectiveness of discectomy still comes from chemonucleolysis. There is strong evidence that discectomy is more effective than chemonucleolysis and that chemonucleolysis is more effective than placebo: ergo, discectomy is more effective than placebo. This is entirely consistent with systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1997</LINK>) of non-RCT series of discectomy and many clinical series which have shown consistently that 65% to 90% of patients get good or excellent outcomes, particularly for the relief of sciatica and for at least six to 24 months, compared with 36% of conservatively treated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1993</LINK>). It is not possible to draw any conclusions about indications for surgery from the present review of RCTs, but these other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1997</LINK>) provide evidence on the need for careful selection of patients. All of this evidence confirms clinical experience and teaching that the primary benefit of discectomy is to provide more rapid relief of sciatica in those patients who have failed to resolve with conservative management, even if there is no clear evidence that surgery alters the long-term natural history or prognosis of the underlying disc disease. The medium-term clinical outcomes have been sufficiently consistent for discectomy to survive the test of time in widespread clinical practice for more than 60 years. </P>
<P>This review also provides evidence on a number of technical questions about discectomy. There is moderate evidence from three trials that the clinical outcomes of microdiscectomy are comparable to those of standard discectomy. In principle, the microscope provides better illumination and facilitates teaching. These trials suggest that use of the microscope lengthens the operative procedure, but despite previous concerns, they did not show any significant difference in peri-operative bleeding, length of in-patient stay, or the formation of scar tissue. It is probable that some form of interposition membrane may reduce scarring after discectomy, although there is no clear evidence on clinical outcomes.</P>
<P>Enthusiasm for chemonucleolysis with chymopapain has waxed and waned. After forty years, there remains good evidence on its effectiveness: five generally high quality trials show that chemonucleolysis produces better clinical outcomes than placebo, and one trial showed that these outcomes are maintained for ten years. Conversely, however, there is strong evidence that chemonucleolysis does not produce as good clinical outcomes as discectomy, even if that must be balanced against a lower overall complication rate (<LINK REF="REF-Bouillet-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouillet 1987</LINK>). Moreover, a significant proportion of patients progress to surgery anyway after failed chemonucleolysis and their final outcome may not be quite as good. Rationally, chemonucleolysis is a minimally invasive procedure, that might be considered as an intermediate stage between conservative management and open surgical intervention, and could save about 70% of patients from requiring open surgery. It is then a matter of debate about the relative balance of possibly avoiding surgery, relative risks and complication rates, clinical outcomes over the next year or so, and the potential impact on the lifetime natural history of disc disease. In current practice, that balance of advantages and disadvantages has put chemonucleolysis out of favour.</P>
<P>The place for other forms of discectomy is unresolved. Trials of automated percutaneous discectomy and laser discectomy suggest that clinical outcomes following treatment are at best fair and certainly worse than after microdiscectomy, although the importance of patient selection (see results) is acknowledged. There are no RCTs examining intradiscal electrotherapy or coblation as a treatment for disc prolapse, nor as yet any comparing transforaminal endoscopic (arthroscopic) discectomy advocated for small sub-ligamentous prolapse</P>
<P>Although a few trials report the number of patients who return to work after treatment, there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of any of these surgical treatments on capacity for work. Readers are referred to older, non-RCT reviews and discussions by Taylor and Scheer (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scheer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scheer 1996</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Epidemiological and clinical studies show that most lumbar disc prolapses resolve naturally with conservative management and the passage of time, and without surgery.</P>
<P>There is considerable evidence that surgical discectomy provides effective clinical relief for carefully selected patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc prolapse that fails to resolve with conservative management. It provides faster relief from the acute attack of sciatica, although any positive or negative effects on the long-term natural history of the underlying disc disease are unclear. There is still a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal timing of surgery.</P>
<P>The choice of micro- or standard discectomy at present probably depends more on the training and expertise of the surgeon, and the resources available, than on scientific evidence of efficacy. However, it is worth noting that some form of magnification is now used almost universally in major spinal surgical units to facilitate vision. </P>
<P>At present, unless or until better scientific evidence is available, automated percutaneous discectomy, coblation therapy and laser discectomy should be regarded as research techniques.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The quality of surgical RCTs still needs to be improved, particularly on the issues of sufficient power, adequate randomization, blinding, duration of follow-up and better clinical outcome measures. There are major gaps in our knowledge on the costs and cost-effectiveness of all forms of surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse. Authors of future surgical RCTs should seek expert methodological advice at the planning stage.</P>
<P>There is still a need for more and better evidence on a) the optimal selection and timing of surgical treatment in the over-all and long-term management strategy for disc disease, b) the outcomes of discectomy versus conservative management, and c) the relative clinical outcomes, morbidity, costs and cost-effectiveness of micro- versus standard discectomy. High quality RCTs are required to determine if there is any role for automated percutaneous discectomy or laser discectomy. There is a major need for long-term studies into the effects of surgery on the lifetime natural history of disc disease and on occupational outcomes.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review should continue to be maintained and updated as further RCTs become available. The authors will be pleased to receive information about any new RCTs of surgical treatment of lumbar disc prolapse.</P>
