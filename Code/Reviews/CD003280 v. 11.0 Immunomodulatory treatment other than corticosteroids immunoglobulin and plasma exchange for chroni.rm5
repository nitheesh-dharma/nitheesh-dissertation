<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence for giving people with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) treatment that regulates the immune system other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin and plasma exchange.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>CIDP is an uncommon disease that causes weakness and numbness of the arms and legs. The condition may progress steadily or have periods of worsening and improvement. The cause is inflammation that damages the insulating layer (myelin) around individual nerve fibres. In severe cases, the disease affects the actual nerve fibres themselves. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, three immune system treatments are known to help. These are corticosteroids ('steroids'), plasma exchange (which removes and replaces blood plasma), and intravenous immunoglobulin (infusions into a vein of human antibodies). However, benefit from these is often inadequate or does not last long. We wanted to discover whether other drugs that suppress or change the activity of the immune system are of benefit.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found four trials. A trial with 27 participants compared the effects of azathioprine together with steroids to steroids alone for nine months. Azathioprine is a drug that is often used to treat autoimmune diseases because it suppresses the harmful immune cells. This trial had a parallel-group design, which means that the participants were divided into groups that each received only one of the treatments.</P>
<P>A cross-over design trial with 10 participants compared the immune-regulating drug interferon (IFN) beta-1a with placebo (dummy treatment) for 12 weeks. The cross-over design means that all participants received both treatments in random order. A parallel-group trial with 67 participants also compared interferon beta-1a with placebo, but for 32 weeks. Another parallel-group trial with 60 participants compared the cytotoxic drug methotrexate with placebo for 40 weeks. The IFN beta-1a trials, but not the azathioprine or methotrexate trials, received pharmaceutical company support or sponsorship.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of these trials showed significant benefit or harm from the drugs. We selected disability scores as our primary measure of the effect of treatment. All the trials were too small to detect or rule out anything but major benefit or harm. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate or low for IFN beta-1a and methotrexate because of problems with trial design, and because the small number of participants made the result imprecise. We rated the quality of the evidence for azathioprine as low because of lack of blinding and imprecision. Observational studies of these and other drugs, including the cytotoxic drugs cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate, rituximab, alemtuzumab and natalizumab, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and the immune regulating drug interferon (IFN) alfa, exist but are of insufficient quality to determine whether any of these treatments are beneficial.</P>
<P>The evidence is up to date to May 2016.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:11:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disease that causes progressive or relapsing and remitting weakness and numbness. It is probably caused by an autoimmune process. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs would be expected to be beneficial. This review was first published in 2003 and has been updated most recently in 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:11:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>To assess the effects of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents other than corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange in CIDP.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-03-27 12:04:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>On 24 May 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS for completed trials, and clinical trial registers for ongoing trials. We contacted the authors of the trials identified and other disease experts seeking other published and unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>We sought randomised and quasi-randomised trials of all immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab, and all immunomodulatory agents, such as interferon (IFN) alfa and IFN beta, in participants fulfilling standard diagnostic criteria for CIDP. We included all comparisons of these agents with placebo, another treatment, or no treatment.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We wanted to measure the change in disability after one year as our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were change in disability after four or more weeks (from randomisation); change in impairment after at least one year; change in maximum motor nerve conduction velocity and compound muscle action potential amplitude after one year; and for participants who were receiving corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), the amount of this medication given during at least one year after randomisation. Participants with one or more serious adverse events during the first year was also a secondary outcome.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>Four trials fulfilled the selection criteria: one of azathioprine (27 participants), two of IFN beta-1a (77 participants in total) and one of methotrexate (60 participants). The risk of bias was considered low in the trials of IFN beta-1a and methotrexate but high in the trial of azathioprine. None of the trials showed significant benefit in any of the outcomes selected by their authors. The results of the outcomes which approximated most closely to the primary outcome for this review were as follows.</P>
<P>In the azathioprine trial there was a median improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (scale range 0 to 280) after nine months of 29 points (range 49 points worse to 84 points better) in the azathioprine and prednisone treated participants compared with 30 points worse (range 20 points worse to 104 points better) in the prednisone alone group. There were no reports of adverse events.</P>
<P>In a cross-over trial of IFN beta-1a with 20 participants, the treatment periods were 12 weeks. The median improvement in the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (range 1 to 10) was 0.5 grades (interquartile range (IQR) 1.8 grades better to zero grade change) in the IFN beta-1a treatment period and 0.5 grades (IQR 1.8 grades better to 1.0 grade worse) in the placebo treatment period. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment period.</P>
<P>In a parallel group trial of IFN beta-1a with 67 participants, none of the outcomes for this review was available. The trial design involved withdrawal from ongoing IVIg treatment. The primary outcome used by the trial authors was total IVIg dose administered from week 16 to week 32 in the placebo group compared with the IFN beta-1a groups. This was slightly but not significantly lower in the combined IFN beta-1a groups (1.20 g/kg) compared with the placebo group (1.34 g/kg, P = 0.75). There were four participants in the IFN beta-1a group and none in the placebo group with one or more serious adverse events, risk ratio (RR) 4.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 80.05).</P>
<P>The methotrexate trial had a similar design involving withdrawal from ongoing corticosteroid or IVIg treatment. At the end of the trial (approximately 40 weeks) there was no significant difference in the change in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale, a disability scale (scale range 0 to 12), the median change being 0 (IQR &#8722;1 to 0) in the methotrexate group and 0 (IQR &#8722;0.75 to 0) in the placebo group. These changes in disability might have been confounded by the reduction in corticosteroid or IVIg dose required by the protocol. There were three participants in the methotrexate group and one in the placebo with one or more serious adverse events, RR 3.56 (95% CI 0.39 to 32.23).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:31:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Low-quality evidence from randomised trials does not show significant benefit from azathioprine or interferon beta-1a and moderate-quality evidence from one randomised trial does not show significant benefit from a relatively low dose of methotrexate for the treatment of CIDP. None of the trials was large enough to rule out small or moderate benefit. The evidence from observational studies is insufficient to avoid the need for randomised controlled trials to discover whether these drugs are beneficial. Future trials should have improved designs, more sensitive outcome measures relevant to people with CIDP, and longer treatment durations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a disease causing progressive or relapsing and remitting weakness and numbness. Its minimum prevalence is at least one or two cases per 100,000 of the population and may be as high as 8.9 per 100,000 (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mygland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mygland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chi_x00f2_-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chiò 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Laughlin-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laughlin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2014</LINK>). A prevalence study in the South East Thames region of England in 2008 found that 76.2% of 84 people with CIDP had needed treatment at some time and 31.7% of 41 people could not walk independently on the prevalence date (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>CIDP began to emerge as a syndrome separate from Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, an acute paralysing disorder usually due to acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy) with the description of recurrent steroid-responsive neuropathy by Austin in 1958 (<LINK REF="REF-Austin-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austin 1958</LINK>). The description of larger series of people with CIDP led to a clearer clinical picture (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK>), and eventually an arbitrary definition (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK>). This definition has been widely used and was the basis of the diagnostic criteria in the first version of this review although it has been criticised as too restrictive, excluding people who are considered by the authors of case series to have a clinical condition identical to CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koski-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koski 2009</LINK>). Other criteria have been published, including less restrictive criteria agreed by a consensus committee (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2010</LINK>), which we have accepted in updates of this review.</P>
<P>A number of conditions that are forms of, or resemble, CIDP require special consideration. The duration of the onset phase in CIDP is more than eight weeks, while that of GBS is less than four weeks. Some cases of CIDP have an acute onset like GBS, or are subacute (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oh-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruts 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ruts-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruts 2010</LINK>). GBS itself may recur on one or sometimes several occasions (<LINK REF="REF-Kuitwaard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuitwaard 2009</LINK>). While some relapses are acute and easily recognisable as GBS, others may be subacute or chronic and these cases are difficult to distinguish from CIDP. For this reason we would have included people with recurrent GBS in this review, but noted in which studies they were included; we are not aware of any such participants. A form of asymmetrical sensory and motor neuropathy with persistent conduction block, the Lewis-Sumner syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Viala-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Viala 2004</LINK>), has been recognised as a distinct subgroup of CIDP that differs from other cases in the persistence of the conduction block at individual sites over long periods. We would have included such cases in this review if trials had included them. However, the syndrome of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block is a pure motor syndrome that differs from CIDP in its response to steroids and might differ in its response to other agents (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2010</LINK>). Consequently, we have excluded MMN from this review; a separate review has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Umapathi-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umapathi 2015</LINK>). By contrast, in the sensory form of CIDP there is electrophysiological evidence of motor involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 1992</LINK>). We therefore regarded this as a form of CIDP and would have included such people. We would also have included variants with cranial nerve or upper-limb onset or involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 1996</LINK>), distal or proximal and distal involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2001</LINK>), and subclinical (magnetic resonance imaging) evidence of central nervous system involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Ormerod-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ormerod 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waddy-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddy 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>There has been debate as to whether people with the clinical features of an acquired demyelinating neuropathy and a systemic disease, such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other connective tissue diseases should be categorised as having CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2010</LINK>). To confine this review to as homogeneous a group as possible, we would have excluded such cases where the results were available separately from the whole trial. About 10% of people with an acquired demyelinating neuropathy have a serum paraprotein (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 1981</LINK>). About half such people have an IgM paraprotein in which the paraprotein is an autoantibody directed against carbohydrate epitopes on myelin-associated glycoprotein, other myelin proteins, and glycolipids. This condition and some of the other paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathies have different underlying pathology and presumably pathogenesis. Consequently, we have left treatments for all paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathies for other reviews to consider. A Cochrane Review of immunotherapy for IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein paraprotein-associated peripheral neuropathies (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2016</LINK>) and another for IgG and IgA paraprotein-associated demyelinating neuropathy have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Stork-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stork 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-05-02 10:17:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Although not proven, CIDP is generally considered to be an autoimmune disease caused by either humoral or cell-mediated immunity directed against myelin or Schwann cell antigens which have not been identified (<LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_ller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köller 2005</LINK>). Consequently, various forms of immunotherapy have been tried in its treatment. A Cochrane systematic review of corticosteroid treatment concluded that the one randomised controlled trial (RCT) identified gave only weak support for the conventional view that such drugs are beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2015</LINK>). In a RCT of high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone versus standard prednisolone treatment for CIDP, 10 of 24 people in the dexamethasone group and six of 16 in the prednisolone group (odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI 0.3 to 4.4) went into remission after 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-van-Schaik-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Schaik 2010</LINK>). Two RCTs have reported that plasma exchange is more effective than sham exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1996a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1996a</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review concluded that plasma exchange does produce benefit but this is short term and may be followed by rebound worsening (<LINK REF="REF-Mehndiratta-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehndiratta 2015</LINK>). A Cochrane systematic review of five trials including a total of 235 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hahn-1996b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 1996b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mendell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2008</LINK>), concluded that a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) significantly reduces disability and weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Immunoglobulin (Ig) is beginning to be given in large subcutaneous doses. One trial in which 30 participants were withdrawn from intravenous Ig (IVIg) and randomised to the same dose of subcutaneous Ig (SCIg) or placebo for 12 weeks supports this practice. There was an increase in isometric muscle strength with SCIg and a decline with placebo, the difference being significant (<LINK REF="REF-Markvardsen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markvardsen 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>One RCT showed that three-weekly treatment with IVIg has a sustained effect for at least 24 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2008</LINK>). Another showed that plasma exchange was not significantly different in efficacy from IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Dyck-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dyck 1994</LINK>). A trial comparing oral prednisolone with IVIg showed slightly but not significantly more benefit from IVIg (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>). A trial comparing IVIg and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) showed IVIg was both more effective and better tolerated in more participants compared to IVMP, but those who responded to IVMP relapsed less frequently after stopping treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2012</LINK>). An open-label trial comparing IVIg with oral prednisone, only published in abstract, reported that more participants improved with IVIg, but the result was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Camdessanch_x00e9_-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camdessanché 2013</LINK>). Corticosteroids have serious long-term side effects, such as hypertension, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Both plasma exchange and IVIg are expensive, require hospitalisation, and have only short-term benefits. Therefore, there is a need for more effective, longer-lasting treatment regimens.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-14 21:04:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In response to the need for better treatments many neurologists have tried treating CIDP with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents that have been found useful in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue diseases, and renal transplant rejection. These agents include azathioprine, interferon beta (IFNb), cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, methotrexate, etanercept, alemtuzumab, rituximab, natalizumab, fingolimod, and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). When this review was first published in 2003, the only published trials were one small RCT of azathioprine combined with prednisone compared with prednisone alone (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1985</LINK>) and another of interferon beta-1a (<LINK REF="STD-Hadden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hadden 1999</LINK>). Since then only one further trial, of methotrexate, has been completed (<LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK>). The topic of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents for CIDP has regularly been the subject of non-systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Hahn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hahn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-K_x00f6_ller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Köller 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00e9_ger-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Léger 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nobile_x002d_Orazio-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nobile-Orazio 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Doorn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Doorn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-St_x00fc_bgen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stübgen 2013</LINK>), but we know of no other systematic review. This review aims to provide the best evidence about such immunomodulatory treatment for CIDP. It is now updated until 2016 to make sure that it includes the latest evidence.</P>

<P>We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), except corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange. Quasi-randomised trials are those trials in which treatment allocation was intended to be random but might have been biased (for example alternate allocation or allocation according to the day of the week).</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2016-11-09 15:26:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We included results from participants of all ages who fulfilled criteria which approximated to the definition of probable CIDP by an American Academy of Neurology ad hoc committee (<LINK REF="REF-Ad-Hoc-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ad Hoc 1991</LINK>) or the Joint Task Force of the European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Peripheral Nerve Society (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2005</LINK>), which were updated in 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-EFNS_x002f_PNS-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">EFNS/PNS 2010</LINK>). Briefly, these criteria require progressive weakness with an onset phase lasting more than eight weeks due to polyradiculoneuropathy, fulfilment of strict criteria for a demyelinating neuropathy, and the absence of significant central nervous system involvement or alternative causes. For the reasons described in the background, we included people with cranial nerve or upper limb onset, proximal and distal or distally predominant weakness, symmetrical or asymmetrical involvement, and sensory predominant deficit, but not multifocal motor neuropathy. We did not include people with cancer, connective tissue diseases, or immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraprotein with antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES_PRIMARY MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:32:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Sophie Maprayil">
<P>Change in disability at 26 or more weeks after randomisation measured by a disability scale designed and validated for CIDP treatment trials such as the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) scale (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2001</LINK>), the Overall Disability Status Score (ODSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Merkies-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merkies 2002</LINK>), Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), or Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) scale (<LINK REF="REF-van-Nes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nes 2011</LINK>).

<P>We selected a disability outcome as the primary outcome on the grounds that a patient-centred outcome is more relevant to the needs of people with CIDP and healthcare purchasers than a measure of impairment or neurophysiology. We originally chose one year as the period for measurement of outcome on the grounds that the risk, expense and inconvenience of cytotoxic agents and interferons would not be worthwhile unless improvements lasted for at least 12 months. However, none of the trials of immunomodulatory drugs in CIDP have lasted as long as one year so we have reported change in disability at 26 or more weeks as the primary outcome since the 2010 update of the review.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1985</LINK> compared 14 people with CIDP randomised to azathioprine 2 mg/kg and prednisone with 13 people with CIDP randomised to prednisone alone. The trial had a parallel-group design and treatment lasted nine months. The observers and participants were not blinded to the intervention. There were multiple explicit outcome criteria but none were stipulated as primary. Follow-up data were not available for one azathioprine and prednisone participant and three prednisone-alone participants. There were no significant differences after four or nine months in any of 16 variables, including the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (NIS), other measures of impairment, motor nerve conduction parameters, and cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration.</P>

After a four-week washout period participants started on the opposite treatment to that which they received during the first treatment period. The primary outcome measure was a clinically significant improvement in at least three of the following measurements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>five disability scales:</LI>
</UL>
<UL>

<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2010</LINK> compared the effect of intramuscular IFNb-1a with placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study. Sixty-seven intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)-dependent participants were randomised: 45 to different doses of intramuscular IFNb-1a and 22 to placebo. Participants received two intramuscular injections of IFNb-1a or placebo weekly for 32 weeks. There were five treatment groups: IFNb-1a 30 &#956;g weekly and placebo, IFNb-1a 60 &#956;g weekly and placebo, IFNb-1a 30 &#956;g twice weekly, IFNb-1a 60 &#956;g twice weekly, and placebo twice weekly. At the end of week 16 of the trial, IVIg was stopped. IVIg was restarted if the participant had a clinical relapse, which was defined as a two-point deterioration on the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score and one functional disability grade on Overall Disability Sum Score, or study termination at 32 weeks.

<LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK> was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate in people with CIDP who had previously responded to and were still receiving corticosteroids, IVIg, or both. Sixty participants were randomised to receive oral methotrexate or placebo (starting at 7.5 mg weekly, increasing to 10 mg weekly after four weeks, and 15 mg weekly after eight weeks) both with folic acid (5 mg twice weekly for 40 weeks). After 16 weeks (15 weeks if on three or five times weekly IVIg and 14 weeks if on seven times weekly IVIg), corticosteroids or IVIg were reduced, subject to satisfactory progress, at a rate of 20% of the baseline dose every four weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change in mean weekly dose of corticosteroids or IVIg during the last four weeks, usually from week 37 to week 40, compared with the mean during weeks one to four. Secondary disability outcomes were changes in disability measured in two ways and at two times: the Amsterdam Linear Disability Score (ALDS), ranging from 0, which is death, to 100, indicating fully able (<LINK REF="REF-Holman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 2004</LINK>), and the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2006</LINK>), both measured from baseline to week 16 and to week 40. The secondary impairment measures were the changes in the expanded (to include the first dorsal interosseous and extensor hallucis longus muscles) MRC sum score from baseline to week 16 and to week 40.<BR/>

<P>All analyses were adjusted for age, baseline score and baseline corticosteroid or IVIg dose.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of main results</HEADING>
<P>This review only found four small trials of immunomodulatory agents in CIDP. One trial of azathioprine, two of IFN beta-1a and one of methotrexate showed no significant benefit. However the quality of the evidence was low or moderate and none of the trials was large enough to rule out small or moderate benefit.</P>
<P>In this discussion we also review the observational studies concerning each of these drugs in turn and also non-randomised studies of other immunomodulatory drugs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Azathioprine</HEADING>
<P>Azathioprine is a broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agent and is probably the one most commonly used in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). The trial by Dyck and colleagues described above is the only controlled trial and did not detect a significant effect on any of the 16 outcomes tested by the authors or on the outcomes that we had selected for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1985</LINK>). However, the trial was small and lacked power to detect or exclude any but very large treatment effects. Furthermore, it only tested a dose of 2 mg/kg of azathioprine whereas a dose of 2.5 mg/kg or sometimes 3.0 mg/kg has been used in other conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-BDMSATG-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDMSATG 1988</LINK>). The trial also only continued treatment for nine months, whereas in a similar trial in myasthenia gravis a treatment effect did not become evident until after 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Palace-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palace 1998</LINK>). Consequently, it would be premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy of azathioprine from this trial alone (<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dyck-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dyck 1985</LINK> did not mention the occurrence of side effects from azathioprine, but it may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and allergic reactions including rash, which prevent its continuation in about 10% of participants. It also causes leucopenia, altered liver function, increased susceptibility to infection, and a theoretical risk of neoplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Confavreux-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Confavreux 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kissel-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissel 1986</LINK>). A large retrospective cohort study of immunosuppressive agents in autoimmune ocular disease did not show an increased incidence of neoplasia in people with CIDP treated with antimetabolites such as azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil after 17,316 person years (<LINK REF="REF-Kempen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kempen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Azathioprine is less expensive than most immunosuppressive drugs. The annual cost of giving 150 mg daily for a year is about GBP 101 (EUR 125) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2014</LINK>). To this cost must be added the costs of monitoring haematological and liver function, which is required for as long as treatment is continued, and the costs of side effects caused by the drug. However, if the drug is effective it might result in savings because of reduced healthcare costs arising from the disability that CIDP causes, from the reduced usage of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which is one of the preferred treatments for CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Eftimov-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eftimov 2013</LINK>), and from the frequent potentially disabling and expensive side effects that can be associated with the use of corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Uncontrolled observations from case reports and case series in the literature provide little information about the value of azathioprine in CIDP. In 1981, Dalakas and colleagues described azathioprine taken as a 3 mg/kg single daily dose as their immunosuppressive drug of choice (see Table Summary of observational studies of azathioprine) (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 1981</LINK>). They considered that a clinical effect could be detected in between one and 12 weeks. They reported improvement in three of four people with steroid-resistant CIDP to almost 90% to 95% of normal. They also considered that azathioprine has a steroid-sparing action in those who responded to steroids. Seven of a series of 92 people with CIDP were treated with azathioprine and four improved by at least one point on a six-point disability scale (<LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>). In a series of 59 treated people, <LINK REF="REF-Barohn-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barohn 1989</LINK> reported that 56 (95%) responded to immunosuppressive treatment, which started with prednisone and then included azathioprine in the event of a relapse or poor response; the number who received azathioprine was not stated. <LINK REF="REF-Simmons-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simmons 1995</LINK> followed up 69 people with CIDP, of whom 50 were being treated and eight were receiving azathioprine: the authors did not state how effective they thought azathioprine to be. Ryan and colleagues reported no benefit in two people with CIDP, one of whom experienced deranged liver function on both occasions they received azathioprine (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2000</LINK>). Monaco and colleagues state their own experience that low doses of azathioprine (1 mg/kg) and prednisolone (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg) prevent relapses, in particular in people with CIDP who have responded poorly to IVIg, but do not give figures to support this impression (<LINK REF="REF-Monaco-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monaco 2004</LINK>). In a disease with a relapsing&#8211;remitting course and a drug that has a slow onset of action, conclusions are particularly difficult to draw from anecdotal observations. A retrospective Italian multicentre study of 158 people with CIDP treated with immunosuppressive drugs included 77 people treated with azathioprine, of whom 21 were reported to improve (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Cyclophosphamide</HEADING>
<P>Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that can be given orally or by intravenous injection. Four people with CIDP who were worsening despite treatment with corticosteroids had sustained improvement when given oral cyclophosphamide 50 to 150 mg daily for two to nine months (<LINK REF="REF-Prineas-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prineas 1976</LINK>). Dalakas and colleagues reported that oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg was beneficial in the one person with CIDP in whom they tried it (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 1981</LINK>). McCombe and colleagues described benefit in four of five people with CIDP but did not mention the dose or route (<LINK REF="REF-McCombe-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCombe 1987</LINK>). Bouchard and colleagues described the treatment of 36 people with CIDP using in turn, depending on response, corticosteroids, IVIg, plasma exchange and finally oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg daily for six to 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Bouchard-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bouchard 1999</LINK>). Ryan and colleagues treated one child with 4 mg/kg for 9 months with benefit evident within one month and sustained after stopping the drug nine months later (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2000</LINK>). Three people with CIDP who had not responded to previous agents also failed to respond to this cyclophosphamide regimen. Brannagan and colleagues gave high-dose cyclophosphamide to four people with CIDP that had responded inadequately to other treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Brannagan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brannagan 2002</LINK>). The dose was 200 mg/kg over four days accompanied by a forced diuresis and the drug mesna to prevent haemorrhagic cystitis. All four people improved in functional status and had their other treatment stopped. Complications included alopecia in four, infections, transient amenorrhoea, transient renal failure, heart failure, mucositis and diarrhoea. In a follow-up study of the same four and one additional person after a median 2.9 years, four of five showed improvements in the Modified Rankin score, four of five improved more than two points on the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score, and three of five had increases in summed compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of more than 1.0 mV (<LINK REF="REF-Gladstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gladstone 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Jasmin-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jasmin 2012</LINK> reported the successful treatment of one person with oral cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids, but this person has not been included in the summary table because he also had systemic lupus erythematosus. The largest series is that of <LINK REF="REF-Good-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Good 1998</LINK>, who treated 15 people with CIDP with intravenous pulses of 1 g/m² monthly for a maximum of six months with careful precautions to avoid dehydration and premedication to reduce nausea. Twelve people showed marked improvement, 11 improving to normal. Three did not improve, of whom one worsened. Six had minor side effects and two alopecia. None developed haematuria, prolonged bone marrow depression or neoplasia, all of which are feared side effects of high-dose cyclophosphamide. Additional side effects are increased susceptibility to infection and ovarian failure. The results in these case series strongly suggest but do not prove treatment benefit. The risk of serious side effects puts many people with CIDP and their neurologists off using this drug.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Ciclosporin</HEADING>
<P>Another drug which has been used quite frequently in CIDP is ciclosporin, which particularly inhibits the proliferation of T cells. One person with CIDP improved on ciclosporin but developed irreversible renal failure as a side effect (<LINK REF="REF-Kolkin-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kolkin 1987</LINK>). Another improved when treated with the combination of plasma exchange and ciclosporin, but treatment had to be discontinued because of a rise in serum creatinine (<LINK REF="REF-Hefter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hefter 1990</LINK>). The largest series comes from Sydney (<LINK REF="REF-Barnett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hodgkinson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodgkinson 1990</LINK>), where 19 people with CIDP were treated but five had a paraprotein which excluded them from consideration in this review. At the beginning of their series they used a high dose, 10 mg/kg daily, reduced to 8 mg/kg daily after one month and 5 mg/kg daily after three months, but later they reduced the starting dose to 3 to 7 mg/kg and the maintenance dose to 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. All 14 without a paraprotein improved either with a reduction in disability by at least one grade or by a reduction in the annual relapse rate. Of the 19 people treated, 11 had side effects, nephrotoxicity in four, hypertension in four, nausea in three, oedema in three and hirsutism in four. The side effects were less with lower doses. In a North American series, three of eight people with CIDP improved (<LINK REF="REF-Mahattanakul-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahattanakul 1996</LINK>). In a Japanese series, all of seven people with CIDP inadequately controlled by other agents including corticosteroids and IVIg improved following treatment with oral ciclosporin 5 mg/kg daily to keep the trough plasma concentration between 100 and 150 ng/ml. All seven people had improvements in disability measured with the Modified Rankin scale and increases in grip strength within three months. None had side effects attributed to ciclosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuda-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuda 2004</LINK>). One child treated with 5 mg/kg daily for 3 months did not improve (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2000</LINK>). Five people were treated with ciclosporin 3 mg/kg daily adjusted to keep the trough plasma concentration between 100 and 150 ng/ml: four improved, including one who had failed to respond to intravenous cyclophosphamide (<LINK REF="REF-Odaka-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odaka 2005</LINK>). Three of 12 people treated with ciclosporin improved in a retrospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK>). In a report of two people treated with oral ciclosporin, one had a significant improvement in grip strength and went into remission and the other showed an improvement in the modified Rankin score and muscle strength. The authors made the point that in addition to monitoring trough levels, it was important to measure the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from 0 to 4 hours. They aimed for a trough level of 150 ng/ml and an AUC of 2500 ng/ml per hour (<LINK REF="REF-Takeuchi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takeuchi 2012</LINK>). These series suggest but do not prove that ciclosporin is also beneficial in CIDP; there is no doubt that it causes potentially serious side effects, especially renal failure.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Methotrexate</HEADING>
<P>Methotrexate is one of the favoured disease-modifying agents in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but until recently there were no reports of its use in CIDP. It is a folate-inhibiting drug, which is well tolerated for long periods and is reasonably safe when used in low, weekly oral doses of about 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. One child improved following treatment with oral methotrexate 10 mg weekly (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2000</LINK>). A consecutive series of 10 people with inadequate responses to other agents was treated with oral methotrexate 10 mg to 15 mg weekly for at least 32 weeks. Five people reported symptomatic benefit and seven had increased MRC sum scores indicating increased strength. However, none showed improvements in the Overall Disability Status Score (ODSS), indicating that improvements were modest (<LINK REF="REF-Fialho-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fialho 2006</LINK>). The results of this study, the excellent tolerability of methotrexate, and its efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis motivated the RMC trial (<LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The RMC trial was a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial of methotrexate versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK>). Some of the results have been reported in the <LINK TAG="STUDY_DESCRIPTION" TYPE="SECTION">Description of studies</LINK> above. In the trial authors' own analysis of its primary outcome, the results were dichotomised into non-responders (reduction of corticosteroid or IVIg dose by 20% or less) and responders (reduction of corticosteroid or IVIg dose by more than 20%). There were 14 responders out of 27 (52%) in the methotrexate group and 14 of 32 (44%) in the placebo group; the RR of being a responder in the methotrexate group was 1.18 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.02) more than in the placebo group, which is not statistically significant. The average change from baseline in the expanded MRC sum score (graded out of 80) for people in the methotrexate group at the mid-trial visit was an improvement of 2.05 (95% CI &#8722;0.21 to 4.32) points more in the methotrexate group than the placebo group. Although the CI included the possibility of no effect, problems inherent in the trial mean that we cannot exclude mild or moderate benefit. These problems included especially the high proportion of responders in the placebo group, the complexity of the trial design, and the subjective component to the decision about dose adjustment on which the primary outcome depended.</P>
<P>In the Italian retrospective study, only two of 12 people with CIDP treated with 7.5 mg to 15 mg of methotrexate weekly responded (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK>). There has been one case report of the use of a higher dose (20 mg weekly) of methotrexate in a person with CIDP refractory to conventional treatment. In this report, there was a 14-point improvement in MRC sum score and three times weekly IVIg was stopped after eight months on methotrexate 20 mg weekly. The improvement was sustained and prednisolone dose was reduced from 50 mg on alternate days to 10 mg on alternate days (<LINK REF="REF-D_x00ed_az_x002d_Manera-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Díaz-Manera 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Mycophenolate mofetil</HEADING>
<P>Mycophenolate mofetil is becoming popular as an alternative to azathioprine and ciclosporin in prevention of rejection of renal transplants and has been used in eight published series of people with CIDP. Chaudhry and colleagues treated three people with CIDP with 1000 mg twice daily and one improved (<LINK REF="REF-Chaudhry-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaudhry 2001</LINK>). Mowzoon and colleagues reported two people, both of whom improved (<LINK REF="REF-Mowzoon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowzoon 2001</LINK>). According to an abstract report, three of six people with CIDP improved with mycophenolate (<LINK REF="REF-Radziwill-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radziwill 2006</LINK>). In two people with CIDP, it was possible to reduce the amount of IVIg being used by 50% without any deterioration in their condition (<LINK REF="REF-Benedetti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedetti 2004</LINK>). By contrast there was no improvement in any of four people in another consecutive series (<LINK REF="REF-Umapathi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Umapathi 2002</LINK>). Gorson and colleagues treated 12 people with CIDP and in the group as a whole there was no significant improvement in average impairment or disability compared with baseline. However, three people did improve significantly (<LINK REF="REF-Gorson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorson 2004</LINK>). In another series, eight people with CIDP received mycophenolate mofetil (mean dose 2 g/day; median duration 15.2 months): all eight improved and their average (SD) Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) improved from a baseline of 72.3 (35) to 37.8 (37) (P &lt; 0.001) after treatment. Six of these eight people either stopped corticosteroids or IVIg or reduced their doses and frequency by 50% or more (<LINK REF="REF-Bedi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bedi 2010</LINK>). Three of 12 people in the <LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK> series improved with mycophenolate. There is an on-going RCT of mycophenolate in CIDP. Its aim is to assess the effectiveness of mycophenolate by determining the proportion of people with CIDP on placebo or mycophenolate who relapse during the tapering of IVIg and after IVIg is withdrawn (<LINK REF="STD-MYCOPID-trial" TYPE="STUDY">MYCOPID trial</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Etanercept</HEADING>
<P>The tumour necrosis factor-&#945; antagonist etanercept is beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. Three of 10 people with treatment-resistant CIDP were considered to gain significant benefit from it (<LINK REF="REF-Chin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chin 2003</LINK>). However, there are also reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome, multifocal motor neuropathy and CIDP developing in people being treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors for other conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hamon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lozeron-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lozeron 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alshekhlee-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alshekhlee 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ahmed-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmed 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rituximab</HEADING>
<P>Rituximab, a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal antibody against CD20+ B lymphocytes, beneficial in lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis, has been used in small series of people with paraproteinaemic demyelinating neuropathy with modest benefit in some. Two randomised controlled trials of its use in IgM anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein demyelinating neuropathy showed benefit in some participants (<LINK REF="REF-Dalakas-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dalakas 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00e9_ger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Léger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2016</LINK>). In CIDP, it has been reported as beneficial in 17 of 22 people with CIDP in published case reports and small series (see Table of Summary of observational studies of rituximab). An email survey of international experts reported benefit from rituximab in 12 of 20 people with CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2009</LINK>). An Italian retrospective survey reported improvement in six of 18 people with CIDP treated with rituximab (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK>). The reports of <LINK REF="REF-Lunn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lunn 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK> have been omitted from our Summary of observational studies, since there may have been overlap with case reports and series already included in the table. The people in whom rituximab was reported to be beneficial often had other autoimmune disease or haematological disease. The table does not include people who had simultaneous treatment with other agents, such as one with associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma co-treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone and then etoposide (<LINK REF="REF-Kasamon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasamon 2002</LINK>), those with IgM paraproteinaemia, such as four reported by (<LINK REF="REF-Kilidireas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kilidireas 2006</LINK>), or a participant who also had systemic lupus erythematosus (<LINK REF="REF-Sanz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanz 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Interferons</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interferon beta</HEADING>
<P>Interferon beta (IFN beta) is a naturally occurring cytokine, which downregulates inflammatory responses and has been shown to reduce relapse frequency and blood-brain barrier leakage in multiple sclerosis. IFN beta-1a is a recombinant protein manufactured in mammalian cells that exactly replicates human IFNb. An apparently beneficial effect was reported in one person with treatment-resistant CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Choudhary-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choudhary 1995</LINK>). In a prospective open study, four people with moderately severe CIDP received a six-month course of IFN beta-1a 22 &#956;g thrice weekly for three weeks and then 44 &#956;g thrice weekly for 8.5 to 10.3 months (<LINK REF="REF-Kuntzer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuntzer 1999</LINK>). There was no statistically significant benefit: two people showed moderate improvement and one relapsed on treatment with IFN-b1a alone. When the treatment was combined with IVIg improvement did occur but this might have been due to the known beneficial effect of IVIg. Martina and colleagues reported benefit in an open study from IFN beta-1a 22 &#956;g thrice weekly in one person with pure motor CIDP, as well as three with the related condition of multifocal motor neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Martina-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martina 1999</LINK>). The encouraging anecdotes led to the first randomised trial described in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Hadden-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hadden 1999</LINK>). Its negative result has to be considered in the context of the facts that the participants were resistant to other treatments, only received treatment for 12 weeks, and received a low dose (maximum 22 &#956;g subcutaneously three times a week). In subsequent trials in multiple sclerosis, 44 &#956;g three times weekly has been more effective on most parameters than 22 &#956;g three times weekly (<LINK REF="REF-PRISMS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISMS 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PRISMS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRISMS 2001</LINK>). Radziwill and colleagues reported in an abstract that four of five people with CIDP improved on IFN beta-1a 22 &#956;g three times weekly or on alternate days (<LINK REF="REF-Radziwill-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radziwill 2001</LINK>). In a non-randomised open study of intramuscular IFN beta-1a 30 &#956;g weekly, seven (35%) of 20 participants treated showed clinical improvement, 10 (50%) remained stable and three (15%) worsened (<LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>These results led to the second randomised trial reported in this review which also failed to confirm benefit in the intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2010</LINK>). In this trial, treatment lasted 32 weeks and the dose given ranged from 30 &#956;g weekly up to 60 &#956;g intramuscularly twice weekly. The primary outcome used by the trial authors was total IVIg dose (g/kg) administered from week 16 to week 32 in the placebo group compared with the IFN beta-1a group. This was slightly lower in the combined IFN beta-1a groups (1.20 g/kg; P = 0.75) compared with the placebo group (1.34 g/kg) but the difference was not statistically significant. However, in an exploratory analysis, participants who were more severely disabled or on higher doses of IVIg had a statistically significant response to IFN beta-1a.</P>
<P>The evidence from the observational studies does not provide much support for the use of IFN beta-1a and, while differences in design and outcomes prevented meta-analysis, neither of the randomised trials identified in this review showed significant benefit. The observation in an exploratory analysis of significant reduction of IVIg in the participants receiving high doses might be worth pursuing with further trials. However, the occurrence of worsening of CIDP following treatment of co-existent multiple sclerosis with IFN beta-1a in one person urges caution in using the drug outside a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Matsuse-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Matsuse 2005</LINK>). This conclusion is supported by the occurrence of side effects and especially the expense of IFN beta. IFN beta-1a often causes minor alterations of liver function and white cell counts and, with subcutaneous preparations, skin reactions but serious side effects are rare. In the UK, the cost of being on 30 &#956;g of IFN beta-1a once a week for one year is about GBP 8502 (EUR 10,481) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2014</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interferon alfa</HEADING>
<P>Interferon alfa (IFN alfa) is another naturally occurring cytokine which has complex, incompletely understood immunoregulatory actions. It is used to enhance immune reactions to combat hepatitis C. It upregulates immune responses and has been reported to cause autoimmune diseases including CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Marzo-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marzo 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meriggioli-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meriggioli 2000</LINK>). Despite this, IFN alfa has been used to treat CIDP. The largest study treated 16 participants (of whom two had a paraprotein) with IFN alfa-2a 3 million international units (MIU) subcutaneously three times a week for six weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Gorson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorson 1997</LINK>). Of the 14 participants without a paraprotein, nine responded to IFN alfa-2a: five had a sustained improvement and one improved, received plasma exchange and then had sustained improvement, and three relapsed. Minor side effects consisting of fatigue, fever, malaise, and myalgia and arthralgia were common. Pavesi and colleagues reported dramatic improvement with IFN alfa in a single person with treatment-resistant CIDP. This person had severe symmetric distal and proximal muscle weakness and made complete functional recovery six months after she was started on IFN alfa 3 MIU subcutaneously twice a week (<LINK REF="REF-Pavesi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pavesi 2002</LINK>). The Italian retrospective study reported improvement in four of 11 people with CIDP treated with 800,000 units to 3 million units every one to three weeks for at least a year (<LINK REF="REF-Cocito-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cocito 2011</LINK>). IFN alfa is expensive. We share the view of Saperstein and colleagues that randomised trials would be needed to establish whether IFN alfa is beneficial (<LINK REF="REF-Saperstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saperstein 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation</HEADING>
<P>Autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is an extreme form of immunosuppression in which the person is treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and then granulocyte stimulating factor to allow harvesting of bone marrow stem cells from their own blood. The person is then treated with very high dose cyclophosphamide, anti-T cell antibodies and, in some regimens, whole body irradiation to ablate their immune system. Finally, the immune system is reconstituted with the stored stem cells. There are seven reports of people with CIDP who underwent PBSCT (See table Summary of studies of autologous and allogeneic PBSCT). Vermeulen and colleagues reported success in one person with CIDP who had been dependent on frequent IVIg: the person improved and became able to stop all immunotherapy afterwards (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 2002</LINK>), but relapsed after five years (<LINK REF="REF-Vermeulen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vermeulen 2007</LINK>). Barreira and colleagues reported a 24-year-old man with a 12-year history of CIDP who underwent PBSCT with only a transient response that lasted for a month (<LINK REF="REF-Barreira-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barreira 2007</LINK>). Oyama and colleagues reported a 32-year-old woman who had had an inadequate response to standard treatments. She had clinical and electrophysiological improvement after her transplantation. Her Rankin function score improved from 4 to 1 and she came off corticosteroids, IVIg and plasma exchange (<LINK REF="REF-Oyama-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oyama 2007</LINK>). A case series followed up three people with CIDP, two of whom were from an earlier publication (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2007</LINK>). Of the three people, two improved: one had a response which was transient (18 months) and the other was in remission after six months (<LINK REF="REF-Mahdi_x002d_Rogers-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahdi-Rogers 2009</LINK>). An open-label, non-randomised study of PBSCT included 42 participants with probable or definite CIDP who had not responded to at least two first-line treatments. Twenty-four of 32 participants had a drug-free remission after one year. None developed neutropenic sepsis but two died of diseases unrelated to PBSCT during the follow-up (see table for more details) (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 2013</LINK>). In another series, 11 participants who had been refractory to other immunotherapies (including one included in a previous report (<LINK REF="REF-Axelson-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Axelson 2008</LINK>)) were treated with PBSCT. After a median follow-up of 28 months, eight had entered remission without the need for any immunomodulatory treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Press-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Press 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, which requires even more aggressive immunosuppression, induced complete remission in one person with CIDP; no relapse had occurred 6.5 years after transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Remenyi-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remenyi 2007</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Alemtuzumab</HEADING>
<P>Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against CD52 antigen. <LINK REF="REF-Hirst-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hirst 2006</LINK> reported remission for 16 months after administration of five daily infusions of alemtuzumab 30 mg/day in a person with CIDP with 11 relapses in 18 months after disease onset. A subsequent report included this person and six others (<LINK REF="REF-Llewelyn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Llewelyn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2010</LINK>). All had been treated with oral prednisolone as well as conventional immunosuppressants without significant benefit. Each received nine courses of alemtuzumab (dose range 60 to 150 mg). After treatment, mean monthly IVIg dose reduced from 202 g to 149 g (26%) and frequency of IVIg infusion from 22 to 136 days. Two people had prolonged remission, another two had a partial response and three had no clear benefit. Responders had a younger age at disease onset and a shorter disease duration than non-responders. Three of the seven people treated developed an autoimmune condition, including Graves&#8217; disease and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2010</LINK>). There is an ongoing open-label multicentre trial of alemtuzumab in the treatment of CIDP (<LINK REF="STD-Alemtuzumab-trial" TYPE="STUDY">Alemtuzumab trial</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Natalizumab</HEADING>
<P>Natalizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody against the T-cell adhesion molecule &#945;4 integrin, has been approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis. A person with CIDP who had failed to respond to corticosteroids, IVIg, plasma exchange, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil was treated with a single intravenous infusion of 300 mg of natalizumab and worsened (<LINK REF="REF-Wolf-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 2010</LINK>). An open-label study of natalizumab evaluated three people with CIDP with a sensory variant of CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Vallat-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vallat 2015</LINK>). They received natalizumab after they had become less responsive or refractory to IVIg and corticosteroids. One improved markedly and was well after three years of treatment, another improved significantly after eight months and the third remained stable during 12 months of treatment. Natalizumab was stopped in all three because of the detection of JC virus in their serum.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future trials</HEADING>
<P>New trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs in CIDP. Of those reported in this review, azathioprine, a higher dose of methotrexate, ciclosporin, and rituximab are all candidates. Fingolimod is being tested in a commercially sponsored trial (<LINK REF="STD-FORCIDP-trial" TYPE="STUDY">FORCIDP trial</LINK>), which closed early for futility. There is also an ongoing multicentre RCT of mycophenolate for CIDP (<A HREF="https://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/viewDiff?documentPK=840301050215410258&amp;versionPK1=z1502271730452941570589096100658&amp;versionPK2=z1606161240409493198160502760464#STD-MYCOPID">MYCOPID</A>). Many other agents such as dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and laquinimod are used or being tested in multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases and would be worth consideration in CIDP (<LINK REF="REF-Melzer-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melzer 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Our ignorance of the detailed underlying pathogenesis of CIDP complicates the choice of agents to try. The occurrence of new onset CIDP in people being treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors has already been mentioned. To this we must add the occurrence of CIDP following solid organ transplantation. <LINK REF="REF-Echaniz_x002d_Laguna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Echaniz-Laguna 2012</LINK> found that 10 of 1557 (0.6%) people developed a monophasic CIDP-like illness in the first 12 months after a transplant for which they had received immunosuppression (<LINK REF="REF-Echaniz_x002d_Laguna-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Echaniz-Laguna 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future trials should preferably last longer than those undertaken so far. The 12-month duration recommended by a consensus group (<LINK REF="REF-ENMC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">ENMC 2005</LINK>), which we selected for this review as the time for measuring the primary outcome, seems appropriate.</P>
<P>Measuring disability is preferred to impairment or nerve conduction parameters as the primary outcome because it has greater relevance to the individual. A disability scale developed for, and validated in, CIDP, such as the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2006</LINK>), would be preferable to a generic scale. Hitherto such scales have been ordinal scales. The Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) scale is a numerical scale that captures a wider range of disability than the ONLS and should now be preferred since it has been shown to be more responsive (<LINK REF="REF-van-Nes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Nes 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Draak-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Draak 2014</LINK>). A RCT of long-term use of IVIg for CIDP found the measurement of grip strength using a vigorimeter to be a sensitive tool in showing clinically significant change in participants (<LINK REF="REF-Vanhoutte-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanhoutte 2013</LINK>). It is likely to be used as an outcome measure in future trials and we will include it as a secondary outcome measure in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>On the other hand, measurement of neurophysiological parameters is fraught with technical difficulties, especially in the multicentre and even multinational trials which are needed in CIDP, and is not being done in current trials. We will remove neurophysiological parameters from secondary outcome measures in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>An alternative outcome measure in people who are receiving IVIg or corticosteroids is to introduce the agent being tested, stop the IVIg or corticosteroids and watch carefully for worsening. This was done by measuring the percentage IVIg dose reduction in the <LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2010</LINK> trial of IFN beta, or the percentage of participants who could reduce the dose of IVIg or corticosteroids in the <LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK> trial. An alternative way of testing the same thing is to compare the times to relapse between the two groups, as was done in the trial of fingolimod (<LINK REF="STD-FORCIDP-trial" TYPE="STUDY">FORCIDP trial</LINK>).</P>
<P>A high proportion of participants in the placebo groups, 14 of 32 in the RMC trial (<LINK REF="STD-RMC-2009" TYPE="STUDY">RMC 2009</LINK>), and 8 of 17 in the trial by IFN beta-1a (<LINK REF="STD-Hughes-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Hughes 2010</LINK>), were able to reduce their dose of IVIg or corticosteroids without deteriorating. This suggested that some participants had been on a higher dose at baseline than they required. This high proportion of 'responders' in the placebo groups reduced the sensitivity of these trials to detect a significant difference in the reduction of IVIg or corticosteroids in withdrawal trials, which made the assessment of the efficacy of methotrexate and IFNb-1a difficult. Future trials should allow for this in power calculations or include a run-in period during which the IVIg or corticosteroid dosage is reduced, after which only participants who had been observed to worsen and require the reintroduction of IVIg or corticosteroids would be randomised. The observations in these trials have led guidelines to encourage drug holidays to discover whether IVIg or corticosteroids are still needed (<LINK REF="REF-Van-den-Bergh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van den Bergh 2010</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-04-28 11:30:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Our search for randomised trials has been exhaustive. Enquiry from members of the international Peripheral Nerve Society, the relevant medical professional organisation, in June 2016 did not reveal any other completed or ongoing trials (<A HREF="http://www.pnsociety.com">www.pnsociety.com</A>). No robust method exists for systematically identifying and reviewing non-randomised studies, but we included all relevant articles known to us, discovered during our search for randomised trials or identified in our additional search for non-randomised studies. We referenced and briefly described case reports and series that gave the number of people treated with individual immunosuppressive agents and the number whom the study authors deemed to have improved. We do not claim to have discovered all such reports or series and the criteria for diagnosis, improvement and completeness of follow-up have often not been fully reported even in those to which we have referred. Any conclusions from these non-randomised data require extreme caution in interpretation.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-02-14 14:23:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>One randomised controlled trial of azathioprine, two of interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) and one of methotrexate have been performed in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). None showed a significant effect but none were adequate to support or refute mild or moderate benefit or harm. Small numbers of case reports and case series described the use of other immunosuppressant drugs, especially cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin and rituximab, but none consistently produced sufficient improvement to recommend their use without further research.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-09 17:01:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>More research is needed to determine whether immunosuppressive drugs or IFNs are beneficial in CIDP. Future trials should measure outcomes including disability after at least one year. It is necessary to use scales for measuring disability and impairment that are more responsive, biometrically sound and relevant to people with CIDP. If trials use change in dosage of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), or the need for rescue treatment when IVIg is stopped as an outcome measure, their design should allow for the fact that these drugs may no longer be needed in a proportion of participants.</P>
