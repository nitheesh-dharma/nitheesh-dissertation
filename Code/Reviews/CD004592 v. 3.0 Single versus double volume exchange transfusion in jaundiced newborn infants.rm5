<P>Extremely high levels of bilirubin (severe jaundice) can lead to brain damage. Severe jaundice in newborns can occur as a result of a variety of causes including rhesus hemolytic disease, ABO incompatibility, atypical antibodies etc. Removal of blood from the affected infant and replacing with fresh blood from the blood bank (exchange transfusion) is used as a treatment for severe jaundice in newborn infants. The affected infant's blood is removed in small portions and equal volume of blood is replaced during exchange transfusion. Traditionally twice the blood volume of baby is removed and the replaced with fresh blood. Exchange transfusion has been shown to reduce brain damage in severely jaundiced babies; however, exchange transfusion is associated with serious adverse events including death. It is likely that the complications of exchange transfusion would increase with amount of blood exchanged. This review was undertaken to examine if single volume (removal of blood equivalent to the blood volume of the baby) is as effective as double volume (removal of twice blood volume of the baby) in reducing the brain damage and bilirubin levels in newborn infants with severe jaundice. Only one randomised trial fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. This study compared single and double volume exchange transfusion in jaundice due to ABO hemolytic jaundice. The study found no significant difference in bilirubin levels following exchange. This study did not look at any long term neurodevelopmental outcome (brain damage). Based on the available data, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of single volume exchange transfusion as opposed to double volume exchange transfusion in jaundiced newborns.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Double volume exchange transfusion is commonly used in newborns with severe jaundice in order to prevent kernicterus and other toxicity related to hyperbilirubinemia. Most commonly, exchange transfusions are used in infants with rhesus hemolytic disease.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare the effectiveness of single volume exchange transfusion (SVET) with that of double volume exchange transfusion (DVET) in producing survival without disability and reducing bilirubin levels in newborn infants with severe jaundice. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>MEDLINE, EMBASE (Excerpta Medica online), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), SCISEARCH (Science Citation Index), Reference lists from the articles identified in the search of the databases, and from review articles were searched through March 2006. Personal communication with experts in the field was used to identify unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All Randomised and quasi randomised control trials comparing single volume and double volume exchange transfusions in jaundiced newborn infants were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Safety and efficacy of single and double volume exchange compared with regards to long term neurodevelopment, reduction in bilirubin levels and other complications during exchange transfusion. Data was evaluated separately with regards to the cause of jaundice. Relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous variables respectively. 95% confidence intervals were used and a fixed effects model was assumed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only one study fulfilled the criteria (Amato 1988). 20 full term babies requiring exchange transfusion for hemolytic jaundice due to ABO incompatibility were randomly allocated to receive single or double volume exchange transfusion. Base line characteristics of both groups were similar with regards to birth weight 3260 (SD 390) g vs. 3350 SD (410) g, gestational age 39 (SD 1) week vs. 40 (SD 0.8) week, immediate pre exchange bilirubin level 199 (SD 33) micromol/L vs. 216 (SD 55) micromol/L. Both groups were treated equally apart from the volume of blood used for exchange transfusion. Total bilirubin levels immediately after exchange transfusion were not significantly different in either group. No long term neurodevelopmental outcome was examined in this study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of single volume exchange transfusion as opposed to double volume exchange transfusion in jaundiced newborns. A change from the current practice of double volume exchange transfusions for severe jaundice in newborns infant, cannot be recommended on current evidence. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-09-11 11:21:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Exchange transfusion (ET) in neonates is commonly used to remove antibody coated red blood cells and/or products of hemolysis in various immune (e.g. rhesus incompatibility, ABO incompatibility) or non immune hemolytic anemias (e.g. G6PD deficiency and other red cell enzyme deficiencies) or to remove bacterial toxins in cases of severe sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Hoontrakoon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoontrakoon 1998</LINK>). ET involves incremental removal of blood from the affected infant and replacement with fresh donor blood. Estimating the blood volume of newborn as 80 - 90 ml/kg, exchange involving replacement of 80-90 ml/kg has been termed as single volume exchange transfusion (SVET) and that involving 160 - 180 ml/kg termed as double volume exchange transfusion (DVET).</P>
<P>Prior to the introduction of exchange transfusion, liveborn infants with severe rhesus hemolytic disease had a 35-40% mortality, with a 90% risk of severe neurological damage among survivors (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1948</LINK>). A reduction in mortality to 20% and reduction in adverse neurological outcome to 30% was observed following the introduction of double volume exchange transfusion (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1948</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although exchange transfusion achieved its goal of reducing mortality, it has become apparent over the years that the outcome of many of the sensitised infants who underwent exchange transfusion would have been no worse if they had not been treated (<LINK REF="REF-Lucey-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucey 1966</LINK>). Over the past few decades, major advances have been made in prevention (e.g. rhesus immunoglobulin) and treatment (e.g. intrauterine transfusions, intensive phototherapy) of rhesus hemolytic disease, so that use of exchange transfusion, especially within twelve hours of birth, has become uncommon. Most centres reporting outcomes in the management of severe Rhesus isoimmune hemolytic anaemia have shown markedly improved survival rates during the past 25 years, and much of this is attributable to improved antenatal management. Of equal importance, long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in these infants is excellent (<LINK REF="REF-Maisels-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maisels 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The efficacy of ET with regards to long term neurological outcome is related to the etiology of hyperbilirubinemia and the population in which ET is undertaken. ABO incompatibility often results in a less severe hemolytic disease, needing fewer exchange transfusions compared to rhesus incompatibility (<LINK REF="REF-Kanto-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanto 1978</LINK>). In developing countries, babies with severe jaundice may be referred late (with babies already showing signs of kernicterus), and therefore exchange transfusion may not be useful in preventing neurological damage. Bilirubin encephalopathy occurs at lower serum bilirubin levels in preterm infants and the threshold for exchange transfusion is usually lower. Sub-group analyses will be done to compare single and double volume exchanges in these populations.</P>
<P>Efficacy and complications of exchange transfusion can also depend upon the route (peripheral vs. umbilical) (<LINK REF="REF-Merchant-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merchant 1992</LINK>), size of aliquots, method of exchange (continuous vs. push pull) (<LINK REF="REF-Schober-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schober 1990</LINK>) and use of albumin during exchange. Use of intrauterine transfusions (<LINK REF="REF-Grannum-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grannum 1988</LINK>) and metalloporphyrins can reduce the need of ET (<LINK REF="REF-Dennery-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennery 2001</LINK>). Sub-group analyses will be done with regards to different techniques used for exchange transfusion.</P>
<P>Mortality directly attributable to ET (reported to be at least 1%) is often due to unexplained cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmia or air embolism (<LINK REF="REF-Boggs-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boggs 1960</LINK>). Severe necrotising enterocolitis and bowel perforation requiring surgery occur in about 1% (<LINK REF="REF-Lucey-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucey 1969</LINK>). Other major complications include severe bleeding or coagulopathy requiring intervention, and severe bradycardia or apnea during or following exchange. There are several reports of portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension occurring following exchange transfusion using umbilical route (<LINK REF="REF-Yadav-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yadav 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is likely that the complications of exchange would increase with the duration of exchange and volume of blood exchanged. Therefore, a double volume exchange is potentially more hazardous than single volume exchange. With improved outcomes of jaundiced babies without exchange, the risk: benefit ratio of exchange transfusion may well have changed. It is important to examine if limiting the procedure to a single volume exchange minimises adverse effects without compromising long term outcome.</P>
<P>This review aims to examine whether there is any evidence supporting the continued use of double, as opposed to single, volume exchanges with regards to efficacy (especially in terms of long term neurodevelopmental outcome) and safety.</P>

<P>Term and preterm newborn infants (up to 28 days of life) requiring exchange transfusion for jaundice or elevated serum bilirubin (SBR). No specific cut off bilirubin level for exchange was required for inclusion. The bilirubin level for exchange transfusion was defined in individual studies. No birth weight or gestational age restrictions were applied. Preterm infants were defined as those born at less than 37 weeks gestational age. Hemolysis was defined as hyperbilirubinemia in association with either major or minor blood group incompatibility, or a red cell enzyme defect where a positive antibody test or evidence of hemolysis (e.g. fragmented red blood cells on blood film examination, raised reticulocyte count ) is also present. Kernicterus was defined as a neurological deficit including athetoid cerebral palsy, impaired upward gaze and deafness, isolated conditions like auditory neuropathy or dys-synchrony (AN/AD), and subtle bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) (<LINK REF="REF-Dennery-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dennery 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shapiro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shapiro 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Single volume exchange transfusion (intervention) (80 - 90 ml/kg) or double volume (control) (160 - 180 ml/kg) exchange transfusion. Exchange transfusions were done either by central or peripheral route using push pull technique, continuous method or by an automated device. No restrictions on volume of aliquots for each cycle of ET, type of blood for ET, age of blood used for ET, infusion of albumin or replacement of electrolytes during exchange were placed. Infants may have received phototherapy and/or metalloporphyrins either prior to exchange and/or subsequently or had intrauterine transfusions in addition to exchange transfusion.</P>
<P>ET was defined as any procedure in which whole blood was removed from the circulation and replaced with either fresh whole blood or diluted packed red blood cells. Phototherapy was defined as the use of artificial light to photoisomerise unconjugated bilirubin. A continuous technique for ET was defined as one in which two catheters were used and withdrawal and infusion of blood occurred simultaneously. A 'push-pull' technique for ET was defined as one in which one catheter was used and withdrawal and infusion of blood occurred sequentially. Central or peripheral vascular catheters was defined as catheters whose tip lies within the thorax or abdomen, or all other sites, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Mills-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mills 2003</LINK>)</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. The methodological quality of each eligible trial was assessed by both authors, and the authors were not blinded to trial author, institution or journal of publication. The following criteria were used: blinding of allocation, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, blinding of outcome measures. Criteria were assessed as Yes/No/Can't tell. Having decided which trials to include, both authors independently extracted the data and compared results. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. </P>
<P>The safety and efficacy of SVET and DVET were analysed in the following sub-groups: Rhesus hemolytic disease, hemolytic disease other than rhesus disease, infants without hemolysis, preterm babies, infants with established kernicterus, infants treated with metalloporphyrins and for various pre-exchange serum bilirubin levels. Further sub-group analyses was not undertaken on method of exchange transfusion (continuous vs push pull), route of exchange (peripheral vs central) and aliquot size because of insufficient data.</P>
<P>The standard statistical methods of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous and continuous variables, the relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated respectively. 95% confidence intervals were used and a fixed effects model was assumed. Heterogeneity in the study population was prospectively addressed by subgrouping on the basis of different etiologies of hyperbilirubinemia. Sub grouping was also done on the method of exchange transfusion to avoid heterogeneity related to intervention. Statistical heterogeneity was examined by I<SUP>2</SUP> test.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1988</LINK>)<BR/>Amato et al studied 20 full term newborn infants with hyperbilirubinemia due to ABO incompatibility, requiring exchange transfusion. The diagnosis of ABO isoimmunization was made on the basis of clinical data, mother infant blood group incompatibility, positive direct or indirect Coombs test, high reticulocyte count and hyperbilirubinemia. The study was done at two centers over a one year period. 84 babies were admitted to the two intensive care units with hyperbilirubinemia due to ABO incompatibility. Babies who had perinatal asphyxia (Apgar score &lt; 4 at one minutes and &lt; 6 at five minutes), babies with congenital malformations, suspected or proven bacterial infection, respiratory distress and babies who had hyperbilirubinemia due to maternal drugs, polycythemia, skin hematomas, cephalhematoma were excluded. No patients were treated with phenobarbitone. Indication for exchange transfusion was bilirubin levels according to the modified Polacek curves (<LINK REF="REF-Cockington-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockington 1979</LINK>)</P>
<P>Twenty term babies who met the inclusion criteria, and in whom a decision to exchange was taken, were randomised into two groups i.e. one group receiving SVET and the other group receiving DVET. Packed cells (2/3 red cell volume and 1/3 plasma) suspended in plasma was used for exchange. No immunoglobulin or clotting factors were present. The mean hemoglobin level of the blood units was 20 g/dl (SD 3.1) and hematocrit 68% (SD 5).</P>
<P>Base line characteristics were similar with regards to birth weight 3260g (SD 390) vs. 3350g SD (410), gestational age 39 (SD 1) week vs. 40 (SD 0.8) weeks, 5 min Apgar scores 7.5 (SD 0.6) vs. 7.8 (SD 0.8) and age at exchange transfusion 17.2 (SD 6.3) hours vs. 18.7 (SD 6.2) hours in babies who received single volume and double volume exchange transfusion.

Both groups were treated equally apart from the volume of blood used for exchange transfusion.</P>
<P>Single volume exchange transfusion transfused 80 ml/kg and double volume exchange 180 ml/kg. Exchange transfusion was performed through umbilical vein over one hour using a disposable exchange transfusion set in 10 ml aliquots. No additional calcium or albumin was given. No deficit was created. Continuous phototherapy was started immediately after ET using double blue light phototherapy. Babies were given 10% dextrose at 120 ml/kg and once bilirubin levels were less than 205 mmol/L, phototherapy was discontinued. None of the babies required more than one exchange transfusion.</P>

<P>Only one small randomised control of 20 patients has been found comparing SVET with DVET (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1988</LINK>). All the results presented below pertain to this study.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Primary Outcomes</B>
<BR/>
<B>Neurological deficits consistent with kernicterus at two year of age: </B>The study did not report any neurodevelopmental outcome and the follow up was only for 3 months.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Death before 28 days of age:</B>
<BR/>No mortality was seen in either the group at three month follow up.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Life-threatening events during transfusion:</B>
<BR/>No major events occurred in either group. Few infants had bradycardia and mild vomiting. The authors considered this to be of no clinical significance and these events were equally scattered in both the groups.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Change in serum bilirubin after exchange transfusion:</B>
<BR/>Total bilirubin levels (mean) immediately after exchange transfusion was 130 (SD 24) micromol/L in single volume group and 143 (SD 47) micromol/L in double volume exchange transfusion group and the difference was not statistically significant (Outcome 01.01). Duration of phototherapy (mean) in both the groups following exchange transfusion was similar 45.4 (SD 17.7) hours and 38.1 (SD 16.4) hours [p&gt;0.05] in SVET and DVET respectively). Rebound (mean) increase in serum bilirubin following the exchange transfusion was similar in both groups 64.9 (SD 16.7) micromols vs 73.7 (SD 41.4) micromol/L [p&gt;0.05]. The time that bilirubin levels were evaluated is not noted.</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary</B>
<BR/>
<B>Total number of exchange transfusions:<BR/>
</B>None of the babies needed a second exchange transfusion in either group.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Hemoglobin (g/dl) or hematocrit (%) measured 3-6 weeks after exchange transfusion:<BR/>
</B>No significant difference was seen in either group at 10 days and at three month follow up after exchange. The mean haemoglobin immediately post exchange was higher in double volume group 20.4 g/dl (SD 2.1) than single volume exchange transfusion group 18.3 (SD1.1) g/dL (p = 0.01) (Outcome 01.02). This was not a secondary outcome planned in the review.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy following exchange, receiving intervention:<BR/>
</B>No intervention was needed in any of the groups in the study. Mean platelet levels immediately post exchange was significantly lower in double volume group. At 10 days post exchange there was no difference in platelet levels (Outcome 01.03).<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Infection attributable to exchange transfusion:<BR/>
</B>This outcome was not reported.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Portal vein thrombosis and/or portal hypertension following exchange:<BR/>
</B>This outcome was not reported.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Necrotising enterocolitis within 72 hours of exchange</B>:<BR/>None of the infants developed necrotising enterocolitis.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-09-11 11:21:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one trial was eligible for the review. This was a small study comparing SVET with DVET in babies with hemolytic jaundice due to ABO incompatibility (<LINK REF="STD-Amato-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Amato 1988</LINK>). The study noted no significant difference in the short term outcomes (fall in bilirubin and anemia at 10 days) examined in this study between single volume and double volume exchange transfusions. Immediate post exchange platelet levels were higher in SVET group and hemoglobin levels were higher in DVET group. No interventions were required to correct this, and at 10 days post exchange no statistically significant difference was noted. The follow up of study infants was only for three months, and neurodevelopmental outcomes were not studied.</P>
<P>When introduced in the 1940's, exchange transfusion (double volume) was shown to reduce the incidence of kernicterus in Rhesus hemolytic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 1948</LINK>). Early exchange transfusions were often performed early in order to remove hemolysed cells, rather than to reduce serum bilirubin. Studies have shown that the double volume exchange removes 80 - 85 % of RBC and single volume exchange removes about 65% of the circulating RBCs (<LINK REF="REF-Lathe-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lathe 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sproul-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sproul 1961</LINK>).</P>
<P>Forfar et al measured the bilirubin mass removed during exchange transfusion and correlated this with the volume of exchange. The bilirubin removed was 45% higher than the fall in serum bilirubin (<LINK REF="REF-Forfar-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forfar 1958</LINK>). This is because of the movement of bilirubin from the tissues into the blood during exchange. The bilirubin removed correlated with the volume of exchange (r = +0.34). An extra 20 - 70% increase in amount of bilirubin was noticed when single volume is increased to a double volume exchange. An exchange volume of 160 - 180 ml/kg resulted in optimum removal of bilirubin. Further increase in exchange volume did remove more bilirubin, but to a much lesser extent. Authors have considered lowering of total body bilirubin, rather than serum bilirubin, more important in prevention of kernicterus and, therefore, recommended double volume exchange transfusion as opposed to single volume in Rhesus hemolytic disease.</P>
<P>The spectrum of hemolytic jaundice and indications for exchange transfusion in jaundice has changed markedly in the past decade in developed countries following the increased use of Rhesus anti D. Exchange transfusion for Rhesus incompatibility has become uncommon and early exchange transfusions are hardly undertaken these days. It is not clear the same criteria for the exchange volume used in cases of Rhesus isoimmunization would apply to jaundiced babies without Rhesus hemolytic disease ( e.g. ABO incompatibility). Since the hemolysis is much lesser, one could argue that single volume exchange transfusion is as effective as double volume exchange for non Rhesus hemolysis with regards to neurodevelopmental outcome and may lead to fewer side effects. However, currently there is insufficient evidence to support a change in the common practice from double volume exchange to single volume exchange for non Rhesus conditions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Based on the available data there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of single volume exchange transfusion as opposed to double volume exchange transfusion in jaundiced newborns. In Rhesus hemolytic disease there is a strong physiological base for continuing with the current practice of using double volume exchange transfusions. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Consideration should be given to the establishment of an adequately powered trials comparing single volume and double volume exchange transfusion with regards to long term neurological outcome, especially in jaundice not related to Rhesus hemolytic disease.</P>
