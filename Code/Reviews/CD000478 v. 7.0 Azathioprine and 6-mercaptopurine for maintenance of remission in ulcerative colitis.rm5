<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-05-16 14:08:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Studies of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis.</B>
<BR/>Seven studies were reviewed and provide the best evidence we have. Study quality was mostly poor. The studies tested 302 people over the age of eighteen who had ulcerative colitis. The subjects received oral azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, placebo (fake pills) or standard maintenance treatment (mesalazine or sulfasalazine). The studies lasted for at least 12 months.</P>
<P>
<B>What is ulcerative colitis and could azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine work?</B>
<BR/>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon. The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis are bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine are thought to reduce inflammation by blocking the immune system.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the studies show?</B>
<BR/>The studies showed that azathioprine was better than placebo for maintenance treatment (i.e. preventing the disease from coming back once the patient has responded to treatment). Fifty-six per cent of patients treated with azathioprine were disease free after one year of treatment compared to 35% of patients who received placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>How safe are azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine?</B>
<BR/>The drugs were generally well tolerated and side effects occurred infrequently. However, serious side effects such as acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas that causes severe abdominal pain - a 2% risk) and bone marrow suppression (failure to make normal blood cells - a 4% risk) can occur. Patients taking these drugs should be regularly monitored for evidence of effectiveness and side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>What is the bottom line?</B>
<BR/>Azathioprine may be an effective maintenance treatment for patients who have failed or cannot tolerate mesalazine or sulfasalazine and for patients who require repeated courses of steroids.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-26 09:01:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="David J. Tsoulis">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data using standard forms. Disagreements were solved by consensus including a third author. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was failure to maintain clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. Analyses were performed separately by type of control (placebo, or active comparator). Pooled risk ratios were calculated based on the fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was shown. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence for pooled outcomes.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-05-18 09:02:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Seven studies including 302 patients with ulcerative colitis were included in the review. The risk of bias was high in three of the studies due to lack of blinding. Azathioprine was shown to be significantly superior to placebo for maintenance of remission. Fourty-four per cent (51/115) of azathioprine patients failed to maintain remission compared to 65% (76/117) of placebo patients (4 studies, 232 patients; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86). A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for this outcome as low due to risk of bias and imprecision (sparse data). Two trials that compared 6-mercaptopurine to mesalazine, or azathioprine to sulfasalazine showed significant heterogeneity and thus were not pooled. Fifty per cent (7/14) of 6-mercaptopurine patients failed to maintain remission compared to 100% (8/8) of mesalazine patients (1 study, 22 patients; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.90). Fifty-eight per cent (7/12) of azathioprine patients failed to maintain remission compared to 38% (5/13) of sulfasalazine patients (1 study, 25 patients; RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.50). One small study found that 6-mercaptopurine was superior to methotrexate for maintenance of remission. In the study, 50% (7/14) of 6-mercaptopurine patients and 92% (11/12) of methotrexate patients failed to maintain remission (1 study, 26 patients; RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.95). One very small study compared azathioprine with cyclosporin and found that there was no significant difference between patients failing remission on azathioprine (50%, 4/8) or cyclosporin (62.5%, 5/8) (1 study, 16 patients, RR 0.80 95% CI 0.33 to 1.92). When placebo-controlled studies were pooled with aminosalicylate-comparator studies to assess adverse events, there was no statistically significant difference between azathioprine and control in the incidence of adverse events. Nine per cent (11/127) of azathioprine patients experienced at least one adverse event compared to 2% (3/130) of placebo patients (5 studies, 257 patients; RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 8.01). Patients receiving azathioprine were at significantly increased risk of withdrawing due to adverse events. Eight per cent (8/101) of azathioprine patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0% (0/98) of control patients (5 studies, 199 patients; RR 5.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 28.75). Adverse events related to study medication included acute pancreatitis (3 cases, plus 1 case on cyclosporin) and significant bone marrow suppression (5 cases). Deaths, opportunistic infection or neoplasia were not reported.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-04-12 13:50:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Azathioprine therapy appears to be more effective than placebo for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may be effective as maintenance therapy for patients who have failed or cannot tolerate mesalazine or sulfasalazine and for patients who require repeated courses of steroids. More research is needed to evaluate superiority over standard maintenance therapy, especially in the light of a potential for adverse events from azathioprine. This review updates the existing review of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis which was published in the Cochrane Library (September 2012).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-18 09:03:02 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Maintenance of remission is a major issue in inflammatory bowel disease. An ideal maintenance therapy would be effective in reducing the occurrence of relapse, be free of adverse events, inexpensive and easy to use (<LINK REF="REF-Campieri-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campieri 2003</LINK>). Currently, sulfasalazine or mesalazine (5-ASA) are the standard therapy for quiescent ulcerative colitis with good evidence to support their use (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2016</LINK>). In distal disease, topical preparations are also effective and safe (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2012</LINK>). However, there are patients with relapsing disease despite standard maintenance therapy. In addition, some patients do not tolerate 5-ASA or sulfasalazine, or therapy with these drugs is ineffective (<LINK REF="REF-Freeman-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Freeman 2012</LINK>). Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine are commonly used in these settings.</P>
<P>The antimetabolites, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are purine analogues that interfere with nucleic acid metabolism by acting as substrate competitive antagonists, resulting in immunosuppression and reduced cell proliferation (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>). 6-Mercaptopurine was first synthesized in 1951 and initially used to treat leukaemia. Azathioprine, its S-substituted precursor, was synthesized in 1957. Azathioprine has a longer half life and a different spectrum and perhaps lower level of adverse events than 6-mercaptopurine (<LINK REF="REF-Dubinsky-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubinsky 2004</LINK>), but there are no comparative trials in humans. Onset of action is delayed for up to 3 to 4 months of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Su-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 2004</LINK>). Toxicity, the risk for severe bone marrow suppression in particular, is increased in patients with thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency, which occurs in 0.3% (homozygosity, low or absent levels) and 11% (heterozygosity, intermediate levels) of the general population respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Colombel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Colombel 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weinshilboum-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weinshilboum 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of azathioprine for the treatment of quiescent ulcerative colitis was first reported in 1966 (<LINK REF="REF-Bowen-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowen 1966</LINK>). A survey conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Hilsden-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hilsden 2003</LINK> showed that 12% of the patient members of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of Canada who are diagnosed with ulcerative colitis are treated with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine. Other surveys have shown that 77% of gastroenterologists in Europe and North America, and up to 93% of British consultant gastroenterologists use azathioprine for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Meuwissen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meuwissen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stack-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stack 1999</LINK>). The common practice of using azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis, however, is based on limited data (<LINK REF="REF-Bressler-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bressler 2015</LINK>). Although evidence exists to support the use of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Chande-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chande 2015</LINK>), the use of these drugs for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis remains controversial.</P>
<P>The first randomized double blind placebo controlled trial on azathioprine for maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>. There have been few studies since, most of them small, with inconsistent results. Evaluating the evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of purine antimetabolites is important, as azathioprine maintenance is usually considered long term treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Meuwissen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meuwissen 2000</LINK>). Major adverse events may occur necessitating regular monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Chouchana-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouchana 2012</LINK>). It is estimated that 9 to 25% of patients on azathioprine discontinue treatment due to adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gearry-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gearry 2005</LINK>). These include potentially serious adverse events including bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma, and skin cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Kotlyar-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kotlyar 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Long-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Long 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Present-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Present 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2001</LINK>). This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Timmer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timmer 2012</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Evaluation of Included Studies</HEADING>
<P>Trials identified by the search strategy were independently assessed for inclusion by two authors (PP and JKM). Two authors (PP and JKM) independently extracted data from included studies. A third author (NC) was involved for problematic issues. Methodological criteria as well as the results of each study were recorded on standard data forms. All results were tabulated on an intention-to-treat basis. Results excluding treatment failures during an induction period, if present, were also tabulated. The methodological quality of the studies included in this review was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), which involves examining the following study characteristics:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomization sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Patient allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding;</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting; and</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Studies were then judged as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias based on the evidence provided in the available publications (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Any disagreement between the authors was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). This approach classifies outcomes as high, moderate, low or very low quality. Data from randomized trials start as high quality evidence. Evidence may be downgraded based on the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Risk of bias from the studies;</LI>
<LI>Indirect evidence;</LI>
<LI>Inconsistency (i.e. unexplained heterogeneity);</LI>
<LI>Imprecision; and</LI>
<LI>Publication bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The overall quality of evidence behind each outcome was determined after considering each of these elements, and categorized as high quality (i.e. further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect); moderate quality (i.e. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate); low quality (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate); and very low quality (i.e. we are very uncertain about the estimate) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Any disagreements between the authors on the GRADE analysis were resolved by consensus.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical methods:</HEADING>
<P>For each individual study a risk ratio (RR) for the primary outcome (relapse during the study period) along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated based on two by two tables for comparable periods of follow-up (12 months). All patients randomized were included following an intention-to-treat approach, but additional analysis were performed excluding primary treatment failures from studies including an induction period. The presence of heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, a P value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to quantify inconsistency (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). This statistic describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that are due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. A value greater than 50% was considered evidence of substantial heterogeneity. In the presence of significant heterogeneity, pooled analysis was not performed. If homogeneity was likely (I<SUP>2</SUP> &lt; 0.03), pooled RR with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a fixed-effect model based on the method by Mantel and Haenszel as a primary analysis.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were to be performed to examine the effects of drug dose (corrected for the differential potency of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), type of control intervention (active control, placebo) and study quality (concealed allocation, blinding) on the results of the analysis. Planned analyses also included calculating RR separately for withdrawal studies, studies including an induction period, and studies adding azathioprine to patients already in stable remission.</P>

<P>A literature search conducted on July 30, 2015 identified 1082 records. After duplicates were removed, a total of 840 trials remained for review of titles and abstracts. Two authors (PP and JKM) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of these trials and 24 studies were selected for full text review (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Fourteen of these studies were excluded (See: <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Ten reports of 7 studies, including 302 patients, were identified which examined the efficacy of purine antimetabolites compared to placebo or active maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). The studies used azathioprine in different doses: 2.0 mg/kg/d throughout (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>), 2.5 mg/kg/d for three months followed by a reduction to 1.5 to 2.0 mg/kg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>), 2.5 mg/kg/d throughout (<LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>) or at variable dosing (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>). There was only one study examining 6-mercaptopurine at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>). Four studies were placebo controlled (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>), three used active comparators (mesalazine and methotrexate - <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; cyclosporin - <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; sulfasalazine - <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). In the placebo controlled study by <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>, all patients received co-medication with 6 g/day sulfasalazine. Co-medication with sulfasalazine or mesalazine was allowed in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>. In <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>, all patients were allowed tapering steroids and maintenance therapy with 5-ASA.</P>
<P>In all but two of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>), patients were randomized during active disease, and maintenance was preceded by an induction period. A steroid tapering scheme was used at the beginning of all of these trials. In addition, antibiotics were given during the induction period in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>). In contrast, the study by <LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK> used a withdrawal design where patients who had been in remission on azathioprine for 6 months or longer before being randomized to withdrawal (i.e. placebo) or maintenance on azathioprine. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK> used a 6 month treatment phase with either azathioprine or cyclosporin coupled with tapering steroids and 5-ASA treatment before discontinuing all medications.</P>
<P>The time of follow up varied from 12 months to 76 weeks. All studies reported the proportion of patients relapsing, or remaining in remission. In addition there was information on reduction of clinical scores, safety data or number of relapses during the study period from single studies.

<P>The methodological quality of the studies was unsatisfactory in four of seven studies (See <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>), described adequate methods for sequence generation and were rated as low risk for this item. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>) were rated as unclear risk because the methods used for randomization were not described. Appropriate methods for allocation concealment were reported or supplied by the authors for two of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>), and these studies were rated as low risk of bias for this item. The other five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>), were rated as unclear for allocation concealment. Two of the three studies using active comparators were open label (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>), and therefore at high risk of bias for lack of blinding. <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK> did not describe blinding in the abstract. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK> was single blind (patients only) and was rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Six studies were rated as low risk for incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). Three of the studies were rated at an unclear risk of bias for selective reporting because of missing outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>), or potential <I>post hoc</I> outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Azathioprine versus Placebo</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>), including 232 patients, compared azathioprine to placebo. A pooled analysis showed azathioprine was significantly superior to placebo for maintenance of remission. Forty-four per cent (51/115) of patients in the azathioprine group failed to maintain remission compared to 65% (76/117) of patients receiving placebo (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86). No heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (P = 0.60; I² = 0%). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to a high risk of bias in one study in the pooled analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>), and imprecision due to sparse data (127 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The results were similar when analyses were restricted to patients after successful induction of remission; however, data on primary treatment failures were only available for two studies. Forty-six percent of patients in the azathioprine group failed to maintain remission compared to 67% of placebo patients (2 studies, 123 patients; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93). There was no obvious evidence for an effect by dose of azathioprine or use of co-medication in these studies, but the treatment schedules were too varied for formal testing. Also, a difference between azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine could not be examined, as the only 6-mercaptopurine study was open label and did not use a placebo control (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The four placebo-controlled studies also reported adverse event rates (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>). Overall, azathioprine and placebo were not significantly different with regard to the risk of adverse events. Eight percent (9/115) of azathioprine patients and 3% (3/117) of placebo patients experienced at least one adverse event (232 patients, RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.82 to 7.74). No heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (P = 0.48; I² = 0%). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to risk of bias and serious imprecision due to sparse data (12 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>). A pooled analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Four percent (3/75) of azathioprine patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to and 0% (0/77) of placebo patients (152 patients, RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 128.87). However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and a GRADE rating of very low (risk of bias, very sparse data and very wide confidence intervals; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

A pooled analysis of these studies to assess failure to maintain remission was not possible due to a high degree of heterogeneity (P = 0.03; I² = 79%). <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK> reported that 58% (7/12) of azathioprine patients failed to maintain remission compared to 38% (5/13) of sulfasalazine patients (25 patients; RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.50). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to a high risk of bias (open label study), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (12 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>). Adverse events occurred in 17% (2/12) and 0% (0/13) patients administered azathioprine and sulfasalazine, respectively (RR 5.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 101.96). All of the patients who experienced adverse events withdrew. <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK> reported that 50% (7/14) of 6-mercaptopurine patients failed to maintain remission compared to 100% (8/8) of 5-aminosalicylate patients (22 patients; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.90). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to a high risk of bias (open label study), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (15 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Azathioprine vs Cyclosporin</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK> evaluated the effectiveness of oral azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg/day) (n = 8) against oral cyclosporin (4 mg/kg/day) (n = 8) at maintaining remission after 6 months of therapy, coupled with tapering steroids and 5-ASA in patients with remissive UC, who had previously responded favourably to intravenous cyclosporin. The patients were followed for an additional 12 months to monitor for relapse after all medications were discontinued. At 18 moths, 50% (4/8) of patients receiving azathioprine had failed to maintain remission, compared to (62.5% (5/8) of those receiving cyclosporin (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.92). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to unclear risk of bias (abstract publication), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (9 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>). One patient from each group withdrew due to adverse events (RR 1.00 95% CI 0.07 to 13.37), and 4/4 of those completing the 6 months of treatment in the cyclosporin group had experienced at least 1 adverse event (RR 0.20 95% CI 0.03 to 1.35).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse Events Across Placebo-controlled and Aminosalicylate-comparator Trials</HEADING>
<P>We decided to pool comparators with a known low adverse effect profile (i.e. aminosalicylates) with the placebo-controlled studies to assess adverse effects. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse events when these studies were pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). Nine per cent of azathioprine patients (11/127) experienced at least one adverse event compared to 2% (3/130) of control patients (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 8.01). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias (blinding), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (14 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). When studies that reported withdrawal due to adverse events were pooled, there was a statistically significant difference in withdrawals due to adverse events. Eight per cent of patients in the azathioprine group (8/101) withdrew due to adverse events compared to 0% of control patients (RR 5.43, 95% CI 1.02 to 28.75). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias (blinding), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (8 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). Pancreatitis was reported in 3 of 141 patients receiving antimetabolites. Jaundice or hepatitis was reported in 1 of 127 patients receiving azathioprine. Bone marrow suppression was reported for 5 of 127 patients on azathioprine. One case of pancreatitis was reported in a cyclosporin patient. Deaths, opportunistic infections or neoplasia were not reported. <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK> reported several cases of bone marrow suppression (3 of 30 IBD patients receiving 6-mercaptopurine) in patients with IBD, some of whom had ulcerative colitis. <LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK> did not report separate the events by disease entity. <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK> did not formally withdraw patients with serious adverse events from the study, but paused therapy and restarted open label treatment. When studies that reported on acute pancreatitis were pooled, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed pancreatitis. Two per cent of patients in the azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine group (3/141) developed pancreatitis compared to 0% of control patients (RR 4.13, 95% CI 0.48 to 35.48). A GRADE analysis showed that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was very low due to high risk of bias (blinding), and serious imprecision due to sparse data (3 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>). When studies that reported on bone marrow suppression were pooled, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed bone marrow suppression. Four per cent of patients in the azathioprine group (5/127) developed bone marrow suppression compared to 0.8% (1/130) of control patients (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.64 to 14.83).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-05-16 14:10:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Based on four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>), azathioprine was shown to be superior to placebo for the prevention of relapse in ulcerative colitis. The difference was statistically significant and appears to be clinically relevant. Relapse rates in the placebo groups ranged from 55% to 78%. Based on a mean failure rate of 65% in the combined placebo group, the pooled risk ratio of 0.68 would translate into a number needed to treat of 5 (absolute risk reduction 21%).</P>
<P>Several observations limit the reliability and clinical usefulness of this conclusion. Foremost, the quality of the trials was unsatisfactory for the majority of evaluated trials. Inadequate concealment of allocation has been shown to impact on effect sizes in clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Adequateness of concealment could not be assessed for five out of seven studies due to insufficient information (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paraskeva-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Paraskeva 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). All of the trials had small sample sizes. Information on the assessment of relapse or remission remained mostly obscure, although most reported Baron's criteria for inclusion. The number of eligible trials was too small to assess the occurrence of publication bias, or any bias arising from differences in methodological quality.</P>
<P>In addition to these threats to the internal validity of the results, several issues arose concerning the applicability of the results to clinical practice. There were no long term studies. Moreover, it is unclear from the results of the included studies when it is appropriate to use azathioprine in clinical practice. Clinicians can prescribe purine antimetabolites when 5-ASA agents fail, or they can be used in addition to 5-ASA agents or instead of 5-ASA agents. The role of azathioprine as maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis in the era of biologic agents is uncertain. These issues should be addressed in future studies.</P>
<P>Due to the limited number of trials and variable dosing of azathioprine we were unable to assess a dose-response relationship, or differences by use of co-medication or duration of treatment. Only two trials compared antimetabolites to current standard maintenance therapy with aminosalicylates (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>). Both were of insufficient quality due to lack of blinding. One of these open label trials was the only study available that evaluated 6-mercaptopurine (<LINK REF="STD-Mate_x002d_Jimenez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mate-Jimenez 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>For four of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jewell-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Jewell 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sood-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Sood 2003</LINK>), patients were randomized while in active disease. Applying an intention-to-treat analysis approach, we decided to include all patients randomized into the main analysis, including those who failed to reach remission. Strictly speaking, these trials were not mere maintenance trials, even though the analysis excluding induction failures rendered very similar results. There was no difference in the pooled results if the single withdrawal study was excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>), but this may be due to the small sample size. None of the trials included patient related outcomes such as quality of life or hospitalizations.</P>
<P>Case numbers were too small to conclusively assess the frequency of adverse events. However, the incidence of major adverse events in the treatment group was in accordance with previous reports from the literature, including a 2% risk of pancreatitis, and 4% risk of bone marrow suppression.</P>
<P>Azathioprine is commonly used as a maintenance treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis, however the lack of high quality trials evaluated in this review is remarkable. Considering the well established efficacy and safety of aminosalicylates for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2016</LINK>), antimetabolites cannot be recommended for first line treatment for this purpose. There may be a place for purine antimetabolites in patients who do not tolerate aminosalicylates. Moreover, purine antimetabolites may be appropriate maintenance treatment for patients who fail aminosalicylates or require induction with steroid therapy. Future high quality trials should allow for separate analysis of these patients, or use active comparators.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-05-16 14:06:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Azathioprine may be an effective treatment for maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. It may be most useful in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate aminosalicylates, as well as patients who require steroid therapy to induce remission. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess superiority of azathioprine alone, or azathioprine in addition to standard maintenance, as compared to maintenance with aminosalicylates, methotrexate or cyclosporin. The effectiveness of azathioprine compared to biologic therapy is unknown. Overall, given the potential for serious adverse events, azathioprine may not be an ideal first line therapy in quiescent ulcerative colitis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-04-21 13:50:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More data from good quality clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis as compared to standard maintenance therapy or biologic therapy. The question of when it is appropriate to use purine antimetabolite therapy in clinical practice should be addressed in future studies.</P>
