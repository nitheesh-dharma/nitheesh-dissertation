<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Still awaiting evidence for sphincterotomy for biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sphincterotomy for biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction in patients with a manometrically documented high basal pressure looks attractive, but should not be offered outside new randomised clinical trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The sphincter of Oddi regulates both bile and pancreatic juice flow into the duodenum. When dysfunction occurs it leads to problems relating to either the bile or pancreatic ducts. On the biliary side, the most common problem is recurrent biliary type pain following cholecystectomy. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>Is sphincterotomy effective treatment for biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction patients?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Electronic data bases, including the Collaborative Review Group trial registers, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, as well as checking reference lists in as many languages as possible that had the titles: sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, biliary dyskinesia, papillary stenosis, biliary dyssynergia, odditis, papillitis, post-cholecystectomy pain, right upper quadrant pain, or unexplained right upper quadrant pain were included. These titles were matched with sphincterotomy.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised placebo-controlled trials performing sphincterotomy in patients with suspected biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction using manometry as part of the patient evaluation. A basal pressure &gt; 40 mmHg was defined as abnormal. The primary outcome measure was symptomatic response (defined either as cure/improvement or not improved) to sphincterotomy.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Electronic data bases were used to search for the studies. Studies were attempted to be stratified as randomised clinical trials, controlled clinical trials (i.e., quasi-randomised clinical trials), well designed observational studies using a well matched control group, or other. These groupings were then entered into a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only two randomised clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. In 49 patients studied, sphincterotomy was more effective than placebo in treating patients with an elevated basal pressure (Peto odds ratio 9.08, 95% confidence interval 2.97-277.77). In 77 patients studied, sphincterotomy was no better than placebo in treating patients with a normal basal pressure (Peto odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 0.52-3.13). There were no data on quality of life or health economics.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>These results suggest that sphincterotomy for biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction appears effective in those patients with an elevated sphincter of Oddi basal pressure (&gt;40 mmHg), but is no better than placebo in those patients with a normal basal pressure. The results reported in this review must be interpreted with caution as there are only two studies and one of the reviewers (Toouli) has been an author in both studies. Further trials by independent groups are recommended.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 22:44:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-11-09 22:44:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The sphincter of Oddi regulates both bile and pancreatic juice flow into the duodenum. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) is seen as several clinical entities. When dysfunction occurs it leads to problems relating to either the bile or pancreatic ducts. On the biliary side, the most common problem is recurrent biliary type pain following cholecystectomy although there is some evidence suggesting that the gallbladder does not have to be removed to cause pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ruffolo-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruffolo 1994</LINK>). With respect to the pancreatic duct, SOD causes idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis (PSOD). This review will only consider the biliary form of SOD (BSOD). Nomenclature has been a problem with numerous terms being used in the past that are now known as BSOD. Some of these other terms include biliary dyskinesia, papillary stenosis, biliary dyssynergia, odditis, or papillitis. The term papillitis followed the recognition of inflammatory changes in surgical specimens of the ampulla of Vater (<LINK REF="REF-Acosta-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Acosta 1966</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The true extent of BSOD is difficult to know. In a study 30 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Bodvall-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bodvall 1967</LINK>), 23.5% of 1900 patients 2-9 years following cholecystectomy complained of mild biliary pain. In another more recent study (<LINK REF="REF-Bar_x002d_Meir-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bar-Meir 1984</LINK>), 29 of 454 post-cholecystectomy patients (i.e., 6.4%) complained of pain for which no cause could be found. Fifteen of the 29 patients agreed to undergo sphincter of Oddi manometry, and two of the 15 patients had abnormal manometry. From these data it is estimated that 1per cent of all patients undergoing cholecystectomy will suffer from BSOD. At present approximately 500 000 cholecystectomies are performed annually in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Grace-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grace 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients presenting with post-cholecystectomy pain need to initially have biliary (e.g., common bile duct stones) and non-biliary (e.g., peptic ulcer disease) causes for their pain excluded. There are several methods for evaluating BSOD. Sphincter of Oddi perfusion manometry has been developed as a way of assessing sphincter of Oddi motility and abnormal values have been determined as three standard deviations from normal values (<LINK REF="REF-Toouli-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Toouli 1985</LINK>) with a sphincter of Oddi basal pressure &gt; 40 mmHg being considered abnormal. This value has been approximated in other reports (<LINK REF="REF-Raddawi-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raddawi 1991</LINK>: 40 mmHg 2 standard deviations from the mean of normal; <LINK REF="REF-Guelrud-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guelrud 1990</LINK>: 35 mmHg three standard deviations from the mean of normal) and has generally become a uniform value for an abnormally elevated sphincter of Oddi basal pressure. A clinically based system has been promoted by some (Hogan/Geenen types I,II,III (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 1988</LINK>) using liver function test abnormalities and findings at endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) with a dilated common bile duct or delayed drainage of contrast as a way of determining the likelihood of BSOD being present. This system correlates well with manometry for the type I patients (all three abnormalities), but the correlation is poor with the other two groups. For this reason, manometry is considered the best method of assessing patients with suspected BSOD, although the procedure is invasive and carries a small risk of pancreatitis and is not readily available in all hospitals. Noninvasive biliary scintigraphy shows promise in some studies when compared with manometry (<LINK REF="REF-Sostre-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sostre 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corazziari-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corazziari 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Madacsy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madacsy 2000</LINK>), but the variables used in this technique are not standardised in routine practice.</P>
<P>The treatment of BSOD with sphincterotomy has been recognised to be effective in some patients but determining appropriate selection criteria has proven difficult, especially for the type II and III patients. Appropriate selection of patients with suspected BSOD for sphincterotomy is important given the risk of pancreatitis and other complications from sphincterotomy, including death (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1994</LINK>). There are many cohort studies, some of them randomised trials, that appear to show a benefit in patients with an elevated basal pressure. We have undertaken a meta-analysis (unpublished data) in the studies that compared responses to sphincterotomy in patients who had manometry performed as part of their diagnostic evaluation. In the six studies performed (<LINK REF="REF-Botoman1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botoman1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neoptolemos1988b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neoptolemos1988b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolny-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolny 1993b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolny-1997b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolny 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts_x002d_Thomson1985b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts-Thomson1985b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wehrmann1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wehrmann1999b</LINK>), 173 patients in total have undergone sphincterotomy. Of those patients with an elevated biliary pressure, 71/94 showed improvement following sphincterotomy, compared with only 40/79 patients with a normal biliary pressure (Peto odds ratio 2.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-5.49). The rate of pancreatitis that was able to be gleaned from four of the six studies was 10.6% (9/85 patients). There were no reports of death. These data certainly suggests that sphincterotomy could be a valid treatment intervention in patients with BSOD, but this procedure needs to be subjected to randomised, placebo-controlled studies before sphincterotomy can be recommended with confidence. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the available literature for placebo-controlled studies undertaking sphincterotomy for suspected BSOD that had included sphincter of Oddi manometry in the diagnostic evaluation of patients.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Twenty-four studies were identified from the search strategy. Twenty-two of these studies were excluded because of the lack of a placebo/control group and in some cases no manometry had been undertaken.</P>
<P>There were two randomised clinical trials that had included a placebo/control group (<LINK REF="STD-Geenen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Geenen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>) and analysis on two groups within study populations was made depending on whether the biliary pressure was normal or elevated. The Geenen trial was performed from 1980-1983 and the Toouli trial from 1987-1996.</P>
<P>Only one trial clearly assessed response to sphincterotomy for two years or beyond (<LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>), whilst the other after one year following the sphincterotomy or sham procedure, offered sphincterotomy to all the patients who had undergone the sham procedure (<LINK REF="STD-Geenen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Geenen 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both trials included patients with recurrent biliary pain for which no cause be found and included only post-cholecystectomy patients in whom the original surgery had not found evidence of common bile duct stones (i.e., no previous common bile duct exploration) and common bile duct stones were excluded prior to entry into both trials. One of the trials only included type II patients (<LINK REF="STD-Geenen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Geenen 1989</LINK>) whilst the other mainly included type II patients with small numbers of type I and III patients (<LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>), as the entry criteria for this study was pain with at least one of the following: positive morphine-neostigmine test, abnormal liver function tests, or a dilated common bile duct. <BR/>
</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-09 22:44:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Both trials were well perfomed with independent assessment of the response to sphincterotomy that included concealment of randomisation to both the independent reviewer and participant. The efforts to incorporate a placebo/control group were novel (sham procedure). Blinding occurred for the duration of study enrolment.</P>
<P>The trials differed slightly in that the Geenen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Geenen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Geenen 1989</LINK>) randomised patients to sphincterotomy or sham procedure before manometry was performed while the Toouli trial (<LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>) randomised participants on the basis of manometry. The Geenen trial offered sphincterotomy at one year to patients who had undergone an original sham procedure, and although the trial included follow up for four years, for the purpose of this review, only the first year of the trial results were included.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Two comparisons were undertaken to assess the primary outcomes:</P>
<P>(1) For patients with an elevated basal pressure (&gt;40 mmHg): sphincterotomy versus placebo, with comparisons for all trials and those that assessed the response symptomatic cure improvement for two years and beyond. The Peto odds ratio for the two trials was 9.08 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.07-277.77) and for the one study that assessed response for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>) the Peto odds ratio was 6.52 (95% CI 1.38-30.71).</P>
<P>(2) For patients with a normal basal pressure (&lt;40 mmHg): sphincterotomy versus placebo, with comparisons for all trials and those that assessed the response symptomatic cure improvement for two years and beyond. The Peto odds ratio for the two studies was 1.28 (95% CI 0.52-3.13) and for the one trial that assessed response for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Toouli-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Toouli 2000</LINK>) the Peto odds ratio was 1.23 (95% CI 0.42-3.59). The P values were 0.6 and 0.7, respectively.</P>
<P>There was no data on quality of life or health economics in the two studies. Data on adverse events was not easily interpretable as there were many interventions at different times and overall numbers were given rather than data for each intervention. No deaths were recorded.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There appears to be clear benefit for patients with suspected biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and an elevated basal pressure on manometry undergoing sphincterotomy versus placebo (Peto odds ratio &gt; 9) although the results reported in this review must be interpreted with caution. The numbers of studies are small and the total number of patients studied is only 128. It is also important to consider that these two trials were performed by the same researcher and co-author of this review (Toouli). </P>
<P>These two trials did differ slightly. The Geenen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Geenen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Geenen 1989</LINK>) did not randomise patients to sphincterotomy or a sham procedure on the basis of the manometry, but rather found retrospectively that manometry was able to predict response to sphincterotomy, and for that reason others have criticised this work as being an observational study. The two trials also differed slightly in the patient groups studied. The Geenen trial only included type II patients whereas the Toouli trial included type I, II, and III patients, although the majority of the patients were type II. In the Toouli trial no correlation was found between Geenen/Hogan type and response to sphincterotomy versus placebo.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>These results suggest that sphincterotomy for biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction appears effective in those patients with an elevated sphincter of Oddi basal pressure (&gt;40 mmHg) but is no better than placebo in those patients with a normal basal pressure. The results reported in this review must be interpreted with caution as there are only two included trials and one of the reviewers (Toouli) has been an author in both studies. We would recommend that sphincterotomy for patients with manometrically proven biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction be considered in the context of new randomised clinical trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further studies by independent groups is recommended. In particular we would recommend studies which include patients with manometrically proven biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction that prospectively randomise patients to sphincterotomy or a sham placebo in a double blind fashion. These studies need to have qualified independent assessors of subject follow up following the intervention and data need to be collected on quality of life, health economics, and adverse events.</P>
