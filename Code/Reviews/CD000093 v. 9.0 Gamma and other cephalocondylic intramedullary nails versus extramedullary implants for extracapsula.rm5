Figures for operative fracture of the femur for Goldahagen and Hofman 1996 have been changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also later fracture of the femur: the fracture of the greater trochanter in Park 1993 has been removed from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the increased numbers lessens the impact of various sensitivity analyses (e.g. overall denominators) it still seems valid at present to show that the basic messages persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing study (Nottingham) is actually suspended at present.

However, there may be a case in a future update for presenting all the short proximal femoral nails together. This would mean a big change in the layout and loose the more detailed accounts of individual nails.

<TITLE>Cephalocondylic intramedullary nails versus extramedullary implants for extracapsular hip fractures in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-07-27 12:57:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Fractures of the thigh bone (femur) just below the hip joint capsule (extracapsular hip fractures) may be surgically fixed using a variety of implants. One particular type of implant is the sliding hip screw, which consists of a screw that is inserted into the upper part of the (femur) to bridge (fix) the fracture. This screw can move within a metal barrel connected to a plate that is screwed to the outside of the femur. Implants of this sort of design are called 'extramedullary'. Intramedullary implants are nails inserted from the top of the femur into the inner cavity of the femur bone ('the medulla') and held in place with screws. This review compared these two types of implants in predominantly older populations.</P>
<P>The main results were for the comparisons of various types of intramedullary nails with the sliding hip screw. Twenty-two trials, involving 3749 participants, tested the Gamma nail. Five trials, involving 623 participants, tested the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). Three trials, involving 394 participants, tested the proximal femoral nail. Other trials involved newer varieties of intramedullary nails. Most older trials showed a tendency for the nails to be associated with an increased risk of fracture of the thigh bone both during and after the operation. More recent trials testing newer varieties of nails seemed to avoid this specific problem to some extent. The review found that using intramedullary nails resulted in one extra reoperation in every 50 people. Mortality and, where data were available, other long-term outcomes were similar between the implants.</P>
<P>The review concluded that current evidence supports the continued use of the sliding hip screw for fixing the more common types of extracapsular hip fractures. This may not be the case for some of the more recently developed designs of intramedullary nails or for specific fracture types, but further research is required to confirm this.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-27 12:30:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>We included 43 trials containing predominantly older people with mainly trochanteric fractures.<BR/>
<BR/>Twenty-two trials (3749 participants) compared the Gamma nail with the sliding hip screw (SHS). The Gamma nail was associated with increased risk of operative and later fracture of the femur and increased reoperation rate. There were no major differences between implants in wound infection, mortality or medical complications.</P>
<P>Five trials (623 participants) compared the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) with the SHS. Fracture fixation complications were more common in the IMHS group. Results for post-operative complications, mortality and functional outcomes were similar in both groups.</P>
<P>Three trials (394 participants) showed no difference in fracture fixation complications, reoperation, wound infection and length of hospital stay for proximal femoral nail (PFN) versus the SHS.</P>
<P>None of the 10 trials (1491 participants) of other nail versus extramedullary implant comparisons for trochanteric fractures provided sufficient evidence to establish definite differences between the implants under test.</P>
<P>Two trials (65 participants) found intramedullary nails were associated with fewer fracture fixation complications than fixed nail plates for unstable fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter.</P>
<P>Two trials (124 participants) found a tendency to less fracture healing complications with the intramedullary nails compared with fixed nail plates for subtrochanteric fractures.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-13 21:52:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With its lower complication rate in comparison with intramedullary nails, and absence of functional outcome data to the contrary, the SHS appears superior for trochanteric fractures. Further studies are required to confirm whether more recently developed designs of intramedullary nail avoid the complications of previous nails. Intramedullary nails may have advantages over fixed angle plates for subtrochanteric and some unstable trochanteric fractures, but further studies are required.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:32:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:32:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Hip fracture is the general term for fracture of the proximal (upper) femur. These fractures can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring within or proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring outside or distal to the hip joint capsule). Extracapsular hip fractures are defined as those fractures of the proximal femur within the area of bone from the attachment of the hip joint capsule to a level of five centimetres below the distal (lower) border of the lesser trochanter.  Other terms used to describe these fractures include trochanteric, subtrochanteric, pertrochanteric and intertrochanteric fractures. As implied above, these terms reflect the proximity of these fractures to the greater and lesser trochanters (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Numerous subdivisions and classification methods exist for these fractures. The most practical classification, and that used for this review, is the basic division into four types: stable trochanteric fractures (AO classification type A1) (<LINK REF="REF-Muller-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muller 1991</LINK>), unstable trochanteric (AO classification type A2), those fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter (transtrochanteric or AO classification type A3) and subtrochanteric fractures. Stable trochanteric fractures are two part fractures in which the fracture line runs obliquely between the lesser and greater trochanter of the femur. Unstable trochanteric fractures again have an oblique fracture line running between the trochanters but in addition there is comminution of the fracture site. The comminution fragments may be the lesser trochanter, greater trochanter or both these parts of the femur. Those fractures at the level of the lesser trochanter (AO A3, transtrochanteric) have a slightly more distally based fracture line which either runs transversely at the level of the lesser trochanter or in an oblique direction that is opposite to that of the stable and unstable trochanteric fractures. These fractures may be two part or comminuted. This fracture pattern allows the femur to be displaced medially due to the pull of the abductor muscles. Subtrochanteric fractures are those fractures in which the fracture crossing the femur is predominately found within the five centimetres of bone immediately below the lesser trochanter. These fractures may be two part or comminuted and, in some instances, the fracture may extend proximally into the trochanteric region or distally into the shaft of the femur.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:32:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Operative treatment of extracapsular hip fractures was introduced in the 1950s using a variety of different implants. Implants may be either extramedullary or intramedullary in nature. The most commonly used extramedullary implant is the sliding hip screw (SHS) which is synonymous with the term compression hip screw and equivalent models such as the Dynamic, Richards or Ambi hip screws. The SHS consists of a lag screw passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head. This lag screw is then attached to a plate on the side of the femur. These are considered 'dynamic' implants as they have the capacity for sliding at the plate/screw junction to allow for collapse at the fracture site. The Medoff plate (<LINK REF="REF-Medoff-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medoff 1991</LINK>) is a modification of the sliding hip screw. The difference is that the plate has an inner and outer sleeve, which can slide between each other. This creates an additional capacity for sliding to occur at the level of the lesser trochanter as well as at the lag screw. Sliding at the lag screw can be prevented with a locking screw to create a 'one way' sliding Medoff instead of a 'two way' sliding Medoff. At a later date the locking device on the lag screw can be removed to 'dynamise' the fracture.</P>
<P>Static implants include the fixed nail plates such as the Jewett and the McLaughlin nail plates. The 90 or 95-degree blade plate is also a static implant of a more recent design. Though, theoretically, the dynamic condylar screw plate has the capacity for sliding at the screw plate junction, it is more likely to act as a fixed device when used at the hip, with no slide occurring.</P>
<P>Intramedullary nails used for internal fixation of extracapsular fractures can either be inserted from distal to proximal (condylocephalic nails) or from proximal to distal (cephalocondylic nails). Condylocephalic nails are inserted at the level of the femoral condyle above the knee and passed across the trochanteric fracture and up into the femoral head. These are the subject of another review (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1998</LINK>). Cephalocondylic nails are inserted through the greater trochanter of the femur and secured by a cross pin or screw which is passed up the femoral neck into the femoral head. Theoretical biomechanical advantages of these intramedullary nails over screw and plate fixation are attributed to a reduced distance between the hip joint and the implant, which diminishes the bending moment across the implant/fracture construct. Examples of these intramedullary nails are the Gamma nail, the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS), the proximal femoral nail (PFN), the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA), the Targon PF (proximal femoral) nail, the Holland nail and the Kuntscher-Y nail (<LINK REF="REF-Cuthbert-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuthbert 1976</LINK>). These nails plus an experimental nail tested in <LINK REF="STD-Dujardin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dujardin 2001</LINK> are described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. A review comparing different intramedullary nails for these fractures is available (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 2006</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-09 16:24:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The controversy over the choice of implant, specifically the use of intramedullary nails versus sliding hip screws, for extracapsular hip fractures continues. Indeed, recent studies reporting a rapid increase in the use of intramedullary nails in the USA have pointed out, citing this review, that this phenomenon is not supported by the available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Anglen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anglen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forte-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forte 2008</LINK>). The availability of new evidence, often on new implants that are aimed at avoiding the complications, specifically operative and later femoral fracture, of intramedullary fixation, point to the need for this update of our review, which continues to compare different types of cephalocondylic nails with extramedullary implants.</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-07-07 21:48:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the relative effects of cephalocondylic intramedullary nails versus extramedullary fixation implants for treating extracapsular proximal femoral (hip) fractures in adults. Effects were assessed in terms of 'operative details' (duration of surgery, exposure to ionising radiation, blood loss); 'fracture fixation complications', including wound infection; 'post-operative complications' and length of hospital stay; 'anatomical restoration'; and 'final outcome measures' (mortality, functional outcome and pain). </P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-07-08 12:57:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>In the update of the review (2010), three aspects of risk of bias were assessed by one author (HH) and reported. These were sequence generation, allocation concealment and surgeons' experience with the devices. In this assessment, incomplete or a lack of information on sequence generation or allocation concealment was judged as 'unclear' risk of bias unless the trial was quasi-randomised, in which case both were rated 'no'. For risk of bias related to surgeons' experience with the devices prior to commencement of the trial, this was generally rated as 'high' where there was a lack of information on measures taken to avoid learning curve problems, often in the context of a large number of operating surgeons.</P>
<P>In addition, both authors independently assessed, without masking, each trial for 11 aspects of internal and external validity (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion.

<P>We recognised the possibility that developments of individual intramedullary or extramedullary implant designs, and implants produced by different manufacturers, while possessing many common features, might show some differences in effectiveness or adverse effects.

These enable readers to inspect the data, but where appropriate, we have explored the possibility that implant types do perform differently by performing test for subgroup differences. Some exploratory subgroup analyses, based on allocation concealment and the reportage of surgical experience, were performed to test potential bias.

These judgements were dependent to a great extent on the quality of reporting of trials and whether clarification had been received from authors on the method of randomisation and surgeons' experience. Low risk of bias judgements on sequence generation were assigned to 14 trials (33%) and on allocation concealment for eight trials (19%). Only five trials provided sufficient evidence of adequate sequence generation and allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Baumgaertner-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Baumgaertner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davis-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Davis 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ovesen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ovesen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pajarinen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pajarinen 2005</LINK>).

Though <LINK REF="STD-Haynes-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Haynes 1996</LINK> used randomisation cards, allocation concealment was deemed unlikely as the imbalance in the treatment group numbers was attributed to surgeons withdrawing a patient from the trial when they considered themselves unfamiliar with the Gamma nail.

<P>Brief details of surgical experience (item 5) as reported for individual trials are given in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.

<P>These are presented by the type of cephalocondylic nail being compared with the extramedullary plate device (sliding hip screw, the Medoff plate, or the percutaneous compression plate) and, for four studies, a fixed nail plate (dynamic condylar screw or blade plate). The outcome measures listed earlier were sought for all studies and, where available, results are presented in the analyses. Reported outcomes are also listed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. The key pooled outcomes for all except two (see below) of the femoral nails versus the sliding hip screw are given first, followed by the results for each type of nail. The experimental nature, including the lack of commercial availability, of the mini-invasive intramedullary nail should be noted when viewing the results of this trial and was the reason for not including it at present in the pooled femoral nail analysis. The results for the Kuntscher-Y nail were also not pooled with the other nails because this earlier version of a cephalocondylic nail does not have the capacity for distal locking.</P>
<P>The included trials generally used similar outcome measures with regard to surgical fixation failure and operative details. Wound infection was usually more difficult to quantify and it was not possible to differentiate between superficial and deep wound infection for many of the trials. Mortality was taken as that which occurred within the follow-up period for each study. The outcome measures of residual pain, change in mobility and function are more difficult to quantify and were recorded in far fewer trials. Moreover, because no standardised assessment was used for all trials, only a limited evaluation was possible for these outcomes. Data from each trial which could be pooled are presented graphically. As reported in Methods, we performed sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of our choice for denominators when these were not clearly stated in trial reports. No significant changes in the pooled results were encountered.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:19:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-07-27 13:42:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>The use of the Gamma nail for stabilisation of stable or unstable trochanteric (AO type A1 and A2) fractures, although an attractive biomechanical concept, has been associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events (intra-operative and later fracture around or below the implant). Of these two complications, later fracture is more devastating for the patient as it requires either major revision surgery or a prolonged period of traction and bed rest. Results from randomised trials comparing the Intramedullary Hip Screw (IMHS) with the SHS suggest that this implant has been associated with similar complications. There is insufficient evidence to say whether more recent development of the Gamma nail (Trochanteric Gamma nail), or of other designs, has overcome these adverse effects. It is, however, notable that the more recent trials evaluating newer intramedullary nails devices (<LINK REF="STD-Barton-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Barton 2010</LINK>: Long Gamma nail; <LINK REF="STD-Giraud-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Giraud 2005</LINK>: Targon PF nail; <LINK REF="STD-Little-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Little 2008</LINK>: Holland nail; <LINK REF="STD-Pajarinen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pajarinen 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Papasimos-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Papasimos 2005</LINK>: PFN nail; <LINK REF="STD-Zou-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Zou 2009</LINK>: PNFA nail) have not reported either operative fracture and later femur fracture. This raises the possibility that there have been improvements to the design of the nails that now make the results for the incidence of fracture healing complications comparable to that of the SHS. But, despite the recent inclusion in the review of trials of the newer implants, overall pooled data from trial comparing femoral nails versus the sliding hip screw still point to an increased risk of one extra reoperation in every 50 patients (95% CI 1 in 33 to 1 in 100) with trochanteric fractures treated with an intramedullary nail.</P>
<P>There is no evidence of superiority of intramedullary devices in respect of fracture union, or cut-out of the fixation screw in the femoral head, a feature of both intramedullary and extramedullary devices.</P>
<P>Neither is there definite evidence for any difference in mortality nor, based on incomplete evidence, patient functional outcomes between the two types of implant.</P>
<P>For fractures occurring at the level of the lesser trochanter (AO type A3 - transverse and reverse obliquity fractures) types, the intramedullary nails were associated with better results, in comparison with extramedullary devices, for length of surgery, transfusion requirements, fixation failure rate, reoperation rate and hospital stay. Final outcome measures appeared to be similar between the two groups. Although based on results from two trials including a total of 65 participants, it appears likely that an intramedullary nail may give superior results to those of static plate fixation for these fractures.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-08-02 11:19:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Lack of consistency and other deficiencies in the reporting of functional outcomes, and the limited use of validated measures are disappointing features of the body of trials included in this review. Inclusion of meaningful health related quality of life measures, and validated lower limb function scores have only recently begun to be reported in a few studies. Many of the outcomes reported have been intermediate, or concerned with process. The general adoption of an agreed set of outcomes for trials comparing the effectiveness of different implant designs would be a useful development.</P>
<P>We were unable to obtain adequate information from the included studies to make any distinction in outcome for unstable versus stable trochanteric fractures; nor separate data for those studies that included subtrochanteric fractures. This situation is unhelpful for clinical practice and a source of continuing frustration. Recognising this, in our next update we will consider the potential for presenting a summary of the evidence based on fracture type, backed up by some exploratory subgroup analyses. Intramedullary devices may have advantages for selected fracture types such as subtrochanteric fractures and trochanteric fractures with a reversed obliquity fracture line. Further studies are required to clarify if the Gamma nail, or another intramedullary nail, is superior for these fractures.</P>
<P>In evaluating the effectiveness of surgical implants, the experience and technique of the surgeon are believed to be important variables. For example, inadequate reaming and the use of excessive force on nail insertion have been implicated as the cause of femoral fracture. The problem of a learning curve for a new implant may jeopardise effective assessment within randomised trials. Thus it may be that some of the complications experienced with the Gamma nail would not have occurred had the surgeons been as familiar with the operative technique as they were with the SHS, the more established implant. Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Benum-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Benum 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldhagen-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Goldhagen 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guyer-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Guyer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Hoffman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Utrilla-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Utrilla 2005</LINK>) specifically referred to a learning curve for Gamma nail insertion, and a further trial (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Brien-1995" TYPE="STUDY">O'Brien 1995</LINK>) mentioned a performance bias with regards to surgery. However, our exploration of apparent surgical experience in subgroup analysis did not confirm any evidence of significant difference; it remains uncertain whether refining of operative technique and more rigorous training, or changes in implant design, will be the dominant factor in reducing the risk of later fracture of the femur. There were insufficient data to examine this issue for other comparisons.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2010-07-15 10:19:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Forty-three studies (with data from 5750 participants) were included. With an average size of 134 participants, many individual studies lacked power to identify differences between the outcomes of the interventions compared.</P>
<P>Twenty-three of the 43 studies were considered at high risk of bias on the grounds of lack of experience of the surgeons with the newer technology, or disparate experiences of the operative procedures by the operating surgeons. Ten out of 43 trials were at high risk of bias on the grounds of inadequate concealment of allocation. Overall, 31 trials provided insufficient evidence to make a judgment on one or more of the three risk of bias items.</P>
<P>Despite these limitations, the evidence of increased risk of operative or later fracture of the femur associated with the use of intramedullary fixation of trochanteric fractures of the femur is consistent, and in view of the negligible heterogeneity amongst the studies, may be considered robust. A similar lack of heterogeneity supports the findings of a lack of differences between implants for other fracture healing complications and mortality. However, for other outcomes, in particular functional outcomes and morbidity, more limited and incomplete reporting of results and the lack of consistent and validated measures limit our ability to pool data and draw conclusions.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-07-15 14:23:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>We searched widely, without imposing restrictions on language or publication status, but it remains possible that we may have missed some relevant studies. These may, for instance, have been unpublished trials, raising the possibility of publication bias, or not published in journals listed in the main databases. However, our scrutiny of other reviews and articles on this topic over the years has been reassuring in that these have not identified trials of which we had not been aware already. We have also contacted authors for clarification of methods and data as well as authors of ongoing trials. We anticipate, however, that unpublished data from early studies, which might have augmented some comparisons, may not now be available. The potential impact of these data on the review findings is now considerably less than for previous versions of the review. Our selection procedures were rigorous and both authors participated fully in all stages of the review.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:33:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-07-20 15:26:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the management of trochanteric fractures (AO type A1 or A2), accumulated data from randomised controlled trials available up to April 2010 show no evidence of advantages to patients from the use of the Gamma nail, Intramedullary Hip Screw (IMHS) or other types of cephalocondylic intramedullary nails when compared with extramedullary implants of the sliding hip screw (SHS) design. </P>
<P>The use of the Gamma nail has been associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events (intra-operative and later fracture around or below the implant), and results from randomised trials comparing the Intramedullary Hip Screw (IMHS) with the SHS suggest that this implant suffers from similar complications. While it is plausible that more recent designs of intramedullary nail might reduce the frequency of these specific complications, published evidence has not so far demonstrated either equivalence with, or superiority over the SHS in respect of these complications, or of functional advantage for patients. Despite the recent inclusion in the review of trials of the newer implants, pooled data still point to an increased risk of one extra reoperation in every 50 patients with trochanteric fractures treated with an intramedullary nail.</P>
<P>Intramedullary nails may have advantages over extramedullary fixation using fixed angle plates for more distal reverse and transverse transtrochanteric (AO type A3) fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures, although there is as yet insufficient evidence to confirm significant superiority over extramedullary devices.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-07-27 11:33:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Appropriate directions for future research include the role of intramedullary nails in subtrochanteric and reversed-obliquity trochanteric fractures. Design changes to different types of intramedullary nails, claimed to reduce the risk of post-operative fracture, should be tested versus the SHS in studies which record functional outcomes at a minimum of six months from surgery, are adequately powered to be capable of demonstrating both equivalence and difference, and meet the CONSORT criteria for design and reporting of non-pharmacological studies (<LINK REF="REF-Boutron-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutron 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Particular deficiencies in the published literature are poor concealment of allocation, failure to report outcomes related to fracture type and limited information on participants who withdrew or for whom follow-up was incomplete, lack of blinded assessment of functional outcomes, limited reporting of functional outcomes and patient-derived quality of life measures, and insufficiently long follow-up. For trials comparing different surgical implants, the development of a benchmark set of outcomes, and concurrent economic evaluation are warranted.</P>

<P>In the update of the review (2010) we made two key changes to Methods.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The outcome "all technical complications of fixation" is no longer presented. This reflected concerns voiced by one editor regarding potential unit of analysis problems, where some participants may have experienced more than one of the major complications of fracture healing, and the general problems of composite outcomes. It is possible that, after further checks of the data, we may reintroduce a similar outcome measure to account for major complications of fracture healing that generally require revision surgery or a change of surgical procedure during the primary operation, such as using a longer nail, but where a reoperation was not performed.</LI>

<P>A report (2002) of the results for patients with trochanteric fractures from all five centres of this study is now available. It is however less comprehensive than the report, used in previous versions of this review, by Fornander et al 1994 which gave the results for two centres and 209 patients, including 19 with subtrochanteric fractures. Fornander also provided a pre-publication report and additional information for these two centres.</P>
<P>Clarification on results and methods from Leif Ahrengart is pending (September 2003).</P>
<P>Given the absence of information on 66 patients lost to follow-up in the five centre report and some lack of clarity or potential inconsistencies with the two centre study regarding surgical experience, trial inclusion criteria, outcome definitions and some results (i.e. there was one deep wound infection in the SHS group in <LINK REF="REF-Fornander-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fornander 1994</LINK> but none in the five-centre report), we have kept the data from the two centre report.</P>

<P>Slight confusion with use of patient or fracture numbers in the trial report. Trialist explained that 4 patients had 2 fractures which were operated on several months apart (they were not bilateral fractures). These were considered separate operations and different cases for pre-op and operative data. Two of the 4 patients received both IMHS and SHS, and were excluded from longer term follow-up data but not mortality (where they were only counted once in the analysis).<BR/>Curtin's abstract reporting early results for 70 patients shows the dangers of interim trial reports.</P>

<P>This was a randomised trial of 75 people with stable trochanteric fracture: 25 were treated with a sliding hip screw 25 with a Gamma nail and 25 with a Gamma nail with a modification of the surgical technique using a 4.5 mm drill hole in the lateral femur approximately 5 cm distal to the tip of the nail. The aim was to determine if the drill hole would reduce the risk of bone marrow vascular embolism. The only outcome measure was the degree of marrow embolisation as determined by transoesophageal ultrasound. The results indicated minimal bone marrow embolisation with the SHS and mild embolisation with the Gamma nail inserted with a distal femoral drill hole. For the 25 people treated with the Gamma nail inserted without a drill hole there was heavy bone marrow embolisation as judged by ultrasound.</P>

<P>Gamma nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Gamma nail (Howmedica Ltd) was introduced in the late 1980s for the treatment of extracapsular hip fractures. The implant consists of a sliding lag screw which passes through a short intramedullary nail. One or two screws may be passed through the nail tip to secure it to the femoral shaft (distal locking). Theoretical advantages of this implant are due to a percutaneous insertion technique and include reduced blood loss, reduced sepsis, minimal tissue trauma and short operating time. Modifications to the design of the Gamma nail and its instrumentation have occurred since its introduction. The trochanteric Gamma nail is referred to as a third generation Gamma nail. It is shorter in length than the standard Gamma nail (200 mm versus 180 mm), has a lower mediolateral curvature (4 degrees) and has a diameter of 17 mm proximally and 11 mm distally. The long Gamma nail has a range of different lengths from 280 to 460 mm with two distal locking screws.</P>

<P>Intramedullary hip screw (IMHS)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The IMHS (Richards Medical Ltd) - length 210 mm - was introduced in 1995 for the treatment of extracapsular femoral fractures. Like the Gamma nail, it consists of a nail inserted via the greater trochanter into the medullary cavity and a lag screw, which is passed up the femoral neck to the head.</P>

<P>The PFN (Synthes Ltd) - length 240 mm - was introduced in 1998 for the treatment of extracapsular fractures. Like the Gamma and IMHS, it consists of a nail inserted via the greater trochanter in to the medullary cavity. Two proximal lag screws are passed up the femoral neck to the head.</P>

<P>Holland nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">

<P>Experimental nail (reported in <LINK REF="STD-Dujardin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dujardin 2001</LINK>)</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>An experimental mini-invasive static intramedullary nail, which is not commercially available, is reported in <LINK REF="STD-Dujardin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Dujardin 2001</LINK>. This consists of an intramedullary nail which is 170 millimetres long with a distal diameter of 12 millimetres and a proximal diameter of 13 millimetres. There are two five millimetre distal locking holes. The proximal hold of the femur is with two seven millimetre cannulated screws which diverge at a 30 degrees angle. Unlike the other proximal femoral nails, there is no sliding mechanism within the nail construct.</P>

<P>Kuntscher-Y nail</P>
</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>The Kuntscher-Y nail (<LINK REF="REF-Cuthbert-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cuthbert 1976</LINK>) is an early design of an intramedullary nail. It consists of a side arm and a separate slotted Kuntscher nail. The side arm is passed up the femoral neck, and then attached to an alignment jig to enable a slotted Kuntscher nail to be passed via the greater trochanter through a hole in the side arm and distally within the medullary cavity. The assembled implant construct has no capacity for sliding at the side arm and neither has it the capacity for distal locking.</P>
