<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:05:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic illness where patients suffer from diarrhea, weight loss or stomach pain resulting from inflammation in the intestine. The illness often requires patients to undergo surgery in order to remove inflamed segments of intestine, but inflammation frequently returns at the site of surgery. This review examines the results of published studies which have looked at the effect of using medication following surgery for Crohn's disease as a mean of preventing the return (recurrence) of inflammation. Where possible, the results of studies were combined to compare the results of different treatments. A number of medications appeared to reduce the recurrence of inflammation, including metronidazole, mesalamine, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and infliximab. Given that some of these medications have significant side-effects, the decision to use them requires a careful balancing of the risks and benefits for each individual patient</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:28:16 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion. Probiotics were not superior to placebo for any outcome measured. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT=4) and endoscopic (RR 0.44; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.74, NNT = 4) recurrence relative to placebo. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.7). Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94, NNT = 12), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84, NNT = 8) when compared to placebo. Azathioprine/6MP was also associated with a significantly reduced risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7), and severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4), when compared to placebo. Neither agent had a higher risk than placebo of serious adverse events. When compared to azathioprine/6MP, mesalamine was associated with a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06), but a lower risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89). There was no significant difference between mesalamine and azathioprine/6MP for any other outcome. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:28:18 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There are insufficient randomised controlled trials of infliximab, budesonide, tenovil and interleukin-10 to draw conclusions. Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine and immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab all appear to be superior to placebo for the prevention of post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The cost, toxicity and tolerability of these approaches require careful consideration to determine the optimal approach for post-operative prophylaxis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:28:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory process that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal system. Most series report approximately 30% of CD cases affect the small intestine only (usually the terminal ileum), 30% affect the colon only, and 40% have ileocolonic involvement. This spectrum results in a range of modes of clinical presentation. The pathologic process itself is characterized by transmural inflammation resulting in complications such as strictures, fistulae, and abscess formation.</P>
<P>Multiple medical treatments targeting this inflammation have been used to induce and maintain remission in CD. Although evidence of efficacy is lacking, antibiotics or 5-ASA agents are commonly used in mild-moderate ileal and colonic disease respectively. More aggressive disease is treated with steroids, immunosuppressives (such as azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate) or biologic agents (such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and natalizumab). Response rates for most medical treatments are up to 70%, and 1 year remission rates are 50% at best (<LINK REF="REF-Travis-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travis 2006</LINK>). Only some of these agents have been shown to reduce the risk of surgery and hospitalization.</P>
<P>Patients with CD may require surgery due to complications (such as strictures or fistulae) or due to disease that is refractory to medical therapy. Surgical intervention rates are traditionally in the order of 70% after 10 years from diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bernell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernell 2000</LINK>). Operative management can be effective for managing disease complications and improving quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Delaney-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delaney 2003</LINK>), but it does not eliminate the pathogenic process, as most patients develop recurrence of the disease. Approximately 70 to 80% of patients experience endoscopic recurrence within 1 year of surgery and the severity of endoscopic inflammation correlates well with risk of subsequent clinical recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Olaison-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olaison 1992</LINK>). Without further treatment, 25-30% of postoperative CD patients will require further surgery within 5 years (<LINK REF="REF-Larson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larson 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The relatively high rates of disease recurrence following surgically-induced remission have prompted increasing focus on interventions to prevent post-operative recurrence. Some clinicians view medical intervention following surgical resection as the best opportunity to attempt to modify the natural history of the disease, by institution of anti-inflammatory therapy before the disease recurs in the unaffected intestine. A range of treatment options have been evaluated in this specific context but, for the moment, there in no consensus on the optimal approach. This systematic review was undertaken to assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials of medical interventions for post-operative prophylaxis with the goal of guiding an optimal approach to therapy in these circumstances.</P>

</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients with Crohn's disease who have undergone surgical resection (ileal resection, ileo-colonic resection, colonic resection) and were subsequently commenced on medical therapy to prevent recurrence of the disease. Cases where surgery was performed with resection of diseased segments and anastomosis of non-involved intestines were considered "surgical resection".</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:28:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The following interventions in the post-operative prevention of Crohn's disease were considered; Mesalamine (mesalazine), 5-aminosalicyclate, sulfasalazine (sulphasalazine), metronidazole, ornidazole, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrexate, probiotics, enteral nutrition, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and natalizumab.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-08-07 10:23:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary outcome measure was clinical recurrence. There was no universal definition of clinical recurrence used, but all studies required the presence of inflammatory symptoms with or without a defined increase in CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index). Secondary outcome measures were endoscopic recurrence (as assessed by Rutgeerts endoscopic index, <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1990</LINK>), surgical recurrence, patient withdrawal, and serious adverse events.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:28:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Searches were conducted to identify all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Articles published in any language were considered for inclusion. The following electronic databases were searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (2008) MEDLINE (1966 to February 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2009).</P>
<P>The following search strategy was constructed by using a combination of MeSH subject headings and text-words relating to the use of medical therapy for the prevention of recurrence of Crohn's disease: Crohn's disease, recurrence, post-operative, surgery, prevention, aminosalicylate, sulfasalazine (sulphasalazine), mesalamine (mesalazine), azathioprine, 6-MP, probiotics, enteral nutrition, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, natalizumab. The standard Cochrane search strategy filter for identifying randomised controlled trials was applied to all searches.</P>
<P>Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were hand-searched to identify further relevant trials. Published abstracts from conference proceedings from Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) were hand-searched. In addition members of the Cochrane IBD/FBD Group, and experts in the field were contacted and asked to provide details of clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials.</P>

<P>
<B>Trial Selection</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (SP and GB) independently scanned the abstract of every trial identified by the search to determine eligibility. Blinding to source was not performed. Full articles were selected for further assessment if the abstract suggested the study included patients with postoperative Crohn's disease and compared prophylactic medical treatments with each other or placebo. If these criteria were unclear from the abstract, the full article was retrieved for clarification. Papers not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion, and if required, by consultation with the senior author (AM).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Assessment of Trials</B>
</P>
<P>Two authors (GD and GB) independently assessed methodological quality, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Briefly, an assessment was made of the method of allocation generation (i.e. was the allocation sequence adequately generated?), allocation concealment (i.e. was allocation adequately concealed?), blinding (i.e. was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?), incomplete outcome data (i.e. were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?); and selective outcome reporting (i.e. are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?). The authors also examined the similarity of groups at baseline and follow up. A judgement of 'Yes' indicates low risk of bias, 'No' indicates high risk of bias, and 'Unclear' indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion, and if required, by consultation with the senior author (AM). </P>

<B>Statistical Analyses</B>
<BR/>Data were analysed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.0.21). All data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; given the preventive nature of therapy in all studies, patient who were lost to follow up could equally be in remission as treatment failures. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test. A value of P &lt; 0.10 was considered statistically significant. I<SUP>2</SUP> values were also calculated for each comparison. Data were pooled for meta-analysis if the outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus of authors) and data were homogenous (determined by the degree of clinical and statistical heterogeneity). A fixed effects model was used to pool data if the data were not statistically heterogenous, otherwise a random effects model was used. Dichotomous data were summarised using the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated where informative. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all outcomes.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:29:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Using the search criteria as outlined, 110 studies were identified for potential inclusion. Of these studies, 87 were excluded for various reasons. Sixty-one were excluded because they were not randomised controlled trials. Twelve studies were excluded because they evaluated treatment rather than prevention of post-operative recurrence. Seven studies were excluded because they reported the outcomes of a non-medical intervention. Duplicate reports of results of the same study from different sources were identified in five cases and were excluded. After detailed review, two randomised studies were excluded due to the absence of a placebo control and inadequate blinding (<LINK REF="STD-Bergman-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Bergman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 1994</LINK>). Twenty-three randomised controlled trials were identified which fulfilled all of the search criteria and were suitable for inclusion in the final analysis.</P>

<P>Allocation concealment was judged to be adequate in 11 of the 23 studies identified for inclusion and was judged inadequate or unclear in the other studies. Jadad quality scores (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>) for all of the included studies are reported in the relevant 'characteristics of included studies' tables. The Cochrane risk of bias tool indicates that the risk of bias is low for 11 of the 23 included studies.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:29:33 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>Probiotics</B>
<BR/>Five studies were identified which evaluated the effect of probiotics. Two studies evaluated the effect of <I>Lactobacillus johnsonii</I> (LA1) (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Gossum-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Van Gossum 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marteau-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Marteau 2006</LINK>). One study examined to effect of <I>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</I> strain GG (LGG) (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 2002</LINK>). Two studies evaluated the use of probiotic cocktails, one looked at 'Synbiotic 2000' (a cocktail of four probiotics and four prebiotics) (<LINK REF="STD-Chermesh-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chermesh 2007</LINK>) and the second, reported in abstract form only, looked at VSL#3, a cocktail of four strains of <I>lactobacilli</I>, three strains of <I>bifidobacteria</I> and <I>streptococcus thermophilus</I> (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 2008</LINK>). None of the individual studies showed a significant effect of probiotic use and meta-analysis of the effects of probiotics as a class suggested that their effect was no different than placebo. The relative risk of clinical recurrence with any probiotic relative to placebo (n = 213) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.59 to 3.36; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>) and the relative risks of severe endoscopic recurrence (n = 333; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>) or any endoscopic recurrence (n = 213) were 0.96 (95% CI 0.58 to 1.59) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29) respectively (<LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). The risk of withdrawal and serious adverse events were similar. Sensitivity analysis performed by comparing interventions (single vs. multiple strains), analysis methods (fixed vs. random effects, odds ratio vs. relative risk) and study risk of bias (high vs. low) did not affect the results of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Antibiotics</B>
<BR/>Two studies evaluated the efficacy of nitroimidazole antibiotics for prevention of post-operative recurrence. An initial trial by <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 1995</LINK> randomised 60 patients to receive metronidazole 20 mg/kg or placebo for 3 months, with follow up to 3 years. A subsequent trial <LINK REF="STD-Rutgeerts-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rutgeerts 2005</LINK> randomised 80 patients to receive another nitroimidazole agent, ornidazole (1 g/day) or placebo for 12 months. While the duration of treatment differed and outcomes were assessed over different periods, some comparisons were possible. Overall the relative risk of severe endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts score I2 or greater) at 3 months was reduced in the treatment groups relative to placebo (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.74; n=140; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). The risk of clinical recurrence at one year was also significantly less with treatment relative to placebo (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, NNT=4; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). Sensitivity analysis performed by comparing interventions (metronidazole vs. ornidazole), analysis methods (fixed vs. random effects, odds ratio vs. relative risk) and study risk of bias (high vs. low) suggested that the relative risk of clinical recurrence was no longer statistically significant if only metronidazole was used (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.2). Patient withdrawal (RR 3.00; 95% CI 1.37 to 6.58; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK> ) and adverse events (RR 2.39; 95% CI 1.54 to 3.70) were both significantly greater with nitroimidazole therapy relative to placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>Mesalamine (Mesalazine) </B>
<BR/>Six studies were identified which examined the effect of mesalamine compared to placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Brignola-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Brignola 1995</LINK> randomised 87 patients to receive mesalamine 3 g/day or placebo for 12 months following ileal or ileo-colonic resection. <LINK REF="STD-Florent-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Florent 1996</LINK> reported endoscopic recurrence rates at 3 months for 126 patients randomised to either mesalamine 3 g/day or placebo following curative ileal/colonic resction. A study by <LINK REF="STD-Lochs-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lochs 2000</LINK> recruited patients following resectional surgery for Crohn's disease at any site and randomised 324 of them to treatment with mesalamine 4 g/day or placebo for 18 months with clinical recurrence within 18 months as the primary end-point. Cumulative clinical recurrence rates are reported by a final study by <LINK REF="STD-McLeod-1995" TYPE="STUDY">McLeod 1995</LINK> who randomised 163 patients to receive either mesalamine 3 g/day or placebo to for up to 72 months following resectional surgery for Crohn's disease. A study by <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2004</LINK> which evaluated the effect of either 6-mercaptopurine or mesalamine compared to placebo is outlined below (See Immunosuppressives). A study by <LINK REF="STD-Fiasse-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Fiasse 1991</LINK> and colleagues was only available for review in abstract form and due to lack of detail, the findings could not be incorporated into a meta-analysis of the effects of mesalamine.</P>
<P>Taking together the results of the five studies (n = 652) from which data could be extracted (including the comparison of mesalamine to placebo by <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2004</LINK>) the relative risk of clinical recurrence was reduced with mesalamine compared to placebo 0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>). The NNT to prevent a single clinical recurrence was 12. The relative risk for endoscopic recurrence showed similar trends. While the relative risk of any endoscopic recurrence was not significantly reduced with mesalamine (0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.13; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>), the relative risk of severe endoscopic recurrence was significantly less (0.50; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84) with a NNT of 8 (<LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>). There was significant heterogeneity in the time-points for reporting of both clinical and endoscopic recurrence. Patient withdrawal was not increased with mesalamine compared to placebo (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.39) and neither was risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.66). Sensitivity analysis performed by comparing interventions (4g vs. 3g of mesalamine), analysis methods (fixed vs. random effects, odds ratio vs. relative risk) and study risk of bias (high vs. low) did not affect the results of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>An additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2003</LINK>) compared the effect of high dose (4 g/day) versus low dose (2.4 g/day) mesalamine (with placebo control for the additional dosing) for one year following ileo-colonic resection. Two hundred and six patients were randomised. There was no difference in the rate of clinical recurrence at 1 year (11/101 randomised to high dose versus 13/105 randomised to low dose). While the rate of any endoscopic recurrence at one year was statistically greater in the low dose group (50/81; 62% versus 39/84; 46%, P = 0.04), there was no significant difference in the rate of severe endoscopic recurrence.</P>
<P>
<B>Sulphasalazine</B>
<BR/>One study was identified which evaluated the effect of sulphasalazine (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1989</LINK>), reporting the results of a multicentre trial of 232 patients with Crohn's disease randomised to undergo radical or non-radical resection followed by medical treatment with sulphasalazine 3 g/day or placebo. An early difference in the rate of recurrence (identified by either clinical, radiologic or endoscopic means) was observed with sulphasalazine at one year (18/111, 16% recurrence with sulphasalazine compared to 34/121, 28% with placebo). Significant loss to follow up and withdrawals beyond this time point made subsequent results difficult to interpret. The definition of 'recurrence' used in this study differed significantly from that employed in the other 5ASA studies and therefore it was not judged appropriate to incorporate this study into a broader meta-analysis of the effects of 5-aminosalicyclates.</P>
<P>
<B>Immunosuppressives</B>
<BR/>Four studies evaluated the use of purine antimetabolites compared to mesalamine and/or placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Herfarth-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Herfarth 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nos 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Ardizzone-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ardizzone 2004</LINK> randomised 140 patients to receive azathioprine 2 mg/kg or mesalamine 3 g/day for 24 months and recorded rates of clinical and surgical recurrence. <LINK REF="STD-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hanauer 2004</LINK> performed a three way comparison of 6-mercaptopurine 50 mg, mesalamine 3 g/day or placebo for 24 months examining clinical, endoscopic and radiological recurrence. <LINK REF="STD-Herfarth-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Herfarth 2006</LINK> reported results of a placebo controlled comparison of azathioprine 2 to 2.5 mg/kg versus mesalamine 4 g/day which was terminated early due to concerns regarding sample size. <LINK REF="STD-Nos-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nos 2000</LINK> and colleagues failed to detect significant differences in clinical or morphological recurrence between patients receiving azathioprine 50 mg daily or mesalamine 3 g/day in a study which randomised 39 patients to treatment following ileal or ileo-cecal resection. A further single placebo controlled study was also identified which examined the effect of azathioprine (compared to placebo) given in combination with initial metronidazole (<LINK REF="STD-D_x0027_Haens-2008" TYPE="STUDY">D'Haens 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness of azathioprine/6-MP relative to mesalamine demonstrated no significant increase in the relative risk of clinical recurrence within 12 months (n = 349) or 24 months (n = 270) with mesalamine (12 month RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.95 to 2.16; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>; 24 month RR 1.31; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.81; <LINK REF="FIG-12" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 12</LINK>). While the relative risk of any endoscopic recurrence at 12 months was significantly increased with mesalamine relative to azathioprine/6-MP (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.06; <LINK REF="FIG-13" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 13</LINK>), the effect was no longer significant for more severe degrees of endoscopic recurrence (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). Serious adverse events were significantly less with mesalamine than azathioprine/6MP (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.89) <LINK REF="CMP-004.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.7</LINK>.</P>
<P>In the two studies which included a placebo comparison (n = 168), azathioprine/6MP reduced the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92, NNT = 7; <LINK REF="FIG-14" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 14</LINK>) and was also associated with a reduced risk of severe endoscopic recurrence (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, NNT = 4; <LINK REF="FIG-15" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 15</LINK>). When compared to placebo alone the risk of serious adverse events was not significantly increased with azathioprine/6MP (RR 1.61; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.66; <LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>), however in a comparison of azathioprine/6MP compared to other interventions (mesalamine or placebo), the risk of adverse events did appear significantly increased (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.16 to 3.02; <LINK REF="CMP-006.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis performed by comparing interventions (fixed vs. weight-based dose), analysis methods (fixed vs. random effects, odds ratio vs. relative risk) and study risk of bias (high vs. low) did not affect the results of the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>Other interventions</B>
<BR/>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Colombel-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Colombel 2001</LINK>) examined the effect of treatment with interleukin 10 (IL-10; Tenovil) on rates of endoscopic recurrence at 12 weeks following curative ileal or ileo-colonic resection with primary anastomosis . 17/37 (n = 43) of treated patients who underwent colonoscopy at 12 weeks had evidence of endoscopic recurrence, compared to 11/21 (n = 22) of patients who received placebo. The difference was not significant and neither were rates of severe endoscopic recurrence or clinical recurrence at 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Two studies were identified which examined the effect of (modified release) oral budesonide therapy on rates of post-operative recurrence. The larger of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hellers-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hellers 1999</LINK>) randomised 130 patients to treatment with either controlled ileal release budesonide, 6 mg daily or placebo for twelve months following ileocolonic resection. The withdrawal rate was high (n = 41). The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Ewe-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Ewe 1999</LINK>) examined the impact on clinical and endoscopic recurrence of modified release budesonide (at a dose of 3 mg daily) or placebo. The withdrawal rate was once again high (31 of 83 did not complete the study). Taken together (n = 212), the relative risk of severe endoscopic recurrence at 12 months was not significantly different with budesonide relative to placebo (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.49; <LINK REF="FIG-18" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 18</LINK>).</P>
<P>A recent randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Regueiro-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Regueiro 2009</LINK>) in individuals at high risk of recurrence, evaluated the use of anti-TNF therapy in the form of infliximab (5 mg/kg) given as induction and maintenance therapy for 54 weeks. The study was small (n = 24) but well-designed. Infliximab use was associated with a endoscopic recurrence rate of 9%, compared with 85% in patients on placebo. The clinical remission rates were 80% with infliximab and 54% with placebo.<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:29:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Many patients with Crohn's disease require surgical resection of their disease at some stage and disease recurrence after surgery is common. There has been interest for some time in devising strategies to alter this aspect of the natural history of the disorder in order to achieve sustained post-operative remission. A range of interventions have been suggested to reduce post-operative recurrence and many have been evaluated by randomised controlled clinical trials. This systematic review critically evaluates the published data in this area.</P>
<P>Clinical recurrence was chosen as our primary focus as this constitutes the most meaningful outcome measure. We accepted the definition of clinical recurrence reported in studies despite some heterogeneity and some variation in the time frame of treatment for some interventions (e.g. mesalamine). Definition of endoscopic recurrence (the other important outcome) was less problematic due to the near universal acceptance of the Rutgeerts scoring system (<LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1990</LINK>), though the threshold for defining severity varied somewhat. We also set out to systematically review the impact of therapy on surgical recurrence, but this outcome was not reported with sufficient frequency to perform a meaningful meta-analysis of any specific intervention. We also reviewed whether withdrawal rates or rates of adverse events were increased with specific interventions.</P>
<P>There has been much interest in the role of enteric microflora in the pathobiology of inflammatory bowel disease, and post-operative recurrence may be influenced by the presence or absence of certain bacterial species (<LINK REF="REF-Sokol-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sokol 2008</LINK>). Both probiotic species and antibiotic agents have been evaluated in the post-operative setting. While there is significant heterogeneity in the probiotic formulations which have been trialed, these studies have neither individually nor collectively demonstrated any impact on either endoscopic or clinical recurrence rates. In contrast, antibiotic therapy with nitroimidazole agents appear better than placebo in two studies with NNT=4 to prevent a single clinical recurrence at one year. However, withdrawal rates and adverse events were significantly higher in the treatment arms in both cases (predominantly due due to gastro-intestinal or neurological side-effects). The ultimate clinical efficacy of these agents can be questioned based on their tolerability, but can certainly be justified as an initial short-term intervention.</P>
<P>A range of other interventions have failed to demonstrate efficacy in a small number of trials. While budesonide is effective for the induction of remission of active ileo-colonic Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Otley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Otley 2005</LINK>), it does not appear better than placebo for post-operative recurrence in the two trials identified for study. A single study of the use of tenovil (IL-10), a novel small molecule therapy did not demonstrate any efficacy as a post-operative intervention.</P>
<P>The efficacy of 5-ASA drugs for the treatment of Crohn's disease has received much recent adverse scrutiny and previous systematic reviews have not demonstrated a significant benefit for 5-aminosalicyclates for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2005</LINK>). In contrast, the results of this review suggest a modest benefit for mesalamine for maintenance of surgically induced remission with relative risk of both clinical and severe endoscopic recurrence reduced with mesalamine. Our observations may partially reflect differences in the approach to intention to treat analysis, but there may also be a plausible clinical explanation for the difference. 5-aminosalicyclates may fail to acheive adequate transmural tissue penetration in cases of established Crohn's disease, an issue which may be less important in anti-inflammatory activity during the early mucosal phase of post-operative disease recurrence. The number needed to treat with mesalamine to prevent a single clinical recurrence (NNT = 12) is considerable and raises the issue of cost-effectiveness of such therapy, however this must then be balanced against the fact that these preparations are generally well tolerated and have an excellent adverse event profile. Differences in the dose and formulation of mesalamine used in these studies are worth bearing in mind (with the majority making use of Eudragit-L coated mesalamine preparations) as, depending on the site of the anastomosis, mesalamine formulation may be important in ensuring optimal delivery to the relevant intestinal segment. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Caprilli-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Caprilli 2003</LINK> also suggest that dose may also be a consideration.</P>
<P>Immunosuppressives such as azathioprine or 6-MP present a more difficult proposition as their toxicity is greater, an issue which is all the more important in the context of prevention rather treatment of disease. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine appear generally effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Prefontaine-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prefontaine 2009</LINK>) and we also found these agents to be more effective than placebo for prevention of post-operative clinical recurrence with a NNT of 7. While we had difficulty in detecting any superiority of these agents to mesalamine for prevention of recurrence (other than a very modest effect on endoscopic recurrence overall), we did note the risk of adverse events to be significantly less with mesalamine. Another recent meta-analysis of the effect of azathioprine/6-MP on post-operative recurrence also suggests purine anti-metabolites are effective (<LINK REF="REF-Peyrin_x002d_Biroulet-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peyrin-Biroulet 2009</LINK>), but was performed on the assumption that mesalamine had effects equivalent to placebo and thus failed to evaluate the comparative effects of immunosuppressives and 5ASA drugs (employing a similar approach we obtained similar results, See <LINK REF="FIG-16" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 16</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-17" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 17</LINK>). Overall, while there is evidence of the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in reducing the risk of post-operative recurrence, their use in this context requires careful risk-benefit analysis. Most of these studies recruited patients irrespective of their risk of recurrence, and whether immunosuppressives are any more or less effective in different patient subgroups is a question we were unable to find sufficient data to address.</P>
<P>Interestingly a single recent randomised controlled trial of post-operative infliximab suggests that in individuals at increased risk of recurrence, the use of anti-TNF therapy may be an effective means of reducing Crohn's disease recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Regueiro-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regueiro 2009</LINK>). The study was small (n = 24) but well designed and the findings, if validated in a larger cohort, would suggest that infliximab is highly effective in this setting.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:29:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The results of this systematic review demonstrate that there are several interventions which are effective in reducing the post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. Nitro-imidazole antibiotics are effective at reducing both clinical and endoscopic recurrence, but appear to be poorly tolerated. Their use as a long term treatment is limited by adverse effects, particularly the risk of neuropathy. However, these agents are worth considering as an early intervention (in the first 3 months), perhaps in advance of early endoscopic assessment to select high risk patients for more aggressive intervention. There is no evidence that budesonide, tenovil or probiotics are any better than placebo for preventing post-operative recurrence.</P>
<P>The relative risk of recurrence associated with use of mesalamine is less than with placebo and this agent is not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events. Immunosuppressive agents such azathioprine/6-MP also appear effective and while the NNT to prevent a clinical recurrence is less than for mesalamine, the risk of serious adverse events is also significantly greater than with mesalamine. Early data on the use on infliximab in the post-operative setting suggest that this may be an effective therapy but larger confirmatory studies are required. The numbers needed to treat to prevent a single clinical recurrence must be balanced against the risks of each intervention. In patients at high risk of early post-operative recurrence, a more aggressive approach to treatment can be justified.</P>
<P>Our current approach is to recommend short term use of antibiotic therapy in the immediate post-operative period to patients with risk factors for early recurrence (and where tolerated). This may then be followed by endoscopic re-assessment (by colonoscopy at 3 to 6 months post surgery) with discussion of the risks and benefits of 5-ASA versus immunosuppressive or anti-TNF therapy with patients in the context of the degree of endoscopic recurrence observed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-12 12:29:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The results outlined suggest the need to explore alternate antibiotic therapies as a low toxicity strategy to prevent recurrence in low to average risk patients. Future studies might focus on identifying patients who will respond to post-operative prophylaxis with agents such as mesalamine or azathioprine/6-MP, in order to maximise the risk/benefit ratio of treatment. Given the larger number needed to treat for mesalamine, studies are needed to carefully evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in particular. The role of anti-TNF agents in prevention of post-operative recurrence merits evaluation in further large randomised clinical trials.</P>
