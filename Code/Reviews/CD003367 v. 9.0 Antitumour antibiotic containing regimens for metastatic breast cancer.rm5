<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Antitumour antibiotic containing regimens for metastatic breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Advanced (metastatic) breast cancer is cancer that has spread beyond the breast. Treatment for metastatic disease usually involves some type of chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) to try to reduce the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs can either be given as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. This is done according to a plan or a course of the drug referred to as a regimen. There are many types of chemotherapy drugs which work in various ways. Antitumour antibiotics work by damaging the cancer cells thereby preventing those cells from multiplying. Chemotherapy in general produces a range of side effects or adverse events related to the treatment. The known side effects of antitumour antibiotics include nausea, vomiting, a reduction in the number of white blood cells (known as leukopenia), and in some cases a toxic reaction which alters the working of the heart (called cardiotoxicity).</P>
<P>This review sought to identify and review the randomised evidence comparing courses of chemotherapy containing antitumour antibiotics against courses not containing antitumour antibiotics. This review identified 34 eligible trials involving 5605 women. This review found that for women with advanced breast cancer, taking antitumour antibiotics did not result in better survival than women who took other types of chemotherapy drugs. Despite the lack of evidence of survival benefit, this review demonstrated that women taking these drugs had an advantage in time to progression (the length of time it takes for the cancer to progress after taking the drug) and tumour response (shrinking of the tumour) compared to women who did not take the antitumour antibiotic drugs. In addition however, the risks of side effects including cardiotoxicity, leukopenia and nausea/vomiting were all significantly increased in the women taking the antitumour antibiotics. Given that this review failed to show a benefit in survival for women taking this group of drugs but a higher rate of side effects, the use of these drugs in the management of metastatic breast cancer must be carefully weighed against the risk of these side effects. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Antitumour antibiotics are used in the management of metastatic breast cancer. Some of these agents have demonstrated higher tumour response rates than non-antitumour antibiotic regimens, however a survival benefit has not been established in this setting. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the randomised evidence comparing antitumour antibiotic containing chemotherapy regimens with regimens not containing an antitumour antibiotic in the management of women with metastatic breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The Specialised Register maintained by the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group was searched on 3rd October, 2006 using the codes for 'advanced breast cancer' and 'chemotherapy'. Details of the search strategy and coding applied by the Group to create the register are described in the Group's module on The Cochrane Library. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing antitumour antibiotic containing regimens with regimens not containing antitumour antibiotics in women with metastatic breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were collected from published trials. Studies were assessed for eligibility and quality, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Hazard Ratios (HRs) were derived from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and a fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. Response rates were analysed as dichotomous variables. Quality of life and toxicity data were extracted where present. A primary analysis was conducted for all trials and by class of antitumour antibiotic.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-four trials reporting on 46 treatment comparisons were identified. All trials published results for tumour response and 27 trials published time-to-event data for overall survival. The observed 4244 deaths in 5605 randomised women did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in survival between regimens that contained antitumour antibiotics and those that did not (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.02, P = 0.22) and no significant heterogeneity. Antitumour antibiotic regimens were favourably associated with time-to-progression (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and tumour response rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.48) although statistically significant heterogeneity was observed for these outcomes. These associations were consistent when the analysis was restricted to the 30 trials that reported on anthracyclines. Patients receiving anthracycline containing regimens were also more likely to experience toxic events compared to patients receiving non-antitumour antibiotic regimens. No statistically significant difference was observed in any outcome between mitoxantrone containing and non-antitumour antibiotic-containing regimens. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Compared to regimens without antitumour antibiotics, regimens that contained these agents showed a statistically significant advantage for tumour response and time to progression in women with metastatic breast cancer but were not associated with an improvement in overall survival. The favourable effect on tumour response and time to progression observed in anthracycline containing regimens was also associated with greater toxicity.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:12:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer death in that group. In 2002, there were over 1 million new cases and approximately 410,000 deaths from breast cancer worldwide; an age standardised death rate (ASR) of 13.2 (per 100,000). ASRs of 25 or greater were recorded that same year by Barbados (25.5), Belgium (27.7), Botswana (25.0), Cyprus (29.6), Denmark (27.8), Georgia (25.1), Ireland (25.7), Malta (29.6), The netherlands (27.5) and The Philippines (27.1). (<LINK REF="REF-Ferlay-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferlay 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>The stage of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis is an important indicator of prognosis. Median survival in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is around 18 to 24 months although this could range from a few weeks to several years (<LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK>). Although there is no randomised evidence comparing chemotherapy with observation in women with metastatic breast cancer, it is widely accepted that women with metastatic disease should receive some form of systemic therapy at some time during the course of their disease. Chemotherapy is considered by many to be the appropriate first treatment option for women with multiple sites of recurrence or where visceral disease is not easily treated by local modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 1995</LINK>). Chemotherapy is also considered to be useful in women whose cancer is hormone refractory or expected to be hormone resistant (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>As a class, antitumour antibiotics are agents that have been isolated, or synthetically derived, from a variety of fungal organisms for their cytotoxic properties. They damage the DNA template by a variety of mechanisms including intercalation into DNA and RNA, alkylation of DNA and the generation of oxygen free radicals to produce single- and double-strand DNA breaks (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1997</LINK>). Antitumour antibiotics include the anthracyclines (for example doxorubicin and epirubicin); anthracenediones (mitoxantrone/mitozantrone); and mitomycin-C. <BR/>This class of drugs, in particular anthracycline-based FAC (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin) and FEC (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and epirubicin) regimens, have been used in chemotherapy for the management of metastatic breast cancer for the last three decades (<LINK REF="REF-Hortobagyi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hortobagyi 2003</LINK>). Several large randomised trials have supported their use over standard CMF (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate) regimens but despite yielding higher response rates, the evidence for survival benefit has not been conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Fossati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 1998</LINK>). Common side effects of these agents are nausea, vomiting, hair loss and leucopenia. Rarely, anthracyclines may cause cardiomyopathy and these agents should be used with care in patients with known cardiac disease.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to compare antitumour antibiotic containing chemotherapy regimens with regimens not containing antitumour antibiotics in the management of women with MBC. </P>
<P>Antitumour antibiotics were classified as anthracyclines, anthracendiones or other antitumour antibiotics for the purposes of this review. Pre-specified subquestions within the review for each of these classes were: <BR/>a) regimen A plus antitumour antibiotic versus regimen A; <BR/>b) regimen A plus antitumour antibiotic versus regimen B; <BR/>c) single agent antitumour antibiotic versus regimen C. </P>

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention group: any chemotherapy regimen containing an antitumour antibiotic. <BR/>Comparator: any chemotherapy regimen not containing an antitumour antibiotic. <BR/>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for classification of chemotherapeutic agents; <BR/> <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for classification of antitumour agents (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1997</LINK>). <BR/>Endocrine therapy may also have been given to both treatment groups. <BR/>Trials may or may not specify recommended treatment upon disease progression or initial treatment failure. Trials where patients crossed over to the other treatment arm at the time of progression or received other treatment off-study were included in this review and analysed according to the treatment they were originally randomised to receive. Sequential trials where patients were allocated to receive a set number of cycles of one treatment and then crossed over to the other treatment arm (not at the time of progression but upon completion of the first treatment) were excluded from this review. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>1. Overall survival <BR/>2. Time to progression (or progression-free survival) <BR/>3. Response <BR/>4. Quality of life measures (trial-specific instruments) <BR/>5. Toxicity </P>
<P>For the purpose of this review, the following outcome definitions applied: <BR/>1. Overall survival (OS): time from date randomised to date of death (any cause); <BR/>2. Time to progression (TTP): time from date randomised to date of progression or death (any cause); <BR/>3. Response rate (RR): the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response as defined by the National Cancer Institute's Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>This review also attempted to investigate treatment-related death which, for the purpose of this review, was defined as death due to the toxicity of the drug and not to disease progression. If an individual trial did not include the definition used by that trial but used the terms 'toxic death' or 'lethal toxicity', or indicated that death was due to treatment, then the information was included in the review. </P>
<P>Time-to-treatment failure was a planned outcome for this review and was defined as time from date randomised to date of progression, death (any cause), withdrawal due to adverse event, patient refusal or further anti-cancer therapy for documented progression. Eight trials reported data on time to treatment failure, however, not all these trials used definitions in alignment with our pre-specified definition and this outcome was not included in this review.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:01:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>The specialised register maintained by the Secretariat of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group (CBCG) was searched (3rd October 2006). Details of the search strategy applied by the Group to create the register, and the procedure used to code references, are described in the Group's module on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. The register includes both published and unpublished (including ongoing) trials identified from searches of electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings. All references that had been assigned the CBCG codes 'advanced' and 'chemotherapy' as applied to the specialised register and the abstracts were screened in an attempt to determine if the reference pertained to a randomised trial in women with metastatic breast cancer comparing one chemotherapy combination with another. The complete article was obtained for references that were definitely eligible, or where it was not possible to determine eligibility based only on information in the abstract.</P>
<P>The reference lists of other related literature reviews were also searched. The reviews searched included <LINK REF="REF-Fossati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Stockler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stockler 2000</LINK> as well as review articles identified by the search strategy.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>At least two individuals applied the selection criteria (including the quality of randomisation) to each reference identified by the search strategy, masked to the study results. A third reviewer resolved any discrepancies regarding eligibility or quality. </P>
<P>The hazard ratio (HR) and associated variances for overall survival and time to progression were extracted directly from the trial publication/s. If not reported, this data was obtained indirectly using the methods described by <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK> et al using either other available summary statistics or from data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves. To allow for immature follow up, the numbers at risk were adjusted based on estimated minimum and maximum follow-up times. If these were not reported in any of the reports available, minimum follow up was estimated using the estimated time taken to complete treatment, and maximum follow up was estimated using the last event reported in the relevant time-to-event curve. These follow-up estimates are recorded in the Characteristics of Included Studies table under 'Notes'. </P>
<P>A pooled HR was obtained from the derived observed (O) less expected (E) number of events and the variance for each trial, using the fixed effect model (<LINK REF="REF-Yusuf--1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yusuf 1985</LINK>). The pooled HR represents the overall risk of an event on chemotherapy regimens containing antitumour antibiotics versus those not containing antitumour antibiotics. </P>
<P>All outcomes available from the individual studies were included in the meta-analysis with heterogeneity reported using chi-square tests (see the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook). </P>
<P>Ratios of treatment effects for time-to-event outcomes were reported so that HRs less than 1.0 favour regimens containing antitumour antibiotics and values greater than 1.0 favour regimens that do not contain antitumour antibiotics. The plots for overall survival and progression-free survival are hazard ratio (HR) plots, although they are labelled as odds ratio (OR) plots in the default mode of meta-view. </P>
<P>Response rates were analysed as dichotomous variables (complete or partial response versus stable disease or no response) and a pooled odds ratio was derived. Response has been reported based on assessable (not randomised) patients as most of the trials included in this review only reported response in this way. Ratios of treatment effects for response were reported so that ORs less than 1.0 favour regimens containing antitumour antibiotics and values greater than 1.00 favour regimens that do not contain antitumour antibiotics. </P>
<P>If all arms in a multi-arm trial were included in the meta-analysis and one treatment arm was included in more than one of the treatment comparisons then the number of events and the number of participants in that arm were divided by the number of treatment comparisons made. This method was used to avoid the multiple use of participants in the pooled estimate of treatment effect while retaining information from each arm of the trial and is likely to compromise the precision of the pooled estimate slightly.</P>
<P>Quality of life data were collected using a variety of instruments across trials. These data were not statistically synthesised but were summarised and evaluated qualitatively. </P>
<P>Toxicity data was extracted for Grade III or Grade IV events of leukopenia, nausea or vomiting, alopecia and cardiotoxicity. This data was not consistently reported across the included trials and the analysis was limited to the calculation a single odds ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) using the total number events and number at risk added up across trials.</P>
<P>As specified in the protocol, each of these outcomes was reported, where available, for all trials combined and by class of antitumour antibiotic (primary analyses). Two secondary analyses were also performed as pre-specified: 1. analysis by type of antitumour antibiotic-containing regimen (single, additional or replacement agent to comparator regimen); and 2. sensitivity analysis using studies with adequate concealment clearly stated. Planned subgroup analysis by menopausal status, hormone receptor status and stage of disease was not undertaken due to the lack of data available in the included trials for these subgroups.</P>
<P>Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted for the subclass of anthracycline containing antitumour antibiotic regimens by type of comparator regimen. These analyses were planned after identification of the eligible trials, and prior to the pooling of results. Comparator regimens used in each trial were classified into four subgroups to allow analyses of antitumour antibiotic efficacy by comparator class. These subgroups were selected on the basis that they each represented classes of agents of similar activity: <BR/>1. CMF; <BR/>2. CMF based, with addition of other cytoxics for example Vincristine; <BR/>3. other C- or CF-based (no methotrexate); <BR/>4. taxanes. <BR/>Chlorambucil was considered equivalent to cyclophosphamide and regimens that included prednisone were considered equivalent to those that did not for the purpose of this classification. </P>
<P>Overall this review tested 40 comparisons for each of the six outcome variables.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>On the 3rd October 2006, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register contained 6,176 references of which 829 were coded as references to studies of chemotherapy and advanced breast cancer (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> for the quorum flow chart). Of these, 502 were references that reported the comparison of two different chemotherapy combinations in metastatic breast cancer, of which 421 were not eligible based on information in the abstract. The complete paper was obtained for 100 references leading to the exclusion of a further 48 references. The remaining 52 references reported the results of 48 randomised trials, 15 of which were excluded from the meta-analysis: 15 were not considered to be eligible for the review (see Characteristics of excluded studies). <BR/>The 34 eligible trials reported on 46 treatment comparisons: 42 comparisons of anthracyclines, and four comparisons of mitoxantrone with non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens. The regimens used in each trial are summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>. Where a trial included more than one comparison these were labelled alphabetically (a, b, c). The trials included in the forest plots were labelled by trial name or primary author and date of publication. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Each study was reviewed, according to its design and by how the study was conducted, to assess the potential for bias. Trial quality was assessed based on: <BR/>- quality of randomisation; <BR/>- comparability between groups (treatment arms) at the baseline; <BR/>- inclusion of all randomised participants in the analysis. </P>
<P>The quality of randomisation was assessed based on generation and concealment of the allocation sequence. This was graded as A - clearly adequate, B - possibly adequate, C - clearly inadequate (see Characteristics of Included Studies). It was not possible to accurately assess the quality of randomisation used in most studies due to lack of information in the published articles. The following sensitivity analyses were conducted. </P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis A <BR/>Trials graded as having clearly adequate allocation concealment (grade A). In this review these trials were: <BR/>ANZ BCTG 8614B122; <BR/>CALGB Aisner; <BR/>Coates 1987; <BR/>EORTC 10923; <BR/>HEPI; <BR/>SECSG. </P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis B <BR/>Trials graded as having possibly adequate allocation concealment and having good comparability of baseline characteristics and adequate reporting of outcomes. <BR/>In this review, eligible trials that did not meet the quality criterion (A) satisfied quality criterion (B). </P>
<P>Sensitivity analysis C <BR/>Trials graded as having inadequate allocation concealment, for example the use of alternation, case record numbers or other open lists of random numbers. No studies included in this review were graded at this level.</P>
<P>Trials were considered to have adequate reporting of time-to-event outcomes if: i) they included all patients in the analysis; or ii) patients were excluded from analysis and reasons were given for excluding patients, and the exclusions were not of a number that could lead to a misleading conclusion. See the Characteristics of Included Studies table for details. </P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-08-07 16:12:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>The 34 trials (46 treatment comparisons) included in this review randomised 7237 women; of these, 6474 (89%) were randomised to 30 trials (42 treatment comparisons) comparing anthracycline based therapies to non-antitumour antibiotic based regimens, and 763 were randomised to four trials (four treatment comparisons) comparing mitoxantrone containing regimens with non-antitumour antibiotic based regimens. Time-to-event data was extractable for overall survival from 27 trials (35 treatment comparisons, 76% of all patients randomised) and progression-free survival from 12 trials (treatment comparisons, 36% of all patients randomised). Tumour response rates based on assessable patients were available for all trials and treatment comparisons.</P>
<P>The observed 4244 deaths in 5605 randomised women did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in survival between regimens that contained antitumour antibiotics and those that did not contain these agents, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.02, P = 0.22) and no statistically significant heterogeneity (Forest plot 1.1). Antitumour antibiotic containing regimens were favourably associated with time-to-progression (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and tumour response rates (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.48 ) although statistically significant heterogeneity was observed for these outcomes across the trials (Forest plots 1.2, 1.3). Treatment related deaths were reported in 2% of participants across the 19 trials (treatment comparisons) reporting on this outcome. Of the 81 treatment related deaths reported, 46 occurred in the antitumour antibiotic arm compared to 35 in the non-antitumour antibiotic arm (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.83).</P>
<P>The results for the analyses by class of antitumour antibiotic (anthracycline containing or mitoxantrone containing) are presented below.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Anthracycline-containing regimens versus non-antitumour antibiotic regimens </B>
<BR/>Twenty-seven trials (39 treatment comparisons) reported on doxorubicin and three trials (three treatment comparisons) reported on epirubicin (<LINK REF="STD-HEPI-013-2001" TYPE="STUDY">HEPI 013 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fountzilas-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Fountzilas 2004</LINK>). The majority of comparator regimens were CMF (14 trials, 18 treatment comparisons), CMFVP (eight trials, ten treatment comparisons) or other CF-based regimens (seven trials, ten treatment comparisons). Two trials (three treatment comparisons) compared doxorubicin or a doxorubicin/paclitaxel combination regimen with single agent paclitaxel (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG-E1193a" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG E1193a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG-E1193b" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG E1193b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10923" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10923</LINK>). <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK> lists the outcomes extracted from each trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall survival </B>
<BR/>Sufficient data was available for 23 of the 30 eligible trials (31 treatment comparisons) to calculate an HR for overall survival (Forest plot 2.1). No survival advantage was observed for anthracycline containing regimens, with an HR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.04). A null effect was also observed within each of the three subquestions where anthracyclines were used as an additional agent (question a: three trials, four treatment comparisons); replacement agent in combination therapy (question b: 18 trials, 22 treatment comparisons); or single agent (question c: five trials, five treatment comparisons). Heterogeneity of survival effect across the 31 treatment comparisons was not statistically significant (heterogeneity chi-square 34.12, df = 30, P = 0.28).</P>
<P>A statistically significant survival advantage for anthracycline containing regimens was observed when a sensitivity analysis was undertaken (Forest plot 3.1). Four trials (five treatment comparisons) addressing Question (b) reported randomisation methods of high quality (<LINK REF="STD-B122" TYPE="STUDY">B122</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coates-1987a" TYPE="STUDY">Coates 1987a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coates-1987b" TYPE="STUDY">Coates 1987b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HEPI-013-2001" TYPE="STUDY">HEPI 013 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SECSG-1983" TYPE="STUDY">SECSG 1983</LINK>). Each of these studies suggested a survival advantage for regimens where an anthracycline was used to replace methotrexate, or methotrexate in combination with fluorouracil or vincristine (comparator CMF or CMFVP), with an overall HR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.98). One other study reported clearly adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10923" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10923</LINK>). This trial addressed question (c) and compared doxorubicin with paclitaxel as single agent therapy. No statistically significant difference in survival was observed between these two single agents (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.19).</P>
<P>
<B>Time to progression </B>
<BR/>Data on time to progression was available from ten trials reporting on 12 treatment comparisons (Forest plot 2.2). There was a statistically significant difference in favour of anthracycline containing regimens for time to progression, with an HR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.83).</P>
<P>This beneficial effect was consistently observed in each of the three categories of anthracycline regimens. Nine trials (nine treatment comparisons) compared anthracycline containing regimens with alternate non-anthracycline combination therapies (question b), with an HR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.91) for time to progression. One of these trials also reported on the addition of an anthracycline to a regimen (<LINK REF="STD-Nemoto-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Nemoto 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nemoto-1982b" TYPE="STUDY">Nemoto 1982b</LINK>), which also showed a favourable effect but this did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.24). Another trial investigating the use of anthracyclines as a single agent (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10923" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10923</LINK>) reported that anthracycline was favoured over paclitaxel in time to progression, with an HR of 0.55 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.68). Heterogeneity across the 12 treatment comparisons was statistically significant (heterogeneity chi-square 22.73, df = 11, P = 0.02) but not within each of the three subquestions.</P>
<P>
<B>Overall response </B>
<BR/>All of the 30 eligible trials (42 treatment comparisons) reporting on anthracycline containing regimens versus non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens provided information about response rates based on assessable patients (Forest plot 02.3). The odds ratio for overall response showed a statistically significant difference in favour of anthracycline containing regimens, with an OR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.56).</P>
<P>Four trials (5 treatment comparisons) addressed question (a), the addition of an anthracycline to a regimen, to demonstrate a benefit in favour of anthracyclines, with an OR of 1.90 (95% CI 1.33 to 2.72). Each of the five comparisons favoured the addition of an anthracycline and a test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant (heterogeneity chi-square 2.08, df = 4, P = 0.72).</P>
<P>Twenty three trials (29 treatment comparisons) addressed question (b), the replacement of a non-antitumor antibiotic with an anthracycline in a combination therapy , demonstrating a statistically significant difference in overall response in favour of anthracycline containing regimens, with an OR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.63). Heterogeneity of effect was statistically significant across these treatment comparisons (heterogeneity chi-square 49.49 df = 28, P = 0.007).</P>
<P>Five trials (eight treatment comparisons) addressed question (c), the use of anthracyclines as a single agent versus non-anthracycline containing regimens. Overall, no statistically significant difference in response rates was observed (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41), although there was significant heterogeneity across treatment comparisons (heterogeneity chi-square 16.41, df = 7, P = 0.02).</P>
<P>
<B>Toxicity </B>
<BR/>Leukopenia (white blood cell count (WCC) less than 2000 x 10-9/litre) was the commonest Grade III to IV toxic event in both anthracycline and comparator arms (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Twenty-two trials reported 1540 events in 4425 participants, with an OR of 1.25 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.41), to show a significantly increased risk for anthracycline containing regimens. Twenty-three trials provided data on Grade III to IV cardiotoxicity, with 110 events in 4777 participants for an OR of 5.17 (95% CI 3.16 to 8.48) in patients receiving anthracyclines. Patients receiving anthracycline based regimens also were more likely to experience moderate to severe nausea/vomiting (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.41) and alopecia (OR 3.87, 95% CI 3.31 to 4.52) compared to patients receiving non-antitumour antibiotic regimens.</P>
<P>Seventeen anthracycline trials provided information about treatment related deaths (Forest plot 2.4). Overall, there was no statistically significant difference in risk of treatment related deaths (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.82).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of life </B>
<BR/>Information about quality of life (QoL) was only available from two trials comparing anthracycline containing regimens with non-antitumour antibiotic (<LINK REF="STD-Fraser-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Fraser 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-10923" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 10923</LINK>). No difference in global QoL scores were reported between the two treatment groups in these two trials (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analyses </B>
<BR/>Anthracycline containing regimens demonstrated a statistically significant difference in survival compared to CMFVP (four trials, five treatment comparisons; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99). This benefit was not observed in the 11 trials (13 treatment comparisons) using CMF as the comparator (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05) nor in the other comparator subclasses (Forest plot 4.1). Anthracycline containing regimens showed a statistically significant advantage in time to progression compared to CMF regimens (four trials, four treatment comparisons; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.93) and CMFVP regimens (one treatment comparison; HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.90) (Forest plot 4.2).</P>
<P>Anthracycline containing regimens demonstrated a statistically significant increase in tumour response compared to CMF regimens (14 trials, 18 comparisons; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.66), CMFVP regimens (eight trials, nine treatment comparisons; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.78), taxanes (two trials, three treatment comparisons; OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.06). No difference was observed in comparison with regimens based on cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil that did not include methotrexate for example CFP, CFVP (seven trials, ten comparisons; OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.76) (Forest plot 4.3).</P>
<P>
<B>2. Mitoxantrone-containing regimens versus non-antitumour antibiotic regimens </B>
<BR/>Four trials reported on four treatment comparisons of mitoxantrone containing regimens versus CMF regimens as first line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (Forest plot 5). No statistically significant difference in overall survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12) or response (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.19) was observed and heterogeneity was statistically significant for response (heterogeneity chi-square 17.06, df = 3, P = 0.0007). A statistically significant benefit for time to progression was observed in one of these trials (ANZ BCTG 8614) comparing single agent mitoxantrone to CMFP (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94); but response favoured the comparator regimen with an OR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.86). The three other trials did not show a statistically significant difference in response for regimens containing mitoxantrone versus non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens.</P>
<P>There was no statistically significant association between the use of mitoxantrone and toxic events or treatment related deaths compared to the comparator regimens (treatment-related deaths: OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.26 to 9.44). Of the two trials reporting treatment related deaths, both addressing Question (b), one trial reported a toxic death in the control group; the other trial reported two toxic deaths in the mitoxantrone group. Two trials reported on QoL and demonstrated no difference in global QoL scores between the treatment groups (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>) (<LINK REF="STD-ANZ-BCTG-8614" TYPE="STUDY">ANZ BCTG 8614</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper_x002d_Wynne-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Harper-Wynne 1999</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review did not identify a statistically significant benefit in overall survival for antitumour antibiotic containing regimens over non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens in the first line management of metastatic breast cancer. Despite the lack of evidence of survival benefit, this review demonstrated that anthracycline containing regimens provided a statistically significant advantage in time to progression and tumour response compared to non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens. Only ten anthracycline trials provided data on time to progression (2226 randomised patients; HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.83). All eligible anthracycline trials provided response data for 6,538 assessable patients, for an OR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.48). The favourable effect on time to progression and response was consistent and statistically significant in regimens where an anthracycline was used as a replacement agent (29 treatment comparisons; 4439 patients). Fewer trials reported on comparisons between an anthracycline as an additional agent (five treatment comparisons; 604 patients) or an anthracycline as a single agent (eight treatment comparisons; 1104 patients). In these trials we observed a response benefit for regimens that included an anthracycline as an additional agent (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.72), but not for regimens that included anthracyclines as a single agent (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.41). </P>
<P>An exploratory subgroup analysis by class of comparator demonstrated that anthracycline containing regimens were statistically significantly associated with improved tumour response compared to CMF, CMFVP and taxane regimens and showed no difference to other cyclophosphamide based regimens. We also observed a statistically significant survival benefit for anthracycline containing regimens compared to CMFVP regimens (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99, P = 0.04). It is unclear why anthracycline containing regimens would be more effective compared to CMFVP regimens and not regimens containing CMF alone. One possible explanation is that the dose or scheduling of CMF varied between these regimens or that patients allocated to CMF regimens received the potential benefit of anthracyclines as second line therapy earlier or more frequently than those allocated CMFVP regimens. Further investigation of the type of regimens and protocols used in the individual trials is required to address this question. It is also possible that this modest finding represents a type I error, and we note that this finding is not statistically significant after correction for the multiple comparisons performed. A pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the four anthracycline trials that reported clearly adequate methods of allocation concealment also indicated a modest survival benefit for anthracycline containing regimens (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98) compared to CMF (two trials) or CMFVP regimens (two trials) to suggest that anthracyclines dominated CMF regimens, however as one of multiple comparisons performed in this review this result must also be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>This review did not demonstrate a difference in overall survival or tumour response for mitoxantrone containing regimens versus non-antitumour antibiotic regimens, although a benefit was observed for time to progression (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98). Statistically significant heterogeneity was observed for tumour response (P heterogeneity = 0.0007). Similarly, there was statistically significant heterogeneity of effect across the anthracycline trials for response (P heterogeneity = 0.0009). In contrast, no significant heterogeneity was observed in the survival estimates for trials within each class of antitumour antibiotic trials (anthracyclines and mitoxantrone). The heterogeneity in the response estimates most likely reflects the different activity of the wide range of different regimens and protocols represented in the included trials, however, specific factors have not been explored in this review. </P>
<P>The interpretation of treatment effect on response is also problematic in this review due to the lack of information provided in some of the trials about the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis of response rates and it is possible that the definition of 'assessable' varied across the trials. </P>
<P>Given the lack of survival benefit, the use of anthracyclines in the management of metastatic breast cancer must be carefully weighed against the risk of toxicities associated with these agents. The risks of cardiotoxicity, leukopenia and nausea/vomiting were all significantly increased in anthracycline containing regimens (cardiac toxicity OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.56 to 9.80; leukopenia OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.41; nausea/vomiting OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.06). </P>
<P>Our results are consistent with an earlier review of 30 trials (5241 patients) of first and second line therapy for metastatic breast cancer, which found no overall survival benefit for combination therapies that included anthracyclines compared to those that did not (<LINK REF="REF-Fossati-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fossati 1998</LINK>). A recent large trial comparing the efficacy of doxorubicin and paclitaxel as single and combined agents has recently reported similar findings that antitumour response activity did not confer an advantage in overall survival (<LINK REF="REF-Sledge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sledge 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The tumour response associated with these agents appeared to offer a poor surrogate for overall survival gain, however, some correlation between these outcomes cannot be ruled out. One possible explanation is that while anthracyclines provide a highly active initial anti-tumour response, 'catch-up' occurs after tumour progression when a subsequent and less active regimen is used as salvage therapy. Conversely, the initial use of less active combinations may be rectified with the subsequent use of anthracyclines. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Regimens that contain antitumour antibiotics do not offer any additional benefit in overall survival over regimens that do not contain these agents in the first line management of metastatic breast cancer. Anthracycline containing regimens do provide advantages in tumour response and time to progression over standard non-antitumour antibiotic containing regimens but these benefits need to be weighed against the increased risk of toxicity before consideration as palliative therapy. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relative efficacy of other non-anthracycline antitumour antibiotic regimens compared to non-antitumour antibiotics.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>A review of trials comparing overall survival, quality of life and toxicity for anthracyclines as a first line agents in regimens of sequential therapy is warranted to further investigate the optimal use of these agents.</P>

<P>6 arm trial. 4 comparisons used for this meta-analysis. Randomisation to chemoimmunotherapy ceased after an interim evaluation showed no benefit &amp; increased toxicity. 432 pts were enrolled. 37 pts were unevaluable: ineligible (20), protocol violoations, early deaths (4), inadequate records (2), improper randomisation(1). Analyses was conducted using 395 evaluable patients (260/283 patients randomised to chemotherapy, 135/149 patients randomised to chemoimmunotherapy). Time-to-event data not extracted from published curves for inclusion in this meta-analysis as unable to do so accurately to replicate reported study findings. Overall survival benefit reported for the CAF arm versus the CMF arm (p=0.04). A three way comparison between time to progression in the 3 chemotherapy arms showed a statistically significantly difference (p=0.01) favouring the CAF arm. No statistically significant differences in survival or time to progression reported between the 3 chemoimmunotherapy arms. Follow-up times not reported. Estimated min = 2 months (2 cycles), est. max = 36 months (from survival curve). 8 treatment-related deaths: 5 due to infection in arms CAF+MER, CAFVP+MER, CAF, CAFVP (2); 2 due to haemorrhage in arms CAF+MER, CMF; 1 due to cardiac toxicity in CAF arm.</P>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed 14 linear analogue self-assessment scales. Clinicians used the Spitzer QL index.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Completion rates for each instrument are not available. No significant differences in patient or clinician rated overall QOL were reported between the treatment groups at 3 months. Patients on CMFP rated significantly higher for mood, pain, feeling sick, vomiting, appetite/taste and sexual interest, but worse for hair loss that patients on MTZ.</P>

<P>IDBBC EORTC 10923</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed EORTC QLQ-C30 and Rotterdam Symptom Checklist</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>64% of randomised patients completed baseline QLQ-C30 and 61% completed baseline RSCL. QOL comparisons were only performed for the first 3 cycles. Doxorubicin was associated with significantly more nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite and burden of disease and treatment, but less bone pain and rash.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>Fraser 1993</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Patients completed 3 quality of life instruments: 4 weekly Nottingham Health Profile (NHP - emotional state, energy, pain, physical mobility, sleep and social factors ) and Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) at the start of treatment and four weekly thereafter and the Qualitator daily dairy card throughout treatment which measured the domains of physical symptoms, social factors, emotional factors and physical performance.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Of the 40 patients randomised, compliance for the 29 who started the Qualitator, the 37 who started the NHP and 36 who started the LASA respectively were 88%, 89% and 92%. Quality of life measures only recorded a significant difference in energy and pain, influenced primarily by the non responders in each treatment group but with no difference in overall global scores. Scores for responders (58% for CMF, 29% for epirubicin P&gt;0.05), irrespective of treatment were better to start with (LASA P=0.001); at 12 weeks, scores had improved (Qualitator P&lt;0.05; NHP P&lt;0.05) . Scores in non responders showed no change.</P>
