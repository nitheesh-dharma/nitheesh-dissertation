<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>We conducted this review to compare azithromycin with amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI).</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are one of the most common diagnoses in outpatient settings. They range from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Azithromycin is a subclass of macrolide antibiotics and is used to treat certain bacterial infections.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
<BR/>We searched for trials published and pending as at November 2014.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
<BR/>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>We analysed the results from 15 trials with 2496 participants. The effects of azithromycin on cure, improvement or failure were not better than those of amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, azithromycin seems to have a lower incidence of adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav but it is not significant.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
<BR/>Overall the quality of the evidence for the main outcome is low as only three of 15 included trials showed adequate allocation concealment. Hence, currently, there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI.<BR/>

<P>Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) range from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Approximately five million people die from acute respiratory tract infections annually. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalisation and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> (<I>H. influenzae</I>)<I>.</I>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-09-21 22:40:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified from the searches for methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We initially pooled all types of acute LRTI in the meta-analyses. We investigated the heterogeneity of results using the forest plot and Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test. We also used the index of the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic to measure inconsistent results among trials. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:28:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 16 trials involving 2648 participants. We were able to analyse 15 of the trials with 2496 participants. The pooled analysis of all the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about days 10 to 14 between the two groups (risk ratio (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). A subgroup analysis in trials with acute bronchitis participants showed significantly lower clinical failure in the azithromycin group compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav (RR random-effects 0.63; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). A sensitivity analysis showed a non-significant reduction in clinical failure in azithromycin-treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:28:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and had small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:28:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The spectrum of acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) ranges from acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Annually approximately five million people die of acute respiratory tract infections. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalisation and medical consultation (<LINK REF="REF-Bariffi-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bariffi 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses in outpatients. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis is mainly based on the symptom of cough and it is usually mild and self limiting. Acute bronchitis with underlying pulmonary diseases or a prolonged cough of more than two weeks are considered for antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Knutson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knutson 2002</LINK>). A prospective multicentre study of 359 cases of community-acquired pneumonia in the United States reported that 58.5% had identifiable pathogens, 32.9% had unknown aetiology and 8.6% had aspiration-related and post-obstructive pneumonia. The most frequent aetiologic agent was <I>Streptococcus pneumoniae </I>(<I>S. pneumoniae</I>) (15%), followed by <I>Haemophilus influenzae </I>(<I>H. influenzae</I>) (10.9%), Legionella spp (6.7%) and <I>Chlamydia pneumoniae </I>(<I>C. pneumoniae</I>) (6.1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Fang-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fang 1990</LINK>). A study in The Netherlands of 145 adults with LRTI showed that a bacterial cause was found in 43 cases (30%) and a viral cause in 57 cases (39%). Influenza A virus was the most frequently diagnosed micro-organism. The most frequently identified bacterial agents were <I>H. influenzae</I> (9%) and <I>Mycoplasma pneumoniae </I>(<I>M. pneumoniae</I>) (9%) followed by <I>S. pneumoniae</I> (6%) (<LINK REF="REF-Graffelman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graffelman 2004</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:34:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antimicrobial treatment in LRTI has to be effective, partly because of the need to reduce the cost and also due to the problem of increasing resistance to the commonly used antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Legnani-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legnani 1997</LINK>). It has also been suggested that the start of therapy should not be delayed for longer than six hours for diagnostic studies (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1998</LINK>). The importance of early antimicrobial treatment was supported by a study in elderly patients with pneumonia, which showed that 30-day mortality was lower after administration of antibiotics within eight hours of arrival at hospital, than after delayed treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Meehan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meehan 1997</LINK>). Compliance is also important, particularly in outpatients. A study related to medical compliance for the outpatient management of infectious diseases indicated that there was an inverse relationship between frequency of dose and compliance. A short-term regimen, requiring administration once a day, was found to have the highest compliance rate - 80% compared to 69% and 38% for administration twice a day and three times a day, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Sclar-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sclar 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Amoxycillin, an oral antibiotic, constitutes extended spectrum penicillin and is active against many aerobic gram-negative bacilli encountered in patients with pneumonia. By combining the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid with amoxycillin, the invitro spectrum of penicillin is expanded to include beta-lactamase producing organisms, which would otherwise be resistant to this drug (<LINK REF="REF-Mandell-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandell 1994</LINK>). Amoxycillin has been accepted as one of the first choice antibiotics in patients with community-acquired LRTI. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid is recommended particularly in the high prevalence area of beta-lactamase producing organisms, and also when an aetiologic agent is not identified (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Huchon-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huchon 1998</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-02-25 20:58:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic structurally modified from erythromycin with an expanded spectrum of activity and improved tissue pharmacokinetic characteristics relative to erythromycin. The drug is noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly <I>H. influenzae</I>. Azithromycin has similar properties to other macrolides against <I>S. pneumoniae</I> and <I>Moraxella catarrhalis </I>(<I>M. catarrhalis</I>), and is active against atypical pathogens such as <I>Legionella pneumophilae </I>(<I>L. pneumophilae</I>), <I>C. pneumoniae </I>and <I>M. pneumoniae</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Dunn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunn 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>Over the past 30 years, strains of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> with diminished susceptibility to penicillin have emerged and spread worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Austrian-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Austrian 1994</LINK>). Cross-resistance to other antibiotics has also been reported in many strains of <I>S. pneumoniae</I> that have diminished susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporin (<LINK REF="REF-Goldstein-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldstein 1996</LINK>). A number of studies have indicated the importance of <I>M. pneumoniae</I> as the main aetiologic agent in ambulatory patients with pneumonia (<LINK REF="REF-Berntsson-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berntsson 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langille-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langille 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marrie-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marrie 1996</LINK>). Co-infection by more than one pathogen was also reported, and ranged from less than 10% to 38.9% (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 1996</LINK>). The value of routine microbial investigation in all patients with LRTI is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Woodhead-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodhead 1991</LINK>). A survey on the management of 2056 such infections, obtained from general practitioners in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, reported that microbiological examination was performed in only 7% of cases compared to 22% for chest radiography (<LINK REF="REF-Woodhead-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodhead 1996</LINK>).</P>

There was no statistical significance in the difference in incidence of clinical failure between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85, random-effects model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).

The overall incidence of adverse events in the azithromycin group was 17.9% (244/1363) compared to 23.6% (246/1043) in the amoxycillin or amoxyclav group. The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was a RR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>

<P>Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication. The pooled analysis showed that the incidence of microbial eradication in the azithromycin group was 66.4% (326/491) compared to 67.6% (318/470) in the amoxicillin or amoxyclav group. There was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, fixed-effect model) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-08-17 08:07:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The results of this review showed that the effect of azithromycin compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav on clinical failure, microbial eradication and adverse events measured at about day 10 to 14 was not statistically significant. However, in a group of participants with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, the incidence of clinical failure was significantly lower in the azithromycin group.</P>

<P>The 15 analysed studies were published over a period of 11 years (1991 to 2002). Fourteen out of the 15 included studies were from a wide range of high-income countries. Eighty per cent (12/15) of the included studies were conducted in adults. There were few differences in the doses of azithromycin and the context of each study. The pooled results may be applied to similar settings.<B>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:28:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were some limitations that related to the quality of the included trials (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The most important was that adequately concealed treatment allocation was performed in only three trials and 53% of the studies (8/15) either did not report this information or reported insufficient information about blinding. The results of these studies should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute lower respiratory tract infection. However, in patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin is more effective in lowering the incidence of clinical failure than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. Azithromycin seems to have a lower incidence of adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. In clinical practice, the choice between azithromycin and amoxycillin or amoxyclav could be based on other considerations such as cost, convenience and adherence to treatment.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-02-25 23:28:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A high-quality and adequate sized trial is needed to clarify whether azithromycin is better than amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute lower respiratory tract infection.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY MODIFIED="2011-08-11 07:57:26 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>While informative, this systematic review leaves at least one unanswered question. Namely, with regards to the outcome of adverse events which seems to favour azithromycin, the severity of these complications are not well described. Another important consideration in the interpretation of this data is that the absence of difference between azithromycin and amoxi/clavulin is far more robust than with the comparison to Amoxil. As a result, clinicians might be tempted to equate all three drugs when reading this systematic review when in fact, the demonstration of equivalence is more convincing between azithromycin and amoxi/clavulin and not amoxycillin and azithromycin. It is also quite interesting to note that the authors conclude a possible benefit in acute bronchitis when a Cochrane review concludes that there is no net benefit associated with the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.</P>

<FEEDBACK_REPLY MODIFIED="2011-07-08 14:33:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>I have revised the review and added details about adverse events in paragraph 6 of the RESULTS section.<BR/>There is information regarding this in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of the RESULTS section, reporting the risk ratios of two comparisons; azithromycin versus amoxyclav and azithromycin versus amoxycillin. </P>
<P>In the DISCUSSION section we stated that the effect of azithromycin in reducing clinical failure was shown to be much stronger when compared to amoxycillin than to amoxyclav. The evidence was not clear because there were only two trials for the control group of amoxycillin.</P>
<P>Acute bronchitis in this review refers to acute bronchitis with suspected bacterial cause. The review focuses on comparison of effects of azithromycin to amoxyclav or amoxycillin. I understand that the other Cochrane review you mentioned compared antibiotics with placebo. The conclusions of review could be different</P>
