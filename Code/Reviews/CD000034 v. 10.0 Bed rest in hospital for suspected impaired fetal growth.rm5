<P>Too little evidence from trials to show whether hospital bed rest for pregnant women has a beneficial effect on the unborn baby's growth.</P>
<P>An unborn baby receiving too few nutrients can grow more slowly than expected in the womb (impaired fetal growth). Bed rest is sometimes suggested to mothers of these babies with the view that less maternal physical activity could result in more nutrients for the baby. However, bed rest can be disruptive and there are concerns about an increased risk of maternal blood clotting. This review of one study, involving 107 women, found too little evidence to show whether hospital bed rest for pregnant women is beneficial to the unborn baby. More research is needed into the effects on women and their babies.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-06 08:51:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Bed rest in hospital or at home is widely advised and prescribed for various pregnancy complications including threatened miscarriage, preterm labour, multiple pregnancy, antepartum haemorrhage, pregnancy hypertension and impaired fetal growth. </P>
<P>Impaired fetal growth is the failure of a newborn to achieve its genetically determined growth potential, which may cause death as well as short or long-term childhood morbidity. It has been reported that 3% to 10% of neonates are small for corresponding gestational age and an estimated 30% of this is due to impaired fetal growth. The remaining 70% is due to constitutional factors such as maternal ethnicity, parity, weight and height (<LINK REF="REF-Lin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 1998</LINK>). The condition occurs with limited flow of nutrients or oxygen, or both, from mother to fetus as a result of fetal (e.g. chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformations), placental factors (e.g. small placenta), or maternal factors (e.g. malnutrition, vascular/renal disease, drugs or other metabolic conditions) (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). </P>
<P>Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus by measuring the abdominal circumference, head circumference, length of upper leg and interpreting these using standardised formulae allows the clinician to estimate the fetal weight, to relate this to the gestational age and to follow the growth progress. Ultrasound evaluation also allows to some extent to estimate the timing and the cause of the impairment. Symmetrical growth of the fetus is generally due to early problems such as chromosomal abnormalities, drugs, chemical agents or infection. Asymmetric growth usually results from inadequacy of substrates the fetus needs particularly later in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Resnik-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnik 2002</LINK>). In low-income settings where early pregnancy ultrasound is not available fetal growth can be monitored by serial symphysis fundus measurements. However, there is no proven effective treatment that can be applied once growth impairment is diagnosed. In general, when no apparent congenital abnormality exists, management is conservative by frequent growth measurements, smoking cessation if the mother smokes and early delivery when the fetus is thought be mature enough to survive outside the womb. </P>
<P>The outcomes of impaired growth are variable and usually related to the specific cause. For example, if the growth impairment is due to chromosomal anomalies or congenital abnormalities, the fetus is more at risk of a perinatal death. Other short-term outcomes may be moderate to mild metabolic problems (hypoglycemia, polycythemia, meconium aspiration, etc.) due to the chronic oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Depending on the severity and the duration of the condition, long-term outcomes may differ from normal to small decreases in IQ to an increased risk of cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bed rest during pregnancy is one of the numerous approaches (nutritional supplementation, oxygen therapy, plasma volume expansion, betamimetic drugs) suggested to treat impaired fetal growth. In most cases the main rationale is close clinical supervision to assist early detection of adverse events such as untimely labour, severe bleeding or fetal distress that necessitates intervention. Some clinicians also believe that uteroplacental perfusion may improve with bed rest due to increased venous return and cardiac output. On the other hand, bed rest may increase the likelihood of thrombosis and, in practice, it may be stressful for women with other children at home and costly for the health services. It is also unclear whether good compliance can be achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 1995</LINK>). It is therefore important to evaluate the effectiveness of bed rest by reviewing the evidence from randomised trials.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Women with ultrasound-estimated fetal weight 20% below mean population values at 32 weeks' gestation or 15% at 34 weeks, were allocated according to odd or even birth date (Laurin J - personal communication (<LINK REF="STD-Laurin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Laurin 1987</LINK>)) to a bed rest in hospital (group A) or ambulant (off work) (group B) group; such a method of allocation is recognised as running risks of biased selection. In other respects the methodology was sound: compliance with allocated management was reasonable (79%) and evaluation was according to original allocation.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Reporting of the results are based on the deviations from the standard curve of the total population. Mean estimated fetal weight deviations at enrolment were -21.7% and -20.7% for groups A and B respectively. Mean birthweight deviations were -19.7% and -20.6%. These differences were not statistically significant, but given the small numbers studied, the possibility of a type two error needs to be entertained. Mean gestational ages and sizes at delivery were similar in both groups. There was a trend towards fewer operative deliveries for fetal distress and low one minute Apgar scores in the bed rest group but these differences could reflect the play of chance.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Hospitalisation for bed rest is widely practiced without any scientific evidence of its benefit. It is expensive and inconvenient for the couples. The trial of Laurin et al (<LINK REF="STD-Laurin-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Laurin 1987</LINK>) is too small to address this question adequately.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is at present no well-controlled evidence that bed rest in hospital promotes fetal growth, but the numbers studied to date are too small to exclude that possibility with any degree of certainty. It is imperative that hospitalisation for bed rest is used only in the context of controlled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Because of the enormous financial and personal costs of prolonged hospitalisation, this form of management should only be used in the context of well-designed controlled trials to test its effectiveness.</P>
