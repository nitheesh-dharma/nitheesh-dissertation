<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Diabetes management in primary care, outpatient and community settings can be improved by interventions targeting health professionals, and organisational interventions that increase continuity of care</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Diabetes is a major and growing health problem. This review examined the effects of interventions targeting health professionals or the way care is organised, with the aim of improving the management of people with diabetes in primary care, outpatient and community settings. The review found that multifaceted professional interventions (for example combinations of postgraduate education, reminders, audit and feedback, local consensus processes, and peer review) could enhance the performance of care providers. Organisational interventions that increased structured recall, such as central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contacted patients, could also lead to improved care for patients with diabetes. The effectiveness of these interventions on patient outcomes (glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors, wellbeing) is less clear. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Diabetes is a common chronic disease that is increasingly managed in primary care. Different systems have been proposed to manage diabetes care. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of different interventions, targeted at health professionals or the structure in which they deliver care, on the management of patients with diabetes in primary care, outpatient and community settings.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 4 1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), Cinahl (1982-1999), and reference lists of articles. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before and after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series (ITS) analyses of professional, financial and organisational strategies aimed at improving care for people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The participants were health care professionals, including physicians, nurses and pharmacists. The outcomes included objectively measured health professional performance or patient outcomes, and self-report measures with known validity and reliability. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Forty-one studies were included involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were RCTs, 12 were CBAs, and two were ITS. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was often poor. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 12 studies the interventions were targeted at health professionals, in nine they were targeted at the organisation of care, and 20 studies targeted both. In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational interventions. A combination of professional interventions improved process outcomes. The effect on patient outcomes remained less clear as these were rarely assessed. Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on process outcomes. Multiple interventions in which patient education was added or in which the role of the nurse was enhanced also reported favourable effects on patients' health outcomes. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Multifaceted professional interventions can enhance the performance of health professionals in managing patients with diabetes. Organisational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients (central computerised tracking systems or nurses who regularly contact the patient) can also improve diabetes management. The addition of patient-oriented interventions can lead to improved patient health outcomes. Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions, through patient education or facilitating adherence to treatment. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:40:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Diabetes mellitus is a major and still growing health problem. It is expected that the number of people with diabetes will double by 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Amos-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amos 1997</LINK>). In particular, the number of patients with Type 2 diabetes is continuing to rise due to the increasing number of elderly people, the better recognition of prevalent undiagnosed diabetes and the better care for and survival of people with clinically diagnosed diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meneilly-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meneilly 1995</LINK>). Furthermore, the adoption of a more affluent and westernised lifestyle (characterised by decreased physical activity, greater fat consumption and subsequent obesity) by some non-Western populations is also contributing to an increase in the diabetic population (<LINK REF="REF-Roman-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roman 1997</LINK>). Though the rise in prevalence of patients with diabetes mellitus is mainly due to Type 2 diabetes, alarming increases in Type 1 diabetes have also been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Gardner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gardner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Libman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Libman 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Onkamo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onkamo 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:42:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since 1970 the responsibility for the routine review of patients with diabetes has shifted away from hospitals to primary care (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1997</LINK>). Nowadays health professionals working in primary care, outpatient and community settings often play a key role in the care of patients with diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Laine-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laine 1996</LINK>). In particular, centralised, computer-based systems for prompted recall and regular review of patients play a very important part in delivering a good standard of diabetes care (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1998a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, empirical data suggest that care for diabetic patients in primary care, outpatient and community settings could be improved. Studies in the USA have shown that a large proportion of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus are not receiving care in accordance with the published guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beckles-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckles 1998</LINK>). In addition, a Dutch study observed that general practitioners' management of patients with Type 2 diabetes only partly adhered to the published guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners (<LINK REF="REF-Grol-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grol 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konings-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konings 1995</LINK>). Physicians' management of patients with Type 1 diabetes has also been found to be sub-optimal (<LINK REF="REF-Tuttleman-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuttleman 1993</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:41:01 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Achieving good glycaemic control is important. The Diabetes Control and Complications trial proved that good glycaemic control in patients with Type 1 diabetes reduced the occurrence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-DCCT-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DCCT 1993</LINK>). The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (<LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>) found the same to be true for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes with good glycaemic control reported a better functional status and greater well-being (<LINK REF="REF-Ahoroni-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahoroni 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-der-Does-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Does 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reichard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reichard 1996</LINK>). Many diabetic patients, however, have poor glycaemic control (<LINK REF="REF-Mazze-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazze 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Attention to other cardiovascular risk factors is also an important aspect of diabetes management. Type 2 diabetes in particular is associated with a greater risk of heart disease and stroke, because of the interaction between raised concentrations of glucose and other cardiovascular risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuusisto-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuusisto 1994</LINK>). Patients with Type 2 diabetes have a two- to three-fold increased risk of macrovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>). These cardiovascular risk factors often go unrecognised and undertreated in patients with Type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Stolar-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolar 1995</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:42:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the last few years a wide range of interventions targeting professional behaviour or the structure of care has been implemented to achieve better metabolic control or to improve care delivered to patients with diabetes. This review aims to identify and describe interventions to improve the management of patients with diabetes mellitus in primary care, outpatient and community settings.</P>

<P>Full text copies of all potentially relevant studies, determined by reviewing the abstracts, were obtained. For each part of the review, studies were assessed for inclusion independently by two reviewers (CMR/GDV). All studies that appeared initially to meet our inclusion criteria, but on closer examination failed to, are detailed in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. When there was a difference of opinion between reviewers concerning the inclusion of a trial the opinion of the EPOC contact editor was sought.</P>
<P>The data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers (CMR, GDV) using an adapted version of the EPOC Data Collection Checklist (see METHODS USED IN REVIEWS under GROUP DETAILS). Any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by discussion or referred to the EPOC contact editor. The quality of all eligible trials was assessed using the criteria described by the EPOC group (see ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, ASSESSMENT OF METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY under GROUP DETAILS). (The EPOC data collection checklist, which contains information on the quality criteria used to assess studies, is available from the EPOC web site: <LINK REF="REF-EPOC-a" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPOC a</LINK>) Missing information about study design and intervention characteristics was sought from the main authors.</P>

<P>We present the following data (where available): pre-intervention study and control data in natural units and statistical significance across groups; post-intervention study and control data in natural units and statistical significance across groups; absolute and relative percentage improvement. If a unit of analysis error was present, we presented the point estimates of effects without p-values or 95% confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We assessed whether the type of intervention (eg professional or organisational), source of intervention (eg whether the intervention was carried out or supported by a professional organisation) and type of diabetes influence the effectiveness of the interventions (Type 1 diabetes requires more intensive follow-up and more intensive management).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 11:56:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search of the computerised databases identified a total of 1294 citations. After excluding duplicates and studies clearly not related to the objective of our review, 147 abstracts were considered in the selection procedure. Based on full text review, 37 studies were included in the review. Screening of references resulted in another 4 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Consequently, 41 studies were included in the review. Both reviewers agreed in 92% about the inclusion of the studies. The agreement between both reviewers on the five most important items (study design, classification of the intervention strategy and the quality criteria: blinding assessment, baseline measurement, follow-up of patients and 'unit of analysis' error), scored with the DATA COLLECTION CHECKLIST, varied from 82% to 95%.</P>
<P>The studies in this review evaluate a wide range of interventions targeted at health professionals to improve the management of patients with diabetes including professional and organisational interventions. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of a financial intervention were not found.</P>
<P>Forty-one studies met all the inclusion criteria for the scope of the review. Of the included studies 27 were RCTs, 12 had a CBA design and two studies were classified as an ITS study. Fourteen RCTs and one CBA study used patient randomisation. The other studies randomised care providers or practices. Only four studies were multi-arm trials comparing three (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>) or four groups (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>). The others were two arm trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Targeted behaviours</HEADING>
<P>The targeted behaviour in all studies was the general management of care for patients with diabetes. The interventions implemented in the different studies, focused on different aspects of this general management including more regular review, clinical prevention services, referrals, record keeping, professional-patient communication, patient education/advice, patient outcomes or combinations of these.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Type of diabetes</HEADING>
<P>The studied patient population was restricted to patients with Type 2 diabetes in 14 studies. Another 15 studies also included patients with Type 1 diabetes. In 11 studies the type of diabetes was not reported. Only one study focused on improving the care for people with Type 1 diabetes (<LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Characteristics of providers</HEADING>
<P>In the included studies care was delivered mainly by physicians. However, in the majority of studies nurses were also involved and participated in the intervention program as part of the practice team or to give patient education. In only eight studies did the nurses (partly) replace physicians in providing diabetes care. The general management of patients with diabetes was provided solely by a pharmacist in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most studies were located in community settings (27), 11 in outpatient settings and three studies in a combination of both settings. In these latter studies conventional care in an outpatient setting (control group) was compared with a new approach to the delivery of care in a community setting (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>). The alternative approaches in two studies were still supported by conventional clinical practice because routine reviews shifted to the community setting but annual reviews were still performed in the clinic (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The majority of studies were undertaken in the United States (24). Nine studies were carried out in the United Kingdom, two in Australia, three in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria and one in Sweden.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Characteristics of interventions (see EDITORIAL INFORMATION under GROUP DETAILS for METHODS USED IN REVIEWS)</HEADING>
<P>A wide range of organisational and professional interventions was implemented in the studies. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. Twelve studies used professional interventions alone. Most included educational materials (nine studies) or educational meetings (seven studies) in combination with other interventions: local consensus processes (six studies), audit and feedback (five studies), reminders (five studies), educational outreach (four studies) and patient education (four studies). One study evaluated two interventions in combination, five studies evaluated a combination of three interventions, three studies combined four interventions and one study evaluated five interventions.</P>
<P>Nine studies implemented interventions only directed at the organisation of care. Most of these studies also included patient education (five studies). The organisational interventions consisted of arrangements for follow-up (four studies), revision of professional roles (three studies), multidisciplinary team (three studies), changes in medical record systems (two studies), changes to the setting/site of service delivery (two studies), case management (one study), integration of services (one study) or communication and case discussion between distant health professionals (one study). Three studies implemented a single intervention, three a combination of two interventions, two studies combined three interventions and one study implemented seven interventions.</P>
<P>Twenty studies evaluated a combination of professional and organisational interventions. Fifteen of these studies included distribution of educational materials, six included educational meetings, six reminders, five audit and feedback, three local consensus processes, three patient mediated interventions, two educational outreach visits, one marketing, 11 changes in medical record systems, eight arrangements for follow-up, four multidisciplinary teams, three revision of professional roles, three skill mix changes, two communication and case discussion between distant health professionals, two case management, two changes in facilities and equipment, and six patient education. In this group that combined professional and organisational interventions two (two studies), three (seven studies), four (four studies), five (three studies), six (two studies) or seven different interventions (two studies) could be distinguished.</P>
<P>The follow-up period was less than two years in 30 studies. The shortest follow-up period was four months (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>) and the longest lasted for three years (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>) (mean ± sd = 16 months ± 9.28).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Barriers to change</HEADING>
<P>Most included studies identified one or more barriers to change in diabetes care and interventions were designed to address these barriers. Reported barriers to change were lack of acceptance of guidelines, lack of knowledge of diabetology, poor co-operation of staff members, poor quality of documentation of provided care that leads to discontinuous care, the complexity of the guidelines and the lack of information needed to incorporate them into practice, non-attendance and poor compliance of patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Strength of evidence for the desired change in practice</HEADING>
<P>For 29 studies, the published report did not refer to a RCT or systematic review documenting the desired change in professional practice. Lobach (<LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>) and See Tai (<LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>) were the only studies that referred to a systematic review. The other ten studies referred to one or more RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The intervention was based upon clinical practice guidelines or clear recommendations for practice in 27 studies, in the others it was not described. In 14 of the 27 studies the recommendations were locally developed, in 11 studies they were clearly based on national guidelines and in two studies the source of the recommendations was not specified ( <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>) stated explicitly that the intervention was based on national guidelines but that they were adapted through a consensus building process to ensure that non-compliance with care guidelines was not the result of clinician disagreement with the guidelines. In one of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>) the formal consensus process was described.</P>

<P>The methodological quality of each study is described in the table of included studies. The quality criteria applied to RCTs, CBAs and interrupted time series are described in detail in the EPOC module of the Cochrane Library (see METHODS USED IN REVIEWS under EDITORIAL INFORMATION in GROUP DETAILS).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">RCTs</HEADING>
<P>In only six of the 27 RCTS was allocation to groups clearly concealed. Of 19 studies that reported patient outcomes, in seven the patient follow-up was satisfactory (outcome measures were obtained of at least 80% of the patients allocated to groups or for patients who entered into the study). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>) undertook an additional analysis in which they made the conservative assumption of no change in glycaemic control if a patient was lost to follow-up, to ensure that loss to follow-up did not bias the results. This was only done for the major outcome of interest: change in HbA1c. The percentage of care providers of which follow-up data were available, was not explicitly stated in most studies in which these were the units of allocation. This item was scored positive in only three studies.</P>
<P>Outcomes were assessed blindly or were objective in 13 studies. In ten studies blinding of the outcome assessment was partly adequate because the laboratory outcomes scored positive on this criterion (were objective) and clinical outcomes (eg measurements of blood pressure, weight, foot examination) or process outcomes (mostly obtained by chart extraction) scored 'not clear' or 'not done'.</P>
<P>No substantial baseline differences were detected in all reported outcomes in ten RCTs. In six studies there were no baseline differences for some of the reported outcome measures (including the most important outcome glycaemic control). In the other 11 studies it was unclear whether baseline measures were substantially different across study groups or whether initial differences were noticed that are likely to have undermined the post intervention differences.</P>
<P>All outcomes were reliably assessed in 11studies and in a further 11 studies if only glycaemic control was considered. The remaining studies were rated as 'not clear' on this item.</P>
<P>Protection against contamination scored 'done' in 13 studies and 'not clear' in 13 studies. In these 13 studies units of allocation were care providers but they were working in the same setting or patients in the intervention as well as in the control group received (part of) possibly their care (eg the annual review) from the same provider or from different providers in the same setting. In one study the protection against contamination was clearly 'not done', because it had a crossover design (<LINK REF="STD-Shultz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>In seven of the 27 included RCTs the unit of allocation was different from the unit of analysis (eg unit of allocation was the provider/practice and the unit of analysis was the patient). Only if the different unit of analysis makes practical sense and is independent of the unit of allocation estimated by the intra-cluster variability will precision not be influenced. One study calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient and corrected the patient outcomes for clustering at practice level (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">CBA</HEADING>
<P>Eleven of the 12 CBA studies allocated providers or practices. Only one of these studies reported characteristics of the study and control providers (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>) to compare both groups. The percentage of care providers of which follow-up data were available, was not explicitly stated in most studies. Only two studies reported follow-up rates of greater than 80%.</P>
<P>Of eight studies that reported patient outcomes, four reported follow up rates of greater than 80%. Outcomes were assessed blindly or were objective (assessed by a standardised test) in seven studies. In four studies blinding of the outcome assessment was partly adequate.<BR/>No baseline differences were detected between the intervention and control group in three studies. All the outcomes were reliably assessed in seven studies and if only glycaemic control was taken into account four studies could be added (assessed by laboratory test).</P>
<P>In two studies patients or care providers were allocated within a clinic or practice, so communication between the intervention and control group could have occurred. The effect of the intervention might have carried over in this way. In one study it was likely that the control group received the intervention because it was stated that both the intervention and control clinic were staffed by the same personnel (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">ITS</HEADING>
<P>For both ITS studies, the intervention occurred independent of other changes. No statistical analysis was performed in one study and in the other it was limited, because only a chi-square test was performed. The intervention was unlikely to affect data collection because sources and methods of data collection were the same before and after the intervention. One study assessed the outcomes blindly (<LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>) but in both studies it was unclear whether the data were obtained in a reliable way. One study reported that the data set covered more than 80% of total number of participants in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Power calculations were included in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). The smallest effect size for the most reported patient outcome, glycated haemoglobin, likely to be found on the basis of these calculations, was 1% difference in mean glycated haemoglobin if a predictive power of 80% at the 0.05 level was used (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>). Only one study appeared to have sufficient statistical power to detect this effect (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The sample size in the study of Weinberger (<LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>) was primarily based on the statistical consideration to detect a moderate effect size of 0.45 difference in mean glycohaemoglobin between study groups. They had 90% power for this outcome and in addition they had 80% power to detect a 12 mg/dl change in total cholesterol in a subgroup of hyperlipidemic patients.</P>
<P>In Feder et al (<LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>) power calculations were undertaken to detect a 50% relative increase in the recording of blood glucose concentrations with a power of 95% at a significance level of 5%.</P>
<P>A power calculation included in Hartmann et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>) showed that a significant change in the main process outcomes from 5% to 7.5% would be detected in a sample of 200 patients out of ten practices with a power of 90%. These main process outcomes were: documentation of funduscopy, screening for hypopallaesthesia and albuminuria.</P>
<P>None of the studies appeared to have taken clustering into account during the sample size calculation.</P>
<P>The studies are grouped by type of intervention. The key results are presented on a study-by-study basis in order of number of interventions that are implemented. An overall conclusion is given for the three types of interventions that were distinguished in this review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparisons: professional intervention versus usual care</HEADING>
<P>We located 12 studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) in which the effectiveness of professional interventions versus usual care was studied (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1991</LINK>). None of the studies tested a single intervention. Combinations of two, three, four or five interventions were used. In four of the studies the professional intervention was combined with patient education (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study determined the effect of a combination of two interventions: educational meetings and educational outreach visits (<LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>). In this study GPs and practice nurses were trained in providing patient centred care. This approach to diabetes care encourages practitioners to integrate patients' perspectives within the consultation. Only 19% of the professionals in the study applied this method systematically, and no significant biochemical or functional improvements could be demonstrated.</P>
<P>A combination of three interventions was studied in six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>):<BR/>Two studies combined educational meetings, educational materials and patient education. In these studies only patient outcomes were measured (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>). Pieber et al (<LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>) found a significant difference in change in HbA1c, BMI, diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides between the intervention and control group. This study however, had a potential unit of analysis error. In the study of Kinmonth et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>) no positive change in glycaemic control or blood pressure was detected. Triglycerides and BMI were significantly worse in the intervention group, possibly due to more intensive managment. Favourable effects were reported on patients' wellbeing. The education implemented in this study consisted of a training program for care providers to provide patient-centred care.<BR/>Litzelman et al (<LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>) studied the effectiveness of educational materials, reminders and patient education on patient and process outcomes related to the diabetic foot. The documentation of provided care in patient records was very low at baseline, so there was a lot of room for improvement. Significant differences were found between the intervention and control group after a follow-up period of one year, although the documentation of care was significantly better in the intervention group it was still relatively low. Patients in the intervention group had a relative risk of 0.41 (p&lt;0.05) for serious foot lesions and of 0.62 (p&lt;0.05) to have dry cracked skin when compared to the control (unit;error)).</P>
<P>Palmer et al (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1985</LINK>) did not find an effect on practice performance of the combination of educational meetings, audit and feedback and local consensus procedures. However, the baseline care was already good and therefore there was limited room for improvement.<BR/>A combination of educational meetings, educational outreach visits and personalised audit and feedback positively affected items recorded in the medical records in accordance with a 'recommended standard' (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>). In this study statistically significant differences were found between the data that were collected by two nurses. The study demonstrated no difference in the effect whether personalised audit and feedback was performed by nurse or doctor, but there was a significant difference between different doctors.</P>
<P>A study in which local consensus processes, reminders, and audit and feedback using a computerised decision support system were combined, demonstrated a favourable effect on compliance rates of care providers (<LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>) (unit;error). The effect of the combination of interventions in the three last mentioned studies on patient outcomes remained unclear because these were not assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three studies tested a combination of four different interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>):<BR/>Benjamin et al (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>) implemented audit and feedback, educational materials, educational meetings and local consensus processes. They reported a favourable effect on both patient and process outcomes. The effect of the combination of guidelines developed by local consensus, practice based education materials, educational outreach visits and reminders, was studied in Feder et al (<LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>). This study showed better recording of patient outcomes, significant improvements were found in all recorded variables. The control group was offered a set of guidelines concerning care for asthma.</P>
<P>Mazze et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>) studied the effect of the combination of local consensus processes, educational materials , educational meetings and a scheme to make decisions for treatment of patients (Staged Diabetes Management). The intervention increased the percentage of patients with recorded examinations after 6 months and also a lower HbA1c was found in the intervention group in comparison to the control group. In this study statistical analyses were not performed and insufficient data were available for a post hoc analysis.</P>
<P>The most complex professional intervention strategy combined five interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>):<BR/>Mazzuca et al (<LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>) tested in a multi arm trial of four groups of residents in four clinics clinics the benefit of a combination of educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, reminders and patient education. The group of residents that received a combination of audit and feedback, reminders and postgraduate education did not differ in their performance with regard to the frequency of measurement of glycated haemoglobin from the group that only received educational materials and educational meetings. However, both groups differed with regard to their performance in ordering home blood glucose monitoring. The third intervention group was also equipped with a set of consumable clinical materials (such as equipment for measurement of blood sugar, a detailed dietary consult form, self care contracting forms for patients) besides education, reminders and audit and feedback. This group produced the highest level of laboratory orders for glycated haemoglobin. At the time of the study this was a newly available measure of blood sugar control. The authors speculated that the reason for the high level of laboratory orders for glycated haemoglobin in the third group was that this group was equipped with an apparatus to measure blood sugar quickly and at no expense to the patient. If this measurement was done, the physicians were free to try out the new test of glycated haemoglobin without an unusual financial burden to the patient and/or insurance carrier. The level of laboratory orders for glycated haemoglobin was higher in the third group than in the fourth group in which patient education was added to all other interventions. Presumably, as stated by the authors, this is due to the confounding of the four clinic nurses working in the four clinics who were all patient educators in their clinics.</P>
<P>To improve the quality of diabetes care Carlson et al (<LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1991</LINK>) chose an alternative to a centrally designed diabetes-control program. In this approach patients and health-care providers were educated and trained to develop their own local organisation of diabetes care by local consensus processes. They were trained to identify problems in local diabetes care and to develop the means to solve these problems. After 18 months significant differences in favour of the intervention group were found in the frequency of HbA1c measurements (p&lt;0.001), and eye examinations (p&lt;0.01) (unit;error). The two groups had a similar degree of glycaemic control, although p-values were not reported. Since the unit of allocation and unit of analysis differed in these studies multivariate analyses were performed to adjust for some organisational, professional characteristics. After these adjustments involvement in the diabetes-control program was still associated with a positive effect on the routine care as described earlier.</P>

<P>Postgraduate education in combination with reminders, audit and feedback, educational outreach visits or combinations of these interventions improved the provided diabetes care in all studies that did not demonstrate a good standard of care at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1991</LINK>). The effect on patient outcomes is less clear as in most studies these outcomes were not assessed.

<P>Nine studies (see <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>) compared organisational interventions with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Branger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Branger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>). In five studies two forms of patient orientated interventions were also implemented: patient education (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>) and a learner-centred counselling approach, allowing patients to identify problems and agree potential solutions (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>). Combinations of one, two, three and seven interventions were implemented.</P>
<P>Three studies determined the effect of a single intervention strategy: changes in medical record system, arrangements for follow-up or revision of professional roles (<LINK REF="STD-Branger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Branger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>):<BR/>Branger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Branger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Branger 1999</LINK>) studied the effects of changes in a medical record system, aimed at facilitating the exchange of information between physicians caring for diabetic patients. Significantly more measurements of glycaemic control, blood pressure-, weight- and lipids were performed in the intervention group. The HbA1c level decreased slightly but the change was not statistically significant (unit;error).<BR/>Arrangements for follow up by mailing multiple patient reminders resulted in improved rates of diabetes eye examination (<LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>). However, the reported improvement was modest and seemed to be short-lived, because in the second six months following the intervention, the effect diminished. The third study, in which a pharmacist replaced the physician, showed several methodological limitations: 45% of the patients were lost to follow-up and information about the methodological quality of this study was scarcely reported (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>). No significant differences in levels of fasting blood glucose were reported between the patients managed by the pharmacist and those managed by the physician.</P>
<P>In three studies a combination of two interventions was studied (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>):<BR/>The addition of patient education to the substitution of the physician by a pharmacist in providing diabetes care, showed a favourable effect on glycaemic control (<LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>). However this study included only 39 patients. Smith et al (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>) evaluated a strategy in which arrangements for follow-up were combined with patient education. Patients were sent educational materials and appointment reminders and received telephone calls for rescheduling of failed encounters. This resulted in more kept scheduled visits in the intervention group compared to the control group (p&lt;0.01). The third study that was carried out to examine the effect of a combination of two interventions studied a joint GP-nurse review system in combination with arrangements for follow-up. An interrupted time series design was used to assess the effect of the intervention on process outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>). The intervention increased the percentage of patients with recorded examinations during the period 1983-1988. In this study a statistical analysis was not performed and insufficient data were available for a post hoc analysis.</P>
<P>A combination of three intervention strategies was tested in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>):<BR/>Sadur et al (<LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>) conducted a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary team, case management and patient education. The multidisciplinary team was led by a diabetes nurse educator who was supported by two diabetologists. After 6 months patients in the intervention group had significant lower HbA1c levels and had significant lower rates of hospital admissions than patients in the control group. Another study combined revision of professional roles (enhancing the role of the nurse), changes to the setting (a new purpose-designed building to provide integrated educational clinical care) and a patient orientated intervention (learner-centred counselling approach) (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>). A positive effect on glycaemic control was found in this study.</P>
<P>One study combined seven interventions: a clinical multidisciplinary team, formal integration of services, arrangements for follow-up, communication and case discussion between distant health professionals, changes to the setting, changes in medical record systems and patient education (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>). The combination of these interventions significantly improved glycaemic control. Furthermore, the decrease in cholesterol level was significantly larger in the intervention group than in the control group (unit;error). In this study, the number of patients in the intervention group was five times higher than in the control group.</P>

<P>Changes in medical record systems improved process outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Branger-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Branger 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of the implementation of revision of professional roles as a single intervention remains unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>).<BR/>Revision of professional roles in combination with a patient-orientated part was associated with a small beneficial effect on glycaemic control (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>). The results of these studies have to be interpreted with some caution because of a limited methodological quality.</P>
<P>Intensive follow-up improves the process of care in terms of scheduled visits and rates of diabetic eye examinations, although there is variation with the type and intensity of methods used (<LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>). Telephone calls for rescheduling visit failures combined with patient education (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>) are more effective than sending multiple reminders to patients, which only affected process outcomes in the short term in comparison to a single reminder (<LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of intensive follow-up on patient outcomes remains unclear as these were not assessed in these studies.<BR/>The effect of arrangements for follow-up in combination with the formation of a multidisciplinary team is not clear because of the limitations of the statistical analysis in the only study that examined this (<LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination of a multidisciplinary team with case management and patient education showed favourable effects on process and patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Sadur-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sadur 1999</LINK>). A combination of six organisational interventions and patient education also found favourable effects on patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Comparisons: professional in combination with organisational interventions versus usual care</HEADING>
<P>Most studies (20; see <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) in this review implemented a complex intervention consisting of a combination of professional and organisational interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deeb-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Deeb 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rutten-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rutten 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taplin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taplin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). In fifteen studies the care providers received education by distribution of educational materials and/or through educational meetings in combination with organisational interventions.</P>
<P>The most common intervention targeted at the organisation of care was a change in the medical record system (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taplin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taplin 1998</LINK>). This medical record system was used for arrangements for follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>), audit and feedback (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>, to generate reminders to the care provider (<LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>), or a combination of these (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Taplin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taplin 1998</LINK>). In six studies patient education was added to professional and organisational interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deeb-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Deeb 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). The effectiveness of a combination of two, three, four, five, six or seven interventions was studied.</P>
<P>Two studies determined the effect of a single professional in combination with a single organisational intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Rutten-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rutten 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>):<BR/>Rutten et al (<LINK REF="STD-Rutten-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Rutten 1990</LINK>) stimulated outpatient management of patients by self-monitoring and also implemented a diabetes protocol with a therapeutic scheme to manage diabetic patients (case management and distribution of educational materials). The aim was to make the frequency of consultations dependent on the metabolic control. HbA1 decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group (unit;error) and for body weight no effect was found. See Tai et al (<LINK REF="STD-Tai-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tai 1999</LINK>) evaluated the effect of reminders and changes in medical record systems. The results showed a positive change in process outcomes, however, because of the small numbers of practices involved no statistical testing was undertaken.</P>
<P>Seven studies evaluated a combination of three interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shultz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 1992</LINK>):<BR/>Nilasena et al (<LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>) studied the effectiveness of educational materials, reminders and changes in medical record systems. This strategy showed a positive effect on process outcomes, although this effect was found in both the intervention and control group. Therefore, no significant difference between both groups in the change in compliance score was demonstrated. This could be due to contamination because both intervention and control residents worked in the same clinics and the supervisors that served as opinion leaders for the residents interacted with both groups. If the reminders in the strategy described before were substituted by arrangements for follow-up, improvements in process outcomes were reported but not in patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>An ITS study was carried out to determine whether educational materials in combination with a multidisciplinary foot-care team and reminders affected the rate of lower-extremity amputations (LEA) among American Indians (<LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>). No significant reductions in average annual incidence of LEA were seen. Although the study population has an extremely high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes and also suffered disproportionately higher rates of LEA, the number of LEA/1000 diabetic years in this study was quite low.</P>
<P>Hoskins et al (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>) conducted a trial to evaluate the effect of educational materials, educational outreach visits and arrangements for follow-up. A research nurse was assigned to liaise with patient and doctor to stimulate continuity of care and to remind them of the need to assess metabolic control, blood pressure and weight on a 4-monthly basis. This system of shared care was compared to general practitioner care and conventional clinic care. In all three groups a comparable improvement in glycaemic control (p&lt;0.05) and a decrease in attendance rates after the initial assessment was demonstrated. However, the decrease in attendance rates was lowest for the shared care group.</P>
<P>A combination of educational materials, revision of professional roles (nurse case management) and patient education did not improve glycaemic control or weight in a trial that included 28 female patients (<LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of the implementation of arrangements for follow-up, patient mediated interventions and patient education was studied by Weinberger et al (<LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). Nurses attempted to call patients at least monthly in order to educate patients, monitor their health status and facilitate compliance by reviewing prescribed regimens and reinforcing the importance of compliance. Additionally, they alerted the patients' physician to identified problems and reminded them of upcoming clinic appointments. In this study glycohaemoglobin appeared to be better controlled in the intervention group in this study compared to the control group (p=0.046).</P>
<P>A cross-over trial was carried out to assess the effectiveness of an intervention strategy consisting of a patient mediated intervention,<BR/>changes in physical facilities and equipment and changes in medical records systems (<LINK REF="STD-Shultz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 1992</LINK>). A telecommunication system was implemented to assist in the outpatient management of patients with Type 1 diabetes. Only a small selected group of 30 patients was included from the veterans hospital: patients with the highest blood glycohaemoglobins. For the intervention group the blood glycohaemoglobin dropped significantly.</P>
<P>In four studies a combination of four interventions was used (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>):<BR/>A combination of educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback and changes in medical record systems demonstrated to be beneficial on the documentation of process of care (<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>). These effects were only seen in items documented annually: lipid spectrum, serum creatinine, funduscopy and foot examination (unit;error). In contrast, changes in quarterly documented items such as blood glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI did not differ between the intervention and control groups. Educational materials, reminders, arrangements for follow-up and changes in medical record systems were combined in the study of Naji et al (<LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>). This intervention improved process outcomes but did not change patients' metabolic control.</P>
<P>O'Connor et al (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>) implemented local consensus processes, audit and feedback, skill mix changes and patient education. Nurses were authorised to initiate patient visits for nurse education or for dilated eye examinations when indicated and to order laboratory tests. Physicians' practice improved as much in the control as in the intervention group. However, glycaemic control was significantly better in the patients in the intervention group. The combination of educational materials, revision of professional roles, arrangements for follow-up and patient education resulted in a significantly improved glycaemic control (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>). This favourable effect was not found for lipid spectrum, blood pressure and weight.</P>
<P>In three studies the effectiveness of a combination of five interventions was studied (<LINK REF="STD-Deeb-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Deeb 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>):<BR/>The combination of educational materials, educational meetings, educational outreach visits, a clinical multidisciplinary team and patient education was studied by Deeb et al (<LINK REF="STD-Deeb-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Deeb 1988</LINK>). Within the intervention group process outcomes improved more than within in the control group. Unfortunately, at baseline there were substantial differences across study groups, 38% of the patients were lost to follow-up and in the statistical analyses outcomes were not adjusted for baseline values (unit;error). For some outcomes a possible ceiling effect was noticed. Consequently, the effectiveness of this intervention remains inconclusive.</P>
<P>In the study by Boucher (<LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>) educational materials were combined with educational meetings, arrangements for follow-up, communication and case discussion between distant health professionals, and changes in medical record systems. Mean glycated haemoglobin values fell significantly in the intervention group but did not change in the control group (unit;error). Process outcomes seemed to improve by the intervention also, however this was not statistically tested. It is noticeable that in this study only 44% of the patients that entered the study had initial and follow-up data. The combination of educational materials, audit and feedback, revision of professional roles (nurses made clinical diabetes management decisions based on detailed protocols), arrangements for follow-up and changes in medical record systems showed an improvement of glycaemic control (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>). In this study a favourable effect was demonstrated on process outcomes also, although this was not statistically tested.</P>
<P>Two studies combined six interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>):<BR/>Legorreta et al (<LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>) determined the effectiveness of educational materials, educational meetings, a multidisciplinary team, skill mix changes (nurses were more involved in diabetes management), changes in medical record systems and arrangements for follow-up. Glycaemic control significantly improved more in the intervention group.</P>
<P>In the study by Marrero (<LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>) the following interventions were implemented: educational materials, patient mediated intervention, skill mix changes (enhanced role for the nurse), case management, changes in facilities and equipment and changes in medical record systems. A telecommunication system was implemented to assist in the outpatient management of patients. This study was the only one in the review that included paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes. No changes were reported between the intervention and control group in glycaemic control.</P>
<P>A combination of seven interventions was looked at in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Taplin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taplin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>):<BR/>The effectiveness of educational materials, local consensus processes, audit and feedback, reminders, marketing (establishing a team and after that regular team meetings to discuss and achieve clinical goals), a multidisciplinary team and changes in medical record systems did not significantly improve the compliance with guidelines on diabetic eye care (<LINK REF="STD-Taplin-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taplin 1998</LINK>). This finding could be explained by a possible ceiling effect. In the control practices a significant improvement was found, probably due to their low initial levels of compliance.</P>
<P>A combination of educational materials, educational meetings, local consensus processes, audit and feedback, reminders, communication and case discussion between distant health professionals and patient education was studied by Vinicor et al (<LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>). The intervention strategy was studied in a multi-arm trial with four study groups. The first group was the control group, the second group received only patient education, the third group received a combination of all professional interventions combined with communication and case discussion between distant health professionals, the fourth group received a combination of the intervention implemented in the second and third group. The fourth group showed the greatest improvements in glycaemic control and body weight, although improvements were also seen in the second and third group. These results have to be interpreted with some caution because only 50% of the patients were reassessed after 26 months (unit;error). For the assessment of process outcomes the first and second group as well as the third and fourth group were combined. The intensive instruction of internal medicine residents resulted in more fasting blood glucose determinations among their patients than in the control group after 11 months (39% of the patients dropped out because they did not remain active in the clinic). Additionally lipid monitoring was increased by instruction. No effects were seen on the monitoring for chronic complications.</P>

One of these studies did not demonstrate an effect on patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>) and the study that reported a positive effect had a limited methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>). Moreover in this study both process and patient outcomes were assessed after different follow-up periods (11 and 26 months respectively).</P>
<P>A centrally organised computerised database to make arrangements for follow-up, to track patient appointments and to generate reminder cards for patients is associated with improvements in process outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>) but does not improve patient outcomes.<BR/>In studies in which patient outcomes were assessed, those that featured greater involvement of nurses in diabetes management reported positive effects on patient outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-11-10 12:18:37 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was performed to identify effective intervention strategies to improve the management of patients with diabetes mellitus in primary care, outpatient and community settings.</P>
<P>It is important to note that the studies identified for the review are heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes. In addition, the methodological quality was often limited: there were high dropout rates among patients and the possibility of unit of analysis errors increasing the apparent precision of estimates was often noticed. Moreover, essential information about concealment of allocation and the number of professionals included in the study was often missing. Therefore, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions. However, some common elements in the heterogeneous interventions that showed a favourable effect can be distinguished.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of interventions</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Professional and organisational interventions</HEADING>
<P>Postgraduate education was part of the complex intervention in almost all studies. Understandably, care providers first need the skills and knowledge to improve their performance. Moreover, they must be convinced of the importance of changing their practice and motivated to do so. This type of intervention seemed to be effective on process outcomes in combination with other interventions like reminders, audit and feedback, local consensus processes, peer review or combinations of these strategies (<LINK REF="STD-Benjamin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Benjamin 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Feder-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Feder 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lobach-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lobach 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazze-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Mazze 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mazzuca-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mazzuca 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carlson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Carlson 1991</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Hartmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hartmann 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nilasena-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilasena 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patient tracking systems or other systems for regular follow-up also improved quality of care at the process level (<LINK REF="STD-Halbert-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Halbert 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sullivan-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sullivan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boucher-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Boucher 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hurwitz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hurwitz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). These interventions may decrease the number of patients getting lost to follow-up. This is particularly important because loss to follow-up carries an increased risk of diabetes complications. Central computerised systems can be of additional value as they may provide feedback to providers and can also generate reminders to providers for management of their patients. Furthermore, in an easy reliable way data can be obtained to measure improvements in the performance of care providers and patient outcomes.</P>
<P>Only thirteen (Benjamin 1999; Litzelman 1993; Mazze 1994; Pill 1998; Carlson 1991; Smith 1987; Boucher 1987; Hoskins 1993; Hurwitz 1993; Naji 1994; O'Connor 1996; Peters 1998; Vinicor 1987) of the forty-one studies studied both effects on process outcomes and on related patient outcomes. Only seven of these studies demonstrated a favourable effect on patient outcomes besides a positive effect on process outcomes (Benjamin 1999; Litzelman 1993; Boucher 1987; Hoskins 1993; O'Connor 1996; Peters 1998; Vinicor 1987)). One component that was included in the intervention strategies in four of the positive studies was a patient-oriented part: patient education (Litzelman 1993; Vinicor 1987), a research nurse was assigned to liaise with patient and doctor (Hoskins 1993), or a combination of both (O'Connor 1996). However, three studies probably overestimated the effect because of a unit of analysis error (Litzelman 1993; O'Connor 1996; Vinicor 1987). In five studies improvements in quality of provided care were not accompanied by improvement in patient outcomes (Pill 1998; Carlson 1991; Smith 1987; Hurwitz 1993; Naji 1994) and in one study it was not clear as the statistical analyses were limited (Benjamin 1999).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Patient-oriented intervention</HEADING>
<P>The addition of a patient-oriented intervention to professional and/or organisational interventions generally led to improvements of patient outcomes next to improvements in process outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Revision of professional roles</HEADING>
<P>The seven studies in which nurses replaced (partly) physicians in providing diabetes care generally demonstrated a positive impact on glycaemic control (<LINK REF="STD-Day-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Day 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Legorreta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Legorreta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1996" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stein-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Stein 1974</LINK>). The effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care model in which a pharmacist solely provided all diabetes-related management aspects needs further exploration as the two studies that evaluated this were of poor methodological quality (<LINK REF="STD-Hawkins-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Hawkins 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Telecommunication systems</HEADING>
<P>The interventions aimed at improving diabetes care for patients with Type 1 diabetes focused on using a telecommunication system to assist in outpatient management of these patients. One of the two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Shultz-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Shultz 1992</LINK>) in which this intervention was studied was of poor quality. The other study was the only study in the review that only included paediatric patients (<LINK REF="STD-Marrero-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Marrero 1995</LINK>). Thus it is still difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention strategy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Financial interventions</HEADING>
<P>No studies were identified that dealt with financial interventions. The explanation may be that studies of these strategies are often not restricted to primary care.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of populations</HEADING>
<P>One identified study restricted the study population to patients with Type 1 diabetes. A lot of studies dealt with a study population of both patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes or did not mention which type of diabetes was involved. None of these studies reported the effectiveness of an intervention separately for different types of diabetes. Therefore no conclusions can be made about whether the type of diabetes influences the effectiveness of the interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methodological considerations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Unit of analysis error</HEADING>
<P>If a unit of analysis error was present a reanalysis would be indicated. However, the great number of studies lacking the essential information in the paper (18 out of 39 studies) made this practically impossible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Effect sizes</HEADING>
<P>Differences in guidelines and also in methods and reference values to assess glycated haemoglobin meant that a uniform effect size could not be valued and presented, thereby hindering between-study comparisons. In addition, in some studies a possible ceiling effect was identified because of very low initial values and in others there was much more room for improvement because of very high initial values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Generalisability</HEADING>
<P>In this review we determined the effectiveness of different interventions, targeted at health care professionals or the structure in which health care professionals deliver their care. The studies that are described include selected practitioners that were willing to implement sometimes very complex interventions. The representativeness of the care providers and practices was variable, from only one practice with one provider (<LINK REF="STD-Rith_x002d_Najarian-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Rith-Najarian 1998</LINK>) to almost all local practices in a big area (<LINK REF="STD-Ward-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Ward 1996</LINK>). In addition, it is not clear if the patients in the studies are representative for the population of diabetes patients because participating patients often are a selected group of patients that are younger, less ill, and more accomodating than the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Greenhalgh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhalgh 1997</LINK>). Studies were all carried out in primary care, outpatient and community settings but still had a specific practice structure often dependent of the organisation of the national or local organisation of health care. Most studies were located in the US. Thus conclusions from this review should be generalised with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Study size and loss-to-follow-up</HEADING>
<P>Most studies of strategies to improve diabetes care limit the evaluation to patients who are motivated enough to consent to participate in clinical trials. This usually drops the number of eligible patients entering the study. Only six studies included a power calculation, many of the studies would have been underpowered to detect small changes in patient outcomes.</P>
<P>Among patients who entered the study high dropout rates were experienced, which may have affected the reported effects. There are many factors that predispose to non-attendance eg patient health beliefs, attitudes of health professionals and financial costs of attendance (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1998b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1998b</LINK>). On the other hand, because diabetes affects a population of mainly elderly people with a chronic complex disease, some loss to follow-up is inevitable in primary care to follow-up because of severe illness, death and hospitalisation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Hawthorne-effect</HEADING>
<P>Another issue that could influence the effect of the intervention is the Hawthorne effect. In an RCT the effect size could be underestimated as both the intervention and control group could improve their performance by virtue of participation in a study in which both groups were motivated to implement an intervention to improve their performance. On the other hand the effect could be overestimated in a controlled before after study in which the control group provide usual care and is not necessarily motivated to implement an intervention and is possibly not (completely) informed about the intervention and the purpose of this. The intervention group could improve their delivered care just because they participate in a study aimed at improving diabetes management.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Inclusion of Interrupted Time Series (ITS) and Controlled Before After studies (CBA)</HEADING>
<P>The decision to include interrupted time series in this review did not have much influence on the conclusions because of limited methodological quality and the statistical methods used were not sufficient. Insufficient data were given to calculate reliable effect sizes. Moreover, as RCTs are not always feasible for interventions aimed at improving professional practice we included CBA studies. Studies with a CBA design often provide useful and reliable information that can help to further explain the results of randomised controlled trials. To expand the inclusion criteria for study design with CBA studies added 12 studies to the review. RCTs clearly offer the highest level of evidence to determine whether interventions are efficacious, followed by CBA and ITS studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Duration of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>One concern is whether the positive effects of the complex and often intensive interventions can be maintained on the long-term. The follow-up period was less than two years in 30 studies of the 41 studies and 1 year or less in 25 studies. On the other hand for some of the studies there is the possibility that the evaluation was premature and that patients had not been exposed to the intervention for long enough to detect any changes or the maximum change. The inexorable progress of diabetes might also be a reason for not finding favourable effects on patient outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Micro- and macrovascular complications</HEADING>
<P>The primary process and patient outcomes studied in most studies in this review concerned glycaemic control. However, recent studies emphasise the importance of combining monitoring and treatment of glycaemic control with that of other cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes patients: blood pressure and lipid spectrum (<LINK REF="REF-Turner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kuusisto-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuusisto 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-UKPDS-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKPDS 1998</LINK>). A high blood glucose interacts with cardiovascular risk factors. Unfortunately, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>) evaluated outcomes on process and patient level concerning the lipid spectrum and additionally two other studies assessed patient and process outcomes on blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>). Peters (<LINK REF="STD-Peters-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Peters 1998</LINK>) showed a clearly better compliance with ADA guidelines related to a greater number of lipid tests in the intervention group than in the control group, although this was not statistically tested. Moreover, in the subgroup of patients with a cholesterol level &gt;6.2 mmol/l, total cholesterol levels fell significantly in the intervention group, but did not change in the control group. The study population in the subgroups, however, was very low. Naji (<LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>) reported an increase in frequency of measurement of blood pressure, but did not find a different change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the intervention and control group. In the second study both process outcomes and patient outcomes were assessed after different follow-up periods. Improvements were found on patient outcomes only.</P>
<P>In six studies the effect of the intervention strategy on lipid spectrum of patients was evaluated without determining changes in process of care (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jaber-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Jaber 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinberger-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Weinberger 1995</LINK>). Two studies showed a significant decrease in cholesterol and/ or triglycerides concentrations compared to the control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>). Eight studies measured the effect of the intervention on blood pressure and in all of these studies no difference in change between the intervention and control group was found (<LINK REF="STD-Kinmonth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kinmonth 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pill-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pill 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aubert-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Aubert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naji-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Naji 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinicor-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vinicor 1987</LINK>). However, in 3 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Pieber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pieber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Sonnaville-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Sonnaville 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 1993</LINK>) significant decreases were found within both groups.</P>
<P>It was noticeable that in the process of diabetes care more attention was paid to monitoring microvascular complications: especially in relation to eye and feet examination, potentially because of low initial levels. The effect of the interventions on micro- and macrovascular endpoints, however, needs further examination in the long term.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>From the review it is difficult to know whether the postgraduate education components did contribute to improvements in care. There were no trials solely evaluating postgraduate education - all had other components. Postgraduate education in combination with other professional interventions improves the process of diabetes care. </P>
<P>Also strategies that increase structured recall contribute to a better quality of diabetes care. This can be achieved by central computerised tracking systems or by nurses who regularly contact patients. These arrangements for follow-up improve process outcomes. <BR/>The effectiveness of these professional and organisational interventions on patient outcomes (clinical outcomes and wellbeing) is less clear.</P>
<P>The addition of patient education or a more enhanced role of a nurse to a complex intervention strategy seems to be important to improve patient outcomes besides process outcomes. Nurses can play an important role in facilitating compliance or giving patient education. They can even replace physicians in delivering many aspects of diabetes care, if detailed management protocols are available, or if they receive training.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This review demonstrates that at present there are a large number of multifaceted models being tested. The choice of components within the models has often not been based on a theoretical or empirical rationale. Future research should either aim to use designs that would allow disentangling of the effects of the different components or evaluate reproducible complex interventions and encourage replications of using the same intervention model. </P>
<P>A great number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of complex interventions to improve diabetes management were identified. Unfortunately, only thirteen of these studies reported outcomes on process and outcomes at the patient level. Both measures contribute to a better understanding of how to improve the quality of care. Process indicators contribute to understanding heterogeneity in outcomes. Poor implementation of complex interventions (masked in the absence of process indicators) may undermine excellent design, power and recruitment. Thus recommendations for current research most usefully draw on a combination of process indicators and outcome measures.</P>
<P>Studies need to focus more on process and patient outcomes in relation to cardiovascular risk factors, because of the interaction between glycaemic control and these risk factors. </P>
<P>Furthermore the effectiveness of the complex and often very intensive interventions has to be evaluated in the long term. </P>
<P>In relation to methodological quality, the following aspects should be given particular attention if new studies are undertaken: they should have sufficient power, adequate follow-up of patients and providers and they should calculate the intra-class correlation coefficient and correct patient outcomes for clustering at practice level. The issue of clustering is particularly relevant here as many of the interventions are aimed at the practitioner. Furthermore, it needs to be taken into consideration in both sample size calculations and analysis.</P>
<P>There is also a need for investigators to adopt standard measurement techniques and reference values for glycated haemoglobin, the primary outcome to assess glycaemic control. Also more comparable guidelines would be advisable. Both would facilitate comparison of effectiveness across different interventions and provide a benchmark against which clinicians could measure success. However, consensus between providers about guidelines is important, otherwise lack of compliance may be due to disagreement with them.</P>
<P>The absence of data on the cost-effectiveness of interventions is a serious omission that should be assessed.</P>
