<TITLE>Does giving chemotherapy before surgery improve survival or quality of life for women with advanced ovarian epithelial cancer?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epithelial ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide in women under the age of 65 years, and is the most common form of ovarian cancer (approximately 90% of ovarian cancers). Unfortunately most women with ovarian cancer present at a late stage when their disease has spread throughout the abdomen. This is because symptoms are vague, often occur only after the cancer has spread, and can be misdiagnosed as being caused by other benign conditions. In Europe, just over a third of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis.</P>
<P>Conventional treatment for ovarian cancer is to have surgery (laparotomy) to remove the womb, ovaries, the omentum (a fatty structure (apron) that hangs down from the stomach and drapes over the intestines in the upper abdomen) and to sample the lymph nodes (glands) in the pelvis and abdomen. The intention of surgery is to stage the disease (assess where the cancer has spread to) and remove as much of the cancer as possible (debulking or cytoreduction). However, since most women will have widespread disease, surgery alone does not cure the disease and further treatment is necessary, in the form of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer uses platinum-based drugs (carboplatin and cisplatin) to treat any cancer cells that cannot be removed by surgery or are too small to be seen (microscopic disease).</P>
<P>Chemotherapy can be used before surgery (also called neoadjuvant chemotherapy) with the aim of shrinking the cancer and making it easier to remove all of the cancer.</P>
<P>One good-quality study in women with advanced ovarian cancer was included in this review. This study compared 336 women who were given chemotherapy first with 334 women who underwent surgery first and found no difference between the two treatments with respect to the time to death or the time to progression of the disease, that is chemotherapy before surgery had a similar effect on survival as the conventional treatment. The study only enrolled women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer. (Stage IIIc is when the tumour that has spread into the abdomen is greater than 2 cm in size.) A large proportion of women in the study had very bulky tumours. We therefore assessed the evidence to be of moderate quality and concluded that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative to primary surgery in women with bulky stage IIIc/IV disease. Three other studies are currently being conducted that will hopefully contribute more evidence to guide clinical practice in this area in the future.</P>

<P>For the original review we searched, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (Silver Platter, from 1966 to 1 Sept 2006), EMBASE via Ovid (from 1980 to 1 Sept 2006), CANCERLIT (from 1966 to 1 Sept 2006), PDQ (search for open and closed trials) and MetaRegister (most current search Sept 2006). For this update randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, 2011) and the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Specialised Register (2011), MEDLINE (August week 1, 2011), EMBASE (to week 31, 2011), PDQ (search for open and closed trials) and MetaRegister (August 2011).</P>

<P>RCTs of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (Federation of International Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage III/IV) who were randomly allocated to treatment groups that compared platinum-based chemotherapy before cytoreductive surgery with platinum-based chemotherapy following cytoreductive surgery.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One high-quality RCT met the inclusion criteria. This multicentre trial randomised 718 women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer to NACT followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) or primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by chemotherapy. There were no significant differences between the study groups with regard to overall survival (OS) (670 women; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18) or progression-free survival (PFS) (670 women; HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.17).</P>
<P>Significant differences occurred between the NACT and PDS groups with regard to some surgically related serious adverse effects (SAE grade 3/4) including haemorrhage (12 in NACT group vs 23 in PDS group; RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.99), venous thromboembolism (none in NACT group vs eight in PDS group; RR 0.06; 95% CI 0 to 0.98) and infection (five in NACT group vs 25 in PDS group; RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50).

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We consider the use of NACT in women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer to be a reasonable alternative to PDS, particularly in bulky disease. With regard to selecting who will benefit from NACT, treatment should be tailored to the patient and should take into account resectability, age, histology, stage and performance status. These results cannot be generalised to women with stage IIIa and IIIb ovarian cancer; in these women, PDS is the standard. We await the results of three ongoing trials, which may change these conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> This is an updated version of the review that was first published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 4, 2007.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women under the age of 65 years. A woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 65 years ranges from 0.36% in developing countries to 0.64% in developed countries (<LINK REF="REF-GLOBOCAN-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GLOBOCAN 2008</LINK>). In Europe, just over a third of women with ovarian cancer are alive five years after diagnosis (<LINK REF="REF-EUROCARE-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUROCARE 2003</LINK>), largely because most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed when the cancer is already at an advanced stage (<LINK REF="REF-Jemel-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jemel 2008</LINK>). Symptoms are often vague and of a short duration and, as yet, there are no effective screening programmes. However, initial results of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), evaluating the effectiveness of annual CA-125 or transvaginal ultrasound, or both, screening in post-menopausal women, show promise in identifying early-stage disease (<LINK REF="REF-UKCTOCS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">UKCTOCS 2009</LINK>), although survival data are still pending. In early-stage disease (Federation of International Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) stage I/IIa; <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) radical surgery will cure most women, although a minority of women will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Trimbos-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trimbos 2003</LINK>), especially those who are not adequately staged at primary surgery. Unfortunately, around 75% of women present when the disease has spread outside the pelvis (FIGO stage III/IV), when surgery alone cannot be curative and the role of surgery is less clear.</P>
<P>The standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III/IV) is a staging laparotomy with primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. The extent of tumour cytoreduction is considered the most important prognostic factor. <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1975</LINK> was the first to report a relationship between the size of residual disease and survival. Meta-analyses of non-randomised studies (NRS) have since concurred that survival correlates positively with the extent of tumour debulking achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Hunter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hunter 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Allen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2002</LINK>). However, the extent of debulking achievable may be directly related to tumour biology, which would strongly bias results from non-RCTs. Tumours that have spread to the para-aortic or scalene lymph nodes may be less likely to be optimally debulked intra-abdominally (<LINK REF="REF-Burghardt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burghardt 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petru-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petru 1991</LINK>). Thus, the ability to achieve successful debulking may reflect tumour biology rather than an independent effect on outcome. One exploratory analysis of three prospectively randomised trials in advanced ovarian cancer suggested that surgical debulking can partially overcome these biological factors (<LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2009</LINK>). Other independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) were shown to be age, performance status, grade, FIGO stage and histology (<LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definition of what constitutes 'optimal' or 'maximal' debulking has changed since the 1980s; originally considered to be no residual tumour deposit of greater than 2 cm in diameter, and more recently as residual tumour of &#8804; 1 cm, the current aim is to leave no macroscopic disease (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In contrast to the evidence for improved survival with PDS, some investigators have been unable to show a benefit to maximal debulking for women with high-volume disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hoskins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskins 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vergote-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Vergote-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vergote 1998</LINK> introduced a policy of treating women with primary chemotherapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)) or primary surgery, depending on the extent of the patient's disease and performance status. Following the change in patient management, they reported an overall improvement in survival, despite a reduction in primary debulking rates from 82% to 57%. The role of so-called supra-radical surgery, with extensive surgical effort often involving the upper abdomen, in ovarian cancer is reviewed elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Ang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ang 2011</LINK>) and this review does not seek to question the value or extent of surgery, rather its timing in respect of chemotherapy.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>NACT involves giving chemotherapy as the initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer before attempting cytoreductive surgery. It has evolved from the practice of interval debulking surgery (IDS), a secondary attempt at tumour cytoreduction performed after a suboptimal attempt at primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy. In a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Tangjitgamol-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tangjitgamol 2010</LINK>), IDS performed by gynaecological oncologists secondary to PDS and adjuvant chemotherapy was found to offer no additional survival benefit compared with standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. However, IDS may improve survival of women in whom primary surgery was not performed by gynaecological oncologists and who have had suboptimal PDS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2007</LINK> reviewed 26 NRSs comparing NACT with PDS and concluded that, while NACT might be a viable option for unresectable tumours, survival outcomes with NACT may be inferior to PDS. Thus, platinum-based NACT has become an alternative to PDS, particularly where complete cytoreduction at PDS is considered unlikely (<LINK REF="REF-Swart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swart 2009</LINK>). Tumour resectability depends on the patient's age, disease burden, co-morbidities, location of metastatic sites, performance status and stage (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011a</LINK>), as well as the skill of the surgical team (<LINK REF="REF-Kehoe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehoe 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The goal of surgery (IDS and PDS) should be complete resection of all disease (<LINK REF="REF-Onda-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onda 2010</LINK>). A review of 21 NRSs (<LINK REF="REF-Kang-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kang 2009</LINK>) found that, compared with PDS, NACT improved the rate of optimal cytoreduction; however, this did not seem to influence survival.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are several reasons why NACT may be preferable to PDS:</P>
<UL>
<LI>NACT may decrease the size and extent of the tumour such that complete resection is more feasible;</LI>
<LI>NACT may improve patient performance status;</LI>
<LI>PDS necessitates hospital admission, whereas chemotherapy can be administered in an outpatient setting and started immediately;</LI>
<LI>PDS delays starting chemotherapy as there is the potential for chemotherapy to interfere with wound healing;</LI>
<LI>if surgery is not curative, residual tumour cells may multiply while the patient awaits recovery from surgery.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Concerns about using NACT include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>NACT delays the removal of the tumour and, thereby, may compromise patient survival;</LI>
<LI>Chemotherapy induces fibrosis, which may make complete cytoreduction more difficult;</LI>
<LI>if too many cycles of NACT are given pre-surgery, there is a concern regarding the possibility of chemo-resistance post-surgery. One meta-analysis found a negative association between OS and the number of NACT cycles given (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2006</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>PDS reduces the tumour bulk and number of cancer cells, thereby reducing the chance of developing chemo-resistance.</LI>
</UL>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is considerable controversy in the literature surrounding the use of NACT in advanced ovarian cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011a</LINK>). In one overview, <LINK REF="REF-Onda-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Onda 2011</LINK> stated "NACT is expected to become standard treatment for unselected patients with advanced ovarian cancer when favourable results are confirmed by Phase III studies and several problems are resolved". However, surveys among members of the US Society of Gynecologic Oncology (<LINK REF="REF-Dewdney-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dewdney 2010</LINK>) and the European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011b</LINK>) suggest a large discrepancy in acceptance and use of NACT as a treatment option for advanced ovarian cancer. Many investigators agree that NACT has a place, at the very least, in women with lesions that cannot be optimally resected (<LINK REF="REF-Bristow-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bristow 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swart-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swart 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chi-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011a</LINK>). To our knowledge, at least four randomised trials of NACT versus PDS have been underway in the past decade (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CHORUS-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">CHORUS #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onda-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Onda #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK>). Since RCTs are the 'gold standard' of evidence-based medical research, we hope that a review of randomised evidence may clarify what the benefits and risks are of using NACT for women with advanced ovarian cancer, compared with the standard treatment of PDS.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> was a large, multicentre, non-inferiority RCT conducted in 59 institutions in Belgium, Canada, the UK, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Spain, Austria, Portugal, Ireland and Argentina. In total, 718 women were enrolled between 1998 and 2006; however, 48 were excluded after randomisation owing to authorisation irregularities at the Argentinian centre. Thus 670 women with stage IIIc/IV epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer were evaluated. For inclusion, extra-pelvic tumour needed to be 2 cm or more and treatment needed to begin within three weeks of the initial biopsy. The experimental group (334 women) were allocated to receive three cycles of platinum-based NACT, followed by IDS and then at least three more cycles of NACT. The control group (336 women) received 'standard' treatment (i.e. PDS plus at least six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy ± IDS). The primary outcome was OS. Secondary outcomes were PFS, surgical morbidity and mortality, QoL and adverse effects. The investigators performed subgroup analyses on OS with respect to age, FIGO stage and extent of residual tumour. Subgroups of age were: age under 50 years, age 50 to 70 years and age over 70 years; subgroups of extent of residual tumour were: no residual tumour, residual tumour of 1 to 10 mm, and residual tumour greater than 10 mm.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>, an RCT comparing NACT plus iliac artery embolisation versus PDS, was originally an 'included study' in the 2006 version of this review. The main findings of this study were that there was no significant difference in survival between the two arms; however, optimal cytoreduction was achieved more often in the NACT/embolisation group (30 vs 21 women; P &lt; 0.005) and this group had a shorter operating time (P &lt; 0.01), less blood loss (665 ± 38 mL vs 849 ± 41 mL; P &lt; 0.001) and fewer blood transfusions (16 vs 29; P &lt; 0.05).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There was no significant difference in OS or PFS in women with stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer who were treated with NACT plus IDS compared with PDS plus chemotherapy. Surgically related morbidity (grade 3/4) was significantly higher in the PDS group with respect to haemorrhagic, infective and thromboembolic adverse effects.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for the non-inferiority of NACT versus PDS for advanced ovarian cancer is not widely applicable as only participants with stage IIIc/IV ovarian tumours (extra-pelvic spread larger than 2 cm) were included in the <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> trial and the majority of participants had extensive disease (metastatic lesions larger than 10 cm were present in 61.6% of women). In the subgroup of women with pre-operative extra-pelvic tumour of less than 5 cm in diameter (189 women), PDS significantly improved OS compared with NACT (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.93) (<LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> Supplementary appendix). Furthermore, when subgrouped by FIGO stage, there was a trend for women with stage IV disease to survive for longer with NACT than with PDS (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02).</P>
<P>Possibly as a result of the extensive disease (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011a</LINK>), median survival times are low compared with other studies. In the PDS group, median survival time for no residual disease, 1 to 10 mm' residual disease and greater than 10 mm' residual disease was 45, 32 and 26 months, respectively, compared with NACT, which was 38, 27 and 25 months, respectively. While these differences were not statistically significant, <LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2011</LINK> argues that they are clinically significant differences in favour of PDS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Chi-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chi 2011</LINK> maintain that the majority of women should be able to tolerate a major debulking procedure. They suggest that the problem lies with a lack of skills among gynaecological oncologists (or a willingness to perform lengthy surgery) and that the assembly of multidisciplinary surgical teams would improve survival figures in advanced ovarian cancer.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011b</LINK> has recommended selection criteria for utilising NACT in stage IIIc/IV disease: the Leuven selection criteria for NACT and IDS in stage IIIc/IV ovarian cancer include the following:</P>

</UL>
<P>According to <LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011b</LINK>, these criteria select about 50% of women with stage IIIc and IV disease. While agreeing that surgical skills are important, the authors stress that aggressive surgery should be tailored to the general condition and extent of disease of the patient, in order to decrease post-operative morbidity and mortality.</P>
<P>Of further interest, <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> investigators performed post hoc multivariate analyses on their data. Complete cytoreduction was the strongest independent predictor of prolonged survival (P = 0.001) followed by stage IIIc disease (P = 0.001), small tumour size before randomisation (P = 0.001), endometrioid histological type (P = 0.005) and younger age (P = 0.005). This is in keeping with findings of <LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2009</LINK> and other studies.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK>, complete cytoreduction occurred more frequently in the NACT group than the PDS group; however, this finding did not translate into improved survival in the NACT group. Preliminary data from <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK> appear to support this observation (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). The reasons for this are not known and may include bias in the assessment of complete cytoreduction. We refer the reader to the literature (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-du-Bois-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Bois 2011</LINK>) for more insight into this debate.</P>
<P>Results from the <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> trial will benefit by corroboration from ongoing studies (<LINK REF="STD-CHORUS-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">CHORUS #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onda-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Onda #</LINK>).</P>

<P>We consider the current evidence for primary outcomes to be of moderate quality. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effects and may change the estimates, overall and/or for subgroups of women with advanced ovarian cancer. We consider the evidence with regard to surgical morbidity to be of low quality owing to small number of events and the lack of blinding; further research is likely to change these estimates.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To our knowledge there are no biases in the review process, other than the introduction of subgroup analyses (i.e. stage, age and residual disease) that were not specified in the original protocol. We do not consider this risk to be substantial as there is only one included study in the review at this stage.</P>
<P>We had hoped to include data from the <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK> trial. However, at the time of writing, the investigators had not completed their final analyses and advised us that they hoped to publish these data in 2012 (see below). We made the decision to await these data, rather than to include provisional data from past conference presentations (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>). Therefore, once these data are published, we plan to update this review again.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Investigators of the ongoing trial <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK>, have presented interim results over the past few years, including at the ACSO 2006 and 2007 conferences. Data from <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK> appear to corroborate the findings of the <LINK REF="STD-EORTC-55971" TYPE="STUDY">EORTC 55971</LINK> study. In the 2009 abstract, the investigators reported no significant differences in OS and PFS with HRs for OS and PFS of 0.94 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.56) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.86), respectively (PDS vs NACT). Blood loss, peri-operative mortality, post-operative infections and length of hospital stay were all reduced in the NACT group; in addition, QoL scores were significantly better in the NACT group "at the end of treatment" (P &lt; 0.001). We understand from correspondence with Professor Kumar (from Sept 2011 to January 2012) that this trial is now closed, that new analyses are being undertaken and that data will be presented in manuscript form during the course of 2012. Owing to insufficient data in the 2009 report and discrepancies in some of the reported findings over time, we took the decision to await the final statistical analyses before including the interim data in meta-analyses (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-06-01 13:26:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PDS is the standard treatment for advanced (stage III/IV) ovarian cancer. NACT is a reasonable alternative for women with bulky stage IIIc/IV disease. Compared to PDS, NACT may increase the rate of complete cytoreduction but this does not translate into an increase in OS. More evidence is needed to show which women are most likely to benefit from NACT. We consider the Leuven selection criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Vergote-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vergote 2011b</LINK>) to be a reasonable guide to patient selection until further evidence is available, although these criteria still need to be validated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are currently three ongoing RCTs (<LINK REF="STD-CHORUS-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">CHORUS #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Onda-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Onda #</LINK>) aimed at addressing the role of NACT in ovarian cancer and we await these results. According to the investigators, data from <LINK REF="STD-Kumar-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kumar #</LINK> should be published soon. Collection of QoL data is an important patient-centred outcome in advanced ovarian disease, especially if there is minimal difference in survival between treatment options. The GCIG consensus statement recommends PFS as the preferred primary end point of Phase III trials in advanced ovarian cancer as OS is confounded by the treatment on detection of progression (<LINK REF="REF-Thigpen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thigpen 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We have updated the methodology of this review to be consistent with the latest Cochrane guidelines, therefore the method of assessing the risk of bias of included studies has changed from the protocol. We have also specified subgroup analyses to be performed in subsequent versions of this review, which were not in the protocol.</P>
<P>This updated version of the review differs from the original review in that a previously included trial, <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2004</LINK>, has now been excluded. After much discussion, we decided that this trial does not strictly meet the inclusion criteria for this review as it compares chemotherapy plus internal iliac artery embolisation (and not chemotherapy alone) with surgery. Thus any effects seen in the chemotherapy group cannot be clearly attributable to the chemotherapy intervention and may, rather, be as a result of the internal iliac artery embolisation.</P>

<P>Interim results presented at 2007 ASCO meeting: 113/139 women evaluable, 20% optimally debulked in PDS group vs 85% in the NACT group. NACT group also experienced less blood loss (P = 0.01), shorter hospital stay (P = 0.04), less post-operative infection (2 cases vs 7 cases; P = 0.06) and less operative mortality (1 deaths vs 5 deaths; P = 0.08). Median OS was 29 months in PDS group vs 41 months in NACT group.</P>
<P>Interim results presented in <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>: 128/133 women evaluable, 62 in PDS group, 66 in NACT group. Optimum debulking was achieved in 22.6% and 86.2% (P &lt; 0.0001), respectively. The NACT group experienced less blood loss (413 mL vs 600 mL; P &lt; 0.0001), reduced post-operative infections (1.54% vs 14.5%; P &lt; 0.025), reduced operating time (75.4 minutes vs 89.2 minutes; P &lt; 0.001) and shorter hospital stay (7.6 days vs 11.5 days; P &lt; 0.001). Median follow-up at 42 months found similar OS of 42 months and 41 months in the PDS and NACT group, respectively (the 2007 results presented showed significantly better OS in the NACT group). HR for OS (PDS vs NACT) was 0.94; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.56. HR for PFS (PDS vs NACT) was 1.1; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.86. QoL score was significantly better in the NACT group 'at the end of treatment' (P &lt; 0.001)</P>
<P>There are some discrepancies in these data when compared with the 2007 interim results (e.g. OS data). Furthermore, the denominators used to create these data were not stated in <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>, and continuous data were presented without standard deviations. We were unable to obtain clarification from the authors, but understand that complete results will be published soon</P>

<TITLE MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:43:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Assessing 'Risk of bias' of included studies</TITLE>
<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-18 10:33:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the following criteria:</P>
<P>(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</P>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it produced comparable groups. We assessed the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</P>
<P>We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(3) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</P>
<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias owing to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</P>
<P>We described for each included study the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusions where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses that we undertook. We assessed methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data or missing data &lt; 20%; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; 'as treated' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</P>
<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>(6) Other bias (checking for bias owing to problems not covered by 1 to 5 above)</P>
<P>We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. We assessed each study as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>high risk of other bias;</LI>
<LI>unclear whether there is risk of other bias.</LI>
