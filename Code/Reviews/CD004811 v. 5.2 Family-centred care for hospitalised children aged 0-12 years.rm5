<P>The newly-included study provides limited evidence for the effects of a family-centred care model on some outcomes for children and parents, and on costs.</P>
<P>We changed the following criteria for the update of this review:</P>
<UL>
<LI>included RCTs only (previously RCTs, quasi-RCTs and CBAs);</LI>
<LI>lowered the threshold for inclusion in the FCC score from 80% in the original review to 50%;</LI>
<LI>excluded single interventions that did not reflect a FCC model of care;</LI>
<LI>excluded premature neonates from the eligible participants;</LI>
<LI>removed the selection criterion whereby studies with inadequate or unclear blinding of outcome assessment were excluded from the review; and</LI>
<LI>adopted the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to assess included studies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We have also changed terminology to describe the control comparison group: in the previous version of the review we described 'professionally-centred models of care' but as these are the same as standard models of care we have now adopted 'standard models' to describe the control group.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-19 10:49:24 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review of family-centred care published in 2007 (<A HREF="Shields 2007">Shields 2007</A>). For this update, we have changed the title to show that it is about children aged 0 to 12 years only. We have now excluded premature neonates, and we have changed several other selection criteria: study designs are now limited to randomised controlled trials only; the way in which family-centredness of interventions is assessed for inclusion has changed; single interventions not reflecting a FCC model of care have been excluded; and the selection criterion whereby studies with less than adequate blinding of outcome assessment were excluded from the review has been removed.</P>
<P>When a child comes into hospital, the whole family is affected. In giving care, nurses, doctors and those caring for the child must consider the impact of the child's admission on all family members. 'Family-centred care' is one way of caring for children in hospital. It is "a way of caring for children and their families within health services which ensures that care is planned around the whole family, not just the individual child/person, and in which all the family members are recognised as care recipients<I>"</I> (<A HREF="Shields 2006">Shields 2006</A>, p. 1318). However, with changes in family structures, for example, development of the single parent family, questions arise about how care is best delivered. To ensure that children are cared for in ways that minimise emotional trauma and assist in recovery, it is important that such ways of delivering care are measured to see if they are effective.</P>
<P>This review has tried to do that by examining research about family-centred care. We looked for randomised trials of family-centred care interventions for children aged 0-12 years, in hospitals. We assessed potentially-relevant studies against criteria that identify important parts of family-centred care. Despite extensive searching we identified only one moderate-quality study (<A HREF="Bolton 2004">Bolton 2004</A>) for inclusion. This study, from a doctoral thesis, showed that the family-centred care model had a positive effect on the adequacy of children's care, parental satisfaction, and costs. For other indicators such as clinical outcomes and children's behaviour there was no significant difference between the family-centred care model and standard inpatient care. There were no harms reported.</P>
<P>In this searches for this update, we also found 25 qualitative studies which described aspects of family-centred care, and a review of these will be published by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our main conclusion from this Cochrane review update, however, is that further, rigorous research is needed to assess the effects of family-centred care on children's experience of hospitalisation, as well as on their parents, hospital staff, and service delivery outcomes such as costs.</P>

<P>This is an update of the Cochrane systematic review of family-centred care published in 2007 (<A HREF="Shields 2007">Shields 2007</A>). Family-centred care (FCC) is a widely used model in paediatrics, is thought to be the best way to provide care to children in hospital and is ubiquitous as a way of delivering care. When a child is admitted, the whole family is affected. In giving care, nurses, doctors and others must consider the impact of the child's admission on all family members. However, the effectiveness of family-centred care as a model of care has not been measured systematically.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-05-12 16:31:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To assess the effects of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children aged from birth (unlike the previous version of the review, this update excludes premature neonates) to 12 years, when compared to standard models of care, on child, family and health service outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:01:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original review, we searched up until 2004. For this update, we searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 12 2011); MEDLINE (Ovid SP); EMBASE (Ovid SP); PsycINFO (Ovid SP); CINAHL (EBSCO Host); and Sociological Abstracts (CSA). We did not search three that were included in the original review: Social Work Abstracts, the Australian Medical Index and ERIC. We searched EMBASE in this update only and searched from 2004 onwards. There was no limitation by language. We performed literature searches in May and June 2009 and updated them again in December 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-07-03 16:05:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster randomised trials in which family-centred care models are compared with standard models of care for hospitalised children (0 to 12 years, but excluding premature neonates). Studies had to meet criteria for family-centredness. In order to assess the degree of family-centredness, we used a modified rating scale based on a validated instrument, (same instrument used in the initial review), however, we decreased the family-centredness score for inclusion from 80% to 50% in this update. We also changed several other selection criteria in this update: eligible study designs are now limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only; single interventions not reflecting a FCC model of care have been excluded; and the selection criterion whereby studies with inadequate or unclear blinding of outcome assessment were excluded from the review has been removed.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-07-05 16:10:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors undertook searches, and four authors independently assessed studies against the review criteria, while two were assigned to extract data. We contacted study authors for additional information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-08-13 03:01:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Six studies found since 2004 were originally viewed as possible inclusions, but when the family-centred score assessment was tested, only one met the minimum score of family-centredness and was included in this review. This was an unpublished RCT involving 288 children post-tonsillectomy in a care-by-parent unit (CBPU) compared with standard inpatient care.The study used a range of behavioural, economic and physical measures. It showed that children in the CBPU were significantly less likely to receive inadequate care compared with standard inpatient admission, and there were no significant differences for their behavioural outcomes or other physical outcomes. Parents were significantly more satisfied with CBPU care than standard care, assessed both before discharge and at 7 days after discharge. Costs were lower for CPBU care compared with standard inpatient care. No other outcomes were reported. The study was rated as being at low to unclear risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 10:20:00 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update of a review has found limited, moderate-quality evidence that suggests some benefit of a family-centred care intervention for children's clinical care, parental satisfaction, and costs, but this is based on a small dataset and needs confirmation in larger RCTs. There is no evidence of harms. Overall, there continues to be little high-quality quantitative research available about the effects of family-centred care. Further rigorous research on the use of family-centred care as a model for care delivery to children and families in hospitals is needed. This research should implement well-developed family-centred care interventions, ideally in randomised trials. It should investigate diverse participant groups and clinical settings, and should assess a wide range of outcomes for children, parents, staff and health services.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-25 15:19:38 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While this is an update of a previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>), this background about the development of family-centred care has changed little. Until at least the late 1950s, hospitals worldwide tended to be bleak places for children.<I> </I>It was believed that visits from parents would inhibit effective care (<LINK REF="REF-Nethercott-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nethercott 1993</LINK>) and were detrimental to the child, who would become distressed when the parents left (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 1999</LINK>). Researchers began to suggest, however, that children whose parents did not visit them suffered acute emotional trauma which may have long-term psychological consequences in adolescence and adulthood (<LINK REF="REF-Bowlby-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowlby 1971</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowlby-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowlby 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1956, the British government commissioned a report into the welfare of children in hospital. The resulting report, the Platt Report (<LINK REF="REF-Platt-1959" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platt 1959</LINK>), recommended that visiting be unrestricted, that mothers stay in hospital with their child, and that training of medical and nursing staff should promote understanding of the emotional needs of children. The process of change has resulted in a humanisation of paediatrics (<LINK REF="STD-Darbyshire-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Darbyshire 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jolley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jolley 2009</LINK>), although the movement away from traditional approaches to health service delivery to the involvement of families in all aspects of the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care has been slow (<LINK REF="STD-Coyne-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Palmer-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmer 1993</LINK>). The foundation for a family-centred approach to paediatric health care is the belief that a child's emotional and developmental needs, and overall family wellbeing, are best achieved when the service system supports diligently the ability of the family to meet the needs of their child, by involving families in the planning and delivery of care (<LINK REF="REF-Allen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neff 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Much of the literature concerning family-centred care has originated from the UK and USA, which are developed and culturally distinctive (predominately Anglo-Saxon) societies (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2002</LINK>). In low and middle income countries with fewer technological, economic and human resources, specific information about the psychosocial care of children in hospital is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2001c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2001c</LINK>). Shields found that in some developing countries, parents were encouraged to stay with their hospitalised child only if it fitted with hospital rules (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2001c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2001c</LINK>). Stanford reported that in Central America where children's health is poor, some hospitals allowed parents to stay when their child was acutely ill, while some restricted parental visiting to one hour per day (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1986</LINK>). These restrictions on parental visiting were thought to be the result of space limitations and lack of facilities rather than a philosophical objection to parents being present. A study in Tanzania found that mothers were concerned about environmental conditions such as overcrowding and lack of food while their children in hospital, while staff's concerns included lack of trained staff, overwork and low pay (<LINK REF="REF-Mwangi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mwangi 2008</LINK>), and a study from Iran has also highlighted problems with he implementation of family-centre care models (<LINK REF="STD-Aein--2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aein 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Family-centred care in high-income countries has been explored as care that is led by parents, with the health professional acting as a consultant, encouraging open and honest dialogue with the family (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchfield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchfield 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2002</LINK>). The family is acknowledged as expert in the care of their child, and the perspectives and information provided by the family have been described as important to clinical decision-making (<LINK REF="REF-Irlam-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irlam 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neff 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webster-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the UK, the importance of promoting the role of families in the care of the hospitalised child has been acknowledged (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2003</LINK>). A number of related terms has been used to describe the attributes of family-centred care (<LINK REF="REF-Hutchfield-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutchfield 1999</LINK>); these include partnership-in-care (<LINK REF="REF-Coyne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 1996</LINK>), parental involvement (<LINK REF="REF-Hurst-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurst 1993</LINK>), nurse-parent partnership (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1996</LINK>), parental participation (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Hallstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Hallstrom 1999</LINK>), and care-by-parent (<LINK REF="REF-Costello-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Evans-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 1992, the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care was established in the USA, taking over the role of the Association for the Care of Children's Health, whose task it had been to develop a nationwide program to enhance the implementation of a family-centred approach to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Much of the family-centred care literature from the USA refers to the seminal work of Shelton (<LINK REF="REF-Shelton-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shelton 1987</LINK>), who developed a framework for offering family-centred care to children. Within this framework, Shelton and colleagues delineated eight elements which characterise health services which are family-centred (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>). Subsequently, a ninth element was included (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1990</LINK>). The nine elements of family-centred care include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>recognising the family as a constant in the child's life;</LI>
<LI>facilitating parent-professional collaboration at all levels of health care;</LI>
<LI>honouring the racial, ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic diversity of families;</LI>
<LI>recognising family strengths and individuality and respecting different methods of coping;</LI>
<LI>sharing complete and unbiased information with families on a continuous basis;</LI>
<LI>encouraging and facilitating family-to-family support and networking;</LI>
<LI>responding to child and family developmental needs as part of healthcare practices;</LI>
<LI>adopting policies and practices that provide families with emotional and financial support; and</LI>
<LI>designing health care that is flexible, culturally competent, and responsive to family needs.</LI>
</UL>
<P>According to the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care's definition:<BR/>"Family-centered care is an approach to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is grounded in mutually beneficial partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. It redefines the relationships between and among consumers and health providers. Family-centered practitioners recognise the vital role that families play in ensuring the health and well being of infants, children, adolescents, and family members of all ages. They acknowledge that emotional, social, and developmental supports are integral components of health care. They promote the health and well being of individuals and families and restore dignity and control to them. Family-centered care is an approach to health care that shapes policies, programs, facility design, and staff day-to-day interactions. It leads to better health outcomes and wiser allocation of resources, and greater patient and family satisfaction" (<LINK REF="REF-Webster-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webster 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-IPFCC-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IPFCC 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested that to practice in a family-centred manner requires a shift in the orientation of health services from a standard model to a collaborative model which recognises family involvement as central to their child's care. Within this view, the healthcare provider is an equal partner and facilitator of care, and families are invited to participate actively in the decision-making, planning and provision of their child's care to the extent they choose (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ahmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmann 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Potential advantages and disadvantages of family-centred care</HEADING>
<P>There is a range of potential benefits and difficulties associated with the provision of family-centred care. For instance, in one study, the stress levels of parents whose children were intensive care unit inpatients were reduced (<LINK REF="STD-Melnyk-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Melnyk 2004</LINK>). However, researchers have also reported challenges when trying to implement changes which would result in meaningful family involvement in the care of their hospitalised child. Healthcare providers have reported a lack of adequate education in relation to understanding and implementing the concept of family-centred care in a practice situation, as well a lack of shared understanding of, and commitment to, family-centred care among all health professionals and families (<LINK REF="STD-Bruce-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruce-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bruce 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coyne-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKean-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacKean 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roden-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roden 2009</LINK>). In addition, the hospitalisation of a child, whether planned or unplanned, is stressful for even the most well-organised and functional family (<LINK REF="REF-Melnyk-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melnyk 2000</LINK>). The significant adjustments to both parent and healthcare provider roles when a child is hospitalised may result in understandable levels of stress (<LINK REF="STD-Callery-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Callery 1997</LINK>). Potential disadvantages of family-centred care may be that families feel that they are expected to provide input into the care of their child beyond their expectations or capabilities, or are given more information than either the child or the family is ready to hear. This may cause additional stress or anxiety for both the parents and child. In summary, in 1994, Darbyshire (<LINK REF="STD-Darbyshire-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Darbyshire 1994</LINK>) suggested that family-centred care was a wonderful idea, but difficult to implement effectively, and some authors are beginning to agree, questioning family-centred care as a model of care (<LINK REF="STD-MacKean-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MacKean 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sarajarvi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarajarvi 2006</LINK>). Also, questions are being raised as to the ethics of continuing to use a model for which no rigorous evidence of effectiveness exists (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2010</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Other models of health care for children</HEADING>
<P>Family-centred care, which involves participation of, or partnering with parents (or family-members) is described as different to the standard models of care used in paediatric health services. In these, often, the healthcare provider plays a major role in assessing and formulating a plan of care, based upon the perceived needs of the child and/or family. In the medical or standard model of health care, the healthcare worker plans care around the child's illness and treatment needs, and the family is generally expected to comply with treatment recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-Ahmann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahmann 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Implementation of family-centred care</HEADING>
<P>It is expected that the development, implementation and outcomes of family-centred models of care may differ according to the population and setting in which the models are applied. For example, the needs and outcomes for families of a child with a chronic condition who experience long hospital stays may differ from those of families of a previously healthy young child who is admitted for a treatment procedure. Also, older children may have a greater awareness and understanding of the reasons for their hospitalisation. Therefore, models of care may reflect increased participation of the child in their hospital care.</P>
<P>However, even if the family-centred care models are seen as making a difference and are advantageous in their own right, reliable reassurance that they result in more good than harm should be sought. The previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>) of which this current review is an update found that no studies met the inclusion criteria for either family-centredness of the intervention under study, or were excluded because they did not meet key methodological quality criteria as pre-specified by the review authors. That said, there were 11 studies at that time which used qualitative methods to examine the implementation of family-centred care, and which met the criteria for family-centredness, and we published a review of these (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>In this update, we have included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster randomised trials in which family-centred care models are compared with standard models of care. In <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>, we took a broader approach, including quasi-RCTs and controlled before and after (CBA) studies. We decided that in the interest of rigour, and to try to definitively say whether or not family-centred care is effective in delivering care to children and families, we would seek the highest level of evidence possible for this update of the review.</P>
<P>However, we have assessed quasi-experimental studies e.g. quasi-RCTs and controlled before-and-after studies, in a separate review for the Joanna Briggs Institute (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2012</LINK>). Another and separate review for the Joanna Briggs Institute which will also be linked to this update will be a review of the qualitative studies which met the family-centredness score. In this way we will be able to provide a rounded, and highly rigorous statement about the effectiveness or otherwise of family-centred care for hospitalized children aged 0 to 12 years.</P>

<P>Child/children: throughout this review, the term 'child' or 'children' is used to include all newborn infants, babies and children up to the age of 12 years being cared for in hospital; and all parts of hospitals that provide a service to children. The definitions of childhood can vary, and age limits are arbitrary. For the purpose of this review the National Library of Medicine's medical subject headings (<LINK REF="REF-NLM-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NLM 2004</LINK>) were used to define the age cut-off of 12 years<I>.</I> However, we have excluded neonates born prematurely and who are patients in a neonatal intensive or special care nursery, as their requirements for family-centred care, and the ethics and philosophies of care around this particular group, are different to those in a ward/unit where full term infants and children are nursed (<LINK REF="REF-Brophy-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brophy 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Families: throughout the review the following definition of the family was applied:</P>
<P>The family is a basic social unit having as its nucleus two or more persons, irrespective of age, in which each of the following conditions are present:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the members are related by blood, or marriage, or adoption, or by a contract which is either explicit or implied;</LI>
<LI>the members communicate with each other in terms of defined social roles such as mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt; and</LI>
<LI>they adopt or create and maintain common customs and traditions.</LI>
</OL>
<P>This definition has been modified from Nixon's original definition (<LINK REF="REF-Nixon-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nixon 1988</LINK>) to allow for inclusion of significant others who do not usually cohabit with the family.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:57:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any intervention that aimed to promote the family-centred model of care during a child's hospitalisation. Only studies that provide clear evidence that the family and/or child were actively involved in the planning and/or delivery of health care during the child's hospitalisation were considered for inclusion. For the purposes of the review, the minimum criteria for active involvement included evidence of collaboration between health carers and the family and/or child in the planning and/or delivery of care as soon as possible after admission or during the preadmission period. Included studies must also have compared family-centred models with standard models of care. In the original review, we included "professionally-centred" models of care, but it became apparent to us that these are the same as "standard models" so we deleted the words "professionally-centred" as redundant for this update.</P>
<P>For inclusion, an holistic family-centred care model, including interventions such as the those in the following list, had to be present. Single interventions (for example, parental presences during one-off procedures) do not represent a family-centred care model, and if the study was about a single intervention only it was not included because the family-centredness score (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>) could not be applied. The list includes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Environmental interventions as evidenced by collaboration with the family and/or child in the design or redevelopment of facilities to provide an environment that maximises parental involvement and enhances child recovery and/or convalescence, care-by-parent units, privacy areas;</LI>
<LI>Family-centred policies which may include open visiting hours for siblings or extended family, parent participation in their child's care to the extent they choose (for example, feeding, bathing);  </LI>
<LI>Communication interventions could include parental presence and participation at daily interdisciplinary ward rounds and family conferences to plan future care, developing collaborative care pathways where both parent and/or child and health carer document issues and progress, reorganisation of health care to provide continuity of care-giver (such as, primary nursing), shared medical records, local hospital based interpreters;  </LI>
<LI>Educational interventions could include structured educational sessions for parents of technologically dependant children, continuing education programs to equip staff to provide care within a family-centred framework, preadmission programs; ·</LI>
<LI>Family support interventions such as flexible charging schemes for poor families, referrals to other hospital or community services (such as, social workers, chaplains, patient representatives, mental health professionals, home health care, rehabilitation services), facilitating parent-to-parent support.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>, we tried to identify several interventions as family-centred. On reflection for this update, we viewed this as a deficiency in the original review, where, at times, it required a deal of discussion and deliberation about the possibility of inclusion of various studies. We have tried to avoid such problems in this update by taking a more direct and simple approach. Consequently, it is important, for this update, to describe what we considered <U>did no</U>t constitute an holistic model of family-centred care. We excluded studies where there was no clear evidence of collaboration between the family and/or child and healthcare provider in the planning and/or delivery of care. Such studies could include parental presence during healthcare procedures such as routine examinations, anaesthetic induction, venipuncture and post-anaesthetic recovery, parental education packages, and bereavement team/protocols; because singular interventions such as parental presence without any collaboration or communication does not meet the holism of family-centredness. As an example, parental presence for anaesthesia induction might occur in the operating room, but this does not mean that the same hospital will allow parental involvement in any other aspect of the child&#8217;s care. In other words, if one intervention was the focus of a study, without recourse to a total family-centred care model, it was excluded.</P>
<P>The assessment of family-centredness is described in detail later, but in brief, we used the same scoring system as we used in the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>), as it worked effectively in the first instance, and also provided us with a way of quantifying what family-centred care is about. It has been used in the assessment of research and literature before, and is well tested.

We discarded those references which clearly did not fulfil inclusion criteria, and retrieved potentially relevant articles, and undertook full-text assessments using the specifically developed and piloted assessment form (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the family-centredness of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>For this update, as in <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>, in order to assess relevant studies for the degree of family-centredness, we used a rating scale modified from the scale developed by Trivette and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>). These authors used the 9 elements of family-centred care, as described by the Association for the Care of Children's Health (now the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care), to develop 13 evaluation items that describe the features of family-centred care. We present the 9 Association for the Care of Children's Health elements and the 13 corresponding sub-elements in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. These sub-elements are further grouped into three cluster groups (that is, Cluster 1: family as a constant; Cluster 2: culturally responsive; Cluster 3: supporting family individuality) derived from an original cluster analysis by Trivette and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>). The clusters were designed to be used to help describe the model of family-centred care in individual trials.</P>
<P>We applied a rating of 0 to 4 to each of the 13 sub-elements of family-centred care, from 0 indicating the article included no evidence that the intervention either implicitly or explicitly was based upon the elements of family-centred care, to 4 indicating the article included numerous instances of explicit<I> </I>evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care (see <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>We considered that an element of family-centred care was implicitly addressed if it could be inferred that the author(s)' descriptions, arguments etc. were consistent with the intent of the elements of family-centred care, whereas if an element of family-centred care was clearly stated and distinctly expressed it ought to underscore health practice and we therefore considered it to have been explicitly addressed or endorsed (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Independently, each review author scored the evaluation items from 0 to 4 for each study, and final scores were resolved by consensus among authors. We added the scores together to give an overall rating of the intensity of family-centredness for each study. The maximum possible score was 52, and scores of 42 (or 80% of total score) (see below) or greater would have indicated a high degree of family-centredness. The results of the study rating were compared amongst review authors and also by an independent expert in the field. The reliability and validity of the scoring system had been tested by Trivette, Dunst and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>). Our scoring sheet, of which the scoring system was an integral part, was tested by the review authors, and others who were independent of the review, by repeatedly using the sheet, comparing answers and refining the document. The construction of the sheet prevented us using reliability statistics for each section, however Trivette's (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>) scoring system for family-centred care had yielded a median Cohen's kappa score of 0.85 (range 0.65 to 1.0) for each element.</P>
<P>In the original review, we used an 80% cut-off point for inclusion, and called that "a high degree of family-centredness". A score of 42 from a possible total of 52 (80%) had been chosen, based on the Pareto distribution, which says that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes (<LINK REF="REF-Narula-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narula 2008</LINK>). No studies were included.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>, we found no studies which could be included, mainly because so few met the 80% cut-off. While our justification of implementation of the Pareto principle is sound, we decided that greater flexibility may have afforded us the opportunity to capture RCTs which tested family-centred models but which still provided a way of testing effectiveness. Hence, in this update, we lowered the cut-off point for inclusion to 50% (26 points from a total of 52). We rated a score of 50 to 80% as a 'moderate degree of family-centredness'; and below 50% as a 'low degree of family-centredness'. In the update, we excluded all those studies for which the intervention rated less than 50% for family-centredness, and planned to analyse separately those studies which fell into the high and moderate categories respectively.</P>

Heterogeneity would have been assessed using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test of heterogeneity along with visual inspection of the graph. A significance level less than 0.10 would have been interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity was found, the authors would have looked for an explanation. If studies with heterogeneous results were found to be comparable, the statistical synthesis of the results would have been done using a random-effects model. Sensitivity analysis would have been conducted to determine the impact of risk of bias on outcomes, if studies of different risk of bias were identified. The risk of bias criteria used in this analysis would have been in accord with the method of allocation to treatment.  </P>

After all searches were completed, we found one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2004</LINK>) (through informal communication with a colleague), which was a chapter in a doctoral thesis, which met the inclusion criteria.</P>

<P>We included one randomised controlled trial involving 288 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2004</LINK>). This trial was one part of a PhD thesis which examined the postoperative care of children post-tonsillectomy. It compared children who received standard inpatient care with children who were cared for in a care-by-parent unit (CBPU). The study was undertaken from 2002 to 2004. The CBPU met the description of family-centred care, as not only was it physically and environmentally family-centred, it was also an holistic approach which involved parents, children and family members, and met the FCC score (36/52 = 69%) (see <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>One hundred and forty three of the participants were nursed with standard inpatient care, while 145 were admitted to the CBPU. Of these, 124 (87%) inpatients and 136 (94%) CBPU children were between 3 and 13 years of age. The study was conducted in two wards: one standard inpatient, the other a CBPU in an Australian metropolitan tertiary referral children&#8217;s hospital. All public patients who were scheduled to undergo tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were reviewed to assess their eligibility for inclusion. These were that the children were at least 3 years of age, had no evidence of obstructive sleep apnoea, no history of significant cardiac, respiratory or hepatic disease, and their parents did not require an interpreter or have trouble with written English.</P>

<B>Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2004</LINK> assessed the effects of admission to the care-by-parent unit (CBPU) compared with standard inpatient care post-tonsillectomy. The CBPU was a unit where parents were accommodated with their admitted children, where parents (and children as appropriate) were supported and encouraged to be part of the decision-making team, and were expected to provide as much of the care as they could appropriately undertake.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes </B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome was a composite indicator of 'inadequate clinical care', which was recorded as 'yes' or 'no'. This outcome was considered to be met (i.e. care was considered to be 'inadequate') if there was one or more instances of inadequate care from five markers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>less than good control of nausea and vomiting (assessed by parents as fair, poor, very poor),</LI>
<LI>less than good pain control (assessed by parents as fair, poor, very poor),</LI>
<LI>medical attention needed but not provided within 30 minutes,</LI>
<LI>discharge delay beyond 1200h one day post-surgery, and</LI>
<LI>unplanned medical consultation within seven days of surgery.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This composite outcome incorporates aspects of the child's physical health outcomes (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>). Additional serious physical outcomes were assessed, such as significant haemorrhage, readmission due to complications, and pain scores. <LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2004</LINK> also assessed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>child behavioural outcomes measured using the Posthospital Behaviour Questionnaire (PHBQ) (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 1966</LINK>) for those under 13 years and the Child Behaviour Questionnaire for parents of adolescents (the latter measure was not included in our review) (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1970</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>parental satisfaction using the standard questionnaire used by the hospital; and</LI>
<LI>costs of post-operative care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Analysis</B>
</P>
<P>It was planned that all data would be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis in the first instance, although some outcomes were only able to be analysed based on return questionnaire numbers. The authors provide ITT and as-treated data for the primary outcome 'inadequate clinical care'.</P>

<B>Physical outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>The primary outcome of 'inadequate clinical care' was analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT) and as-treated (AT) approaches. According to the ITT analysis, the CBPU patients had significantly less inadequate care than children receiving standard inpatient care. The absolute risk difference in favour of CBPU was -12.4% (95% CI -23.8% to CI -0.03%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). This difference was not influenced by age, weight, sex or concurrent adenoidectomy. When applying an 'as treated' analysis to account for the failure of ten allocated patients to reach the CBPU, the absolute risk difference in favour of CBPU was slightly larger: -17.6% (95% CI - 28.8% to -6.3%).</P>
<P>Of the five components of the 'inadequate clinical care' composite outcome measure, the component with the largest effect was that of delayed discharges in the inpatient group (25.2%) compared with the CBPU group (6.2%).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-07-05 13:54:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P> The one included study was part of a composite project incorporating several sub-studies which examined the care of children following tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy. Only one sub-study was an RCT that was eligible for inclusion in this review. The results show that children receiving care in a 'care by parent unit' (CBPU) were significantly less likely to receive inadequate care compared with standard inpatient admission, and there were no significant differences for their behavioural outcomes or other physical outcomes. Parents were significantly more satisfied with CBPU care than standard care, assessed both before discharge and at 7 days after discharge. Costs were lower for CPBU care compared with standard inpatient care. No other outcomes were reported. </P>

<P>As some studies came close to meeting the inclusion criteria, we examined them in detail. Some studies met the criteria for study design and participants but did not fulfil the required degree of family-centredness, despite the fact that the threshold for inclusion using this scale was considerably relaxed (from 80% to 50% cut off) in this review update (see <LINK REF="APP-09" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 9</LINK>).</P>
<P>We could only include one study which provided limited evidence for some outcomes. The study did not measure the intervention's effects on: children's psychosocial or developmental outcomes, knowledge and understanding, satisfaction or attitudes; parents' stress, perceptions of coping, sense of control, or attitudes, staff outcomes, and health services outcomes other than costs. The study was conducted at a single tertiary-care hospital in Australia, involving patients undergoing a relatively minor procedure (tonsillectomy). Its applicability to other settings and patient groups may be limited</P>

<P>We included one study involving 288 participants. The included study was at low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and attrition bias and at unclear risk of bias for other items.</P>
<P>The fact that some data pertained to children older than 12 years, and we were unable to contact the author to obtain results for children under 12 only, means that some of the data presented here relates to children slightly outside the age range specified for this review. Overall the evidence suggests some benefit for the family-centred care intervention but this is based on a small dataset and needs confirmation in larger RCTs.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-19 10:48:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The tool used for scoring family-centredness (<LINK REF="REF-Trivette-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trivette 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="APP-08" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 8</LINK>) has been used for scoring existing literature (as well as our previous review, <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>) and so was thought to be particularly relevant for this update. The fact that the scored studies consistently fell short in Cluster 2: cultural, may indicate a need for revision of the tool before further work is conducted in this area. However, it has not been possible to find other tools. Some studies investigating family-centred service delivery have developed tools, for example the MPOC (<LINK REF="REF-King-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 1995</LINK>), but this instrument, which has been widely validated in many clinical areas, examines processes of care delivery rather than assessment of existing research. We have not included the studies using MPOC because while they suggest they are about family-centred care delivery, they examine relationships between parents and health professionals only, without the holistic approach that we see as an inherent part of a family-centred care model.</P>
<P>It is possible that the combination of the scoring system for family-centred care and the limitation to RCTs may have created a stringency that precluded inclusion of most studies in this field. The team discussed revising the scoring criteria, but decided to retain these as a way of establishing a baseline for further investigations of the effectiveness of family-centred care. Much of the very large literature on family-centred care is anecdotal, containing descriptions, stories and reports rather than research. We therefore wanted to ensure that this review was as rigorous as possible. Future reviews may consider it reasonable to revisit these inclusion criteria and scoring systems and to consider broadening the selection criteria to include other study designs. We will address this, in part, by undertaking two reviews for the Joanna Briggs Institute. The first will be of the qualitative research found, while a second review examines the quasi-RCTs which were excluded from this updated Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2012</LINK>).</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-10-19 10:51:14 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because of the difficulty of measuring the family-centredness of care, much of the published research in this area has used qualitative approaches. While useful in their own right, these studies do not answer questions of effectiveness. While we do not want to pre-empt the review of qualitative studies for the Joanna Briggs Institute, early reading of the possible included studies reveal consistent themes about the delivery of family-centred care.<I> </I>For example, several papers<I> </I>(<LINK REF="STD-Darbyshire-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Darbyshire 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coyne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coyne-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Haire-2005" TYPE="STUDY">O'Haire 2005</LINK>) have described the resentment felt by parents when staff expect them to undertake some of the care of their hospitalised child, staff acting as gatekeepers for parents to access their own children (<LINK REF="REF-Coyne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 2008</LINK>), and parents having to negotiate with staff to have their needs met (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002d_Hallstrom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">K-Hallstrom 1999</LINK>). These provide ideas for further qualitative research, which could subsequently form a basis for generating hypotheses for quantitative studies about both the acceptability and effectiveness of family-centred care.</P>
<P>As lifestyles continue to change over time, with the evolution of non-nuclear families, for example, parents have increasing expectations of their abilities to combine work and family life. As family structures and expectations of the healthcare experience change (often related to the development of innovative technologies in health care, and new models of care delivery) so such perspectives will affect the way care is given in hospitals. It is important that ways of measuring the effects of models such as family-centred care are developed, so that ultimately we can determine the best way to provide care for children and families in health services. Recent research has developed and validated tools to examine the family-centredness of care (<LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2009a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aggarwal-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggarwal 2009b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gill 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shields-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2011</LINK>). These could be the basis for measurement within future quantitative studies.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-05 13:56:58 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This update has found limited evidence, in the form of a single moderate-quality RCT, to guide practice. The study suggests there may be some positive effects of family-centre care on outcomes such as adequacy of clinical care, parental satisfaction and costs. There is no evidence of harm; nor is there evidence for a range of other relevant outcomes. While awaiting further definitive evidence of the effects of family-centred care models, health services can continue to explore the application of these models as an option for children's care in hospital. </P>
<P>Current arrangements in some hospital settings, whereby children and their families receive care using a model that incorporates some aspects of family-centred care, but which militate against truly regarding the family as the central unit of care, and in which ineffective negotiation about roles of both family members and staff are common, can cause resentment and inappropriate communication between families and hospital staff (<LINK REF="REF-Coyne-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Coyne-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Coyne-2007a" TYPE="STUDY">Coyne 2007a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darbyshire-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Darbyshire 1994</LINK>). Future research will hopefully identify effective models of care which may ameliorate such communication breakdown between staff and families.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-07-06 10:58:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review has shown that more high-quality research is needed. We found only one randomised trial providing limited evidence for the benefits of family-centred care for particular outcomes.</P>
<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-Bolton-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bolton 2004</LINK>) considered a narrow, discrete category of children having a single type of surgery (tonsillectomy), in one hospital, where contamination across groups would have been possible, and blinding difficult. Also, family-centred care is influenced by a range of factors, including the diagnosis for which the child is admitted, and the length or frequency of their hospital stay. The included study did not consider the influence of culture and ethnicity (and notably, the cultural component of the family-centredness score was given a 0 result for this study). Future research should examine the effects of family-centred care for children with a range of diagnoses, and length and frequency of hospital stays, as well as for children from different ethnic and cultural groups. This updated review has also highlighted the need for a review to examine the effects of family-centred care on adolescents and their families/carers.</P>
<P>We have identified clearly the elements of family-centredness that should be addressed by future intervention research. Any family-centred care intervention (model) should include the family as the centre point of the child's life, and therefore the family should be integral to care delivery. The intervention should also include structural and environmental factors, such as accommodation for parents (which would be more than a chair beside the child's bed) and should include bathrooms, laundries, eating places, parking and other facilities for parents and family members. A family-centred care model should take cultural differences of families into consideration, perhaps including separate spaces for prayer and reflection, culture-specific foods, and awareness of the needs of family members. Education and effective communication are important parts of a family-centred care model, and these need to be in place for both health professionals, and children and family members. Support of all kinds, for example parent to parent, or consumer groups and information services are available in a true family-centred care model. Specific interventions (venipuncture, dressings, injections, for example) in a family-centred context require the presence of parents and family members. </P>
<P>To minimise the risk of contamination between intervention and control groups, and to ensure a sufficiently large sample size, cluster RCTs may be the preferred model for future research. These would require the cooperation of several hospitals which were run on similar lines. Future single site studies may be at risk of contamination between groups and find blinding difficult to implement. In some situations, for example, in a town where there is only one children's hospital/ward/unit, allocation to an experimental or control hospital/ward/unit would not be possible. Random allocation may also not be feasible when a child is admitted to a particular hospital/ward/unit for specific specialist care available only at that hospital. Further, parents' choices may dictate where a child is admitted. If the difficulties in conducting RCTs of family-centred care prove insurmountable, before and after studies in one or two sites may be a feasible way of ascertaining the effects of family-centred care, though this would not provide the same level of evidence as a randomised trial.</P>
<P>Models of care are changing with differing methods of running hospitals. A family-centred care model could contain, for example, a learning package for staff and families about family-centred care, and a period of implementation of the principles learned. This becomes problematic in an era of short stays in hospital, with models of day admission and treatment the norm for many conditions. Such models could suggest that family-centred care is irrelevant, as the child stays in hospital for less than a day. However, family-centred care may be important whatever the health setting may be, and for any length of stay and involvement, including the pre-hospitalisation and follow-up phases, and so should be investigated in all healthcare settings: acute hospital, community services, and long-term facilities. </P>
<P>Future research should measure a range of important outcomes that have not been addressed to date, including children's knowledge and understanding, satisfaction, parental stress, coping and sense of control, and outcomes for staff including satisfaction. Comprehensive cost measures as well as staffing and time outcomes are also needed (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2006</LINK>).</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2012-07-05 14:09:37 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the original protocol and review (<LINK REF="REF-Shields-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shields 2007</LINK>), we included a range of study designs (RCTs, quasi-RCTs and CBAs). For this update, we included only RCTs in an attempt to improve the methodological rigour of studies eligible for inclusion in the review. However, as a way of potentially including studies on family-centred care, we decreased the threshold for inclusion in the family-centred care intervention score from the 80% of the original review to 50%.</P>
<P>We have also excluded single interventions that did not reflect a FCC model of care from the review, and excluded premature neonates from the eligible participant group. Finally, we have removed the selection criterion whereby studies with inadequate or unclear blinding of outcome assessment were excluded from the review. We have also adopted the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to assess included studies.</P>
<P>Another important difference between the original protocol and review and this update relates to screening of studies and interventions. Initial assessment in the original protocol and review was, at times, confusing, as we had to have many deliberations over whether or not to move studies of varying interventions forward for scoring of the family-centredness of interventions and quality assessment. In this update, we corrected this to ensure that only studies of a family-centred model of care, as opposed to studies of a single intervention, for example, venipuncture or parental present anaesthesia induction, became potential inclusions. This ensured a greater degree of precision within the methods of the update.</P>
<P>We have also changed terminology to describe the control comparison group: in the previous version of the review we described 'professionally-centred models of care' but as these are the same as standard models of care we have now adopted 'standard models' to describe the control group.</P>
<P>In the original review, our population of interest included premature neonates. This update has removed these from the eligible participant group because premature neonates' requirements for family-centred care, and the ethics and philosophies of care around this particular group, are different to those in a ward/unit where full term infants and children are nursed.</P>
<P>In the original review we excluded studies based on blinding of outcome assessment. This update has removed this exclusion criterion.</P>

<P>RCT (this was sub-study of a larger project which examined the postoperative care of children having tonsillectomy).</P>
<P> The RCT compared routine inpatient care with care in a Care-by-Parent Unit (CBPU) in a tertiary referral paediatric hospital in Australia. Other investigations included various types of pain control, control of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and costs of admission.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2012-07-06 11:39:30 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All public patients who were scheduled to undergo tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were reviewed to assess their eligibility for inclusion (at least 3 years of age, no evidence of obstructive sleep apnoea, no history of significant cardiac, respiratory or hepatic disease, and parents did not require an interpreter or have trouble with written English).</P>
<P>A total of 153 (inpatient) and 148 (CBPU) participants were enrolled. Of these 3 inpatients refused written consent and 7 cancelled surgery or had it performed elsewhere prior to informed consent being obtained. A further 3 CBPU participants withdrew prior to consent being obtained. </P>
<P>A total of 288 participants consented to the trial and were randomly allocated to routine inpatient care (n=143) or CBPU (n=145). Some of these were over 13 years, but it was found that 260 of these children were aged between 3 and 13 years, and were analysed separately, hence were able to be included in this review (124 inpatient, 136 CBPU).</P>
<P>The sample size was adjusted incrementally throughout the study as the original sample size calculation was not able to be met through the recruitment strategies employed.The author stated that initial calculations indicated that a two-group, large sample normal approximation test of proportions with a one sided 0.05 significance level of 207 participants in each group would provide an 80% power to reject the non-equivalence null hypothesis that the CBPU intervention (though it must be remembered that this part of the study constituted only a small component of the overall study) offered a lesser quality of treatment than routine inpatient care. The prespecified zone of equivalence was stated to be 0.12 (an absolute difference in the proportion of each study group reaching the primary outcome of 0.12 or more). The assumptions underpinning these sample size and zone of equivalence calculations were that the expected differences in proportions between CBPU and routine inpatient care groups was zero, and that the proportion of participants registering at least one marker of inadequate care in each study group was equal to 0.4.</P>
<P>Revision of the sample size was accepted by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the end of 2002 when it was apparent that the sample size would not be reached. A larger pre-specified zone of equivalence of 0.14 (the absolute difference in the proportion of each study group reaching the primary outcome was 0.14 or more) was therefore accepted. The assumptions were that the incidence of the primary outcome was unchanged at 0.4 (routine care group), that the study's power also remained stable at 80% and so that a total of 300 subjects would be needed. In addition, the age range was enlarged to allow children over 13 years to be included.</P>

<P>While use of validated questionnaires (Posthospital Behaviour Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-1966" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 1966</LINK>) and Child Behaviour Questionnaire (<LINK REF="REF-Rutter-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutter 1970</LINK>) helped minimize possible bias in reported answers, it is possible that respondents gave results which were somewhat subjective, for example, parents assessing the behaviour of their children. Recall bias may have occurred, but this was minimized by contacting the families several times post-discharge, and was thought not to have influenced the result. The possible impact of interviewer bias was minimised by use of the same research assistant and a script. </P>

<P>
<I>Instructions for Applying Inclusion Criteria </I>
</P>
<P>
<B>Q1:</B>Include studies that are cluster randomised trials; Include studies where the sequence generation is 'adequate' according to the Cochrane Handbook;</P>
<P>Simple/unrestricted randomisation, including repeated coin-tossing, throwing dice, dealing previously shuffled cards, a published list of random numbers, a list of random assignments generated by a computer;           </P>
<P>Restricted randomisation, including blocked randomisation, stratified randomisation, minimisation, biased coin or urn randomisation, replacement randomisation, mixed randomisation and maximal randomisation.           </P>
<P>Include studies which state they are an RCT but don't state the randomisation method (the trial authors will be contacted for information about the sequence generation method).</P>
<P>Exclude studies where the sequence generation is 'inadequate' according to the Handbook; exclude studies which state they are RCTs but turn out to be a quasi-randomized trial.</P>
<P>Systematic methods such as alternation, assignment based on date of birth, case record number and data of presentation are sometimes referred to as &#8216;quasi-random&#8217;.</P>
<P>
<B>Q2: </B>Include studies if the data for children 0-12 years can be extracted and analysed. If a study mostly contains children 0- 12 years of age, with a few outliers, it will be included, but no subset analysis will be undertaken.</P>
<P>EXCLUDE studies examined premature neonates as infants born prematurely and who are patients in a neonatal intensive or special care nursery, as their requirements for family-centred care, and the ethics and philosophies of care around this particular group, are different to those in a ward/unit where full term infants and children are nursed.</P>
<P>
<B>Q3: </B>Include any healthcare intervention that aims to promote the family-centred model of care during a child's hospitalisation. Only studies which provide clear evidence that the family and/or child were actively involved in the planning and/or delivery of healthcare during the child's hospitalisation will be considered for inclusion in this review. </P>
<P>For the purposes of the review, the minimum criteria for active involvement will include evidence of collaboration between health carers and the family and/or child in the planning and/or delivery of care as soon as possible after admission, or during the preadmission period. Included studies must also compare family-centred models with standard model of care.</P>
<P>Types of interventions could include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Environmental interventions as evidenced by collaboration with the family and/or child in the design or redevelopment of facilities to provide an environment that maximises parental involvement and enhances child recovery and/or convalescence, care-by-parent units, privacy areas;</LI>
<LI>Family-centred policies which may include open visiting hours for siblings or extended family, parent participation in their child's care to the extent they choose (for example, feeding, bathing);</LI>
<LI> Communication interventions could include parental presence and participation at daily interdisciplinary ward rounds and family conferences to plan future care, developing collaborative care pathways where both parent and/or child and health carer document issues and progress, reorganisation of health care to provide continuity of care-giver (such as, primary nursing), shared medical records, local hospital based interpreters;</LI>
<LI>Educational interventions could include structured educational sessions for parents of technologically dependant children, continuing education programs to equip staff to provide care within a family-centred framework, preadmission programs;</LI>
<LI> Family support interventions such as flexible charging schemes for poor families, referrals to other hospital or community services (such as, social workers, chaplains, patient representatives, mental health professionals, home health care, rehabilitation services), facilitating parent-to-parent support.</LI>
</UL>
<P>EXCLUDE Studies where there is no clear evidence of collaboration between the family and/or child and   health care provider in the planning and/or delivery of care. Such studies could include parental presence during health care procedures such as routine examinations, anaesthetic induction, venipuncture and post-anaesthetic recovery, bereavement team/protocols, because singular interventions such as parental presence without any collaboration, communication etc does not meet the holism of FCC.</P>
<P>Studies which examine parental presence for a singular procedure, for the same reason. As an example, parental presence for anaesthesia induction might occur in the OR, but there&#8217;s nothing to say that the same hospital will let parents be involved in any other aspect of the child&#8217;s care. Similarly, a study that examines parental presence for venepuncture is not studying FCC, rather it is only parental presence for a specific reason.</P>
