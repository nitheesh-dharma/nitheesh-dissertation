<P>Data are now available from randomised trials involving over 24,000 women. The new data do not support routine vitamin C supplementation, either alone or in combination with vitamin E and other supplements in pregnancy for the prevention of fetal or neonatal death, poor fetal growth, preterm birth or pre-eclampsia. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption. The review found conflicting results for prelabour rupture of fetal membranes (PROM); vitamin C given on its own appeared to decrease the risk of preterm and term PROM, however, the risk of term PROM was increased when supplementation included both vitamin C and vitamin E. There was an increased risk of self-reported abdominal pain in supplemented women.</P>

<P>
<B>Taking vitamin C supplements in pregnancy</B>
</P>
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Does vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy improve outcomes for mothers and babies, and does it have any adverse effects?</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Having a low intake of vitamin C could be associated with complications in pregnancy such as high blood pressure with swelling of the hands, feet and face (pre-eclampsia), anaemia and having a small baby.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>This review included data from 29 trials involving over 24,000 pregnant women from 17 different countries. Four trials did not contribute data to the review. The overall risk of bias of the trials was low to unclear, and the evidence was moderate to high quality. The most common daily dosage of vitamin C was 1000 mg, which was used in 15 studies. The findings indicated that routine supplementation with vitamin C during pregnancy, either alone or in combination with other supplements (mainly vitamin E) did not improve outcomes for women and their babies. There was a 36% relative reduction in the placenta coming away early from the uterine wall (placental abruption) in women given vitamin C supplements (eight studies, over 15,700 women); this was rated as high-quality evidence. However, it was unclear whether this finding was due to vitamin C or another agent, as most trials gave women vitamin C combined with vitamin E. In the studies that gave women vitamin C only, there was a reduction in prelabour rupture of the membranes (PROM) occurring either preterm or at term. However, there was an increased risk of term PROM in the studies that gave women vitamin C and vitamin E. Therefore, further research is required to examine the role of vitamin C in reducing placental abruption and the development of PROM. The review found in one study only an increased risk of abdominal pain with vitamin C indicating there may be harms associated with vitamin C supplements in pregnancy.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Taking vitamin C supplements during pregnancy does not help to prevent problems in pregnancy including stillbirth, the death of the baby, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia or low birthweight babies.</P>

<P>Twenty-nine trials involving 24,300 women are included in this review. Overall, 11 trials were judged to be of low risk of bias, eight were high risk of bias and for 10 trials it was unclear. No clear differences were seen between women supplemented with vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements compared with placebo or no control for the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.89 to 1.49; 20,038 participants; 11 studies; I² = 0%; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), neonatal death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.08; 19,575 participants; 11 studies; I² = 0%), perinatal death (average RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.49; 17,105 participants; seven studies; I² = 35%), birthweight (mean difference (MD) 26.88 g, 95% CI -18.81 to 72.58; 17,326 participants; 13 studies; I² = 69%), intrauterine growth restriction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; 20,361 participants; 12 studies; I² = 15%; <I>high quality evidence</I>), preterm birth (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.10; 22,250 participants; 16 studies; I² = 49%; <I>high quality evidence</I>), preterm PROM (prelabour rupture of membranes) (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36; 16,825 participants; 10 studies; I² = 70%; <I>low quality evidence</I>), term PROM (average RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56; 2674 participants; three studies; I² = 87%), and clinical pre-eclampsia (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 21,956 participants; 16 studies; I² = 41%; <I>high quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>Women supplemented with vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements compared with placebo or no control were at decreased risk of having a placental abruption (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92; 15,755 participants; eight studies; I² = 0%; <I>high quality evidence</I>) and had a small increase in gestational age at birth (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61; 14,062 participants; nine studies; I² = 65%), however they were also more likely to self-report abdominal pain (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.37; 1877 participants; one study). In the subgroup analyses based on the type of supplement, vitamin C supplementation alone was associated with a reduced risk of preterm PROM (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; 1282 participants; five studies; I² = 0%) and term PROM (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94; 170 participants; one study). Conversely, the risk of term PROM was increased when supplementation included vitamin C and vitamin E (average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.23; 3060 participants; two studies; I² = 0%). There were no differences in the effects of vitamin C on other outcomes in the subgroup analyses examining the type of supplement. There were no differing patterns in other subgroups of women based on underlying risk of pregnancy complications, timing of commencement of supplementation or dietary intake of vitamin C prior to trial entry. The GRADE quality of the evidence was high for intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and placental abruption, moderate for stillbirth and clinical pre-eclampsia, low for preterm PROM.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-09-07 10:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-04-13 04:01:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of a woman's diet during pregnancy, including the intake of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein and fat) is known to influence fetal growth and a range of other maternal and perinatal health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Abu_x002d_Saad-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abu-Saad 2010</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-07-29 11:59:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin C or ascorbic acid, is an essential water-soluble micronutrient, involved in the synthesis of collagen, an essential component of connective tissue (the tissue that holds the body's structures together), and in antioxidant defence mechanisms. Unlike most animals, humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C and therefore require an adequate dietary intake of vitamin C in order to maintain body stores. Vitamin C is found widely in many fruits and vegetables, with high levels in guava, blackcurrants, citrus fruits, strawberries, capsicum, tomatoes, potatoes and broccoli (<LINK REF="REF-Read-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 1990</LINK>). Consequently, vitamin C deficiency is rarely reported in individuals with a healthy standard diet. In most western countries, the current adult recommended dietary intake (RDI) for vitamin C ranges from 30 mg per day to 70 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>). During pregnancy, vitamin C requirements are increased (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>) as vitamin C is actively transported across the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Streeter-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streeter 1981</LINK>). As a result, maternal plasma vitamin C levels fall during pregnancy and the RDI is increased to 60 mg per day during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>). During lactation the RDI is increased to 85 mg per day due to loss through breast milk (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-09-07 10:44:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>One of the first controlled trials of vitamin C was conducted by James Lind in 1753, who demonstrated that providing soldiers on the HMS Salisbury with citrus fruits alleviated symptoms of the disease scurvy (<LINK REF="REF-Lind-1753" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lind 1753</LINK>). Lind's work led to the discovery that vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy, which is characterised by damaged connective tissue and capillary haemorrhage leading to bleeding in the gums and deeper tissues, poor wound healing, skin rashes and generalised weakness (<LINK REF="REF-Read-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 1990</LINK>). Infantile scurvy can occur in infants fed vitamin C-deficient formula, and is characterised by bleeding under the connective tissue surrounding bones, impaired bone development, irritability, poor appetite and weight loss (<LINK REF="REF-Read-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Read 1990</LINK>). Individuals with scurvy can also suffer iron-deficiency anaemia and/or megaloblastic anaemia as vitamin C is involved in the metabolism of iron and folate. Vitamin C promotes both the mobilisation of iron from body stores and the absorption of dietary iron in the gut (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nienhuis-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nienhuis 1981</LINK>). The mechanisms behind the interaction between vitamin C and folate are less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Stokes-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokes 1975</LINK>). Iron and folate supplementation in pregnancy has been covered in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Lassi-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lassi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Rosas-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Rosas 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pe_x00f1_a_x002d_Rosas-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peña-Rosas 2015</LINK>). Supplementation with vitamin C may play a role in the prevention of iron-deficiency anaemia and megaloblastic anaemia.</P>
<P>As an antioxidant, vitamin C helps to protect body tissues from damage by harmful free radicals (reactive oxygen molecules) and so helping to prevent oxidative stress. Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in the amount of free radicals circulating in the body and the availability of antioxidants to quench free radicals. Vitamin C acts as a free radical scavenger and also interacts with vitamin E, another antioxidant, where it helps to regenerate and maintain body stores of vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Packer-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Packer 1979</LINK>). A key feature in the development of complications in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and prelabour rupture of fetal membranes (PROM) is oxidative stress (<LINK REF="REF-Myatt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myatt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2001</LINK>). Oxidative stress has also been implicated in many of the disorders common to preterm infants including chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saugstad-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saugstad 2001</LINK>). Having an increased dietary intake of vitamin C in early pregnancy has been associated with small increases in birthweight and placental weight (<LINK REF="REF-Mathews-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mathews 1999</LINK>). Preventing complications in pregnancy like pre-eclampsia, growth restriction, preterm PROM and serious neonatal morbidities would represent significant cost savings in hospital and intensive care unit admissions and the use of other healthcare resources. Other Cochrane reviews are assessing vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005a</LINK>) and antioxidants for preventing pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2008</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-07 10:44:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>Patterns on the use of vitamin C supplements during pregnancy are not well described. Commonly prescribed and self-administered vitamin and mineral supplements in pregnancy include folate, iron and multivitamins (<LINK REF="REF-Donati-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donati 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henry-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 2000</LINK>). Many over the counter multivitamins contain vitamin C in a range of doses, which highlights the need to demonstrate the safety of using vitamin C in pregnancy, particularly use in early pregnancy. There is limited evidence about the safety of giving vitamin C to women during any stage in pregnancy. One animal study has reported scurvy in the offspring of guinea pigs given vitamin C supplements during gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 1965</LINK>), coined 'rebound scurvy' due to increased turnover of vitamin C in the offspring. However, further animal studies have failed to replicate this finding (<LINK REF="REF-Diplock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diplock 1998</LINK>). In preterm infants, high levels of vitamin C at birth have been associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Silvers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silvers 1998</LINK>). After adjusting for gestational age however, these findings were no longer significant and women in this study were not supplemented with vitamin C during pregnancy. Despite the limited data on safety in pregnancy, in the United States the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board have set an upper tolerable limit of vitamin C ingestion in pregnancy at 2000 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2000</LINK>) indicating the highest level of intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all women. In non-pregnant adults, observational studies of vitamin C supplementation have reported adverse effects such as oxalate kidney stone formation, interactions with vitamin B-12 leading to decreased B-12 availability, excessive iron absorption and gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Diplock-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diplock 1998</LINK>). However, the only consistent adverse effect reported from controlled clinical trials of vitamin C supplementation of doses ranging from 120 mg to 6000 mg per day is diarrhoea (<LINK REF="REF-Bendich-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bendich 1997</LINK>). The need to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy is important when vitamin C is used in high doses. This is particularly important as vitamin C crosses the placenta, hence supplementation with vitamin C may result in higher than normal vitamin C levels in the developing fetus. There is a need to demonstrate the long- and short-term safety for both the mother and child.</P>
<P>The aims of this review are (i) to identify all published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy and (ii) to investigate the benefits and hazards of vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy.</P>

A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials in this update.

We will adjust their sample size using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane</I> <I>Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

Furthermore, the test of subgroup differences was not significant for the outcome pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="CMP-004.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.8</LINK>).</P>

<P>The results of this review, which included over 24,000 women and their babies, do not support routine vitamin C supplementation, either alone or in combination with other supplements. There were no clear differences between women supplemented with any vitamin C compared with placebo or no control for the risk of any primary outcome including stillbirth, neonatal or perinatal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, preterm PROM (prelabour rupture of fetal membranes), term PROM or pre-eclampsia. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption, which warrants further investigation. There was also a small increase in length of gestation among supplemented women although this finding may have limited clinical relevance as there was no difference in the risk of preterm birth between comparison groups. Women supplemented with vitamin C were more likely to self-report abdominal pain, however, there were no differences in other reported side effects between comparison groups. There was no convincing evidence that any vitamin C supplementation results in other important benefits or harms.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-28 12:32:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides reliable information about the impact of vitamin C supplementation on a range of maternal, perinatal and infant health outcomes. The most common outcomes reported were preterm birth (16 studies, 22,250 participants), pre-eclampsia (16 studies, 21,956 participants), birthweight (13 studies, 17,326 participants), intrauterine growth restriction (12 studies, 20,361 participants), stillbirth (11 studies, 20,038 participants), neonatal death (11 studies, 19,575 participants), preterm PROM (10 studies, 16,825 participants), eclampsia (nine studies, 20,304 participants), caesarean section (nine studies, 16,459 participants), gestational age at birth (nine studies, 14,062 participants), placental abruption (eight studies, 15,755 participants), and respiratory distress syndrome (eight studies, 18,574 participants).</P>
<P>However, no studies reported on any measures of maternal or infant iron and folate status, infantile scurvy, maternal satisfaction with care or any long-term benefits or harms for either the mother or child. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McEvoy-2014" TYPE="STUDY">McEvoy 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poston 2006</LINK>), reported conflicting findings on respiratory function in children up to two years of age, however, whether supplementation influences childhood growth, disability or other health outcomes in children is unclear.</P>
<P>Potential side effects of vitamin C were inconsistently reported. One study reported an increased risk of self-reported abdominal pain among supplemented women. There were no differences between women supplemented with vitamin C compared with placebo or no control for any other potential side effects assessed, including elevated liver enzymes, pyrosis and nausea, acne, transient weakness and skin rash.</P>
<P>There were no clear differences between women supplemented with any vitamin C compared with placebo or no control for any outcome related to the use of health service resources, however few studies reported on maternal use of health services.</P>
<P>We detected substantial heterogeneity for the primary outcomes perinatal death, preterm birth, preterm PROM, term PROM and pre-eclampsia. We undertook sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of trial quality and found that the heterogeneity was reduced for the outcomes preterm birth, term PROM and pre-eclampsia when only studies at low risk of bias were included. This suggests that variation in trial quality may explain some of the heterogeneity detected for these outcomes.</P>
<P>We also undertook subgroup analyses based on the type of supplement used to explore heterogeneity and examine whether there are any differences in the effects of vitamin C when given alone or in combination with other agents.Twelve studies supplemented women with vitamin C alone, 15 studies supplemented women with vitamin C and vitamin E, and a further two studies supplemented women with vitamin C in combination with vitamin E and either allopurinol or aspirin and fish oil. For the outcomes stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth and pre-eclampsia, there were no differences between the effects of vitamin C supplementation in the studies that assessed vitamin C alone and in the studies that assessed vitamin C in conjunction with vitamin E and other supplements. However, vitamin C supplementation alone appeared to reduce the risk of preterm PROM; this effect was not present in the studies that supplemented women with a combined supplement. Furthermore, vitamin C supplementation alone appeared to reduce the risk of term PROM, however, the risk was increased in the studies that used vitamin C in combination with vitamin E. The increased risk of term PROM was also present in the sensitivity analyses. Only two studies that reported term PROM were judged to be at low risk of bias, and both supplemented women with vitamin C combined with vitamin E. Therefore, the increased risk of term PROM in studies at low risk of bias may reflect the addition of vitamin E.</P>
<P>These subgroup analyses suggest that vitamin C on its own may be beneficial for preventing preterm and term PROM, but when combined with vitamin E may in fact be harmful and increase the risk of term PROM. Caution should be taken when interpreting the findings for term PROM as only three studies (3230 women) reported this outcome, and the subgroup analyses included only one small study (170 women) that assessed vitamin C supplementation alone. Therefore, further research investigating the specific role of vitamin C in the aetiology of PROM is warranted before any conclusions can be made about this finding. There appear to be no other potential benefits or harms of vitamin C supplementation alone in pregnancy. For further information on vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy <I>see</I> the Cochrane review '<I>Vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy</I>' (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2005a</LINK>). Studies of combined vitamin C and vitamin E supplementation have been included in both reviews.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity was also explored in subgroup analyses examining the influence of dietary intake of vitamin C prior to trial entry. Ten studies reported some information about the dietary intake of either study participants or the populations from which the participants were drawn. Of these, seven were classified as including women with adequate vitamin C intake. The remaining three did not provide specific information about dietary intake among study participants, however, they were classified as including women from populations with 'low nutritional status' which could indicate poor vitamin C intake. There were no clear differences in the effects of vitamin C supplementation in the subgroups of women with 'low nutritional status' or adequate vitamin C intake, although for many outcomes, data in the 'low nutritional status' subgroup were contributed from one study only, which limits the reliability of the results. One study (<LINK REF="STD-McCance-2010" TYPE="STUDY">McCance 2010</LINK>) reported information about the risk of pre-eclampsia separately according to serum vitamin C concentrations at trial entry, and reported a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia in the supplemented group with very low vitamin C concentration, which was of borderline statistical significance. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution as this subgroup included only 28 women, and the findings are inconsistent with the risk of pre-eclampsia observed among supplemented women with 'low nutritional status'. Whether vitamin C is beneficial for women with low or inadequate intake of vitamin C is therefore unclear. The role of vitamin C and other antioxidants in the prevention of pre-eclampsia is being further explored in the Cochrane review '<I>Antioxidants for preventing pre-eclampsia</I>' (<LINK REF="REF-Rumbold-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumbold 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other planned subgroup analyses examined the impact of variation in baseline risk of pregnancy complications. Just over half of all studies included women to be at increased or high risk of adverse outcomes, mainly pre-eclampsia. For all of the primary outcomes, the effect sizes did not vary substantially between women at high/increased risk and women at low/moderate risk, suggesting that there are no benefits of supplementation in particular subgroups based on underlying risk. Furthermore, for the outcomes preterm birth, preterm PROM and pre-eclampsia, there was heterogeneity present in both of the subgroups based on risk, suggesting that it may be due to other factors.</P>
<P>We also undertook subgroup analyses to explore the impact of variation in timing of commencement of supplementation. These subgroup analyses did not reveal any substantial differences in the effect sizes for any of the primary outcomes between studies enrolling women prior to 20 weeks&#8217;, after 20 weeks&#8217;, or that included women both prior to and after 20 weeks&#8217; gestation, with the exception of preterm PROM. There was a reduction in preterm PROM when supplementation commenced after 20 weeks', however this should be interpreted with caution, as the finding is based on one study (109 participants). There was no reduction in preterm PROM observed in the studies that commenced supplementation at other times. Therefore, there appears to be no clear benefit of commencing vitamin C supplementation either earlier or later in pregnancy.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses assessing the impact of the dosage of vitamin C were planned but could not be undertaken due to insufficient information about low dosages of vitamin C.</P>
<P>We explored the possibility of publication bias for each primary outcome. The distribution of results were skewed for the outcome pre-eclampsia (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), indicating that small studies reporting negative findings may be missing, which could indicate reporting bias. For the other outcomes (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>), the distribution of results was relatively even, suggesting that the risk of publication bias is low. (Data for small for gestational age, preterm birth and preterm PROM are not shown due to restrictions on the number of figures allowed).</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-09-07 10:56:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The findings of this review are in agreement with several meta-analyses examining the effects of vitamin C and E supplementation for the prevention of pre-eclampsia and other maternal and perinatal complications (<LINK REF="REF-Basaran-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Basaran 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The finding of a 36% reduction in the relative risk of placental abruption among vitamin C supplemented women compared with placebo or no control warrants further investigation. Several studies have reported the presence of low serum vitamin C concentrations as well as markers of oxidative stress in women with placental abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Incebiyik-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Incebiyik 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1985</LINK>). However, low serum concentrations of vitamin E and other antioxidants have also been associated with placental abruption (<LINK REF="REF-Sharma-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharma 1986</LINK>). In addition, secondary analysis of one included study (<LINK REF="STD-Poston-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Poston 2006</LINK>), suggested that the reduced risk of placental abruption in supplemented women was confined to smokers. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution as it is unclear whether the reduced risk of placental abruption identified in this review is attributable to vitamin C or E or the combination of both agents, and also whether the effects are consistent across all subgroups of women. Further observational research examining the underlying pathways to placental abruption is required before any firm conclusions can be drawn about this finding.</P>

<P>The available data from randomised trials involving over 24,000 women do not support routine vitamin C supplementation, either alone or in combination with vitamin E and other supplements in pregnancy, for all women or women at high risk of pregnancy complications. Supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of placental abruption; this requires further assessment, as it is unclear whether this effect is attributable to vitamin C, vitamin E or the combination of both vitamins. The review found conflicting results for prelabour rupture of fetal membranes (PROM), vitamin C given on its own appeared to decrease the risk of preterm and term PROM, however, the risk of term PROM was increased when supplementation included both vitamin C and vitamin E. Although side effects were scarcely reported, there was an increased risk of self-reported abdominal pain in supplemented women.</P>

<P>Further research is required to clarify the specific role of vitamin C in the aetiology of preterm and term PROM and placental abruption. Follow-up studies of women and children enrolled in the current trials are also warranted to determine whether there are any longer-term benefits or harms of vitamin E supplementation. Further research is also required to examine the effect of supplementation in women with a low or inadequate intake of vitamin C prior to and in early pregnancy.</P>

<P>Women were assigned randomly to receive vitamin C and E tablets or identical placebos from enrolment (between14-22 GA to birth), the assigned prescription continued even after pre-eclampsia or hypertension was diagnosed. They were instructed to take 1 tablet and 1 capsule daily and to leave unused tablets or capsules in the blister and to return the blisters at the subsequent trial visit, regardless of whether all tablets and capsules had been taken. The active and placebo tablets for each vitamin were identical in form, colour and taste and were provided in boxes containing 4 blister packs, each marked Monday to Sunday. Custom Pharmaceuticals prepared vitamin C (1000 mg) and identical placebo tablets (microcrystalline cellulose) with addition of tartaric and citric acid to provide similar acidic taste and Banner Pharmacaps prepared identical gelatin capsules containing 400 IU natural source vitamin E (RRR-a-tocopherol) or a placebo (sunflower seed oil) and the tablets and capsules sealed in blister strips, each with a 1-week supply were packaged. For adherence: median adherence was 87%, and was similar between the treatment groups.</P>

<P>Data for 72 (25%) participants missing, 34 (23%) in vitamin group and 38 (27%) in control group. Of the 34 women in the vitamin group, 18 were "lost to follow up" and 16 delivered elsewhere. Of the 38 women in the control group, 16 were "lost to follow up" and 22 delivered elsewhere. The reasons for birth elsewhere were not provided. Although the number of women lost to follow-up in each group was similar, given the magnitude of the effect size for some outcomes (e.g. preterm birth), the review authors suspect that there may be clinically relevant bias. For example, the risk of preterm birth was 14.7% in control and 4.7% in the vitamin group, which could reflect women in the vitamin group who are in preterm labour being transferred to another hospital for birth.</P>
