<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-28 06:32:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After a stroke, blood clots can form in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT). These clots can break off and be carried in the blood stream to the heart and lungs (causing pulmonary embolism). This can be life threatening. Although anticoagulant drugs can reduce the risk of DVT they can also cause serious bleeding. A number of physical methods have been developed to prevent DVT forming. These include wearing graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression and electrical stimulation of leg muscles. The physical methods are used to increase the blood flow in the leg veins and reduce the risk of clots forming. We aimed to evaluate the effects of these physical methods in patients with a recent stroke. We found two randomised trials of graduated compression stockings, involving 2615 participants, and two small trials of intermittent pneumatic compression involving 177 participants. Graduated compression stockings were no better than 'best medical treatment' in reducing the risk of DVT after stroke. Stockings caused more skin problems (for example ulcers and blisters) on the legs. Intermittent pneumatic compression appeared promising but was not proven to be definitely beneficial. The evidence does not support routine use of graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression in patients with a recent stroke. The trials that are ongoing at present should provide reliable evidence on the benefits and harms of intermittent pneumatic compression.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-28 10:55:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are important causes of death and morbidity after stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DVT include venous stasis and hypercoagulability linked to an increase in thrombin formation and platelet hyperactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Virchow-1858" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virchow 1858</LINK>). Patients with significant weakness of the leg, and who are immobile appear to be at greatest risk. Recent studies with magnetic resonance imaging appeared to demonstrate DVT in 40% of stroke patients within the first three weeks, and above-knee DVT in 18% (<LINK REF="STD-Kelly-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Kelly 2004</LINK>). Studies using less sensitive screening techniques, such as compression duplex ultrasound, identify above-knee DVT in about 10% of patients, although the types of patients included and the duration and timing of follow up influences the frequency (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>). Clinically apparent DVT confirmed on investigation is less common. Unrecognised DVTs may nonetheless cause important complications. Proximal DVT carries a higher risk of PE than distal DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Havig-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Havig 1977</LINK>). Clinically evident PE has been variably estimated to affect stroke patients, 1% to 16% of patients in prospective randomised trials (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>) and 3% to 30% in observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Davenport-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davenport 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A Cochrane systematic review of studies of anticoagulants in patients with acute stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Sandercock-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandercock 2008</LINK>) has shown that treatment with unfractionated heparin, low molecular-weight heparin, heparinoids or oral anticoagulants was associated with a highly significant 64% reduction in the risk of DVT (95% confidence interval for the relative risk reduction was 54% to 71%, 2P &lt; 0.00001).<B> </B>However, only 3.9% of patients included in this review were systematically screened for asymptomatic DVTs to determine the effect of anticoagulants on the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT. In these small trials, the apparent absolute reduction in DVT with anticoagulation was substantial with 281 DVTs prevented per 1000 patients treated.<B> </B>However, although anticoagulant therapy was associated with about nine fewer recurrent ischaemic strokes per 1000 patients treated, it was also associated with nine additional symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages per 1000 patients treated. Similarly, anticoagulants were associated with about four fewer pulmonary emboli per 1000 but this benefit was offset by an extra nine major extracranial haemorrhages per 1000. As a result, guidelines suggest that use of low-dose anticoagulants for DVT prophylaxis are generally only applied to patients at high risk of DVT and low risk of bleeding. For example, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance states that for stroke patients, "Do not offer pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to patients with any of the risk factors for bleeding shown .... , unless the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-CG92-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE CG92 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the uncertainties about the net benefit from anticoagulants for DVT prophylaxis after stroke, interest has increased in physical methods of DVT prophylaxis (either alone or in addition to background treatment with low-dose anticoagulants). Graduated compression stockings (GCS) are thought to reduce the risk of DVT by several mechanisms, compressing the leg and thus reducing the cross-sectional area of the veins which in turn reduces stasis by increasing the blood flow velocity, increasing flow by providing greater compression around the ankle than more proximally, augmenting the effect of the calf muscle pump, improving the function of venous valves, reduction of venous pooling and altering levels of clotting factors (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>). Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is thought to reduce the risk of DVT by increasing the flow of venous blood through the deep veins of the leg and by stimulating the release of intrinsic fibrinolytic substances (<LINK REF="REF-Kohro-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kohro 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physical methods of DVT prevention could have harmful effects. Patients at highest risk of harm from this therapy are those with dermatological diseases, severe peripheral arteriopathy or diabetic neuropathy. GCS may cause ischaemic necrosis of the legs in patients with peripheral vascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merrett-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merrett 1993</LINK>) and ulceration in patients with sensory loss due to neuropathy. IPC is contraindicated in severe congestive heart failure with oedema, it could also disturb patients' sleep and might increase the risk of falling. We aimed to determine whether there is any evidence in the literature that physical methods are effective in reducing the risk of DVT and safe in patients with acute stroke. We therefore updated the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Mazzone-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mazzone 2004</LINK>) to include the recently completed trials.<BR/>

<P>One author (MN) assessed the studies identified by the electronic searches and reference tracking. Two authors (MN and MD) discussed the potentially relevant trials and extracted information about the characteristics of the included studies (method of randomisation, concealment of treatment allocation, blinding, patients lost to follow up), the characteristics of the patients (age, sex, clinical severity, confinement to bed), the action taken (description of the treatment, duration of treatment, associated administration of anticoagulant, physiotherapy) and the measures of outcome (and duration of follow up). The two data extractors resolved any discrepancies by discussion. We calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using the Review Manager software, RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We aimed to extract data to permit an intention-to-treat analysis, if possible. We also planned to do subgroup analyses according to the type of physical method of prophylaxis (GCS versus control, IPC versus control) and patients (immobile versus mobile), if possible. The review was to include an evaluation of the methodology of the studies, adequacy of randomisation, concealment of treatment allocation and blinding of the study. We had planned to do a sensitivity analysis excluding studies in which we found some ambiguity and excluding studies of poor methodological quality and unpublished studies, but this was not possible.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-06-28 07:10:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reviewed reports of 52<B> </B>studies and 72 abstracts identified by the searches. We found 12 studies of physical means for preventing DVT or PE, or both, in acute stroke. Only four studies met our inclusion criteria. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1982</LINK>) included 26 patients within 72 hours of having had an acute stroke (clinical diagnosis). Patients were randomised to receive below-knee IPC or not for 10 days. <SUP>125</SUP>I-Fibrinogen was used for DVT diagnosis. The test was performed within 24 hours of admission and scanning of precordium and legs was carried out for 10 days. The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK> ) randomly allocated 98 patients (but one patient immediately dropped out) with an acute stroke to one of three treatment groups: routine care, routine care plus thigh-length Kendall TED stockings (TED group: TED), or routine care plus thigh-length Brevett TX stockings (TX group: TX). Colour flow duplex ultrasound examination was used at baseline and at day 7 ± 2 for the diagnosis of DVT. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Lacut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacut 2005</LINK>) included 151 patients (mobile or immobile) within 48 hours of admission for cerebral haemorrhage (spontaneous or traumatic) who were randomly allocated to either thigh-length 'IPC plus GCS' or 'GCS alone' for 10 ± 2 days. We included this study since the design (IPC + GCS versus GCS) provided an unconfounded comparison of the effects of IPC versus control. At day 10 ± 2 a compression duplex ultrasound was performed for the diagnosis of DVT. Patients were evaluated at 30 and 90 days for symptomatic venous thromboembolism. The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>) included 2518 patients enrolled within the first three days after admission for an acute stroke. Patients were randomly allocated either to 'routine care plus thigh-length GCS' or 'routine clinical care alone' until the patients were mobile, discharged or died. A compression duplex ultrasound was performed between days seven and 10 and, when practical, between days 25 and 30 after randomisation. The study also evaluated complications of GCS use and compliance with the allocated treatment. We did not identify any studies of electrical nerve stimulation.</P>

<P>In the Prasad study, the method of randomisation was unclear and it was not clear whether the fibrinogen scans were assessed blind to the treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1982</LINK>). In the Muir study, patients were randomised using computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK>). Compression duplex scans were recorded on videotape for independent blind assessment. In the Lacut study, patients were randomised by computer-generated random numbers in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Lacut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacut 2005</LINK>). Compression duplex scans were recorded on videotape for independent blind assessment. This study included patients with traumatic and spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage who were either mobile or immobile at randomisation. In the CLOTS trial 1, patients were randomised by means of central (web or telephone) computer-generated allocation (<LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK>). Compression stockings were removed before compression duplex ultrasound (CDU) was performed to blind the observer to treatment allocation and hard copies of positive scans were recorded for independent assessment.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1982</LINK> the <SUP>125</SUP>I-fibrinogen scan was positive in 46% of patients (12 patients out of 26). Clinical signs of DVT were only noted in one patient with a positive scan (treatment allocation not stated). No significant differences were noted in radio-isotopically detected DVT between the treatment and control groups (six patients versus six patients, P = ns). In <LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK>, at randomisation nine out of 97 patients (9%) already had detectable DVT on CDU and five additional patients had detectable DVT by days five to nine. Thus 14 of 97 patients (14%) had DVTs within 10 days of stroke. Of the five new DVTs that occurred after randomisation four occurred in the control group. The dropout of patients in the treated group was greater than in the control group but was not statistically significant (dropouts in TX 39% versus TED 24% versus control 19%, P = 0.16). Seven patients withdrew: three for intolerance, the others for unstated reasons in the GCS group. In <LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK> there was no significant difference in compliance or tolerability in the two treated groups (TX plus TED) so the two active groups were combined for analyses of efficacy. At the second CDU three of 65 patients allocated GCS and five of 32 allocated to the control group had DVT. Only one patient had a symptomatic DVT. In <LINK REF="STD-Lacut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacut 2005</LINK> 14 patients out of 151 had a positive CDU at day 10 ± 2 (9%). No symptomatic DVT occurred within the treatment period. Three out of the 11 DVTs in the control group involved the proximal veins, while no proximal vein DVT occurred in the IPC group. Ten patients allocated to IPC (14%) and eight patients in the control group (10%) did not have a CDU performed. In <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> 205 patients out of 1256 (16%) allocated to GCS had a CDU-confirmed DVT within the study period; 224 patients out of 1262 (18%) developed DVTs in the control group. However, not all patients had CDU of their calf veins so total DVT rates may have been underestimated. The incidence of proximal DVTs was 10% (126 out of 1256) in the GCS group and 10.5% (133 out of 1262) in the control group. Symptomatic DVTs occurred in 4% of patients allocated to GCS (55 out of 1256) and in 5% of control patients (61 out of 1262) by 30 days. Overall, physical methods were not associated with a significant effect on DVT prevention (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), with moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 54%). Subgroup analysis based on the type of physical method used showed no evidence of effect of thigh-length GCS on DVT risk (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08) with a trend towards heterogeneity between the two included studies (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 65%). IPC was associated with a non-significant trend to reduction in the risk of DVT (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.10; P = 0.08), without heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 38%).</P>

<P>The outcome 'DVT in the treatment period' takes no account of any possible adverse effects or death. A more inclusive assessment of effect, that would take account of fatal events, is the outcome 'death or DVT'. This was not a prespecified outcome for this review. In <LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK> 15 of 65 (23%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and 10 of 32 (31%) allocated to avoiding GCS either died or had CDU-detected DVTs. In <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1982</LINK> the outcome was not reported explicitly but can be derived from the publication. Eight patients in the IPC group and six in the control group died or had a DVT. In <LINK REF="STD-Lacut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacut 2005</LINK> nine patients out of 74 (12%) allocated to IPC and 19 out of 77 (25%) allocated to avoid IPC either died or developed DVT within the study period. In <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> 327 patients out of 1256 (26%) allocated thigh-length GCS and 334 out of 1262 (26%) allocated to avoiding GCS either died or had CDU-detected DVTs within 30 days. Overall, physical methods were not associated with a significant reduction in 'death or DVT' (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.11) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). Subgroup analysis based on the type of physical method used showed a non-significant reduction of 'death or DVT' in the IPC subgroup (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.24) even though in this subgroup few events occurred during the study period and there was moderate heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 62%).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Pulmonary embolism (PE), adverse effects and late outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Data on other outcomes in the scheduled treatment period (PE and adverse effects) were not reported by two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Muir-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prasad-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 1982</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Lacut-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Lacut 2005</LINK> there were no symptomatic PEs nor any confirmed cases of PE at post-mortem. During the three-month follow-up period only two symptomatic venous thromboembolic events occurred, one in each group. Fourteen patients out of 74 (18.9%) allocated to IPC did not tolerate the device and stopped wearing it within five days following randomisation. In <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> 13 patients out of 1256 (1%) allocated to GCS and 20 patients out of 1262 (1.6%) allocated to avoid GCS had imaging or autopsy confirmed PE within the first 30 days (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.30; P = ns) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Of patients allocated to compression GCS, 73% (916 out of 1256) were compliant with treatment (that is they wore GCS daily until 30 days, discharge or death). Sixty-four patients out of 1256 (5%) allocated to GCS and 16 patients out of 1262 (1%) allocated to avoiding GCS experienced skin problems on the legs (that is skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, skin necrosis) (OR 3.47, 95 % CI 2.22 to 5.41; P &lt; 0.001).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-28 09:09:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, the use of physical methods did not have any clinically or statistically significant effects on any of the outcomes assessed. PEs were rare in the included RCTs of physical methods of prophylaxis. The estimate of the effect of these interventions on the risk of PE is therefore very imprecise.</P>
<P>However, the great majority of data in this review comes from trials of GCS, and <LINK REF="STD-CLOTS-2009" TYPE="STUDY">CLOTS 2009</LINK> yielded 93% of the weight in the estimate of effect on the outcome 'death or DVT'. Use of thigh-length GCS in stroke patients was not associated with a significant effect on the odds of DVT during the scheduled treatment period (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.08). Assuming a rate of 16% for any DVT (distal and proximal) this translates into a very modest absolute risk reduction of less than 2% (number needed to treat &#8805; 50). This is probably not a clinically worthwhile effect given the cost, difficulties with compliance and frequency of local complications (that is skin breaks, etc).</P>
<P>These data from trials of GCS in stroke are in marked contrast to the effects of GCS in other settings. Apart from a single study carried out in patients with acute myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="REF-Kierkegaard-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kierkegaard 1993</LINK>) no other randomised clinical trials in high-risk medical patients, other than those with stroke, have been performed. However, a systematic review of randomised trials of GCS in patients at moderate and high risk of DVT following surgical procedures showed that the use of GCS was associated with a significant reduction in DVT (<LINK REF="REF-Amaragiri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amaragiri 2001</LINK>). In a more recent review that included 18 trials, of which 16 were in perioperative patients, thigh-length GCS were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of 'any DVT'. When outcomes were restricted to proximal DVT the trend towards reduced risk with GCS was no longer statistically significant (<LINK REF="REF-Roderick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roderick 2005</LINK>). Therefore, GCS applied perioperatively seem to reduce the risk of mainly distal DVT in patients undergoing surgery. By contrast, in stroke patients the evidence does not indicate that use of GCS is associated with a clinically worthwhile reduction in risk of either distal or proximal DVT. There is very little information to indicate whether GCS reduce the risk of DVT in other high-risk groups of medical patients.</P>
<P>There was very limited evidence on the effects of IPC. However, in patients with an acute stroke IPC appears to be a promising method for reducing the risk of DVT, particularly among groups of patients in whom anticoagulants are contraindicated, for example those with intracranial haemorrhage. Therefore, additional larger randomised studies of IPC are needed to reliably assess the balance of risk and benefit after stroke. We did not find any trials of electrical nerve stimulation to induce active calf muscle contractions, but since such devices are being developed it seems likely that trials may be undertaken.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-28 09:10:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence does not support the routine use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) to reduce the risk of DVT in patients with recent stroke. There is currently insufficient evidence to justify the routine use of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in such patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-16 11:38:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of this review suggest that further trials of graduated compression stockings are justified in other categories of high-risk medical patients. Intermittent pneumatic compression for the prevention of DVT and PE may be effective in stroke patients. The ongoing CLOTS Trial 3 aims to determine whether intermittent pneumatic compression reduces the risk of DVT after acute stroke in the presence or absence of background use of GCS.</P>
