<P>There is no evidence that ozone therapy can reverse or stop tooth decay.<BR/>Tooth decay can be painful, is expensive to treat and can lead to the loss of teeth. It has been suggested that treatment of a decayed tooth with ozone will stop or reverse the decay process. This review of trials found no sound evidence that ozone is capable of reversing or stopping the progression of tooth decay. High quality research is needed to show whether or not it works. Ozone should not be considered an alternative to current treatment methods in dental practices.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-12 12:49:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dental caries is a bacterially mediated disease characterised by demineralisation of the tooth surface, which may lead to cavitation, discomfort, pain and eventual tooth loss. Ozone is toxic to certain bacteria in vitro and it has been suggested that delivering ozone into a carious lesion might reduce the number of cariogenic bacteria. This possibly could arrest the progress of the lesion and may, in the presence of fluoride, perhaps allow remineralisation to occur. This may in turn delay or prevent the need for traditional dental conservation by 'drilling and filling'.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess whether ozone is effective in arresting or reversing the progression of dental caries.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-12 12:49:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 7 November 2003); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2003, Issue 3); MEDLINE and PREMEDLINE (OVID) (1966 to November 2003); EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to November 2003); CINAHL (OVID) (1982 to November 2003); AMED (OVID) (1985 to November 2003). Quintessence was handsearched through 2002 and KaVo were contacted as manufacturers of the HealOzone apparatus for any additional published or unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Inclusion was assessed independently by at least two reviewers. Trials were only included if they met the following criteria: randomisation in a controlled trial; single surface in vivo carious lesion accessible to ozone application; clear allocation concealment; ozone application to the lesions in the intervention group; no such application of ozone in the control group; outcomes measured after at least 6 months.
<BR/>

</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Reviewers independently extracted information in duplicate. A paucity of comparable data did not allow meta-analytic pooling of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Three trials were included, with a combined total of 432 randomised lesions (137 participants). Forty-two conference papers, abstracts and posters were excluded (from an unknown number of studies). The risk of bias in all studies appeared high. The analyses of all three studies were conducted at the level of the lesion, which is not independent of the person, for this reason pooling of data was not appropriate or attempted. Individual studies showed inconsistent effects of ozone on caries, across different measures of caries progression or regression. Few secondary outcomes were reported, but one trial reported an absence of adverse events.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Given the high risk of bias in the available studies and lack of consistency between different outcome measures, there is no reliable evidence that application of ozone gas to the surface of decayed teeth stops or reverses the decay process. There is a fundamental need for more evidence of appropriate rigour and quality before the use of ozone can be accepted into mainstream primary dental care or can be considered a viable alternative to current methods for the management and treatment of dental caries.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-12 13:29:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries is a multifactorial, bacteriologically mediated, chronic disease that can damage the dentition of both children and adults. Caries is widespread across all cultural groups and is one of the most common diseases to affect the world's population (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). Tooth decay accounts for almost half of all dental extractions in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-NHS-CRD-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHS CRD 1999</LINK>). However, patterns of dental disease in the UK are changing (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2000</LINK>), with less decay being experienced by younger age groups. In the next two decades there is likely to be a corresponding change in patterns of dental treatment. The demand for traditional restorative treatment (drilling and filling) may fall if preventive care is embraced or may increase with the average age of the population as people retain more disease susceptible teeth into older age. There has already been a change in treatment philosophy. The emphasis in treatment planning has shifted from the restoration of carious teeth to the prevention of decay with minimal intervention. The early carious lesion is reversible (<LINK REF="REF-Silverstone-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverstone 1983</LINK>), a dynamic equilibrium between demineralisation and remineralisation especially in the presence of fluoride (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002B" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002B</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>). Dental caries should be managed by preventive treatment to encourage the remineralisation of non-cavitated lesions and the need for restorative treatment can then be delayed or minimised (<LINK REF="REF-Burke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burke 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Much of the research into dental caries diagnosis and management has been inadequate. Current clinical diagnosis of caries in practice is commonly subjective and new diagnostic tools have not been widely embraced due to a variety of reasons, cost, lack of familiarity and training, resistance to change, lack of validity, specificity and reliability (<LINK REF="REF-NIHC-statement-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIHC statement 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bader-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2001</LINK>). Recent government policy outlined in 'Modernising NHS Dentistry - Options for Change' (<LINK REF="REF-Options-for-Change" TYPE="REFERENCE">Options for Change</LINK>) introduced a mandate to promote novel or innovative methods to treat tooth decay in the UK population. Drilling has always been associated with some patient trepidation or fearfulness, but failure to intervene may allow further progression towards the pulp and considerable pain. Secondary dental caries can occur when a restoration (filling) fails and the decay process reoccurs at the margin of a restoration. Once restorations are in place they eventually fail and require repetitive replacement, with further drilling away of tooth material each time, which may eventually lead to total tooth loss.</P>
<P>Ozone is a naturally occurring compound consisting of three oxygen atoms produced by the ultraviolet conversion of oxygen into the activated, but unstable and short lived form of oxygen. It is a very powerful oxidising agent and in high concentrations is toxic to living systems, causing damage to cell membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Timbrell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Timbrell 1987</LINK>). This toxicity has led ozone to be suggested as an agent for the disinfecting of dental unit water lines (<LINK REF="REF-Pankhurst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pankhurst 1998</LINK>), but may also be implicated in causing respiratory symptoms in children with asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Gent-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gent 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>It has been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-PRWeb-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRWeb 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Midentistry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Midentistry 2004</LINK>) that the application of ozone to carious dental lesions will arrest or reverse these lesions and that the use of ozone will provide an alternative to conventional drilling and filling. Theoretically using ozone to reduce the bacterial count in active carious lesions may temporarily arrest progression of caries. This may prevent or delay the need to restore the tooth surface, which would be of benefit to the public, healthcare providers and to dentists. This review assesses the effectiveness of ozone application(s) in the management of caries in vivo.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of ozone in arresting or reversing the progression of dental caries.</P>
<P>The review tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in caries progression following the application of ozone or no such application/placebo.</P>

<P>Results of all searches were screened by at least two reviewers, independently. Full copies of all studies meeting, or potentially meeting, the inclusion criteria were obtained for detailed assessment by at least two reviewers independently. Where inclusion was unclear (generally due to randomisation being uncertain) attempts were made to contact study authors. Where such information was not obtained, and the original report was in the form of a conference abstract only, the trial was excluded due to inadequate information. Such trials may be included in updates of this review if further information becomes available.</P>

<P>Two formally published studies, a large number of conference abstracts, two PhD theses and a submitted manuscript were either located during the electronic search of databases or the internet, or provided by Professor E Lynch, a Professor of Restorative Dentistry and Gerodontology of the Queen's University, Belfast, and were assessed for inclusion. It was unclear from the abstracts how many potentially relevant randomised trials were in progress, and clarification of the number of trials was not provided. It may be that some of these trials will be suitable for inclusion, but this cannot be assessed until fuller published data become available. Main reasons for exclusion of the abstracts were: intervention in extracted teeth rather than people with teeth in situ; randomisation not stated; less than 6 months data available or supplied; no relevant outcomes; no further data supplied by the authors within the time frame of this review.</P>
<P>Three studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Naba_x0027_a-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Naba'a 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Naba_x0027_a-2003pilot" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Naba'a 2003pilot</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Baysan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Baysan 2003</LINK>) and are described in the table of <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>

<BR/>Ninety participants with 258 primary occlusal pit and fissure carious lesions were included in this split-mouth study (129 received ozone, 129 did not but the numbers of ozone and no ozone lesions were not necessarily equal in each mouth). Participants were aged over 12, 88% were under 32 years of age, 39% were male. They were all attending the Restorative Department of the School of Dentistry, Queen's University, Belfast with at least two carious lesions (accessible to intervention) in their permanent dentition.</P>
<P>Included lesions were assessed and then individually randomised to either ozone therapy or no ozone groups. Lesions randomised to receive ozone had 10 seconds of ozone (2100 ppm ozone at the start of the study, falling to 630 ppm, only 30% of the full dose, by the end; this reduction in dose was not intended and it is not clear why it occurred) at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. Lesions randomised to ozone, and to no ozone were sprayed with a reductant containing fluoride and xylitol at each appointment.</P>
<P>All participants also received a toothbrush, preventive advice and fluoride containing toothpaste.</P>
<P>Caries progression and regression were measured by change in clinical severity scores, mean log(e) DIAGNOdent readings and mean log(e) ECM (electric caries meter) scores at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Patient satisfaction was also assessed.</P>

<BR/>Eight participants with 38 primary occlusal pit and fissure carious lesions were included in the study (19 lesions received ozone, 19 did not). Inclusion criteria were identical to those in <LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Naba_x0027_a-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Naba'a 2003</LINK>.</P>
<P>Included lesions were assessed and then individually randomised to either ozone therapy or no ozone. Lesions randomised to receive ozone had 40 seconds of ozone (dose unclear) at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Reductant was sprayed onto ozone and no ozone lesions (as in the main study). All participants also received a toothbrush, preventive advice and fluoride toothpaste.</P>
<P>Caries progression and regression were measured by change in clinical severity scores, mean log(e) DIAGNOdent readings, mean log(e) ECM scores and other clinical indices (surface destruction, hardness, visual index, colour of lesion, perceived treatment need, frostiness of enamel, and enamel undermining) at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months.</P>

<BR/>Seventy-nine participants with either two or four primary root carious lesions (PRCLs) were randomised to either root sealant or no root sealant in this split-mouth study. Only the participants randomised to 'no root sealant' (39 participants) are included in this review. Lesions of individuals in the 'no root sealant' group were randomised to ozone or no ozone, so one lesion received ozone and one did not, or two received ozone and two did not, within each individual. Overall, 68 PRCLs received ozone treatment, and 68 PRCLs did not.</P>
<P>The mean age of all 79 participants was 65 years (range 30 to 72), 62% were male (details were not provided separately for participants not receiving sealant) and all were attending Queen's University Belfast School of Dentistry. People with advanced periodontal disease, with active root caries, who were pregnant, had participated in another trial within the last 3 months, or had a cross infection risk were excluded. All included PRCLs were leathery (severity index two) and accessible to treatment.</P>
<P>Lesions randomised to receive ozone were cleaned with a sterile toothbrush and water, dried with sterile cotton wool and given ozone for 10 seconds. After removal of the ozone the cup was filled with reductant (containing xylitol and fluoride) for 5 seconds. Treatment was repeated at 3 and 6 months (and a further follow-up appointment with reductant but no ozone was included at 1 month) and the trial was planned to continue to 1 year. At these appointments the control lesions also received reductant, and did not receive ozone (it is unclear whether they were cleaned or dried). All participants were provided with toothpaste (1100 ppm sodium fluoride), soft toothbrushes, extensive oral hygiene and preventive dietary advice.</P>
<P>Caries progression or regression was measured by visual inspection (per cent of lesions becoming hard) and electrically by an electric caries monitor (ECM) or DIAGNOdent. Number of fillings were recorded, and pain, adverse events and satisfaction were assessed by patient questionnaire.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-12 13:28:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three trials were included with a combined total of 137 participants, with 432 lesions. The risk of bias in all studies appeared high. Changes from baseline of clinical severity index, log(e) Electric Caries Monitor and log(e) DIAGNOdent scores were provided at 6 and 12 months (or end measurements at 6 months); no consistent advantage or disadvantage of ozone on caries was seen across outcome measures in any study. Few secondary outcomes were reported, but one trial reported an absence of adverse events. There is no reliable evidence that the application of ozone gas to the surface of decayed teeth is effective in arresting or reversing the progress of dental caries. It is as yet unclear whether there is merit in this avenue of research and the reviewers would like to encourage sound research. Any future trials must be of high quality and capable of withstanding rigorous independent review.</P>
<P>The difficulties of designing studies to investigate experimental interventions for the management of dental caries are well documented (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2001</LINK>), as are the principles underlying a well designed clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Petrie-2002A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrie 2002A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Petrie-2002B" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrie 2002B</LINK>). It is important that the efficacy of experimental interventions be evaluated under conditions that are replicable by other researchers, easily generalisable to primary dental care and where threats to internal validity are known, they are reported in detail and controlled. The difficulties of caries diagnosis and monitoring (<LINK REF="REF-Kidd-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kidd 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1985</LINK>), masking (of participants, operators and assessors), pairing of lesions, appropriate placebo treatment, allocation concealment, examiner reliability, interrater reliability, attrition (loss of participants from follow up), adequate follow up and sufficient power to detect clinically important differences in outcomes all need to be addressed in future studies.</P>
<P>Many of these criteria appear essential for strong and reliable data. Our included studies did not mask participants, did state that outcome assessors were masked (but this would appear unlikely as the same individual operator provided treatment and completed outcome assessments at the same visit), did use several outcome measures but only used a single outcome assessor and did not include power calculations. For these reasons the discussed trials' results can be considered highly susceptible to bias. Therefore overall there was no reliable evidence that ozone treatment was superior to no treatment for management of pit and fissure or root caries.</P>
<P>The early carious lesion is reversible in vivo and the progress of active lesions is slow. It may take 6 years for the early enamel lesion to progress through enamel to dentine, and up to 53% of pit and fissure lesions remain unchanged or may reverse in a 21 to 41 month period (<LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1985</LINK>). Any new treatment modalities designed to arrest or reverse the carious process must be shown to be effective over the lifetime of the lesion. To be considered significant any change in caries progression should be demonstrated to be effective over a 2 to 6 year period. The discussed studies were therefore much too short to appropriately investigate if the application of ozone does or does not arrest the progression of dental caries.</P>
<P>It is known to be difficult to diagnose the presence of caries, and to assess the progress of the carious lesion objectively (<LINK REF="REF-Elderton-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elderton 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kidd-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kidd 1984</LINK>). The carious lesion occurs in a small highly mineralised structure and can occur in a variety of different sites each of which has a unique configuration and rate of spread. These difficulties make it unlikely that any one diagnostic modality will have adequate sensitivity and specificity for all sites (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2001</LINK>). Where studies are being designed to assess the effectiveness of new treatment modalities for the management of caries any measures or techniques used to assess the progress of the lesion must be demonstrated to be reliable, reproducible, sensitive and specific due to the dynamic nature of the demineralising and remineralising process within the carious lesion. In the absence of such measures any change in caries progression must be validated by several techniques and several examiners in the context of a controlled trial not in the wider population. Many of the caries diagnostic methods mentioned here are not used widely in general dental practice.</P>
<P>The reviewers have some concerns with regard to the data analyses of all three studies being conducted at the level of the lesion. This level is not independent of variables relating to the person and is therefore an inappropriate analysis which may introduce inaccuracy and bias. A more appropriate level of analysis would take the clustering of the lesions within an individual into account (for more detailed discussion <I>see </I>
<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1999</LINK>). For this reason pooling was not appropriate or attempted, and caution should be exercised interpreting what the studies report as 'significant differences' between teeth treated or not treated with ozone which may be in fact in a small number of individuals.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that the application of ozone to carious dental lesions will reverse these lesions and provide an alternative to conventional drilling and filling. Ozone may disrupt the dental bacterial plaque and arrest progression of the lesion however ozone per se will not reverse the lesion, rather it may produce an environment in which arrest of the carious lesion could occur.</P>
<P>In the presence of early carious lesions with no cavitation it has long been understood that current preventative dental treatments can be used to reverse or halt the demineralisation process, shifting the ionic exchange at the tooth surface in favour of remineralisation. Simple measures involving disruption of the dental plaque, which have been shown to be effective, include: professional prophylaxis; restriction of the bacterial substrate by modification of the diet (<LINK REF="REF-DHHS-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">DHHS 1999</LINK>); the use of sugar free chewing gum (<LINK REF="REF-Machiulskiene-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Machiulskiene 1999</LINK>); and use of fluoride toothpaste (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>). The use of self applied fluoride supplements has been shown to be effective at reducing caries in high risk children who are compliant (<LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1999</LINK>), as have self applied fluoride rinses in high risk children, adolescents, adults and the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>). The application of professionally applied fluoride varnishes and gels has been shown beneficial in high risk children, adolescents and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002A" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002A</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002B" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002B</LINK>). Therefore, on the basis of the research currently available, the application of ozone conveys no additional benefit to the preventative treatments outlined above. Additionally where cavitation has already occurred conventional treatment will be still be required to facilitate effect plaque removal .</P>
<P>The reviewers found significant failings in reporting in this review's three studies. Firstly no quantification of ozone output from the HealOzone unit was reported (and appears in one of the included studies to have failed). Secondly only passing mention was made of the content of the 'reductant', a solution applied after ozone treatment to the carious tooth surface by the single operator in both the treatment and control groups (in many of the studies). On clarification from the manufacturers, KaVo, reductant was identified as a 2% solution of sodium fluoride and 5% xylitol. Given the evidence above the reporting of the use of the reductant lacked detail particularly in the control groups. The reviewers felt it would be far more enlightening to compare the use of ozone/placebo in masked groups with/without fluoride reductant in a well designed and conducted trial minimising bias to elucidate the efficacy of ozone gas application as a treatment for dental caries. Additionally the interaction between ozone and topical fluoride is unknown and needs to be investigated. It was felt a very detailed level of reporting would be helpful to determine the role of the reductant solution, pre or post treatment oral hygiene instruction and the use and application of fluoride containing dentifrice at home on the outcomes measured.</P>
<P>The application of topical fluoride is cheap, simple and effective. The clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and ease of application of ozone need to be elucidated and may by comparison be much more expensive. Abu Naba'a (<LINK REF="STD-Abu_x002d_Naba_x0027_a-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abu-Naba'a 2003</LINK>) suggests that the application of ozone is most effective following three applications in 3 months, that with less frequent application it becomes less effective and that poor compliance in terms of attendance reduces effectiveness. If this is shown to be the case, the acceptability to patients of such frequent attendance, and the cost implications, need to be investigated. A recent paper (<LINK REF="STD-Holmes-2003E" TYPE="STUDY">Holmes 2003E</LINK>) suggested that a single tooth ozone treatment should be costed at £68 in the UK (equivalent to 122 US dollars or 101 Euros), and a full mouth ozone treatment at UK £245 (equivalent to US$438 or 365 Euros). This will put this treatment modality out of reach of a substantial percentage of the population at risk including those in high risk groups, such as the socially deprived.</P>
<P>The clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of ozone application is unknown. It is not known what the optimal concentration of ozone might be, how long it should be applied for, how long any effects might last, how deep into the lesion it might penetrate, or whether ozone has any other effects. Further research is needed to answer these questions, but it must be of adequate quality to provide good evidence. Presently there is no good evidence that the application of ozone gas to the surface of decayed teeth is effective in arresting or reversing the progression of dental caries, and ozone should not be considered an alternative to current methods for the management and treatment of dental caries.</P>
<P>The reviewers felt it would have been more appropriate to compare anxiety levels with preventive dental procedures such as topical fluoride application, fissure sealing or placement of preventive resin restorations within a study. The comparison with more invasive restorative procedures such as injection and drilling is irrelevant.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">In summary</HEADING>
<P>Overall this systematic review of all relevant randomised controlled trials found no good evidence that ozone treatment was superior to no treatment for management of pit and fissure or root caries. Across the results of the three trials included in this review there is no consistent pattern of efficacy of ozone. There is no good evidence that the application of ozone gas to the surface of decayed teeth is effective in arresting or reversing the progression of dental caries. The available studies investigating the effectiveness of ozone in management of dental decay appear to be at high risk of bias. There is no evidence to disprove the null hypothesis that there is no difference in caries progression following the application of ozone. There is a fundamental need for more evidence of appropriate rigour and quality before the use of ozone can be accepted into mainstream primary dental care or can be considered a viable alternative to current methods for the management and treatment of dental caries.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>There is no good evidence that ozone application is effective in arresting or reversing the progression of dental caries. </LI>
<LI>There is no good evidence to support the use of ozone in a primary care setting. </LI>
<LI>Evidence of appropriate rigour and quality must become available before ozone can be widely accepted. Ozone therapy should not gain acceptance nor be used in general practice unless valid evidence of its clinical effectiveness and (ideally) cost effectiveness becomes available.</LI>
<LI>Dental care providers or users of dental services should not advocate the use of ozone gas on the sole basis of high patient acceptability or desirability as compared to less attractive conventional dental injection local anaesthesia, filling and drilling.</LI>
<LI>This group of reviewers wish to encourage an evidence-based approach to the management of dental caries particularly in the primary care setting of general dental practice despite the barriers to its use such as lack of available clinical time and financial constraints (<LINK REF="REF-Iqbal-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iqbal 2002</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There are currently no peer reviewed trials or papers published in journals of repute on the efficacy of the use of ozone in dentistry. There appear to be several longitudinal RCTs in progress but their quality is unknown at the time of this review. A substantive update of this review will be carried out when a body of published peer reviewed data becomes available. </P>
<P>There is a need for well-conducted, valid studies to assess the effectiveness of ozone in the management of dental caries. The following issues will need to be addressed in future trials of ozone for caries management:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New treatments designed to arrest or reverse the carious process must ideally be shown to be effective over the lifetime of the lesion. To be considered significant any change in caries progression should be demonstrated to be effective over at least a 2 to 6 year period.</LI>
<LI>The development and use of a standard set of valid criteria for the diagnosis and the assessment of progression of early carious lesions would be desirable. Where studies are being designed to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for the management of caries any measures or techniques used to assess the progress of the lesion must be demonstrated to be reliable, reproducible, sensitive and specific. In the absence of such measures any change in caries progression must be validated by several techniques and several examiners (<LINK REF="REF-Bader-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bader 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Streiner-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Streiner 1990</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Use of sample size calculations, to ensure that studies are adequately powered to show clinically relevant effects if they exist, should be encouraged.</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment should be adequate (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Lesions should be randomised so that equal numbers of intervention and placebo lesions exist in each mouth, and analyses should provide outcome data per person rather than per tooth (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1999</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Robust masking of participants (using an appropriate placebo treatment), operators and outcome assessors is essential (<LINK REF="REF-Everitt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Everitt 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fyffe-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fyffe 2000</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Assessment of examiner reliability and interrater reliability, with the use of several masked assessors, is necessary in high quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Tranaeus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tranaeus 2002</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Better reporting of adverse events, for example asthma incidents, is required.</LI>
<LI>The availability of new funding in the primary care setting may in future need to be linked to quality assurance in research design. </LI>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Study type: RCT, lesions individually randomised to either ozone therapy or no ozone groups according to computer generated random sampling digit tables (exact method unclear). Teeth were allocated to 'ozone' and to 'no ozone' in every mouth, though not always in equal numbers. In some participants teeth were also allocated to 'ozone plus sealant' or 'no ozone plus sealant' (results in these teeth are not reported in this systematic review).<BR/>Allocation concealment: stated as concealed but appears to use an open random number table.<BR/>Masking of patient and/or parent: not done, no placebo ozone treatment was given.<BR/>Masking of outcome assessors: unclear. While the authors state that outcome assessment was masked it is unclear how effective this was, given that the assessor was also the operator at the same visit.<BR/>Interrater reliability: not done, single operator/ assessor.<BR/>Groups comparable at baseline: no, differences exist in clinical severity scores at baseline (50% scored 1 in the ozone group, 62% in the no ozone group).<BR/>Drop outs: 58 of 90 participants attended all visits, one subject missed all visits after the initial visit (and was excluded from the study). 25 participants missed one visit, four missed two and two missed three visits.<BR/>ITT: no (those without readings at a visit were excluded from analysis).<BR/>Other treatments equivalent: yes.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion criteria: attending School of Dentistry, Queen's University, Belfast. Male or female aged over 12 years, with at least two primary pit or fissure lesions (without cavitation) in permanent posterior teeth accessible to diagnostic procedures (ECM and DIAGNOdent). Clinical severity scores were 1 to 3 and DIAGNOdent readings = 10. Participants were considered reliable attenders and available for the duration of the study.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: where participants had an odd number of lesions suitable for inclusion the lesion with the lowest DIAGNOdent reading was excluded from randomisation. Participants were excluded for the presence of advanced periodontal disease, participation in another study in past month or any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation by the subject (e.g. cross infection risk).<BR/>Randomised: 90 participants, 258 lesions (129 in the ozone group, 129 in the no ozone group), 61% female.<BR/>Mean age: not stated. Most were teenagers and young adults. Five subjects were aged 12 to 15, 74 were aged 15 to 31, 11 were older than 31 years.<BR/>Baseline level of caries: clinical severity averaged 1.6 in the ozone treated lesions, 1.4 in the no ozone lesions. ECM scores averaged 11.6 in the ozone treated lesions, 15.2 in the no ozone lesions. Participants had 2 to 14 included lesions, often with numerous filled teeth and some decayed beyond the inclusion criteria.<BR/>Caries risk assessment: not stated.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Intervention lesions: at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months the lesions were disclosed, cleaned with an air abrasion system (PROPHYflex), outcomes assessed, ozone applied for 10 seconds, then reductant sprayed on. At the 12 month final visit no ozone was applied.<BR/>Control lesions: at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months the lesions were disclosed, cleaned with an air abrasion system (PROPHYflex), outcomes assessed, then reductant sprayed on.<BR/>All participants: extensive oral hygiene and dietary advice was provided, a toothbrush and toothpaste (1,100 ppm fluoride) were provided at each appointment.<BR/>Operator: single operator/assessor (Layla Abu-Naba'a).</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Caries progression or regression measured by clinical severity index, ECM, and DIAGNOdent. Anxiety assessed. </P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Reductant (containing xylitol at = 5% by weight and fluoride at 1100 ppm, as well as other compounds) was used for each lesion at each visit (0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months). <BR/>This study also randomised lesions in some participants to receive the interventions above plus a sealant, these lesions have been excluded from the current analysis.<BR/>The authors stated in correspondence that blinded outcome assessment occurred, however a single operator was responsible for both outcome assessment and ozone delivery to appropriate lesions at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months.<BR/>The actual level of ozone delivered was correct at the start of this study, but very much lower than expected at the end. It is unclear how many full strength doses were actually delivered.<BR/>

<P>Intervention lesions: at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months the lesions were cleaned, outcomes assessed, ozone applied for 40 seconds, then reductant sprayed on. <BR/>Control lesions: at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months the lesions were cleaned, outcomes assessed, then reductant sprayed on.<BR/>All participants: preventive advice was provided, as were a toothbrush and toothpaste (1100 ppm fluoride).<BR/>Operator: single operator/assessor (Layla Abu-Naba'a).<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Caries progression or regression measured by clinical severity index, ECM, DIAGNOdent and other clinical indices (surface destruction, hardness, visual index, colour of lesion, perceived treatment need, frostiness of enamel, enamel undermining). Anxiety assessed, but not as part of the randomised trial.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Reductant (containing xylitol at = 5% by weight and fluoride at 1100 ppm, as well as other compounds) was used for each lesion at each visit. <BR/>The authors stated in correspondence that blinded outcome assessment occurred, however a single operator was responsible for both outcome assessment and ozone delivery to appropriate lesions at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months. <BR/>The actual level of ozone delivered was unclear (see notes under main study).<BR/>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Study type: RCT, sequence generated by statistitian at Queen's University, 2 or 4 primary root carious lesions randomised, with equal numbers to intervention and control, in each mouth.<BR/>Allocation concealment: stated as concealed by author (however sequence presented in thesis as an open list).<BR/>Masking of patient and/or parent: not done.<BR/>Masking of outcome assessors: unclear. While the authors state that outcome assessment was masked it is unclear how effective this was, given that the assessor was also the operator at the same visit.<BR/>Interrater reliability: not done (single operator).<BR/>Groups comparable at baseline: unclear.<BR/>Drop outs: 4 people dropped out by 3 months, unclear how many lesions this represents, or number of drop outs at 6 months.<BR/>ITT analysis: unclear.<BR/>Other treatment equivalent: unclear. The submitted paper suggests that the teeth receiving ozone were cleaned before ozone and the reductant were applied, but the teeth not receiving ozone were not cleaned before the reductant was applied. However, the PhD implies that in control group the teeth were cleaned before caries measurements were taken, and so were cleaned before the reductant was applied.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Inclusion criteria: male and female at least 18 years old, with leathery root carious lesions (severity index 2) on at least two surfaces and accessible for diagnostic procedure (electronic caries meter and Diagnodent). <BR/>Exclusion criteria: participants with advanced periodontal disease, who had participated in another dental study in past 3 months, were pregnant or had any condition precluding participation (e.g. cross infection risk).<BR/>Randomised: 39 participants, 68 teeth in intervention, 68 in control group, each participant had equal numbers of intervention and control lesions (2 or 4 in total).<BR/>Mean age: unclear.<BR/>Baseline level of caries: not stated.<BR/>Caries risk assessment: not stated.<BR/>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-12 13:10:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intervention lesions: at initial visit tooth surface cleaned with sterile toothbrush and water, dried, ozone applied for 10 seconds into cup, suction applied for 10 seconds, reductant applied for 5 seconds. Repeated at 1 month (with no ozone), 3 months and 6 months (both with ozone for 10 seconds).<BR/>Control lesions: at initial visit no ozone (or placebo) applied, and no cleaning occurred, but reductant applied for 5 seconds. Repeated at 1, 3 and 6 months.<BR/>All participants: standard dentifrice (1100 ppm sodium fluoride) and soft toothbrushes were provided to all participants during the study.<BR/>Duration of follow up: 12 months stated intent, but results found for 6 months maximum.<BR/>Operator: Aylin Baysan, single operator.<BR/>
</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Caries progression or regression ('% lesions becoming hard', Electric Caries Meter and DIAGNOdent readings). It was stated that further dental interventions, pain, patient satisfaction and adverse events were recorded, but these have not been reported at 6 months or later.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Reductant (containing xylitol at = 5% by weight and fluoride at 1100 ppm, as well as other compounds) was used at each visit (0, 1, 3 and 6 months). <BR/>Protocol states that if participants present with discomfort the primary root carious lesions would be immediately treated by drilling and filling. <BR/>The same study also randomised participants to receive the interventions above plus a sealant, these participants have been excluded from the current analysis.<BR/>Study included as authors stated in correspondence that blinded outcome assessment occurred, however a single operator was responsible for outcome assessment and ozone delivery to appropriate lesions at 0, 3 and 6 months.<BR/>
