<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:57:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="PRIYA MADHUVRATA">
<P>Many adults have symptoms of overactive bladder. A person with overactive bladder syndrome feels a very strong urge to pass urine and they may not make it to the toilet before they leak urine. Other common problems are a feeling of needing to urinate often during the day or night, or both. This problem seems to be caused by an overactive bladder muscle, and it becomes more common with ageing. Treatments are conservative measures, such as bladder training or drugs. Anticholinergic drugs can reduce the overactivity of the bladder muscle and the feeling of urgency. The review found that there are several anticholinergic drugs prescribed for adults with overactive bladder symptoms. The two most studied drugs are oxybutynin and tolterodine. These two drugs have similar effects but, on average, those taking oxybutynin were more likely to withdraw from the studies because of adverse effects, mainly dry mouth. However, both drugs can give dry mouth and this problem is less likely if an extended release formulation of either drug is used. Two newer drugs are solifenacin and fesoterodine. Solifenacin has a better effect and less risk of dry mouth compared to tolterodine. Fesoterodine has a better effect than extended release tolterodine but withdrawal from studies due to adverse effects and dry mouth was more likely.</P>

<P>Around 16% to 45% of adults have overactive bladder symptoms, urgency with frequency or urgency urinary incontinence, or both, termed 'overactive bladder syndrome'. Anticholinergic drugs are common treatments.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:54:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="PRIYA MADHUVRATA">
<P>Two authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:56:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighty-six trials, 70 parallel and 16 cross-over design, were included (involving 31,249 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind but were variable in other aspects of quality. Cross-over studies did not present data in a way that could be included in the meta-analyses. Twenty-nine collected quality of life data (the primary outcome measure) using validated measures, but only 15 reported useable data.</P>
<P>Tolterodine versus oxybutynin: there were no statistically significant differences for quality of life, patient reported cure or improvement, leakage episodes or voids in 24 hours, but fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with tolterodine (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.66, data from eight trials) and less risk of dry mouth (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71, data from 10 trials).</P>
<P>Solifenacin versus tolterodine: there were statistically significant differences for quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.01, data from three trials), patient reported cure or improvement (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.39, data from two trials), leakage episodes in 24 hours (weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.08, data from four studies) and urgency episodes in 24 hours (WMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.13, data from four trials), all favouring solifenacin. There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events and dry mouth but after sensitivity analysis dry mouth rates (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.94) were statistically significantly lower with solifenacin when compared to immediate release (IR) tolterodine.</P>
<P>Fesoterodine versus extended release tolterodine: three trials contributed to the meta analyses. There were statistically significant differences for quality of life (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.14), patient reported cure or improvement (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.16), leakage episodes (WMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.09), frequency (WMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.06) and urgency episodes (WMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.16) in 24 hours, all favouring fesoterodine. Those taking fesoterodine had a higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.98) and higher risk of dry mouth (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.05) at 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Different doses of tolterodine: the standard recommended starting dose (2 mg twice daily) was compared with two lower doses (0.5 mg and 1 mg twice daily) and one higher dose (4 mg twice daily). The effects of 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses were similar for leakage episodes and micturitions in 24 hours, with a greater risk of dry mouth with the 2 and 4 mg doses at two to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Different doses of solifenacin: the standard recommended starting dose of 5 mg once daily was compared to 10 mg. While frequency and urgency were less (better) with 10 mg compared to 5 mg, there was a higher risk of dry mouth with 10 mg solifenacin at four to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Different doses of fesoterodine:the recommended starting dose of 4 mg once daily was compared to 8 mg and 12 mg. The clinical efficacy (patient reported cure, leakage episodes, micturition per 24 hours) of 8 mg was better than 4 mg fesoterodine but with a higher risk of dry mouth with the 8 mg dose.There was no statistically significant difference between 4 mg and 12 mg in efficacy but the dry mouth was significantly higher with 12 mg at eight to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Extended versus immediate release preparations of oxybutynin or tolterodine, or both: there were no statistically significant differences for cure or improvement, leakage episodes or micturitions in 24 hours or withdrawals due to adverse events, but there were few data. Overall, extended release preparations had less risk of dry mouth at two to 12 weeks.</P>
<P>One extended release preparation versus another: there was less risk of dry mouth with oral extended release tolterodine than oxybutynin (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95) but no difference between transdermal oxybutynin and oral extended release tolterodine, although some people withdrew due to a skin reaction at the transdermal patch site at 12 weeks.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:56:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where the prescribing choice is between oral immediate release oxybutynin or tolterodine, tolterodine might be preferred for reduced risk of dry mouth. With tolterodine, 2 mg twice daily is the usual starting dose but a 1 mg twice daily dose might be equally effective, with less risk of dry mouth. If extended release preparations of oxybutynin or tolterodine are available, these might be preferred to immediate release preparations because there is less risk of dry mouth.</P>
<P>Between solifenacin and immediate release tolterodine, solifenacin might be preferred for better efficacy and less risk of dry mouth. Solifenacin 5 mg once daily is the usual starting dose, which could be increased to 10 mg once daily for better efficacy but with increased risk of dry mouth.</P>
<P>Between fesoterodine and extended release tolterodine, fesoterodine might be preferred for superior efficacy but has a higher risk of withdrawal due to adverse events and higher risk of dry mouth.There is little or no evidence available about quality of life, costs, or long-term outcomes in these studies. There were insufficient data from trials of other anticholinergic drugs to draw any conclusions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-06 15:33:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:58:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>People with overactive bladder syndrome report urgency (with or without urgency urinary incontinence), usually in combination with frequency or nocturia, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). Overactive bladder syndrome may also be called urge syndrome or urgency-frequency syndrome.</P>
<P>Urgency is the sudden and compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). Sometimes there is involuntary leakage of urine with the feeling of urgency and this is called urgency urinary incontinence. Urgency and urgency urinary incontinence usually result from an involuntary increase in bladder pressure due to detrusor (bladder smooth muscle) over-activity. If further investigation of urgency and urge incontinence with urodynamics demonstrates spontaneous or provoked detrusor muscle contraction in the filling phase of the test then detrusor overactivity is diagnosed. If there is no defined cause for the overactivity this is called idiopathic detrusor overactivity, but if there is a relevant neurological condition then the term neurogenic detrusor overactivity (previously detrusor hyperreflexia) is used.</P>
<P>Frequency is the complaint of needing to void too often during the day, while nocturia is waking once or more times per night to void (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2002</LINK>). In clinical practice, a person who voids more than eight times during the day would be considered to have daytime frequency; waking from sleep more than once at night to void would be considered nocturia.</P>
<P>Overactive bladder symptoms are very common in community dwelling adults, with large studies showing prevalences of 12% in Japan (<LINK REF="REF-Homma-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homma 2005</LINK>); 15% in Hong Kong Chinese (<LINK REF="REF-Brieger-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brieger 1996</LINK>); 17% in Europe (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>), Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Corcos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corcos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herschorn-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herschorn 2008</LINK>) and the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>); 13% to 31% in Korea (<LINK REF="REF-Choo-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Choo-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choo 2007</LINK>) and 45% in Asian men (<LINK REF="REF-Moothy-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moothy 2001</LINK>). These studies reported that the prevalence in adult males varied from 10% to 17% and in females it varied from 10% to 31%. The Asian studies may have overestimated prevalence, because people whose only symptom was frequency were counted as 'cases' of overactive bladder. Different definitions and different age groups studied may be the reason for differences in prevalence.</P>
<P>Several large population studies have reported that the prevalence of overactive bladder symptoms increases with age in men and women (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corcos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corcos 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Homma-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homma 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Irwin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwin 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moller 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 2000</LINK>). Although the diagnosis of overactive bladder excludes people with known causes of detrusor overactivity, for example neurological disorders, this combination of symptoms is nevertheless common in such groups. In fact, urinary dysfunction appears to be more common in the neurologically impaired than unimpaired population; the most frequently reported problems are urgency or frequency, or both (<LINK REF="REF-Hennessey-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennessey 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>It seems that frequency and urgency might be just as bothersome as actual leakage (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>), and overall the effects of overactive bladder symptoms on quality of life are marked (<LINK REF="REF-Coyne-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coyne 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Liberman-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liberman 2001</LINK>). It also seems clear that many of the people affected by overactive bladder symptoms do not seek help from healthcare professionals (<LINK REF="REF-Milsom-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milsom 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ueda-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ueda 2000</LINK>) because symptoms and bother do not necessarily go hand-in-hand and patients who are not bothered may need no treatment.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 11:59:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two main treatment options for overactive bladder syndrome are bladder training and pharmacotherapy, that is drugs. A separate Cochrane review on bladder training (<LINK REF="REF-Wallace-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wallace 2004</LINK>) is available, and the scope of the current review is confined to drug treatment.</P>
<P>While the pathophysiology of the overactive bladder remains to be fully elucidated, the two most widely accepted explanations are the myogenic and neurogenic theories, which are not mutually exclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Hashim-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hashim 2004</LINK>). In the first, partial denervation of the detrusor muscle is thought to increase excitability. Changes in central nervous system pathways that inhibit bladder activity and over-sensitivity of the sensory nerve endings in the bladder are the basis of the second. In both theories, the outcome is overactivity of the detrusor muscle. The motor nerve supply to the bladder is via the parasympathetic nervous system (via sacral nerves S2, 3, 4) (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ouslander-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ouslander 1986</LINK>), which affects detrusor muscle contraction. This is mediated by acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors at the level of the bladder. There are currently five recognised subtypes of muscarinic receptor; the M<SUB>1</SUB>, M<SUB>2</SUB> and M<SUB>3</SUB> subtypes are of interest in bladder activity. Muscarinic receptors are found in other parts of the body too, for example in the gut, salivary glands, tear ducts, brain and heart. Pharmacotherapy relies on the use of drugs with anticholinergic properties. The rationale for using anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome is to block the parasympathetic acetylcholine pathway and thus abolish or reduce the intensity of detrusor muscle contraction. Unfortunately no anticholinergic drug available to date is specific to the muscarinic receptors in the bladder and, as a result, the drugs can cause side effects by acting in other parts of the body too, for example dry mouth or eyes, constipation or nausea. For the purpose of this review the term 'anticholinergic medications' will refer to both pure antimuscarinic drugs and antimuscarinic drugs with mixed actions that are given specifically for bladder symptoms. Drugs with mixed actions will be included where their clinical effect is thought to be antimuscarinic rather than via a direct action on bladder muscle. Medications with secondary anticholinergic effects, for example tricyclic antidepressants will be excluded.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-01-06 15:33:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The number of anticholinergic drugs available on the market is increasing and various studies, both observational and randomised controlled trials, have evaluated their effectiveness. A previous Cochrane review compared anticholinergic drugs with no treatment or placebo treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>). The use of anticholinergic drugs by people with overactive bladder syndrome results in statistically significant improvements in symptoms associated with a modest improvement in quality of life. Dry mouth is a common side effect of therapy but does not seem to have an effect on the numbers of withdrawals.</P>
<P>Anticholinergics are commonly used in primary and secondary care settings for the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, and this has considerable resource implications (<LINK REF="REF-Kobelt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kobelt 1997</LINK>). If anticholinergic therapy is prescribed, there is still uncertainty about which anticholinergic drugs are most effective, at what dose, and by which route of administration. There is also uncertainty about the role of anticholinergic drugs in different patient groups (for example the elderly, men and women).</P>
<P>There are many studies of the effects of anticholinergic drugs. Four Cochrane reviews consider them. The present review compares anticholinergic drugs with each other to see whether different anticholinergic drugs have different effects. Previous reviews compared:</P>
<P>1) anticholinergic drugs with no treatment or placebo treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>);</P>
<P>2) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other active (non-drug) therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2006</LINK> ); and</P>

<P>Six previous systematic reviews of anticholinergic drugs for urgency urinary incontinence were found (<LINK REF="REF-Chapple-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapple 2008a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haeusler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haeusler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonagh-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonagh 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Novara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novara 2008</LINK>). Haeusler et al<I> (</I>
<LINK REF="REF-Haeusler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haeusler 2002</LINK>) included only placebo controlled trials, and no comparisons of anticholinergic drugs. Harvey et al (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2001</LINK>) included trials that compared tolterodine and oxybutynin; the review, using Cochrane methods, is now outdated because other relevant trials have since been published. In addition, Harvey et al (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2001</LINK>) did not include all possible anticholinergic drug comparisons. Chapple et al (<LINK REF="REF-Chapple-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chapple 2008a</LINK>) included placebo controlled trials, trials using different anticholinergics and different doses of anticholinergics. They concluded that anticholinergics were safe, efficacious and well tolerated with an improvement in quality of life. Novara et al (<LINK REF="REF-Novara-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Novara 2008</LINK>) included trials comparing different doses, formulations and routes of administration of anticholinergics. They concluded that extended release (ER) formulations should be preferred to immediate release (IR) ones. With regard to IR formulations, dose escalation might yield some improvement in efficacy with a significant increase in adverse events. A systematic review of the effects of antimuscarinics on health related quality of life in overactive bladder showed no significant differences among antimuscarinic agents (<LINK REF="REF-Khullar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khullar 2006</LINK>). A network meta-analysis of adverse events of antimuscarinics showed most currently used antimuscarinics to be an equivalent first choice to start the treatment of overactive bladder, except oral oxybutynin dosage of &#8805; 10 mg/day, which may have unfavourable adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2011</LINK>). Since the publication of the above systematic reviews more trials have been published for fesoterodine, and trials on a new anticholinergic called imedafenacin have been reported.</P>
<P>Therefore, there is clearly a need for a regularly updated and comprehensive systematic review of the effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs versus each other in the management of adults with overactive bladder syndrome.</P>

<P>All adult men and women with a symptomatic diagnosis of overactive bladder syndrome with or without a urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor overactivity. Although people with neurological disorders cannot, by definition, have overactive bladder syndrome, they often experience overactive bladder symptoms secondary to their neurologic disease and are offered anticholinergic drugs. Therefore, trials that recruited people with neurologic disorders complaining of overactive bladder symptoms or with a diagnosis of neurogenic detrusor overactivity, or both, were included.</P>

<P>One arm of the study was allocated an anticholinergic drug and at least one other arm used a different anticholinergic drug, an anticholinergic drug given via a different route, or a different dose of the same anticholinergic drug. To be included the drug had to be an anticholinergic, muscarinic antagonist and be given for the purpose of decreasing symptoms of overactive bladder. Trials of the following drugs were considered: emepronium bromide or carrageenate, intravesical atropine, darifenacin, dicyclomine chloride, oxybutynin, propantheline bromide, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium chloride, fesoterodine and imedafenacin. Terodoline, an anticholinergic drug previously used in the treatment of overactive bladder, was excluded because it was withdrawn from the market.</P>
<P>Other drugs with less direct anticholinergic effects were excluded, for example smooth muscle relaxants (flavoxate hydrochloride, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel openers, beta-adrenoceptor agonists, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors) and tricyclic antidepressants.</P>

For the one dose studies the washout period was one week. Seven of the 16 studies had no washout period. Four washout periods were of one week and the other two weeks. Given the short half life of the drugs used a washout period may not be important. Seven of the studies had two arms, three had three arms, three had four arms and three had six arms. Some arms were the same drug at different doses. Some studies had different combinations of drugs so that they, for example, tested four drugs in a three arm study (<LINK REF="STD-Kramer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Kramer 1987</LINK>) and some had even more complicated arrangements with different doses (<LINK REF="STD-Massey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1986</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Overall there was a lack of consistency in the choice of outcome measures by trialists and a lack of consistency in the way data were reported. Sixteen trials reported outcomes of interest but no useable data were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Bagger-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Bagger 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burton-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Burton 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-But-2010" TYPE="STUDY">But 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chaliha-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Chaliha 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Stasi-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Di Stasi 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Di-Stasi-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Di Stasi 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Massey-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Massey 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osca-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Osca 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Salvatore-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Salvatore 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stohrer-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Stohrer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wehnert-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Wehnert 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeegers-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Zeegers 1987</LINK>). Due to deficiencies in data reporting (for example point estimates without measures of variation) many trials contributed little or no data to the review. The lack of similarity in measures limited the possibilities for combining data from individual trials.</P>
<P>The primary outcome of interest in the review was quality of life (Qol). Validated incontinence specific quality of life measures were reported by 29 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Barkin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barkin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-But-2010" TYPE="STUDY">But 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2004c" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2004c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapple-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Chapple 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Choo 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davila-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Davila 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fader-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Fader 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herschorn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Herschorn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herschorn-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Herschorn 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homma-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Homma 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Junemann-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Junemann 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaplan-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kaplan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leung--2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leung 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Minassian-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Minassian 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nitti-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Nitti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nitti-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Nitti 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VanKerrebroeck-2001" TYPE="STUDY">VanKerrebroeck 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamaguchi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Yamaguchi 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yamanishi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yamanishi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zellner-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zellner 2007</LINK>) of which only 15 reported useable data. The Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) were used by five trials of which two did not report useable data. The King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) was used by 17 trials but no useable data were reported by 11 trials (see results). The Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) was used by one trial. Two trials used the Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Two trials used both OAB-q and PPBC of which one reported no useable data. One trial used the Contilife questionnaire. One trial mentioned that quality of life (Qol) data were collected using a validated questionnaire but did not report the questionnaire used or the data. Therefore, the authors chose the patient's perception of cure or improvement as an alternative primary outcome. About a third of trials appeared to collect data on the patients' perceptions of symptomatic cure or improvement but fewer reported these findings.</P>
<P>About half the studies used micturition diaries to record number of leakage episodes, number of micturitions and urgency episodes over varying lengths of time. In order to combine these data in the pooled analysis the numbers of leakage episodes, micturitions and urgency episodes in 24 hours were calculated.</P>
<P>A wide range of urodynamic measures were reported. In view of the lack of correlation between urodynamic measures and clinical outcome the formal comparisons were limited to maximum cystometric capacity, volume at first contraction and residual volume. These were measures that trialists most consistently reported, which suggests that researchers and clinicians have thought these data were important in making judgements about the effects of the drugs on overactive bladder. Some authors reported post-treatment urodynamic measures and others reported changes in urodynamic measures, so both are included in the formal comparisons. Dry mouth was the adverse event reported by the largest number of studies. No trial included socioeconomic data.</P>

<P>There was no statistically significant difference between the groups for dry mouth (<LINK REF="CMP-012.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.11</LINK>). Visual inspection of the data suggested clinical heterogeneity. Diokno et al (<LINK REF="STD-Diokno-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Diokno 2003</LINK>)<I> </I>found statistically significantly fewer reports of dry mouth with oral ER tolterodine than with oral ER oxybutynin. Dmochowski et al (<LINK REF="STD-Dmochowski-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Dmochowski 2003</LINK>) did not find a difference in risk of dry mouth between oral ER tolterodine and transdermal ER oxybutynin but there were fewer reports of dry mouth with transdermal delivery. It is possible that there were differences in dry mouth depending on the method of delivery.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review is the one of a series of reviews of anticholinergic drug therapy for overactive bladder symptoms and it should be viewed in that context. The first anticholinergic review considered whether anticholinergic drugs were better than placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>). Two further reviews considered 1) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other active (non-drug) therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Alhasso-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alhasso 2006</LINK>); and 2) whether anticholinergic drugs are better than other drug treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Roxburgh-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roxburgh 2007</LINK>). Anticholinergics for nocturia is considered in another review: 'Drugs for nocturia in adults' (<LINK REF="REF-Cannon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cannon 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>A previous review found that administration of anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms resulted in a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo, although the clinical importance of the difference was less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Nabi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nabi 2006</LINK>). However, the use of anticholinergic medications for the relief of overactive bladder symptoms is widespread, so the question of which anticholinergic drug is better is of clinical interest. The three questions addressed by the review are which drug is better, what dose is most effective, and which method of delivery is best?</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:31:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Considering this review as a whole, it seemed that oxybutynin and tolterodine demonstrated similar efficacy but those people taking tolterodine had less risk of withdrawal due to adverse events and less risk of dry mouth. However, the risk of dry mouth was not always less with tolterodine because this also depended on the method of drug delivery. There was less risk of dry mouth with extended release (ER) preparations regardless of which drugs were being compared. There was some evidence that, for clinical outcomes (leakage and micturition data), the effects of 1 mg versus 2 mg and 2 mg versus 4 mg oral immediate release (IR) tolterodine twice daily were similar, but confidence intervals were wide. However, there was less risk of dry mouth with 1 mg.</P>
<P>Solifenacin 5 mg demonstrated superior efficacy (quality of life, patient reported outcome, leakage and urgency of micturition in 24 hrs) when compared to IR tolterodine. There were statistically significantly fewer people reporting dry mouth with solifenacin 5mg compared to IR tolterodine. Solifenacin 5 mg also demonstrated superior efficacy when compared to ER tolterodine but the risk of dry mouth was less with ER tolterodine, with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events.The clinical efficacy (frequency and urgency) of solifenacin was better with 10 mg compared to 5 mg, but with a higher risk of dry mouth with the higher dose.</P>
<P>Fesoterodine 8 mg also demonstrated superior efficacy in quality of life, patient reported cure or improvement, leakage episodes and frequency and urgency episodes per 24 hours compared to ER tolterodine 4 mg, but those taking fesoterodine had a higher risk of withdrawals due to adverse events and higher risk of dry mouth. There was no difference in the efficacy and reporting of dry mouth when 4 mg fesoterodine was compared to ER tolterodine 4 mg. The clinical efficacy (patient reported cure, leakage episodes, micturition per 24 hrs) of 8 mg was better than 4 mg fesoterodine but with a higher risk of dry mouth with the higher dose.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">One anticholinergic versus another</HEADING>
<P>Direct comparisons of tolterodine and oxybutynin suggested that the two drugs have similar effects on leakage episodes and micturitions in 24 hours. Quality of life data, and data on patients' perceptions of cure or improvement, were similar. It seemed dry mouth was a common side effect of oral IR preparations of tolterodine and oxybutynin, with dry mouth more common in those taking oxybutynin. Those receiving tolterodine were between 34% and 60% less likely to withdraw with adverse events and between 29% and 40% less likely to experience dry mouth. The one trial that suggested less dry mouth in those taking oxybutynin compared oral ER tolterodine and transdermal ER oxybutynin.</P>
<P>Direct comparisons of tolterodine and solifenacin suggested that solifenacin was better in decreasing micturition and urgency in 24 hours. Quality of life and patient perception of cure or improvement were better with solifenacin (58%) than tolterodine (46%). Those receiving solifenacin were between 6% and 49% less likely to experience dry mouth after sensitivity analysis compared to IR tolterodine but the withdrawals due to adverse events were similar. Soilfenacin showed superior efficacy when compared to ER tolterodine. However, those receiving ER tolterodine were between 3% and 44% less likely to experience dry mouth with no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events.</P>
<P>Direct comparisons of fesoterodine and tolterodine ER 4 mg showed that fesoterodine 8 mg was better in decreasing leakage episodes and micturition and urgency episodes per 24 hours. Both the quality of life and patient reported outcome (fesoterodine 74% cured versus tolterodine 66%) were better with fesoterodine. However, those receiving ER tolterodine were between 6% and 51% less likely to withdraw due to adverse events and between 43% and 59% less likely to experience dry mouth compared to fesoterodine.</P>
<P>There were insufficient trials and data to reach any conclusions about the relative efficacy of trospium versus oxybutynin, propantheline versus oxybutynin, propiverine versus oxybutynin, darifenacin versus oxybutynin, solifenacin versus oxybutynin, trospium versus tolterodine, propiverine versus tolterodine, solifenacin versus propiverine and imedafenacin versus propiverine.</P>
<P>A comparison that might benefit from further research is trospium versus oxybutynin or tolterodine (because trospium is a quaternary amine and oxybutynin and tolterodine are tertiary amines).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different doses of tolterodine</HEADING>
<P>Doses that were higher or lower than the standard therapeutic dose of 2 mg twice daily were investigated, i.e. 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg versus 2 mg, and 4 mg versus 2 mg tolterodine. The lowest dose (0.5 mg) appeared somewhat less effective than 2 mg, but 1 mg and 4 mg doses of tolterodine appeared similar to the effect of 2 mg for leakage episodes and micturitions in 24 hours. Unfortunately, there were few data on patients' perceptions of outcome. Urodynamic measures suggested that 4 mg was associated with bigger increases in maximum cystometric capacity, and volume at first contraction. However, residual volume increased between 27 and 159 ml more with 4 mg than 2 mg tolterodine. Withdrawals due to adverse events were similar in all dose groups. Dry mouth was between 5% and 87% less likely with 0.5mg than 2mg tolterodine, and 20% and 48% less likely with 1mg than 2mg tolterodine. Dry mouth seemed more common with 4 mg than 2 mg tolterodine, although the difference was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>Most data in these comparisons came from three trials; all were dose ranging studies with per protocol analyses. Based on the data, it seems the clinical effectiveness of 1 mg and 2 mg twice daily oral IR tolterodine is not clearly different, but with less risk of dry mouth with the lower dose. Prescribing 0.5 mg or 4 mg tolterodine twice daily might be associated with reduced efficacy with the lower dose, and potentially clinically important increases in residual volume and greater risk of dry mouth with the higher dose. It is not clear what the differences in outcome would be between 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg doses in a more pragmatic clinical setting.</P>
<P>From a practical perspective, two other factors may influence decision making with regard to tolterodine dosage; these are that 0.5 mg tolterodine is not available commercially, and there is little difference in the cost of 1 mg and 2 mg tolterodine.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different doses of solifenacin</HEADING>
<P>Doses higher and lower than the standard therapeutic dose of 5 mg once daily were compared, that is 2.5 mg versus 10 mg versus 20 mg of solifenacin. The quality of life was similar for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg but significantly better with 20 mg, although these data are from one trial only. The dry mouth rates increased with increase in the dose; there was no difference between 2.5 and 5 mg whereas those on 10 and 20 mg had higher reporting of dry mouth. Those receiving 5 mg were between 50% and 78% less likely to experience dry mouth compared to 10 mg solifenacin. There was no significant difference in the withdrawals due to adverse events. A 10 mg dose was more effective than 5 mg for decreasing micturition and urgency per 24 hours. Commercially only 5 and 10 mg are available and 10 mg is more expensive than 5 mg..</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different doses of fesoterodine</HEADING>
<P>Doses higher than the therapeutic dose of 4 mg once daily were investigated, that is. 8 and 12 mg. Patient reported cure or improvement was significantly better with the higher doses, that is 8 and 12 mg were better than 4 mg. There was no difference in the quality of life between the doses. An 8 mg dose was more effective than 4 mg, but 12 mg appeared similar to the effect of 4 mg for leakage and micturition in 24 hours. There was no difference in the withdrawals due to adverse events between 4 and 8 mg, whereas the withdrawals increased significantly with 12 mg. Dry mouth was less likely with 4 mg compared to 8 and 12 mg which had a significantly higher reporting rate. Those receiving 4 mg were between 34% and 58% less likely to experience dry mouth compared to 8 mg. Increasing the dose to 8 mg appears to be associated with increased efficacy and increased dry mouth with no change in withdrawals due to adverse events whereas the highest dose of 12 mg has similar efficacy as 4 mg while both the withdrawals due to adverse events and dry mouth were higher. There is no difference in the cost of 4 and 8 mg, whereas 12 mg is not available commercially.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Different doses of other anticholinergics</HEADING>
<P>There were insufficient trials and data to reach any conclusions about the relative efficacy of different doses of oxybutynin, trospium, propiverine, darifenacin or imedafenacin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Extended versus immediate release preparations</HEADING>
<P>Extended release (ER) preparations have been developed to reduce the side effects, particularly dry mouth, of anticholinergic medications. Although there were few data, there did not seem to be important differences in the efficacy of ER and immediate release (IR) preparations. However, regardless of which drugs were being compared, there was less risk of dry mouth with ER preparations. For oxybutynin, dry mouth is between 9% and 34% less likely with ER preparations; the reduced risk is most pronounced in a comparison of IR with transdermal ER oxybutynin. For tolterodine, data from one large well conducted trial found between 6% and 38% less risk of dry mouth with the ER preparation. Although there are limited data, it seems ER preparations of oxybutynin and tolterodine might have the desired effect of reducing dry mouth. Therefore, comparisons of an IR preparation of one drug with the ER version of another probably do not add much; comparisons of one ER preparation versus another are of greater clinical importance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">One extended release (ER) preparation versus another</HEADING>
<P>Two trials compared ER tolterodine with ER oxybutynin. Data from both trials suggest similar efficacy of the ER preparations. The trial that compared oral ER tolterodine and oxybutynin found a similar proportion of withdrawals in each group but dry mouth was between 6% and 51% less likely in the tolterodine group. In contrast, a comparison of oral ER tolterodine and transdermal ER oxybutynin reported more withdrawals but a tendency toward less dry mouth in the oxybutynin group. The addition of withdrawals because of skin reactions at the transdermal application site, in addition to withdrawals for anticholinergic side effects, might explain the observed difference in withdrawal rates between the two trials. The apparent difference in risk of dry mouth might be associated with method of delivery, with transdermal delivery associated with less dry mouth than oral preparations. Greater salivary output with transdermal ER oxybutynin than oral ER oxybutynin is observed in healthy volunteers (<LINK REF="REF-Appell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Appell 2003</LINK>).</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In contrast to many other treatments for urinary dysfunction, there are a relatively large number of trials comparing anticholinergic drugs with each other. In general, the reported methods of the parallel arm trials were of moderate to high quality. However, the methods of group allocation were rarely described in sufficient detail to be sure that allocation was adequately concealed. Only three trials clearly used blinded outcome assessors. The reporting of group allocation of dropouts and reasons for withdrawal were adequate in about two thirds of trials.</P>
<P>Cross-over trials were usually poorly reported. In order to be included in a meta-analysis the results from cross-over studies for continuous variables must be reported as a difference in means and either the standard deviation, standard error or 95% confidence interval of that difference. This does coincide with what is of clinical interest but can become complex when there are more than two treatments. Dichotomous outcomes (for example cured or not cured) should be reported so that it is clear whether the events during each treatment occurred in the same or different people. Only three of the 16 cross-over trials reported outcomes in this manner, but each had only one outcome of interest.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the number of trials, it is disappointing that it was not possible to combine more data. There was considerable variation in chosen outcomes and also variation in how the same outcome was measured and reported. Relatively few trials sought the patient's opinion on satisfaction with and acceptability of treatment but these are important factors in the choice of management. Only 15 trials reported useable quality of life data, and none reported socioeconomic outcomes. These areas need to be addressed in future research.</P>
<P>In the majority of included trials, the primary endpoint was measured after 12 weeks or less of treatment. Overactive bladder syndrome is a chronic condition and anticholinergic drugs are not curative; continued use of the drug is likely to be needed if the benefits are to be maintained. The short duration of most studies and the lack of long-term follow up gives little information about the long-term effects and acceptability of the different anticholinergic therapies.</P>
<P>None of the included trials reported results for those with or without urgency urinary incontinence. A number of trials included men and women but did not report outcome separately by sex. Therefore, it was not possible to investigate differences in effect based on gender, or on whether patients have incontinence or not.</P>
<P>Some comparisons demonstrated statistically significant heterogeneity. Usually there was a plausible explanation for this, based on clinical heterogeneity. There were differences in the sample populations but also differences in methods of drug delivery (that is oral, intravesical, transdermal, IR and ER preparations) and drug doses.</P>
<P>It is worth noting that 30 of the 86 trials (38%) declared pharmaceutical company support. This support ranged from the supply of active and placebo tablets (in blinded packaging) through to full funding and data analysis. None of the remaining trials made any statement about the absence or presence of company involvement. One trial was funded by a grant from a health research body.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two most widely prescribed drugs (oxybutynin and tolterodine) appear to have similar effects on patients' perceptions of cure or improvement, leakage episodes and number of micturitions, but tolterodine has the lesser risk of withdrawals and dry mouth. Where the prescribing choice is between IR oral preparations of tolterodine and oxybutynin, tolterodine might be preferred because there is less risk of dry mouth and therefore people might be more likely to continue taking the medication. If oral IR tolterodine is being prescribed, it seems the clinical effect might be similar with 1 mg or 2 mg twice daily but dry mouth is less likely with the 1 mg dose. Although clinical observation suggests that 2 mg twice daily is the more common starting dose, the evidence to date suggests a starting dose of 1 mg twice daily might be equally effective with less risk of the most common adverse event, dry mouth.</P>
<P>Solifenacin appears to be better than tolterodine on quality of life, patients' perception of cure or improvement and decreasing micturition and urgency in 24 hours. Dry mouth was less common in those taking solifenacin compared to tolterodine although the withdrawals due to adverse events were similar. A 10 mg dose seems to be more effective than 5 mg solifenacin in decreasing micturition and urgency episodes in 24 hours. Dry mouth was less common with 5 mg, although the withdrawals due to adverse events appear to be similar.</P>
<P>Fesoterodine appears to be better than tolterodine ER for patient reported cure or improvement, quality of life, decreasing leakage episodes and micturition and urgency episodes per 24 hours. The withdrawals due to adverse events and dry mouth seem to be fewer with tolterodine. The 8 mg fesoterodine appears to be more effective than 4 mg for patient reported cure or improvement, decrease in leakage episodes and micturition in 24 hours. Athough dry mouth was less likely with the 4 mg dose the withdrawals due to adverse events were similar.</P>
<P>Where clinicians have the option of prescribing ER preparations, this method of delivery can be expected to reduce the risk of dry mouth without any apparent loss of efficacy. There are insufficient data to recommend one ER preparation over another, although dry mouth might be less common with oral ER tolterodine than oral ER oxybutynin, or transdermal ER oxybutynin than oral ER tolterodine. Some patients may have a skin reaction to transdermal patches, which leads them to discontinue this method of delivery.</P>
<P>There are few data in this review to compare other anticholinergic drugs (for example trospium chloride, propantheline, propiverine, darifenacin, imedafenacin) with either oxybutynin or tolterodine; more data are needed to support the prescribing of these drugs.</P>
<P>The short duration of most studies and the lack of long-term follow up gives little information about the long-term effects and acceptability of the different anticholinergic drugs.</P>
<P>Economic measures were not reported. It is disappointing that none of the included trials reported even the most basic of cost descriptions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-06 12:32:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The meaning and usefulness of future trials and reviews would be improved if attention is paid to the choice of outcome measures, long-term follow up, and some aspects of trial design. In particular, the authors recommend that future trials:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>are large;</LI>
<LI>are more pragmatic than explanatory in design, because findings would be more useful if trial methods reflected usual clinical practice (pragmatic design) rather than very tightly controlled, highly selected populations and per protocol analyses (explanatory design);</LI>
<LI>use adequate means to conceal group allocation (and report the methods used);</LI>
<LI>use blinded outcome assessors;</LI>
<LI>use a standardised, validated measure of condition-specific (overactive bladder) quality of life as the primary outcome measure;</LI>
<LI>include the patient's perception of change in symptoms and satisfaction with outcome, as secondary outcome measures;</LI>
<LI>follow participants up for to at least one year, because anticholinergic drugs are not curative and what success they have is likely to depend on people continuing to take them;</LI>
<LI>include economic outcomes;</LI>
<LI>report useable data, point estimates with variation (mean, standard deviation and number of patients with outcome);</LI>
<LI>use standardised reporting of cross-over trials.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The reporting of trials could also be improved, especially the methods of group allocation and description of dropouts. Further, the reporting of all aspects of cross-over studies needs to be dramatically improved if they are to add anything to the body of knowledge about these drugs.</P>
<P>With regard to drug comparisons, there have probably been sufficient trials comparing oxybutynin and tolterodine to have established that these two widely prescribed drugs have similar efficacy but tolterodine has the better side effect profile. However, oxybutynin is cheaper and is a registered and subsidised drug in more countries. Any new anticholinergic therapies, after their safely has been established, should be compared to either oxybutynin or tolterodine to establish if they have similar or better efficacy or side effect profiles than either of these 'standard' drug therapies.</P>
<P>It seems extended release preparations do have the desired effect of reducing side effects, particularly dry mouth, compared to oral immediate release preparations. It is probably more clinically useful to concentrate research efforts on comparisons of different extended release preparations or different methods of extended release delivery, than comparisons of extended release with immediate release preparations.</P>

METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in the territory of Hong Kong. The subjects were a sample of women between the ages of 10 and 90 years. The main outcome determined was the prevalence of urinary dysfunction. RESULTS: We made 3248 calls, resulting in 819 evaluable responses. Stress incontinence was reported by 21% (174) of respondents, urgency or urge incontinence in 15% (120), urinary frequency in 19% (154), nocturia in 20% (166), bed-wetting in 4% (31), and voiding difficulties in 13% (109). Stress incontinence occurred as the only symptom in 7% (53), the combination of urgency and frequency in 1% (11), and mixed symptoms in 6% (52). Four percent required protective underwear or pads, with 2% wearing protective underwear continuously; 4% were incapacitated by their incontinence. Symptoms of urgency, urge incontinence, frequency, and nocturia increased with increasing age, but voiding difficulties and nocturnal enuresis were unrelated to age. Stress incontinence, urgency, urge incontinence, frequency, nocturia, and voiding difficulties increased with increasing parity to para 4. CONCLUSION: Urinary dysfunction and its patterns appear to be as common and incapacitating in Hong Kong Chinese as they are in other populations&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-01-09 14:16:44 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
