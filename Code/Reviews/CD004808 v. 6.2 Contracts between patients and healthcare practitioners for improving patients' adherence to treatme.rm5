<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners for improving patients' adherence to recommended healthcare activities</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Sometimes patients do not complete a course of treatment or they do not follow recommended changes in diet or personal habits. This poor adherence may be because treatments take a long time, have side effects or involve changing patients' habits, which is often difficult. Several interventions aim to change the relationship between patients and healthcare practitioners in order to improve the patients' adherence to treatments. One of these interventions is in the form of contracts between healthcare practitioners and patients, by which one or both parties commit to a set of behaviours related to the care of the patient. Contracts may be written or verbal. Most contracts are between healthcare practitioners and patients, but they may also occur between practitioners and carers, carers and patients or by a patient with him/herself. In this review we assessed whether contracts between practitioners and patients really improve the patients' adherence to treatment or their health status. We also assessed the effects of contracts on other outcomes, including patient participation and satisfaction, health practitioner behaviour and views, health status, harms, costs, and ethical issues.</P>
<P>We found 30 trials involving 4691 participants, examining several types of contracts. The main health problems targeted were substance addictions, hypertension and overweight. Many of the trials were of poor quality and involved small numbers of people. Most were conducted in the USA. In 15 of the trials there was at least one outcome showing statistically significant differences in favour of the contracts group (although some of the improvements in adherence did not remain when measured after a longer period). In six trials at least one outcome showed such differences in favour of the control group. In 26 trials there was at least one outcome for which there was no difference between the contract and control groups.</P>
<P>There is not enough reliable evidence available to recommend the routine use of contracts in health services to improve patients' adherence to healthcare activities or other outcomes.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Contracts are a verbal or written agreement that a patient makes with themselves, with healthcare practitioners, or with carers, where participants commit to a set of behaviours related to the care of a patient. Contracts aim to improve the patients' adherence to treatment or health promotion programmes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners on patients' adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activities, the stated health or behaviour aims in the contract, patient satisfaction or other relevant outcomes, including health practitioner behaviour and views, health status, reported harms, costs, or denial of treatment as a result of the contract. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register (in May 2004); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2004, issue 1); MEDLINE 1966 to May 2004); EMBASE (1980 to May 2004); PsycINFO (1966 to May 2004); CINAHL (1982 to May 2004); Dissertation Abstracts. A: Humanities and Social Sciences (1966 to May 2004); Sociological Abstracts (1963 to May 2004); UK National Research Register (2000 to May 2004); and C2-SPECTR, Campbell Collaboration (1950 to May 2004). </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of contracts between healthcare practitioners and patients or their carers on patient adherence, applied to diagnostic procedures, therapeutic regimens or any health promotion or illness prevention initiative for patients. Contracts had to specify at least one activity to be observed and a commitment of adherence to it. We included trials comparing contracts with routine care or any other intervention.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Selection and quality assessment of trials were conducted independently by two review authors; single data extraction was checked by a statistician. We present the data as a narrative summary, given the wide range of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes, grouped by the health problem being addressed.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We included thirty trials, all conducted in high income countries, involving 4691 participants. Median sample size per group was 21. We examined the quality of each trial against eight standard criteria, and all trials were inadequate in relation to three or more of these standards. Trials evaluated contracts in addiction (10 trials), hypertension (4 trials), weight control (3 trials) and a variety of other areas (13 trials). Fifteen trials reported at least one outcome that showed statistically significant differences favouring the contracts group, six trials reported at least one outcome that showed differences favouring the control group and 26 trials reported at least one outcome without differences between groups. Effects on adherence were not detected when measured over longer periods.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is limited evidence that contracts can potentially contribute to improving adherence, but there is insufficient evidence from large, good quality studies to routinely recommend contracts for improving adherence to treatment or preventive health regimens.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:54:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>For many treatments and health promotion strategies, participants need to take advantage of the advice, treatments and other actions offered by healthcare practitioners. A number of good studies and systematic reviews have evaluated interventions to improve patients' adherence to treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rueda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rueda 2006</LINK>). Haynes, for example, reports that interventions to improve short-term adherence to medications are relatively successful, but interventions for chronic conditions tend to be complex and not very effective. One widely-used approach is a contract between healthcare practitioners and participants. We examine here the use of contracts to improve adherence looking at the specific features of contracts.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Definition and characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Contracts are defined as a mutual agreement between two or more parties that something shall be done by one or both (<LINK REF="REF-OED-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">OED 2003</LINK>). As a behavioural strategy aiming at improving patients' adherence, contracts refer "to a process of specifying a set of rules regarding some behaviour of interest and formalising a commitment to adhere to them" (<LINK REF="REF-Dunbar-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dunbar 1979</LINK>). They are referred to as contracts, behavioural contracts or contingency contracts. Contracts have been used in a wide range of circumstances such as smoking cessation, breast self examination, hypertension, diabetes, rheumatic diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, for renal patients, and for people with psychiatric conditions.</P>
<P>In the social science literature, there is no consistent definition of contracts. This section aims to scope the features and concepts underpinning the use of contracts in health and draws from a wide range of research.</P>
<P>The following summarises the features of contracts when used as a strategy to increase adherence:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Formalisation. Contracts formalise the agreement of patients and/or healthcare practitioners to follow treatment, prevention or health promotion activities. These usually involve therapeutic activities (particularly adherence to prescribed drugs) but they also include: observance of appointments (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2000</LINK>); lifestyle behaviours, such as smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Resnikow-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Resnikow 1997</LINK>) and nutrition habits (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 1997</LINK>); and diagnostic actions, like breast self examination (<LINK REF="STD-Lierman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lierman 1994</LINK>). Contracts are often written, but some examples of verbal contracts exist (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arnet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnet 2000</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Parties to the contract. Contracts are most often established between patients and their physicians. There are examples of other parties being involved, such as nurses and patients (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 1997</LINK>), patients and selected partners from the household or the community (<LINK REF="STD-Keane-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Keane 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lierman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Lierman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1984</LINK>), and even contracts with the patients themselves (a self-commitment made explicit) (<LINK REF="REF-Brus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brus 1998</LINK>). We found one study of a tripartite contract: between the patient, the healthcare practitioner of a pain clinic and the primary care physician (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 2002a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Usually adults. In the literature, contracts primarily involve adult patients, although adolescents (<LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 1989</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-Greenan_x002d_Fowler-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenan-Fowler 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1991</LINK>) have also been involved. The role of children is particularly delicate, since their decision capacity is limited and sometimes delegated to their carers, and their right to have access to information entails specific requirements to ensure their comprehension (<LINK REF="REF-Sanz-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanz 2003</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Contingency contracts</HEADING>
<P>When contracts include a reward conditioned by the accomplishment of the contract clauses, they are referred to as contingency contracts: "a specifically negotiated agreement that provides for the delivery of positive consequences contingent on desirable behaviour" (<LINK REF="REF-Janz-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janz 1984</LINK>). There are two main types of rewards (<LINK REF="REF-Christiensen_x002d_S.-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christiensen-S. 1985</LINK>). 'Token economies', which were initially used as a behavioural therapy, are rewards from the healthcare practitioner in the form of tokens that can be exchanged for something of value (<LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wysocki-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Wysocki 1989</LINK>). Rewards may also involve the refund of a deposit ('deposit contract') (<LINK REF="REF-Chowdhury-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chowdhury 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Molteni-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Molteni 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paxton-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paxton 1983</LINK>). One study reported a self-reward, where the patient states what s/he will do to reward him/herself (<LINK REF="STD-Neale-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Neale 1991</LINK>). Another study involved insurance refund policies based on measures of treatment success (<LINK REF="STD-Harzer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Harzer 2000</LINK>). Neither contingencies nor penalties seem to take place, however, if healthcare practitioners do not respect their terms in the contracts.</P>
<P>Ethical issues arise when access to treatment may be dependent upon patients' behaviour as specified in a contract (<LINK REF="REF-Biller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biller 1999</LINK>). Contracts have been used not only as behavioural therapy, but also to support decisions on the appropriateness of a given treatment. For example, one study described how compliance with a behavioural contract was used as a criterion to identify individuals with the potential to maintain a transplanted organ capably (<LINK REF="REF-Cupples-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cupples 2001</LINK>). The circumstances in which a patient can make a rational and autonomous choice, in the context of contracting, is also worthy of ethical consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Biller-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biller 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>For this review, contracts are defined as any type of agreement, verbal or written, by which one or both parties agree to a set of behaviours related to the care of a patient. Contracts may be established between healthcare practitioners and patients, between practitioners and carers, between carers and patients, or by a patient with him/herself. Contracts are intended to improve adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activities.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Theoretical models</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Concordance and the relationship model</HEADING>
<P>Compliance or adherence has been defined as "the extent to which a person's behaviour (in terms of taking medications, following diets or executing lifestyle changes) coincides with medical or health advice" (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979a</LINK>). The increasing use of the term 'adherence' instead of 'compliance' is due to the latter's negative and authoritarian connotations. Adherence implies the patient's active choice in following medical recommendations rather than passive co-operation of obedience to them (<LINK REF="REF-Evangelista-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evangelista 2000</LINK>). However, adherence is still rooted in a medical model, in which patients are expected to do what healthcare practitioners tell them. In this review, we use the term adherence in its most restricted sense, to designate the extent to which something that has been implicitly or explicitly agreed between healthcare practitioners and patients (for example, a treatment), actually happens, regardless of the type of relationship between patients and practitioners.</P>
<P>The term 'concordance' aims to reflect that patients/persons have self-determination and control over what happens to them. Concordance means shared decision making and arriving at an agreement that respects patients' wishes and beliefs (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>). It has been argued that healthcare practitioners may also find that patients' difficulties in adhering to treatments - such as those experienced by chronically-ill patients with their treatments (for example, taking treatments consistently whilst suffering side effects) - may be minimised in the context of a concordant relationship (<LINK REF="REF-Townsend-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Townsend 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some contracts depend on a relationship model. Contrary to the assumptions in a concordant relationship, the healthcare practitioner perspective predominates in the literature on behavioural contracts scrutinised so far. References to healthcare practitioners' obligations (like providing information or evidence-based treatments) are generally missing. Contracts often appear not to be based on a relationship marked by shared decision making, but instead they place the responsibility of failing the terms of the contract on the patients' side. The literature around concordance is particularly relevant since it provides a critical perspective to understand the patient - provider relationship, whatever form it takes (including contracts). With concordance, an essential component in a shared decision-making model is that of mutual agreement (implicit or explicit) with the treatment decision (<LINK REF="REF-Charles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charles 1997</LINK>). This kind of agreement may indeed reinforce the mutual contribution of healthcare practitioners and patients to a successful treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Maher-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maher 2003</LINK>). Furthermore, it has been argued that unless patients and doctors are collectively or jointly involved in the decision-making process, sharing information and building up consensus, there is no basis for reaching an agreement on which a treatment can be implemented (<LINK REF="REF-Stevenson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevenson 2000</LINK>). In a concordant consultation the patient and the healthcare professional participate as partners to reach that agreement (<LINK REF="REF-Cox-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Impact on health</HEADING>
<P>Low adherence may seriously compromise the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens. It has been reported that adherence may be as low as 10% in keeping appointments (number of appointments kept in relation to the total number of appointments scheduled), or may be between 40% and 60% in the case of adherence to long-term medications (percentage of patients with presence of medications in body fluids or self-assessed reporting of drug intake) (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1979</LINK>). Poor adherence to treatment regimens has been associated with a reduction in treatment effectiveness, leading to worse health outcomes and even death (<LINK REF="REF-Cleemput-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleemput 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gordis-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordis 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2006</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) report on adherence documents worse outcomes associated with poor adherence for conditions like hypertension, type-2 diabetes and depression (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>). There is some evidence that the costs involved in treating non-adherent patients are greater than those involved in treating adherent ones (<LINK REF="REF-Cleemput-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cleemput 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heinssen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinssen 1995</LINK>). In the United Kingdom (UK), it has been estimated that missed appointments resulted in an economic loss of 250 million pounds sterling per year (<LINK REF="REF-DPP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">DPP 2003</LINK>). However, adherence to potentially harmful treatments may also lead to adverse outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Advantages of contracts</HEADING>
<P>What are the potential advantages of contracts over other interventions that seek to improve adherence and concordance? First, they could allow for better replication if they are standardised and do not include extensive training or educational components. Contracts may be cheaper to implement than other combined or more complex interventions, or even than supervised self-administration of drugs (<LINK REF="STD-Keane-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Keane 1984</LINK>). Apart from that, in a case study, contracts have shown cost savings related to an increase in adherence and the rationalisation of the care provided (<LINK REF="REF-Heinssen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heinssen 1995</LINK>). For patients/participants, provided that the interventions used are effective, the benefits include health gains, psychological comfort (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>) and a better understanding of what they are expected to do and why.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evidence base for improving adherence</HEADING>
<P>Haynes reviewed the factors associated with the level of adherence to therapeutic regimens (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-1979b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 1979b</LINK>). The type of disease seems to play a secondary role, except in specific conditions: adherence tends to be lower in some psychiatric disorders such as depression, for example. System or organisational issues such as referral delays, waiting times and appointment schedules have a stronger influence than the type of disease on the level of patients' adherence. In relation to the features of the therapeutic regimens, low adherence has been found almost constantly in treatments of longer duration and involving several drugs. Socio-economic barriers, side effects of treatments and denial of the illness have also been related to poor adherence (<LINK REF="REF-Mellins-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mellins 1992</LINK>). Finally, the interaction between patients and healthcare practitioners is decisively important in ensuring that what has been explicitly or implicitly agreed, actually takes place. Effective communication of usage instructions for drugs, and the clinician's understanding of patients' concerns about their problems or treatment preferences, have been associated with an increase in patients' adherence and willingness to participate (<LINK REF="REF-Hulka-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hulka 1979</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interventions to increase adherence may address organisational issues, the simplification of therapeutic regimens, the interface between the patient and the healthcare practitioner, and patients' behaviour. Strategies to increase adherence to regimens have been systematically reviewed in general (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>), and in relation to specific diseases, like tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2006</LINK>), HIV/AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Rueda-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rueda 2006</LINK>) or mental illness (<LINK REF="REF-Reda-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reda 2001</LINK>), reporting the effects of these interventions on patients' adherence and on other outcomes. These interventions tend to be complex. Firstly, many different actors and activities may be involved. Educational interventions, for example, may involve physicians, other therapists, facilitators, educational materials, and different schedules and structures of the sessions. Secondly, some interventions are a combination of different strategies, such as patient instructions combined with visits to a specialist, or patient brochures together with group sessions. This complexity makes it very difficult to know which are the key elements that may have an impact on patients' adherence or on the improvement of health outcomes. Results from these reviews indicate that some strategies or combination of strategies may improve adherence or health outcomes, but their effects are not very remarkable overall when compared with the effort they require (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>While this review focuses on a single strategy in the context of any health condition, several systematic reviews have assessed interventions to improve adherence or compliance in relation to specific conditions. Five included contracts. One was restricted to adherence to appointment keeping, and considered only randomised controlled trials written in English (<LINK REF="REF-Macharia-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macharia 1992</LINK>). Another assessed controlled studies, published in English language journals, of patients' adherence to therapeutic regimes (<LINK REF="REF-Roter-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roter 1998</LINK>). Three other reviews were published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. One of them focused on tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Volmink-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 2006</LINK>), another on reminder packaging (<LINK REF="REF-Heneghan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heneghan 2006</LINK>) and yet another considered adherence to prescribed (self-administered) medications only (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). No systematic review has addressed contracts as a strategy to improve patients' adherence to any kind of treatment, prevention or health promotion activity, regardless of the setting and the condition or disease affecting the patients.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners on patients' adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activities, the stated health or behaviour aims in the contract, patient satisfaction or other relevant outcomes, including health practitioner behaviour and views, health status, reported harms, costs, or denial of treatment as a result of the contract. </P>

<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-07-02 14:16:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</P>
<P>After the initial publication of the protocol for this review, we amended the selection criterion for studies (which formerly included some study designs other than RCTs). Preliminary searching indicated that the number of randomised controlled trials potentially eligible for inclusion in this review was much larger than previously anticipated, thereby removing the need to examine studies providing less robust evidence. The 'Criteria for considering studies for this review / Types of studies' section was amended to include only RCTs (excluding quasi-randomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses).</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients or their carers, of any gender and age, with any health condition and in any health setting. The term 'patient' is used broadly to refer to any person undergoing diagnostic tests, or treatment, or participating in any illness prevention or health promotion initiatives.</P>
<P>Practitioners, including clinicians, nurses and any worker or service providing screening, diagnosis, therapeutics, rehabilitation, prevention or health promotion activities.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Contracts concerning treatment, prevention and health promotion activities aimed at improving patients' adherence. Contracts included any verbal or written statement specifying at least one treatment, prevention or health promotion activity to be observed, and a commitment of adherence to it.</P>
<P>Contracts could take place between healthcare practitioners or services and patients or their carers, between patients and their carers, or between patients themselves (self-commitment). Contracts could relate to any diagnostic procedure, therapeutic regimen, rehabilitation measure, general health advice, referral instruction, or any other activity or combination of activities involved in the management of patients.</P>
<P>Explicit rewards (like tokens, cash or social benefits) may or may not have been present. Self-management was included, providing that self-management appears to be supported by any form of contracting.</P>
<P>The control was any intervention (such as instructions, education, incentives or reminders) or combination of interventions, aimed at improving patients' adherence; or no intervention. We excluded studies comparing different modalities of contracts.</P>
<P>We included studies of multifaceted interventions provided that a given modality of contract was present in the intervention but not in the control group.</P>

<P>
<BR/>Although an association between adherence to drug therapy and positive health outcomes has been shown (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2006</LINK>), this does not necessarily mean that good adherence to medication will always predictably lead to better health outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Haynes-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haynes 2008</LINK>). However, we still think that it is of value to include studies with only adherence-related outcomes, because certainly good adherence may be a pre-requisite, although not the only one, for achieving good health outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>One author (XBC) assessed the titles and abstracts of potentially-relevant studies against the review inclusion criteria. If a study could not be excluded on the basis of the title or abstract alone, we obtained full papers. Two authors (XBC and KA) assessed potentially-relevant papers for inclusion independently against the review inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and, if an agreement was not reached, referred to a third author (PG). Reports were scrutinised for multiple publication. We excluded potentially-relevant studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, giving the reasons for exclusion in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. We attempted to contact some study authors for clarification where information was missing, but the age of some of the trials, together with authors' resource constraints, meant that this was not always possible. We aim to increase author contact for future updates of this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of methodological quality</HEADING>
<P>Two authors (XBC and KA) assessed independently the quality of studies (see criteria below). This process was not blind in relation to the trial authors, their institutions and journals.</P>
<P>We used a form to guide the assessment of methodological quality, and classified each quality component as 'adequate', 'inadequate' or 'unclear'. Disagreement was resolved by discussion with the third author (PG).</P>
<P>The criteria applied to assess the methodological quality were as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Method of randomisation: rated 'adequate' if the method used was described and the resulting sequences were unpredictable (e.g. random numbers, drawing of lots or envelopes, tossing a coin); rated 'inadequate' if the sequences could be related to non-random factors (e.g. record number, date of birth); rated 'unclear' if the description did not allow us to judge the method of randomisation.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of allocation: rated 'adequate' if participants and investigators could not foresee the assignment (e.g. central randomisation remote from trial location; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes); rated 'inadequate' if participants and investigators enrolling participants could foresee the upcoming assignment (e.g. open allocation schedule; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes); rated 'unclear' if the description did not allow us to judge allocation concealment. In the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> allocation concealment was reported as: adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C), or that allocation concealment was not used (D) as a criterion to assess validity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>, chapter 6.3).</LI>
<LI>Blinding of practitioners: rated 'adequate' if it was reported that practitioners or researchers (those offering the intervention) were blind to who was in each group; rated 'inadequate' if practitioners or researchers knew the participants' group, and this was stated or could be clearly inferred from the text; rated 'unclear' if the description did not allow us to judge blinding of practitioners.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of participants: rated 'adequate' if participants did not know to which group they belonged; rated 'inadequate' if participants knew to which group they belonged; rated 'unclear' if the description did not allow us to judge blinding of participants.</LI>
<LI>Blinding in the assessment of outcomes: rated 'adequate' if trial authors explicitly stated that the primary outcome variables were assessed blindly; rated 'inadequate' if outcome(s) were not assessed blindly; rated 'unclear' if the description did not allow us to judge blinding of outcome assessment.</LI>
<LI>Baseline measurements: rated 'adequate' if baseline measurements were reported and there were no significant differences between groups; rated 'inadequate' if baseline measurements were reported and there were significant differences between groups; rated 'unclear' if baseline measurements were not reported.</LI>
<LI>Loss to follow up: rated 'adequate' if outcome measures were explicitly obtained for 80% or more of professionals, subjects, patients or episodes entering the study; rated 'inadequate' if outcome measures were obtained for less than 80% of professionals, subjects, patients or episodes entering the study; rated 'unclear' if it was not reported or it was impossible to estimate.</LI>
<LI>Consumer participation: rated 'adequate' if there was any mention of the involvement of consumers in the design, implementation or interpretation of the research; rated 'inadequate' if it was explicitly stated that consumers did not participate in any stage; rated 'unclear' if nothing was reported.</LI>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data Extraction</HEADING>
<P>Trials were distributed among two authors (XBC and KA) for data extraction. The statistics editor and statistics assistant of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group checked the data extraction. Data extracted included the study design, methods, participants, interventions, co-interventions and outcomes. Data extracted to describe the modality of contracts included: formalisation and duration of contracts, parties (categorised as practitioner, participant/patient, carer (including peers and significant others) and other), treatment, prevention and health promotion activities involved, and contingencies. We also extracted data on the profile of trial participants.</P>
<P>We extracted the following data on outcomes (for all parties, such as for children and parents): measures of adherence to therapeutic regimens and use of services; adherence of healthcare practitioners to the terms of the contracts; penalties and rewards; quantitative measures or qualitative data describing the level of shared decision making; measures of satisfaction with the process; expectations and psychological distress; healthcare practitioners' understanding and behaviour in relation to contracts; health status data, such as improvement in clinical parameters or prognosis; cost information, detailing (where possible) the way costs have been estimated; and data on harms derived from the adherence or lack of adherence to treatment/s.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data Analysis</HEADING>
<P>Where no intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis had been carried out, we have tried to extract data to do it. Percentage loss to follow up has been presented as reported, or calculated if the number of selected individuals did not match the number of individuals whose data has been analysed. For binary outcomes we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event in each group and calculated the odds ratios. For continuous outcomes we extracted the arithmetic means and standard deviations (SD).</P>
<P>The main features of included studies have been presented in the table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>, which also includes the country, setting, health area or problem, recruitment mechanism, sample size of participants randomised and main features of contracts. Additional tables <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK> (one for each main group of health problems or areas) describe the number of participants included in the analysis (which may differ to the number of participants randomised), the interventions, controls and outcomes. For each study, outcomes have been placed in three columns depending on whether there were statistically significant differences favouring the intervention group, the control group or there were no differences, respectively.</P>
<P>Trials were all too diverse in terms of co-interventions, control groups, features of contracts, outcomes and settings to try any grouping by those criteria. Although the initial sub-group analyses options included health status outcomes, presence and type of contingencies, degree of shared decision making and type of healthcare activity, we decided that the clearest way to group trials was by health area, because slightly more than half of the included trials could be grouped into three health areas (addictions, hypertension, and weight control). The remaining trials examined a range of conditions and are listed as 'miscellaneous' in our grouping. Data were presented by means of graphics only where data were complete (numbers in all groups available for categorical variables, and numbers in groups, means and standard deviations for continuous variables).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Consumer participation</HEADING>
<P>Given that this review was not limited to any particular condition, we sought input from consumers or patients whose health experiences were not restricted to a single disease group and with experience or involvement in issues related to the relationship between patients and healthcare practitioners. Consumer participation was ensured in the protocol stage, and in the development of the review, and will be taken into account in future updates.</P>
<P>The protocol for this review, together with a user-friendly questionnaire in electronic format to guide the process, was sent to a number of consumers for comments. Feedback was received from the following people and institutions: a social sciences and gender specialist working as a Community Research and Training Consultant, who is familiar with consumers' points of view (the Gender and Health Group, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK), and the Director of Developing Patient Partnerships (London, UK). The Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group involved two other consumers as external peer-reviewers of the protocol, and one consumer as an external peer-reviewer of the review. Additionally, several consumers involved in The Cochrane Collaboration provided feedback directly to the review authors at both protocol and review stages. Suggestions from consumers have been incorporated into the protocol and review as much as possible.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:54:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>As a type of intervention designed to help shape the relationship between patients, carers and practitioners, contracts are extremely complex, poorly defined and described, and evaluated in many different formats and ways. The lack of a consistent definition and common features, and the variation in trials undertaken, meant that we had to select one sensible way to present the results.

<P>Eight methodological quality criteria were applied to each trial (see 'Methods of the review / Assessment of methodological quality', for details). None of the trials met 5 or more of the 8 methodological quality criteria; 1 trial met 4 criteria, 3 trials met 3 criteria, 6 met 2 criteria, 11 trials met a single criterion and the remaining 9 trials met none of the criteria. The assessment of methodological quality for each included study is reported in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Method of randomisation and concealment of allocation</HEADING>
<P>The randomisation mechanism to allocate participants into groups was appropriately reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Burkhart-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Burkhart 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vinson 2000</LINK>). In the other 27 trials it was not possible to determine the randomisation mechanism, although none gave any evidence of utilising a quasi-experimental rather than truly randomised study design.</P>
<P>Only two trials mentioned a method which allowed for concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vinson 2000</LINK>); in 28 trials (94%) allocation concealment was unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Baseline measurements</HEADING>
<P>Baseline measurements were reported in 24 trials. No differences in baseline measurements were reported in 16 trials, although only 9 of them showed baseline data. The other eight trials reported some differences (six of them showing data).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>This behavioural intervention is difficult to blind to practitioners and participants. Only four trials reported blinding of practitioners or researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1981</LINK>). In 22 trials blinding was not reported and in the other 4 trials it was clearly stated that practitioners were not blind to group allocation.</P>
<P>In 3 trials participants were blind to the allocated intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Claydon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Claydon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haber-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Haber 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hammond 1999</LINK>), and the other 27 trials did not mention blinding of participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Claydon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Claydon 1997</LINK>, it should be noted, patients were unaware of being participants in a trial.</P>
<P>Blinded assessment of outcomes was reported in 6 trials (<LINK REF="STD-Claydon-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Claydon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammond-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hammond 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoelscher-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hoelscher 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vinson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Vinson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wurtele-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Wurtele 1980</LINK>). In 23 trials it was unclear, and 1 trial reported that outcome assessors were not blind to group allocation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Follow up</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow up was less than 20% (rated as 'adequate') in 19 trials, more than 20% (rated as 'inadequate') in 4 trials, and could not be determined in the other 7 trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Community or user involvement</HEADING>
<P>None of the trials reported any participation of community members or users in the design, implementation or interpretation of the research, beyond the involvement expected from a behavioural intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Data on outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the 30 trials provided enough data to estimate statistical differences between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Craighead-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Craighead 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lash-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lash 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McLean-1973" TYPE="STUDY">McLean 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Morisky-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Morisky 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1984</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Piotrowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Piotrowski 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1981</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1994</LINK>). The presentation of numerical data was of poor quality: some statistical significances were just mentioned in the text without P values; others had P values but not the statistical parameter used (for example, F, t) or their values; some did not show the number of subjects included in the analyses of each group; and sometimes comparisons of more than one intervention group were pulled together against more than one control group pulled together as well.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample size</HEADING>
<P>Sample sizes were generally small. The median sample size per group was 21 (interquartile range 24), and only two trials had more than 100 subjects in each group. With this very limited sample size it is difficult to have the power to estimate relatively small differences between groups.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:54:51 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>The numerous outcomes were difficult to group in terms of their meaning, methods of assessment and times of the assessments. Therefore, it seemed impractical to attempt any pooling of data for meta-analysis. However, for those outcomes where data were complete (for example, standard deviations included when estimating means, or the number of subjects included in the analyses of each group), and where appropriate, we entered data into RevMan Analyses and produced forest plots, as noted below. <I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Overall, 15 trials reported at least 1 outcome that showed statistically significant differences favouring the contracts group; six trials reported at least one outcome that showed statistically significant differences favouring the control group; and 26 trials reported at least 1 outcome without statistically significant differences between groups (see tables 2 to 5).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adherence</HEADING>
<P>Adherence was measured in three different ways: (i) period of time abstinent (substance-free samples); (ii) proportion of participants abstinent (substance-free samples); and (iii) adherence to attending sessions (sensitisation sessions).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Substance abuse</HEADING>
<P>(i) Period of time abstinent<BR/>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Calsyn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Calsyn 1994</LINK>), people in the contract group were abstinent for a longer period (as measured by positive urine analysis at 9 weeks post-treatment) than people in the control group (result as reported by triallists; no extractable data).</P>
<P>In another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Piotrowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Piotrowski 1999</LINK>), differences in abstinence duration were assessed at different time periods post treatment. No significant differences were found after 30 or 60 days of treatment; but significant differences favouring the intervention group were found in longer post-treatment intervals, up to 180 days. For all participants (regardless the period of time they were on treatment) and individual substances, the only statistically significant differences reported were in the case of benzodiazepines and marijuana (favouring the intervention group). No differences were found for alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates and cocaine .</P>
<P>(ii) Proportion of participants abstinent<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Calsyn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Calsyn 1994</LINK> reported the proportion of participants abstinent at 9 weeks and at 18 months, measured by urine analysis. At 9 weeks, the proportion of participants abstinent from opiates was significantly higher in the intervention group, but there were no differences between groups for cocaine. At 18 months, a significantly greater proportion of participants in the intervention group was abstinent compared with the control group: (a) regardless of the type of substance; (b) for cocaine, and; (c) for opiates. Detailed data was only reported for the 18-month measurement point (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Piotrowski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Piotrowski 1999</LINK> the proportion of participants in the contracts group that were abstinent after 120 days of treatment showed no difference with control group (measured by substance-free samples). (See <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>(iii) Adherence to attending sessions<BR/>The percentage of participants present at sessions one to eight showed statistically significant differences favouring the contracts group for sessions one, three, four and six; but these differences vanished for sessions two, five, seven and eight (<LINK REF="STD-Ossip_x002d_Klein-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ossip-Klein 1984</LINK>).<I> </I>In another trial, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in the number of participants who attended at least one aftercare group session nor in the mean number of aftercare sessions attended (<LINK REF="STD-Lash-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lash 1998</LINK>).

<P>(ii) Proportion of participants abstinent<BR/>In <LINK REF="STD-Curry-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Curry 1988</LINK> the proportion of participants abstaining from smoking at any period (from treatment up to more than three months, measured by weekly self-reported cigarette consumption) was also similar in both groups. In <LINK REF="STD-Brockway-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Brockway 1977</LINK> the participants in the contracts group smoked significantly fewer cigarettes (measured by individual self-report) than people in the control group at 6 months follow up. However this difference vanished at 12 months follow up. In <LINK REF="STD-Poole-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Poole 1981</LINK> there was no difference between participants in the control and contracts groups when cigarette consumption was compared with baseline smoking, from 1 week to 12 months follow up.

<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Farrell-1984" TYPE="STUDY">O'Farrell 1984</LINK> measured participants' abilities to solve problems, and their perceptions about the treatment programmes, but the study did not report any statistical analysis nor enough data to be analysed post hoc.</P>
<P>A new outcome, related to the use of services, which was not foreseen at the protocol stage, is reported here. Contracts significantly increased the discharge rate of patients under methadone therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Calsyn-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Calsyn 1994</LINK>), because contingency contracting in this study included discharge for continuous positive urine analysis. In other words, contracts were unable to keep patients under treatment, however participants in the contracts group were statistically significantly less months out of treatment before readmission (i.e. they were readmitted more after a shorter period than participants in the control group).</P>

In <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1981</LINK>, contracts statistically significantly improved the diastolic blood pressure measured over four visits (specific time periods not reported).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1981</LINK>, contracts significantly improved patients' knowledge about hypertension care issues. Participants' views on health care were examined in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Schulman-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Schulman 1980</LINK>) through the Active Patient Orientation scores reported by patients (health professionals support patients' motivations reinforcing their active participation, illness-management is collaborative, clear instructions and skills training). Patients under contracts rated their care significantly higher in the Active Patient Orientation scores. In <LINK REF="STD-Hoelscher-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hoelscher 1986</LINK>, the cost-effectiveness (improvement in blood pressure per hour of therapist contact) in the 'contracts plus group relaxation' group was significantly higher than in the 'individual relaxation' group.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Craighead-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Craighead 1989</LINK> there were three groups: contracts, supervised exercise and minimal contact. Outcomes were measured at 12 weeks and 12 months. When data from the contracts and supervised exercise groups were pooled, people in these groups lost significantly more weight than those in the minimal care group. For those participants who completed the treatments, mean weight losses were respectively 8.1 pounds (contracts), 11 pounds (supervised exercise) and 4.6 pounds (minimal contact) (P &lt; 0.05) (see <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

Outcomes in <LINK REF="STD-Litzelman-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Litzelman 1993</LINK> included adherence outcomes (for example, washing the feet), health outcomes (for example, presence of foot lesions), and physician practice outcomes (for example, documentation of clinical observations).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:52:33 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>In this review we included 30 trials presented in 32 reports, the majority set in the USA and all of them in high income countries. The trials were undertaken in a range of settings (including some projects and services that were established especially for research purposes), and covered a wide range of health problems or areas, contract forms, participants, and outcomes.</P>
<P>Most of the trials were of poor design, or were poorly reported, or both. For example, only three trials reported their method of randomisation and only two mentioned a method of randomisation which allowed for the concealment of group allocation. Poor quality trials are more likely to be subject to bias and therefore the results are less reliable than those from better quality trials (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). In addition, the sample size of many trials was small. Over half the trials had more than two comparison groups, making group sample sizes even smaller. Small trials are more likely than larger trials to be insufficiently powered to detect statistically significant differences between groups.</P>
<P>In 25 of the included trials, the intervention groups involved in the contracting process also received other interventions intended to improve the measured outcomes. In addition, in 16 of the trials, 1 or more control groups received interventions other than routine care. It is therefore impossible, in most of the trials, to assess the effects of contracts per se compared to routine care; an assessment which would be very relevant for policy makers and consumers.</P>
<P>Contracts were described in varying degrees of detail, but they hardly met all assumptions as described by Quill (<LINK REF="REF-Quill-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quill 1983</LINK>): terms and conditions explicitly stated; parties have unique responsibilities; the relationship between practitioners and patients is consensual, not obligatory; and all parties are able to negotiate. Furthermore, in the concordance paradigm (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2003</LINK>) contracts should not be simply understood as a way to engage patients to comply with a predefined set of instructions, but rather as a strategy to involve patients into a shared decision-making process (<LINK REF="REF-Charles-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charles 1997</LINK>). The requirements for shared decision making - such as mechanisms for patients' preferences to be taken into account, information sharing and common decision on the regimens to follow - were even more difficult to find in the included trials.</P>
<P>The great variety of health problems or areas, participants, interventions, control groups and outcomes precluded any attempt to pool data for meta-analysis. The areas with the largest number of trials were those of substance addictions and hypertension. The data presented in the graphs has to be interpreted with caution, because we only included trials and outcomes with complete sets of data. Apart from one trial on adherence to antibiotic regimens for acute bacterial infections (<LINK REF="STD-Putnam-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Putnam 1994</LINK>), all trials were related to chronic conditions.</P>
<P>Four of the seven trials dealing with alcohol or opiate addictions reported statistically significant differences in several outcomes favouring the contracts group. The findings in the review by Miller (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2002</LINK>) placed behavioural contracts as one of the top 10 (out of 46) treatment modalities for alcohol abuse (although important publication bias could not be ruled out in that review). However, some of those positive effects seen in our review were not consistent in all repeated measures over time. We could not identify any trial addressing the effects of opioid contracts in the management of opioids for the relief of chronic pain; contracts which are widely used but of doubtful efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the area of smoking cessation (evaluated in three trials), our findings seem to agree with those in a review examining another behavioural intervention, namely competitions and incentives (<LINK REF="REF-Hey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hey 2005</LINK>): studies were underpowered and of variable quality. Furthermore, neither incentives, nor competitions, nor contracts, seemed to enhance long-term cessation rates. In this review, the only positive effect reported (mean number of cigarettes smoked at several periods in time; <LINK REF="STD-Brockway-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Brockway 1977</LINK>) vanished when measured at 12 months follow up.</P>
<P>All three trials about hypertension that reported blood pressure outcomes showed no differences between groups on blood pressure measurements (except for better diastolic blood pressure in the contracts group in <LINK REF="STD-Swain-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1981</LINK>).<I> </I>Adherence outcomes were both better (<LINK REF="STD-Swain-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swain 1981</LINK>) and worse (<LINK REF="STD-Hoelscher-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hoelscher 1986</LINK>) in the contracts groups compared with the controls. Contracts in the context of hypertension seem relatively unexplored, despite the fact that in many countries blood pressure control falls far short of treatment goals and the recognised relevance of behavioural interventions to achieve those goals (<LINK REF="REF-Reunion-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reunion 2006</LINK>). The evidence from the included trials supporting the use of contracts for hypertension was very weak.</P>
<P>The external validity of the findings in the included trials is very limited, due to several factors: their narrow geographical scope; the settings which were specially established for research purposes in most cases; the ways that participants were recruited (for example, by advertisements); and the complexity and variety of contracts, co-interventions and control group conditions, together with the inconsistent descriptions of those interventions. All these features discouraged any attempt to conduct a sub-group analysis, since it would not be possible to control for each one of those factors. In many cases it is difficult, if not impossible, therefore, to attribute the effects seen to the impact of contracts alone. Furthermore, in many trials the selection criteria for participants were very stringent. It seems unlikely that the findings of these trials can be extrapolated to complex real situations as seen, for example, in young black men of deprived communities in whom depression, substance use (alcohol, tobacco and others), poor adherence and poor blood pressure outcomes have all been identified as related (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are some other critical factors to consider when deciding whether to introduce contracting within a healthcare delivery system. The included trials have addressed these factors little, if at all, namely: acceptability of contracts to healthcare practitioners; participants', patients' and carers' satisfaction; costs; clinicians' liability, perpetuation of stigma in patients (<LINK REF="REF-Fishman-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fishman 2002b</LINK>); and ethical considerations, especially where receiving treatment depends on patients adhering to the terms of the contract, or where financial rewards are used. Some of the outcomes listed in the protocol for this review addressed issues such as patients' participation in the contractual process, degree of shared decision making, harms or ethical issues; but none of the trials reported data on them. The lack of reporting on consumer participation highlights the provider-centred approach, by which adherence is mainly seen as a patient's duty and practitioners remain in a patronising role; far from the concordance model. This may be partially due to the fact that most of the trials were conducted more than one decade ago. Future studies should also address the issue of harms. We saw in <LINK REF="STD-Hoelscher-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Hoelscher 1986</LINK> that the contracts group performed worse in adhering to relaxation practices. But contracts might also reduce the retention rate of patients, or affect the sincerity with which patients report events that may breach the terms of the contract.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-07-02 13:06:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Existing small trials suggest that contracts may have a positive effect. This needs further evaluation with large, good quality randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of patient contracts within established health systems. These should be:<BR/>

<UL>
<LI>designed to allow the effects of contracts and any co-interventions to be assessed separately, as well as in combination where appropriate, taking into account the different features of contracts.</LI>
