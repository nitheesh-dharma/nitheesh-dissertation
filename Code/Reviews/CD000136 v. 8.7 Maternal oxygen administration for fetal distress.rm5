<P>Too little evidence to show whether oxygen administration to the woman during labour is beneficial to the baby.</P>
<P>Some babies show signs of distress, such as unusual heart rates or the passing of a bowel motion (meconium) during their mother's labour. This may be caused by a lack of oxygen passing from the woman to the baby through the placenta. Sometimes, women may be encouraged to breathe extra oxygen through a facemask (oxygen administration) to increase the oxygen available to the unborn baby. A review of two trials found too little evidence to show whether oxygen administration to the woman during the second stage of labour is beneficial to the baby. No trials of oxygen administration when the baby is showing signs of distress were found. Further research is needed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-11-08 14:18:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Maternal oxygen administration has been used in an attempt to lessen fetal distress by increasing the available oxygen from the mother. This has been used for suspected fetal distress during labour, and prophylactically during the second stage of labour on the assumption that the second stage is a time of high risk for fetal distress. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of maternal oxygenation for fetal distress during labour and to assess the effects of prophylactic oxygen therapy during the second stage of labour on perinatal outcome.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We located no trials addressing maternal oxygen therapy for fetal distress. We included two trials which addressed prophylactic oxygen administration during labour. Abnormal cord blood pH values (less than 7.2) were recorded significantly more frequently in the oxygenation group than the control group (RR 3.51, 95% CI 1.34 to 9.19). There were no other statistically significant differences between the groups. There were conflicting conclusions on the effect of the duration of oxygen administration on umbilical artery pH values between the two trials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-11-13 09:58:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-11-13 09:58:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The diagnosis of suspected fetal distress during labour, usually on the basis of fetal heart rate parameters or fetal scalp blood pH measurement, is always considered an emergency. The importance attached to it derives from the perceived association of fetal hypoxia (low oxygen levels) with perinatal morbidity/mortality and long-term disability (<LINK REF="REF-Marlow-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marlow 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Physiological studies support the notion of a relationship between maternal oxygenation and fetal wellbeing. In a randomized cross-over study, fetal habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation was normal in 17 of 18 women with normal pregnancies at term, but in only two of the 18 when breathing a 12% oxygen in nitrogen mixture (<LINK REF="REF-Leader-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leader 1988</LINK>). Thus, among other measures, maternal oxygen therapy is commonly employed, albeit empirically, in the clinical management of suspected fetal distress. So deeply entrenched is its use in clinical practice that healthcare workers almost intuitively administer oxygen at the first suspicion of fetal distress. Oxygen administration has also been used prophylactically in the second stage of labour on the assumption that this is a time of high risk for fetal distress.</P>
<P>Despite this widespread use, controversy persists concerning the benefits of administered maternal oxygen for the fetus. Some studies suggest a beneficial effect (<LINK REF="REF-Althabe-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Althabe 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gare-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gare 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNamara-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willcourt-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willcourt 1983</LINK>). Other authors report otherwise. <LINK REF="REF-Saling-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saling 1963</LINK> attributed the transient rise in partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) followed by a simultaneous drop in fetal pH and a rise in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) after maternal oxygen therapy to the effects of hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction of placenta vessels. <LINK REF="REF-Perreault-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perreault 1992</LINK> found no effect on umbilical cord blood gas values following a brief period of maternal hyper-oxygenation immediately before caesarean section. Interpretation of these studies is difficult as they were conducted in diverse clinical settings, and applying differing methodologies and variable biochemical techniques for blood gas and fetal acid-base assessment. Extrapolating from animal studies, <LINK REF="REF-Lofaso-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lofaso 2007</LINK> cautions that the inhibitory effects of hyperoxia may compromise oxygenation after oxygen administration, particularly in preterm infants. However, <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2005</LINK> demonstrated increased fetal oxygen saturation following maternal oxygen administration during the first stage of labour. The increase was more pronounced in fetuses with fetal oxygen saturation less than 40%, compared with those with higher oxygen content. This effect was reported to persist for more than half an hour after the oxygen was discontinued.</P>
<P>In support of the argument that maternal oxygen therapy has an appreciable effect on fetal oxygenation, <LINK REF="REF-Meschia-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meschia 1999</LINK> contends that when the oxygen content is considered rather than focusing on fetal PO2 changes alone, oxygen therapy can cause similar increments in maternal and fetal blood. <LINK REF="REF-Glazier-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glazier 1999</LINK> describes the oxygen content of the blood perfusing the placenta from the umbilical arteries as the single most important determinant of oxygen transfer from maternal to fetal blood.</P>
<P>Given the current level of uncertainty about the use of oxygen during labour, it is not strange that the indications, duration, mode of administration and the optimal concentration remain contentious. Surprisingly, no randomized clinical trials have to our knowledge assessed the effectiveness of maternal oxygen therapy for fetal distress.</P>
<P>This review evaluated the effects of maternal oxygen therapy during labour in women with or without suspected fetal distress.</P>

<P>The search strategy identified six reports of studies for potential inclusion. <LINK REF="STD-Sirimai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirimai 1997</LINK> prospectively randomized 160 women with normal labour to receive either oxygen throughout the second stage of labour or no oxygen. <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1995</LINK> also randomized 86 women at the onset of the second stage of labour to receive oxygen administration by face mask or no oxygen. These two studies met the inclusion criteria for this review (<I>see</I> table of '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>').</P>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jozwik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jozwik 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lawes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lawes 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nesterenko-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nesterenko 2012</LINK>) were excluded from the review (<I>see</I> table of '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). <LINK REF="STD-Lawes-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Lawes 1988</LINK> investigated the effect of maternal oxygen concentration (50% versus 33%) on neonatal status in women who had caesarean section under general anaesthesia. This study was excluded because the study design was not randomized and thus did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. <LINK REF="STD-Jozwik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jozwik 2000</LINK> compared 17 women in the second stage of labour who were given oxygen by face mask with 343 controls and 24 women scheduled for elective caesarean section who had 60% oxygen at 15 litres/minute for 15 minutes compared with 116 controls. We excluded the study because it was not a randomized controlled trial. <LINK REF="STD-Simpson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Simpson 2005</LINK> prospectively evaluated three intrauterine resuscitation techniques, namely administration of intravenous fluid, maternal position and oxygen administration. Maternal fluid administration and position were evaluated using randomized design, but investigation of the effects of oxygen administration was not by a randomized design. We also excluded this trial. There were two study reports for the <LINK REF="STD-Nesterenko-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nesterenko 2012</LINK> trial. This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. <LINK REF="STD-Nesterenko-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Nesterenko 2012</LINK> investigated the effects of maternal oxygen administration (2L/min) for at least 30 minutes before delivery on maternal and umbilical cord blood concentrations of SOD and glutathione (GSSG); 30 women were randomized to Oxygen group and 26 women into the Room Air group. This trial was excluded because maternal oxygen administration was not for fetal distress and participants were not specifically stated to be in the second stage of labour.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1995</LINK>, randomization was by sealed envelopes, but no further details were given. One woman randomized to the oxygenation group was excluded because of caesarean section for cord prolapse before full cervical dilation. An imbalance in the analgesia received by the oxygenation group compared with the control group is not accounted for (narcotic only: 12% versus 41% in the control group, P &lt; 0.05; epidural: 71% versus 18%, respectively). No masking by means of dummy oxygen therapy was used. Compliance with oxygen therapy was reasonable.</P>
<P>The method of randomization in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Sirimai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirimai 1997</LINK> was not stated. The report was available in abstract form only and contained minimal data for analysis. It was, however, included because there were not enough good quality trials addressing the question. Interpretation of the findings from the trial consequently needs to be done with circumspection.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>We found no trials that assessed the effects of maternal oxygen therapy in fetal distress. Two randomized trials (<LINK REF="STD-Sirimai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirimai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1995</LINK>) assessed the use of prophylactic maternal oxygen therapy during the second stage of uncomplicated labour. Randomization was not employed in a Polish trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jozwik-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Jozwik 2000</LINK>) that also assessed prophylactic maternal oxygen therapy during labour. We excluded this trial. </P>
<P>We sought all the prespecified outcomes listed under 'Types of outcome measures'. We included two additional outcomes (cord arterial blood oxygen content (mg/dl) and cord arterial blood oxygen saturation (%)) after discussion between the review authors.<BR/> <BR/>Abnormal cord blood pH values (&lt; 7.2) were significantly more frequent in the oxygenation group than the controls (relative risk 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 9.19). There was a tendency towards reduced cord arterial blood oxygen content and oxygen saturation in mothers treated with oxygen compared with controls: weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.80, 95% CI -2.29 to 0.69 and WMD -4.40, 95% CI -11.22 to 2.42 respectively. Other blood gas parameters also tended to favour the control group. These differences between the groups were not statistically significant. </P>
<P>Data on the effect of duration of oxygen administration were not presented in a uniform format suitable for combination. In the <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1995</LINK> trial, those receiving oxygenation for less than 10 minutes had higher umbilical artery pH values than those receiving oxygenation for longer than 10 minutes and the umbilical artery pH was also significantly higher in infants receiving oxygenation for less than 10 minutes than controls. The duration of maternal oxygen administration had no effect on cord arterial blood pH in the <LINK REF="STD-Sirimai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirimai 1997</LINK> trial. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>There were conflicting observations about the effects of the duration of maternal oxygenation on cord arterial blood pH in the two trials. Whereas <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1995</LINK> suggested that short-term oxygenation may be beneficial and long-term oxygenation harmful, <LINK REF="STD-Sirimai-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sirimai 1997</LINK> reported that prolonged use of oxygen did not affect fetal acid-base status. However, neither trial addressed the question of the duration of oxygen therapy in a randomized format. Thus the conclusions should be regarded as speculative.</P>
<P>It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from some of the measures of outcome in this review as they suffered from small numbers or wide confidence intervals, or both. These included Apgar scores less than seven at one and five minutes, assisted vaginal delivery, caesarean section, and the cord arterial blood oxygen saturation.</P>
<P>Maternal oxygen administration did not significantly affect the cord blood arterial blood oxygen content and the need for neonatal resuscitation. However, there were significantly more infants whose mothers received oxygen with cord arterial pH less than 7.2 compared with the infants of controls.</P>
<P>Remarkably, no trials on maternal oxygen administration for fetal distress were identified. </P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-30 19:09:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The evidence available for this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal oxygen therapy during labour. We are not aware of randomized clinical trials to guide practice concerning the therapeutic use of maternal oxygen therapy for fetal distress.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-30 19:09:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In view of the widespread use of maternal oxygen therapy for fetal distress and the lack of consensus concerning its usefulness or possible harmfulness, it is most important that appropriate randomized trials be carried out in this field. Trials should specify whether the supine position, which may impair fetal oxygenation, was systematically avoided.</P>
<P>There are apparent gaps between basic medical science information and clinical practice. The following areas need elucidation upon which subsequent clinical research could be based.</P>
<OL>
<LI>The response of umbilical cord vessels to hyper-oxygenation.</LI>
<LI>The effect of the duration of hyper-oxygenation on umbilical cord vessels.</LI>
<LI>The effect of hyper-oxygenation on umbilical cord blood gas and fetal acid-base status.</LI>
<LI>The assessment of the most reliable indicator(s) of materno-fetal exchange and fetal well-being.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Doppler studies may be a useful way to assess the fetal response to maternal oxygen therapy.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data collection and analysis  </HEADING>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>We independently assessed for inclusion all potential trials we identified as a result of the search strategy, without consideration of the results. We resolved any disagreement through discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management  </HEADING>
<P>We designed a form to extract data. Both authors independently extracted data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We used the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>) to double enter all the data. When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we contacted the authors of the original reports to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies  </HEADING>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>). Methods used for the generation of the randomization sequence was described for each trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Selection bias (randomization and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>We assigned a quality score for each trial, using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation: such as telephone randomization, consecutively-numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether adequate concealment of allocation: such as list or table used, sealed envelopes, or study does not report any concealment approach;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation: such as open list of random-number tables, use of case record numbers, dates of birth or days of the week.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Attrition bias (loss of participant e.g. withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed completeness to follow up using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of loss of participants;<BR/>(B) 5% to 9.9% of loss to follow up;<BR/>(C) 10% to 19.9% loss of participants;<BR/>(D) more than 20% loss of participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>We assessed blinding using the following criteria:<BR/>(1) blinding of participants (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(2) blinding of caregiver (yes/no/unclear);<BR/>(3) blinding of outcome assessment (yes/no/unclear).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect  </HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data in the absence of significant heterogeneity if trials were sufficiently similar. If we found heterogeneity, we explored this by sensitivity analysis followed by random-effects if required.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we used the weighted mean difference (WMD) when outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We intended to utilize standardized mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data  </HEADING>
<P>We analyzed data on all participants with available data in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. If in the original reports participants were not analyzed in the group to which they were randomized, and there was sufficient information in the trial report, we restored them to the correct group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity  </HEADING>
<P>We applied test of heterogeneity between trials using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. We considered I<SUP>2</SUP> values greater than 50% as indicating substantial heterogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2005</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We will resolve any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.</P>
<P>We will assess the method as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4"> (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.   </LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We will consider that studies are at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judge that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;</LI>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.  We will assess blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.</P>
<P>We will assess methods used to blind outcome assessment as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low, high or unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We will state whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.  Where sufficient information is reported, or can be supplied by the trial authors, we will re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertake.</P>
<P>We will assess methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; &#8216;as treated&#8217; analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk of bias.</LI>
</UL>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We will assess the methods as:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)</HEADING>
<P>We will describe for each included study any important concerns we have about other possible sources of bias.</P>
<P>We will assess whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We will make explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we will assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.  We will explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>Sensitivity analysis. </P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>For dichotomous data, we will present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals.<I> </I>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous data</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data, we will use the mean difference if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. We will use the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measure the same outcome, but use different methods. <B> </B>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dealing with missing data</HEADING>
<P>For included studies, we will note levels of attrition. We will explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we will carry out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we will attempt to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants will be analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial will be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>We will assess statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the T², I² and Chi² statistics. We will regard heterogeneity as substantial if I² is greater than 30% and either T² is greater than zero, or there is a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity.<B> </B>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>If there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually, and use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry. For continuous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>, and for dichotomous outcomes we will use the test proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Harbord-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harbord 2006</LINK>. If asymmetry is detected in any of these tests or is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We will use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it is reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods are judged sufficiently similar. If there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differ between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful we will not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>If we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>We will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effects of trial quality assessed by allocation concealment and other risk of bias components, by omitting studies rated as inadequate for these components. We will restrict this to the primary outcomes.</P>
