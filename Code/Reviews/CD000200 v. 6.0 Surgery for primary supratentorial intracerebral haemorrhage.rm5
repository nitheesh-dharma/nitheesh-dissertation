<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-03 14:12:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is evidence of benefit from surgical removal of the blood clot formed after a stroke due to bleeding in the brain. Most strokes are due to the blockage of an artery to one part of the brain; these are called ischaemic strokes. Some strokes occur because blood leaks from a blood vessel into the brain matter where it clots; this is called a brain haemorrhage and is an event that threatens life, limbs and speech. Various types of surgical operation can be performed to remove the blood blot, with the aim of improving the patient's chance of being alive and independent after the stroke. The review authors set out to determine whether surgery within 24 to 72 hours of onset of symptoms decreases the risk of death or dependence; and whether one surgical technique is better than another. Endoscopic or stereotactic surgery inserts a fine catheter rather than having to open up the skull (craniotomy) to get to the blood clot. This updated review included 10 studies in which a total of 2059 participants received medical treatment, but 50% also had surgery within 72 hours of onset of the event. Surgery was associated with significant benefit and improved the proportion of participants alive and independent. However, the benefit was not consistent in all the studies, which suggests that this result may not be very reliable. Overall, surgery appeared promising, though further trials are underway to identify the type of patients most likely to benefit from surgery.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-16 11:34:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>There is considerable international variation in the rate and indications of surgery for primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma, reflecting the uncertainty about the effects of surgery. Recently, some large randomised trials have appeared in the literature but the controversy over its role continues. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1997, and previously updated in 1999.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2008-04-03 14:02:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To assess the effects of surgery plus routine medical management, compared with routine medical management alone, in patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-04-03 14:23:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched June 2007), checked reference lists of relevant articles and contacted authors of relevant trials. In addition, for the original version of this review we handsearched two journals, <I>Current Opinion in Neurology and Neurosurgery</I>, and <I>Neurosurgical Clinics of North America</I> (1991 to July 1993), and three monographs. We contacted study authors for relevant information.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-04-04 14:35:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised trials of routine medical treatment plus intracranial surgery compared with routine medical treatment alone in patients with CT-confirmed primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma. Intracranial surgery included craniotomy, stereotactic endoscopic evacuation or stereotactic aspiration.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-03 14:03:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-27 15:48:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten trials with 2059 participants were included. The quality of most of the trials was acceptable but not high. Because of this and as the overall result was sensitive to the losses to follow up in the largest trial, the estimates of effect may not be robust and may be subject to bias. Surgery was associated with statistically significant reduction in the odds of being dead or dependent at final follow up (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.88; 2P = 0.001) with no significant heterogeneity among the study results. Surgery was also associated with significant reduction in the odds of death at final follow up (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 2P = 0.003); however, there was significant heterogeneity for death as outcome.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-04-03 14:07:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>In patients with CT-proven primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage, surgery added to medical management reduces the odds of being dead or dependent compared with medical management alone, but the result is not very robust. Hence, further randomised trials to identify which patients benefit from surgery and to evaluate less invasive methods are indicated.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-13 12:47:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The role of surgery in the treatment of primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma is controversial. This is reflected in the wide international variation in the use of surgery in the management of primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma. While reports from Germany and Japan indicate the use of surgery in 50% or more of patients with this condition (<LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mohadjer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mohadjer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nizuma-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nizuma 1989</LINK>), those from other parts of the world indicate its use in only 3% to 20% of patients (<LINK REF="REF-Broderick-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broderick 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franke-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franke 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gregson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregson 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several descriptive reviews have appeared in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaufman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaufman 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kopotnik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kopotnik 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unwin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unwin 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Task-Force-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Task Force 1989</LINK>), but their recommendations on the indications for surgery are conflicting. Some point to the lack of effectiveness of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2007</LINK>), some recommend surgery in cases with large primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Task-Force-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Task Force 1989</LINK>), while others recommend it only for small subcortical hematomas (<LINK REF="REF-Feldmann-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feldmann 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Unwin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Unwin 1992</LINK>). Three meta-analyses have been published on the topic, but none had enough trial participants to arrive at definitive conclusions. Two relatively large randomised controlled trials (RCT) (<LINK REF="STD-Hattori-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hattori 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelow 2005</LINK>) appeared recently in the literature providing us with an opportunity to increase the power of the meta-analysis with the potential to come to a definite conclusion.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 1, 1997. This updated Cochrane review brings together all the available randomised evidence on the role of surgery in primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma.</P>

<P>We included patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haematoma confirmed by CT scanning prior to randomisation. We did not include patients with infratentorial haematomas because there seems to be a consensus among experts on the role of surgery in these haematomas (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-Task-Force-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Task Force 1989</LINK>). Thus the degree of uncertainty required for justifying randomised trials for the infratentorial haematomas may not exist.</P>

<P>Death at the end of follow up. We considered a follow up of six months after randomisation desirable.

The cut-off point for the various scales to define independence in ADL were 60 or more for the Barthel Index, grade 2 or better for the Rankin Scale and grade 4 or 5 for the Glasgow Outcome Scale.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-04-16 15:05:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, which was last searched by the Review Group Co-ordinator in June 2007. In addition, we scanned reference lists of all articles found to identify additional relevant articles and contacted authors to obtain additional information for relevant trials. For the original version of this review we handsearched <I>Current Opinion in Neurology and Neurosurgery</I> and <I>Neurosurgical Clinics of North America</I> from January 1991 to July 1993 for articles on intracerebral haemorrhage. We also scanned reference lists for clinical trials comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment. We also searched three monographs for clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-Mizukami-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizukami 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pia-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pia 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Suzuki-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suzuki 1988</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-23 09:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors (KP, BG) selected trials for inclusion in the review. For each included trial, we extracted information about the method of randomisation, blinding of outcome evaluators, whether CT scanning was used for diagnosis and whether all the randomised participants were accounted for in the analysis. We contacted the trial authors if the above information was not available in the published reports.</P>
<P>We selected death and functional status (dependent/independent in ADL) as outcome measures because they are clinically relevant. Death alone was considered inadequate because clinicians would like to know whether survivors are functionally dependent or independent. We used the composite outcome of death or dependence in ADL as the primary outcome for the analysis.</P>
<P>We extracted data on the number of deaths and functional status among survivors from the articles. Each trial used a different scale for assessing functional status (<I>see </I>'Characteristics of included studies'). We adopted the categories of dead, dependent, independent (<LINK REF="STD-Juvela-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Juvela 1989</LINK>) and reclassified the outcome in all the papers into two categories: (1) dead or dependent; and (2) independent. We considered Batjer's level 2 (dependent at home or institution) (<LINK REF="STD-Batjer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Batjer 1990</LINK>) and Auer's Grade 5 (patient totally dependent on others for activities of the day) (<LINK REF="STD-Auer-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Auer 1989</LINK>) in the dependent category; we considered participants whose functional status was better than these categories to be independent.</P>
<P>Due to concerns about differences in the expected risks and benefits of craniotomy and stereotactic or endoscopic evacuation, we considered the possibility that effectiveness may differ according to the surgical technique used. Accordingly, we analysed data from the various studies in two sub-categories: (1) craniotomy, and (2) stereotactic/endoscopic/others. For this we grouped the studies according to the surgical technique. The STICH study had both kinds of technique, accordingly its data were split into the relevant groups (<LINK REF="STD-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelow 2005</LINK>). We calculated the summary effect estimates for each of the techniques separately. We used the test of interaction to compare the two summary estimates.</P>
<P>We used odds ratios (OR) as the effect parameter for meta-analysis. We used a fixed-effect model for combining the results from different studies. We used the 95% confidence interval (CI) for interpreting the results. We assessed heterogeneity among the trial results using the chi-square test and I square (I<SUP>2</SUP>). A P value of 0.10 or less was taken as statistically significant and I<SUP>2</SUP> of 25%, 50% and 75% were considered as low, moderate and high heterogeneity respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>We calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) using the NNT calculator on the Cochrane Stroke Group website (http://www.dcn.ed.ac.uk/csrg/nnt2calc.asp). We entered ORs and their 95% CIs. We used control event rates of 0.7 for death or dependence and 0.32 for death for the calculation.<BR/>
<BR/>We conducted several sensitivity analyses: for participants lost to follow up we did a worst-case scenario analysis (in which all lost to follow up from the control group are considered to have a favourable outcome, and those from the experimental arm to have a unfavourable outcome) to examine whether the results were sensitive to this assumption. We also examined if and how the results change under the random-effects model. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the two medical arms of Batjer et al separately in comparisons with the surgical arm (see below) (<LINK REF="STD-Batjer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Batjer 1990</LINK>).<BR/>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-06-30 09:53:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Eighteen studies were considered, 10 have been included in the analysis (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>) bringing the total number of participants to 2059. In this update, seven new studies have been added (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hattori-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hattori 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hosseini-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hosseini 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelow 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morgenstern-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Morgenstern 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Teernstra-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Teernstra 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarello 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1992</LINK>) has been excluded because of the lack of data on post-randomisation withdrawal from the surgical arm, and gross prognostic imbalance between the two arms at baseline. One study (Chen 1998) was excluded because of gross prognostic imbalance between the two arms at baseline (<I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kanaya-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kanaya 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peresdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peresdov 1990</LINK>) have been cited in some places as randomised trials, but after discussion with the translators, they were found to be non-randomised studies and hence were not included in the analysis. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2001</LINK>) was excluded because it was a matched pair design, not a truly randomised study. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Su-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Su 1999</LINK>) compared two surgical approaches (craniotomy versus haematoma breaking and drainage) and hence was outside the scope of this review. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Winking-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Winking 1998</LINK>) is a cross-sectional study and had no clinical outcome at follow up.</P>
<P>The surgical interventions vary across the studies. Some had craniotomy, while others used stereotaxy and some had both. Even with stereotaxy, some used aspiration and some endoscopic evacuation. Some studies used urokinase to liquefy the haematoma and aspirated intermittently for 48 hours. The details are provided for each study in the 'Charactersitics of included studies' table, under the Interventions column.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Batjer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Batjer 1990</LINK>) had three treatment arms: two medical arms (medical therapy alone, medical therapy plus intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring), and one surgical arm (medical therapy plus craniotomy). Both medical arms were combined in the analysis. One may argue that the combined medical group is not comparable to the surgical arm, rather the two medical arms are individually comparable to the surgical arm, according to the randomisation scheme. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using the two medical arms separately in comparisons with the surgical arm.</P>
<P>The age, sex and other inclusion criteria of the included trials has been given in 'Characteristics of included studies'. It may be noted that in all the trials, the intent was to exclude patients with aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, trauma or tumour, and in most of them any bleeding disorder. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Batjer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Batjer 1990</LINK>) required a documented history of hypertension (160/95 mm Hg or above).</P>
<P>Participants were predominantly male (56% to 60%), had an average age between 57 to 69 years, arriving within 72 hours of onset (most of them within 24 hours), with an average haematoma volume between 37 ml to 66 ml (most of them between 40 ml to 50 ml), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4 to 15 (eye motor score 2 to 10). Surgery was mostly done within 24 hours of onset (none above 99 hours after onset).</P>
<P>Some of the scales used for outcome measurement in the trials have not been formally assessed for reliability and validity. This may not be important for death as an outcome but clearly is for assessing dependence in ADL. The results should be read with this caveat in mind.</P>

<P>The volume of the haematoma is the most powerful predictor of outcome in intracerebral haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Broderick-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broderick 1993</LINK>).

<P>We included 10 trials in the analysis. The kappa for the decision to include or exclude a study from the review was 0.75, which is excellent according to Landis and Koch (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 1977</LINK>). We excluded two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kanaya-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Kanaya 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peresdov-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Peresdov 1990</LINK>) because on closer evaluation with the help of translators, they were found to be non-randomised studies. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-McKissock-1961" TYPE="STUDY">McKissock 1961</LINK>) included in the previous review, did not use CT scanning for diagnosis and therefore may inadvertently have included patients with ischaemic stroke. In current practice, surgery is not considered without confirmation of intracerebral haemorrhage with CT. Therefore, we excluded this trial. The total number of participants included was 2059 with 609 deaths. For the composite outcome death or dependency, data were available for 2000 participants with 1335 outcome events.<BR/>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1.1: Death or dependence at end of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for nine studies. Surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of being dead or dependent at final follow up (odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.88; 2P = 0.001). The number needed to operate to prevent one death/dependence (taking the control event rate as 70%) is 14 (95% CI 9 to 37). This summary estimate is more reliable because this meta-analysis was associated with statistically non-significant low heterogeneity (P = 0.22, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 24.7%).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Comparison 1.2: Death at end of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Data were available for 10 studies. The duration of follow up was three months for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cheng-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cheng 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuccarello-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zuccarello 1999</LINK>) and six months for the other eight studies. Surgery was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of death at final follow up (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 2P = 0.003). There was statistically significant moderate heterogeneity in the results among the studies (P = 0.04, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 49%). In absolute terms, with a control event rate of 32%, the number needed to operate to save one additional patient from dying would be approximately 18 (95% CI 11 to 56).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>We examined the effect of changing from a fixed-effect to a random-effects model on the results. For the outcome of being dead or dependent at follow up, the results were similar (random effects OR 0.68 versus fixed effect OR 0.71, and 95% CI was 0.51 to 0.91 for the random model and 0.58 to 0.88 for the fixed model). For death also, the results were generally similar, though point estimates of the random-effects model (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87) indicated a larger favourable outcome than the fixed-effect model (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90).</P>
<P>We also conducted a best-case scenario analysis of participants lost to follow up in the study by Mendelow (<LINK REF="STD-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelow 2005</LINK>). Assuming all those lost to follow up in the surgical arm had a favourable outcome, whereas those lost to follow up in the conservative arm had an unfavourable outcome, we found that surgery was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of an unfavourable outcome. Inclusion of the best-case scenario data for the Mendelow study in the meta-analysis would obviously have further strengthened our conclusions. A worst-case scenario analysis reverses the direction of the study results and its inclusion in the meta-analysis renders the overall results statistically non-significant with a trend in favour of surgery. These sensitivity analyses indicate that the study results are sensitive to the number of participants lost to follow up in the study by Mendelow (<LINK REF="STD-Mendelow-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelow 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis, comparing each medical arm of the Batjer study separately against the surgical arm, did not alter the results as the number of participants is small (<LINK REF="STD-Batjer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Batjer 1990</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>In our earlier version of the review, we had hypothesised a difference in outcome according to type of surgery. Accordingly, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on the type of surgery: craniotomy versus stereotactic or endoscopic. The data were available for only death and dependence. There was a trend of better outcome with stereotactic or endoscopic surgery (OR 0.66) as compared with craniotomy (OR 0.82), but the difference was marginal. However, this difference is not reliable as these studies did not randomise patients into different types of surgery and studying the difference in the effectiveness of various surgical methods was not the primary objective of this review or of any of the included studies. Also the test of interaction was statistically non-significant (P = 0.67).<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-27 15:39:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review provides evidence that surgery significantly decreases the odds of being dead or dependent in patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage. The review brings together all published studies known to the review authors up to June 2007. The meta-analysis is the first to demonstrate that surgery in primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage is effective in reducing the odds of an unfavourable outcome. This conclusion is contrary to the original review which stated that there was not enough evidence to evaluate the effect of craniotomy or stereotactic surgery, or endoscopic evacuation in patients with supratentorial intracerebral haematoma.</P>
<P>We have attempted to bring together all relevant RCTs in this review, but a few unpublished studies might have been missed. However, any such study is likely to be small and unlikely to significantly affect the results. Funnel plots help in detecting publication bias. We visually inspected the funnel plot of the studies, but did not find any striking asymmetry, though the total number of studies is rather too small to show clear asymmetry. We excluded one study because it did not keep any record (not even the number) of those who refused surgery and had a gross imbalance in the number of comatose patients at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 1992</LINK>), and we excluded another study because it was not truly randomised (<LINK REF="STD-Tan-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Tan 2001</LINK>). However, these exclusions were pre-specified (not post-hoc) in the protocol, and do not constitute a significant bias.</P>
<P>The overall methodological quality of the included studies seems reasonable, but was not consistently high. Seven studies, with 72% of the weight, had concealed randomisation and intention-to-treat analysis. Blinding is difficult in surgical trials, but the largest study (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#std-mendelow-2005#std-mendelow-2005">Mendelow 2005</A>) had blinded outcome assessment.</P>
<P>The evidence derives strength from the fact that there is no significant heterogeneity for the primary outcome of death or dependence. However, for death, there is significant heterogeneity. This may indicate that the evidence is not robust. However, all studies except three small ones (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#std-juvela-1989#std-juvela-1989">Juvela 1989</A> having weight of 2.63%) have point estimates in favour of surgery. The confidence intervals are overlapping and I<SUP>2 </SUP>of 46% indicates near moderate heterogeneity. A low (25%) level of heterogeneity lends some strength to the conclusion that surgery may be beneficial, but more evidence would strengthen the results.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Size of benefit</HEADING>
<P>Surgery was associated with a 26% relative reduction in the odds of being dead and 29% in the odds of being dead or dependent. However, since the control event rate is high, the relative odds reduction is potentially misleadingly large. The treatment effects, when expressed as relative risk reductions, are more modest: 18% for death, and 9% for death or dependence. On the other hand, if surgery is being considered in patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage who have a severe prognosis without surgery (for example, 70% risk of being dead or dependent), the absolute benefit from surgery is potentially large and equivalent to a number needed to treat to benefit of 14 to prevent one person from being dead or dependent.<BR/>
<BR/>It is possible that the size of benefit is more than indicated above because the surgical arm in five trials was at a relative disadvantage from the start as the volume of haematomas was larger in the surgical than the medical arm (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#tbl-01#tbl-01">Table 1</A>). As volume is the most powerful predictor of outcome in intracerebral haemorrhage, the imbalance might have led to an underestimation of the benefit. Although the imbalance was small in individual trials, its cumulative effect might have been significant.</P>
<P>It seems likely that timing of surgery may be related to the size of benefit, though this issue was not an objective to be specifically addressed in this review. There are too few studies to address this issue, but one study (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-kaneko-1986#ref-kaneko-1986">Kaneko 1986</A>) has suggested that the earlier surgery is done the better the outcome may be. Individual patient data meta-analysis of all the studies with timing of surgery as a co-variate may allow this issue to be examined.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Deteriorating patients</HEADING>
<P>We wish to emphasise that the trials included in this review have looked at the routine rather than the selective use of surgery in eligible patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. The question of the particular group of patients who deteriorate rapidly and in whom surgery may be contemplated has not been addressed in these trials. Accordingly, this review only addresses the question whether the policy of evacuating haematomas in patients with a primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage (but not deeply comatose Glasgow Coma Scale score 3 to 4) does more good than harm. However, deteriorating patients were included in trials like STICH. Hence the results may apply to deteriorating patients as well.<BR/>
<BR/>A clinically relevant question would be: what kind of patients are likely to benefit? This requires a subgroup analysis or individual patient data analysis. We did not have the outcome data according to subgroups of participants and hence did not conduct the subgroup analysis. Some studies have reported a number of subgroup analyses, even though their overall results were negative. The subgroup analyses are, in general, not reliable when the overall results are statistically non-significant (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-oxman-1992#ref-oxman-1992">Oxman 1992</A>; <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-yusuf-1991#ref-yusuf-1991">Yusuf 1991</A>). We found that study authors frequently presented a plethora of subgroup analyses even when the overall results were statistically unstable. This sometimes yielded clinically unlikely results like 'surgery is better in small subcortical haematomas' (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#std-auer-1989#std-auer-1989">Auer 1989</A>). We suggest that these results should not be blindly accepted as some reviewers seem to have done (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-kaufman-1992#ref-kaufman-1992">Kaufman 1992</A>; <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-mohadjer-1992#ref-mohadjer-1992">Mohadjer 1992</A>; <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-unwin-1992#ref-unwin-1992">Unwin 1992</A>). For reliable and valid subgroup analyses, appropriate methods should be used (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-breslow-1980#ref-breslow-1980">Breslow 1980</A>; <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-oxman-1992#ref-oxman-1992">Oxman 1992</A>; <A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5ba88d1282e26aa2008a9705218135bd&amp;format=revman#ref-yusuf-1991#ref-yusuf-1991">Yusuf 1991</A>).</P>
<P>To whom do the results of the review apply? As the primary studies included in this review had patients early in the course of the disease, patients should be operated as early as possible. Patients who are adults (average age 60 years) below 85 years of age, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score between 5 to 15, having altered consciousness or severe neurological deficit, and coming within 24 hours of onset represent a typical patient in the included studies and are most likely candidates to benefit from surgery. None of the studies included patients after 72 hours of onset, and therefore, we do not know whether surgery will benefit those operated beyond 72 hours of onset.</P>
<P>A comment about the STICH trial is warranted because this is the largest study relevant to the review. Some neurosurgeons interpret the results of the STICH trial as negative and justify denying neurosurgery to all kinds of patients with primary supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage. This is plainly inaccurate. Nearly a quarter of participants in the medical arm of the STICH trial had surgery, mainly because of their deteriorating clinical condition. A more rational interpretation of the STICH trial would be that there is no statistically significant difference in outcomes between the policy of surgery done early in all eligible patients and that of surgery done only in those who deteriorate. </P>

<P>The main reason is lack of data for the number and characteristics of participants randomised in the trial. Several participants randomised to the surgical arm refused to undergo surgery and were withdrawn from the trial. Even the number of such withdrawals were not recorded. The selective withdrawal resulted in gross imbalance in the distribution of baseline prognostic factors between the two arms of the trial (29 participants in the surgical group and only 6 in the medical group were in coma or deep coma). It is doubtful whether randomisation was carried out properly. Neither intention-to-treat nor sensitivity analysis is possible.</P>
