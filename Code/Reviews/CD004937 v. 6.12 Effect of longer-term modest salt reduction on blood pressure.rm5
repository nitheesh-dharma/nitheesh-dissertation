<LI>A new search was performed using a search strategy modified from our previous one.</LI>
<LI>Two new trials (one in hypertensives and the other included both hypertensive and normotensive individuals) that met our inclusion criteria have been added to the current update.</LI>
<LI>Meta-regression (multiple regression model) was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity and also to examine whether there was a dose-response relationship between the change in 24-h urinary sodium and the change in blood pressure (BP).</LI>
<LI>Further subgroup analyses were performed on BP, i.e. stratified by ethnic group and sex, for hypertensives and normotensives respectively.</LI>
<LI>Pooled analyses were carried out for plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides.</LI>

<P>
<B>Summary results:</B>
</P>
<P>Our updated review confirms that a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure significantly in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, and the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in blood pressure.</P>
<P>Compared with our previous review, our current update demonstrates that the effects of salt reduction on systolic blood pressure are significant in both whites and blacks, men and women. Furthermore, our updated review demonstrates that, with a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake, there is only a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or triglycerides. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population blood pressure and reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-28 12:29:19 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The public health recommendations in most countries are to reduce salt intake from the current levels of approximately 9-12 grams per day to less than 5-6 grams per day. Our pooled analysis of randomised trials of 4 weeks or more in duration shows that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure both in individuals with raised blood pressure and in those with normal blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure is shown in both whites and blacks, men and women. Additionally, our results show that a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake has no adverse effect on hormone and lipid levels. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population blood pressure and reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the fact that the lower the salt intake, the lower the blood pressure. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5-6 grams per day will lower blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3 grams per day will lower blood pressure more. Therefore, 3 grams per day should become the long-term target for population salt intake.</P>

<P>A reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure (BP) and, thereby, reduces cardiovascular risk. A recent meta-analysis by Graudal implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with BP reduction. However, Graudal's meta-analysis included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, and such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations for a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake. We have updated our Cochrane meta-analysis.  </P>

<P>Thirty-four trials (3230 participants) were included. Meta-analysis showed that the mean change in urinary sodium (reduced salt vs usual salt) was -75 mmol/24-h (equivalent to a reduction of 4.4 g/d salt), the mean change in BP was -4.18 mmHg (95% CI: -5.18 to -3.18, <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP>=75%) for systolic and -2.06 mmHg (95% CI: -2.67 to -1.45, <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP>=68%) for diastolic BP. Meta-regression showed that age, ethnic group, BP status (hypertensive or normotensive) and the change in 24-h urinary sodium were all significantly associated with the fall in systolic BP, explaining 68% of the variance between studies. A 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/day salt) was associated with a fall in systolic BP of 5.8 mmHg (95%CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and the change in 24-h urinary sodium explained 41% of the variance between studies. Meta-analysis by subgroup showed that, in hypertensives, the mean effect was -5.39 mmHg (95% CI: -6.62 to -4.15, <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP>=61%) for systolic and -2.82 mmHg (95% CI: -3.54 to -2.11, <I>I</I>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-28 12:27:53 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A modest reduction in salt intake for 4 or more weeks causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, irrespective of sex and ethnic group. With salt reduction, there is a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. There is no significant change in lipid levels. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, reduce cardiovascular disease. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a significant association between the reduction in 24-h urinary sodium and the fall in systolic BP, indicating the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake from 9-12 to 5-6 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect and should become the long term target for population salt intake.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-12 05:05:07 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current public health recommendations in most countries are to reduce salt intake from approximately 9-12 g/d to 5-6 g/d (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SACN-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">SACN 2003</LINK>). There is much evidence demonstrating that such a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure (BP). The evidence comes from different types of studies including epidemiological, migration, population-based intervention, genetic and animal studies, as well as treatment trials (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poulter-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poulter 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Forte-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forte 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lifton-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lifton 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Denton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Denton 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2002</LINK>). As raised BP throughout its range is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, a reduction in salt intake lowers BP and, therefore, would reduce cardiovascular risk. Indeed, both prospective cohort studies and outcome trials have demonstrated that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Strazzullo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strazzullo 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-He-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite the evidence above, a recent meta-analysis by Graudal et al (<LINK REF="REF-Graudal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graudal--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2012</LINK>) implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on hormones and lipids which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with the reduction in BP. However, Graudal et al's meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Graudal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graudal--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2012</LINK>) is flawed from a public health perspective, as they included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, e.g. from 20 to less than 1 g/d for only 4-5 days, and such metabolic studies are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of time. We have updated our Cochrane meta-analysis to determine the effects of a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake (i.e. of public health relevance) on BP, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, noradrenaline, adrenaline, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides, as well as further sub-group analyses to study the effects of salt reduction on BP by ethnic group and sex.    </P>

<P>In our first meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-He-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2002</LINK>), we developed a search strategy to search for randomised salt reduction trials. In this current update, our original search strategy was modified by Douglas Salzwedel, Trials Search Coordinator at the Cochrane Hypertension Group. Using the updated strategy, the following electronic databases were searched:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register 1948 to November 2012;</LI>
<LI>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 11, 2012;</LI>
<LI>Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to November 2012;</LI>
<LI>Ovid Embase 1974 to November 2012</LI>
</UL>
<P>Additionally, we reviewed reference list of relevant original and review articles to search for more trials. There were no language restrictions. Electronic databases were searched using a strategy combining the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE with selected MeSH and free text terms for salt and blood pressure. The MEDLINE search strategy (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) was translated into Embase (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>), CENTRAL (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>), and the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (<LINK REF="APP-04" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 4</LINK>) using the appropriate controlled vocabulary as applicable.</P>

<U>
<B>Data Extraction: </B>
</U>Data were extracted independently by two persons (F.J. He and J.F. Li) using a standard form and differences were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (G.A. MacGregor). Relevant data recorded were characteristics of the study, design (parallel or crossover), type of the study (open, single-blind or double-blind), method of randomisation, method of blinding (use of placebo, random-zero or automated sphygmomanometers, or BP observer-blind), study duration, pre- and post-intervention results. For the purpose of pooled analyses, statistics that could be used to estimate the variance of the outcome measures were also recorded.</P>
<P>
<U>
<B>Statistical Analyses: </B>
</U>For each trial, we calculated the treatment effect for systolic and diastolic BP, and other outcome measures. For crossover trials, the treatment effect was the difference in outcomes between the end of reduced salt period and the end of usual salt (i.e. control) period. For parallel trials, the treatment effect was the difference between the two treatment groups in the change in outcomes from baseline to the end of follow-up.</P>
<P>For each trial, we also calculated the variance of the treatment effect for outcomes. This was derived from standard deviations or standard errors of paired differences between baseline and the end of follow-up for each group in a parallel trial (<LINK REF="REF-Cappuccio-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cappuccio 1991</LINK>) or between the two treatment periods in a crossover trial, or if these statistics were not given, from confidence intervals, exact t or P values. If the exact variance of paired difference was not derivable, it was imputed either by inverting a boundary P value (e.g. P&lt;0.05 became P=0.05) or assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between the initial and final measurement (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>To assess the mean effect sizes, we pooled the data by the inverse variance method in random-effects meta-analysis. We used the <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP> test to examine heterogeneity, with <I>I</I>
<SUP>2</SUP>&gt;50% considered to be important (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). To explore the source of heterogeneity, we performed meta-regression analyses (multiple regression models) weighted by the inverse variance of the change in systolic or diastolic BP. The meta-regression analysis was also used to examine whether there was a dose-response relationship between the change in 24-h urinary sodium and the change in BP. We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect whether there was publication bias and Egger's regression test to measure funnel plot asymmetry (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sterne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sterne 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prespecified subgroupings included BP status (i.e. hypertensive or normotensive) and further subgroupings by ethnic group and sex. The purpose of the subgroup analysis was to determine whether there was a significant effect of salt reduction on BP in each group itself rather than identifying difference in the effect between groups. For the analysis stratified by ethnic group, trials were included in the group of "white" if &#8805;85% of participants were white. If the information on ethnic group was not available, the trial was excluded from this subgroup analysis. For hormone and lipid data, subgroup analyses were not performed because of the small number of trials that reported such outcomes.</P>

<P>A total of 34 trials with 3230 participants were included. The characteristics of the trials included in the meta-analysis are summarised in Table (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). The median age was 50 years (ranging from 22 to 73 years). Of the 34 trials, 23 used crossover design and 11 used paralleled comparisons. Twenty-two of the 34 trials were double blind, 11 were BP observer blind, and 1 did not report any blinding procedure. The study duration varied from 4 weeks to 3 years (median: 4 weeks). The median BP on the usual salt intake was 141/86 mmHg. The median 24-h urinary sodium on the usual salt intake was 160 mmol (9.4 g/d salt), ranging from 125 to 200 mmol (7.3 to 11.7 g/d salt). The pooled estimate of the change in 24-h urinary sodium from the usual to the reduced salt intake was -75 mmol (range -40 to -118 mmol), equivalent to a reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d (range 2.3 to 6.9 g/d). This average reduction in salt intake is similar to that of the current public health recommendations.</P>

<SUP>2</SUP>=68%) for diastolic BP (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>To explore the source of heterogeneity, meta-regression analysis was performed with the change of BP (systolic or diastolic) as dependent variable and the independent variables included age (mean age of the participants in individual trials), BP status (hypertensive=1; normotensive=0), ethnic group (i.e. the proportion of whites as a continuous variable), and the change in 24-h urinary sodium. The results showed that the change in 24-h urinary sodium, age, BP status and ethnic group were all significantly associated with the change in systolic BP. The regression coefficients indicated that a 100 mmol reduction in 24 hour urinary sodium (6 g/d salt) was associated with a decrease of 5.8 mmHg (95% CI: 2.5 to 9.2, P=0.001) in systolic BP, a one-year increase in age was associated with a 0.06 mmHg (95% CI: 0.006 to 0.116, P=0.030) greater decrease in systolic BP with salt reduction, being hypertensive was associated with a greater fall in systolic BP (P=0.042) compared with normotensives, and a larger proportion of whites (or a smaller proportion of blacks) was associated with a smaller fall in systolic BP (P=0.001). These 4 variables together explained 68% of the variance between studies. In a separate regression model, sex (i.e. the proportion of men as a continuous variable) was added to the independent variable list, and there was little change to the adjusted R<SUP>2</SUP> (R<SUP>2</SUP>=0.68 without sex in the regression model and R<SUP>2</SUP>=0.70 with sex added to the regression model).  Sex was not significantly associated with the change in systolic BP. For diastolic BP, age, ethnic group, BP status and 24-h urinary sodium together explained 41% of the variance between studies. Among these 4 variables, only ethnic group was significant (P=0.021) and the other 3 variables were not significantly associated with the change in diastolic BP. When sex was added to the regression model, there was little change in the adjusted R<SUP>2</SUP> (R<SUP>2</SUP>=0.41 and 0.44 for the regression model with and without sex respectively). Sex was not significantly associated with the change in diastolic BP.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study quality</HEADING>
<P>The risk of bias graph is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. Among the 34 trials included in our meta-analysis, 26 were judged to have adequate concealment of allocation of treatments (Table:<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). In 8 trials the information on concealment of allocation was not available. Despite the fact that only 7 out of 34 trials performed intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of participants who were lost of follow-up after randomisation was small (6.7% on average).</P>
<P>We included double-blind, BP observer-blind, and open studies due to the fact that 1) some trials e.g. the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)-Sodium (<LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2001-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2001 (H)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2001-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2001 (N)</LINK>), although non-double-blinded, were well conducted with good compliance to different diets; and 2) it is very difficult to make any dietary intervention study double-blind. In relation to salt, this can only be done by the use of salt tablets (Slow Sodium and placebo). Among the 34 trials included in our meta-analysis, 22 were double-blind, 11 were BP observer-blind and only one small trial in hypertensives was non-blind. Re-analysing the data by excluding the non-blind study (<LINK REF="STD-Parijs-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Parijs 1973</LINK>) showed that the results were unchanged. The mean net change in BP for hypertensive individuals was -5.35 mmHg (95%CI: -6.62 to -4.09) for systolic and -2.88 mmHg (95%CI: -3.58 to -2.18) for diastolic BP after the non-blinded study was excluded.</P>

For systolic BP, the graphic plot was suggestive of bias (asymmetry test: P=0.025). This asymmetry of funnel plot might be because smaller studies showing no effect were under-reported in the literature. However, in our meta-analysis it is more likely to be due to the smaller effects of two larger and longer-term trials (<LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I-1992" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II-1997" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II 1997</LINK>). The smaller effects in these two trials are attributable to the smaller reduction of salt intake achieved in the longer-term trials. When these two trials were removed from the analysis, the asymmetry test was not significant (P=0.247).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-03-12 05:12:03 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake of 4.4 g/d on average, causes significant and, from a population viewpoint, important falls in BP in individuals with both raised and normal BP. The BP falls, on average, by 5/3 mmHg in hypertensives and 2/1 mmHg in normotensives. Further subgroup analyses demonstrate that a modest reduction in salt intake leads to a significant fall in systolic BP in both whites and blacks, men and women. These results provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake which will result in a lower population BP and, thereby, a reduction in strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.</P>
<P>The effect of a chronic high salt intake is a gradual increase in BP throughout life.  The INTERSALT study (International Study of Salt and Blood Pressure) suggested a strong relationship between salt intake and a progressive increase in BP with age, i.e. 0.4 mmHg per year for a 6 g/d salt intake (<LINK REF="REF-Elliott-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elliott 1996</LINK>). A reduction in salt intake is, therefore, likely to attenuate the rise of BP with aging, in addition to the immediate BP-lowering effect.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Dose-response to salt reduction</HEADING>
<P>Our meta-regression analysis shows a significant dose-response relationship between the reduction in salt intake and the fall in systolic BP, i.e. the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in systolic BP. A reduction of 6 g/d in salt intake predicts a decrease of 5.8 mmHg in systolic BP after adjusting for age, ethnic group and BP status. </P>
<P>It is acknowledged that the does-response relationship from meta-regression (i.e. between-study investigation) should be viewed as exploratory and may be potentially prone to confounding. Meta-analysis with individual participant data would have an advantage both statistically and clinically (<LINK REF="REF-Riley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riley 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berlin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 2002</LINK>) and, if available, should be used in the future to explore the dose-response relationship further. Nevertheless, the dose-response relationship found in our study is consistent with that observed from rigorously controlled trials with multi-levels of salt intake which provided the most persuasive evidence. There have been two trials that studied three levels of salt intake. The first one was the randomised double-blind cross-over study in 20 individuals with untreated essential hypertension, where salt intake was reduced from 11.2 to 6.4 and to 2.9 g/d, each for one month (<LINK REF="STD-MacGregor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">MacGregor 1989</LINK>). BP was 163/100 mmHg with a salt intake of 11.2 g/d, and reduced to 155/95 mmHg when salt intake was decreased to 6.4 g/d (i.e. a decrease of 8/5 mmHg). BP fell further to 147/91 mmHg when salt intake was reduced to 2.9 g/d (i.e. a further fall of 8/4 mmHg). After the trial was completed, individuals continued the lowest salt intake. Among the 20 participants, 19 were followed up for 1 year. In 16 individuals, BP remained controlled without any antihypertensive medication and the average BP was 142/87 mmHg with a salt intake of 3.2 g/d (<LINK REF="STD-MacGregor-1989" TYPE="STUDY">MacGregor 1989</LINK>). The other trial that has studied the dose-response relationship is the DASH-Sodium study. Over 400 individuals with normal or mildly raised BP were randomised to receive either the normal American diet (control group) or the DASH diet which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products. Within each group, participants were given 3 levels of salt intake (i.e. 8 to 6 and 4 g/d) in a randomised crossover manner, each for 4 weeks. The results demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship both on the normal American diet and on the DASH diet. The fall in BP was greater at a lower level of salt intake, i.e. from 6 to 4 g/d compared with that from 8 to 6 g/d (<LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2001-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2001 (H)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sacks-2001-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Sacks 2001 (N)</LINK>).<B> </B>
</P>
<P>From the evidence above, it is clear that the recommendations to reduce salt from the current levels of approximately 9-12 g/d to 5-6 g/d will have a significant effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a much greater effect on BP. Therefore, 3 g/d should become the long-term target for population salt intake. Indeed, the UK government's health advisory agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended a reduction in the population's salt consumption to 3 g/d by 2025 (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). In USA, it is recommended that sodium intake should be reduced to less than 2.3 g/d (i.e. &#8776;6 g/d salt) for adults, with an even further reduction to 1.5 g/d (i.e. &#8776;4 g/d salt) for about half the population, including African Americans, all adults 51 and older, and those with hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-IOM-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">IOM 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Study duration</HEADING>
<P>In spite of including studies of 1 month or more, the median duration of salt reduction in our meta-analysis was only 5 weeks in the hypertensives and 4 weeks in the normotensives. Whether salt reduction has exerted its maximum effect by 4-5 weeks is not known, but much evidence would suggest that this is unlikely (<LINK REF="REF-Forte-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Forte 1989</LINK>). Among the 34 trials included in our meta-analysis, two had duration of over 1 year (<LINK REF="STD-TOHP-I-1992" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP I 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TOHP-II-1997" TYPE="STUDY">TOHP II 1997</LINK>) and both trials were in normotensive individuals. These two trials did not show a greater fall in BP compared with other trials in normotensive individuals. However, the reduction in salt intake achieved in these two trials was half that achieved in other trials. On average, salt intake was reduced by 2.4 g/d in these two longer-term trials, whereas in the other trials in normotensives, salt intake was reduced by 4.8 g/d. These longer-term studies clearly highlight the difficulty in keeping individuals on a lower salt intake due to the widespread presence of salt in nearly all processed, canteen and restaurant food.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Variations of BP response to salt reduction</HEADING>
<P>Previous studies have shown that, for a given reduction in salt intake, the fall in BP was larger in individuals of African origin, in older people and in those with raised BP compared to whites, young people and individuals with normal BP respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Bray-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bray 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2001</LINK>). The results from our meta-regression analyses are consistent with these observations.</P>
<P>The term "salt sensitivity" has been commonly used to describe the variations of BP response to salt reduction. However, almost all of the studies on "salt sensitivity" have used a protocol of very large and sudden changes in salt intake. Such studies are irrelevant to the public health recommendations of more modest reduction in salt intake for a prolonged period of time. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake has a significant effect on BP in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, men and women, whites and blacks; although there is a variation in the extent of the fall in BP. These results in conjunction with other evidence (<LINK REF="REF-He-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2010</LINK>), particularly that a reduction in salt intake also lowers blood pressure in children (<LINK REF="REF-He-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2006</LINK>), provide strong support that  salt reduction should be carried out in the whole population. A reduction in population salt intake lowers population BP. Even a small reduction of BP across the entire population would have a large impact on reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Whelton-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whelton 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of salt reduction on hormones and lipids</HEADING>
<P>A recent meta-analysis by Graudal et al (<LINK REF="REF-Graudal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graudal--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2012</LINK>) implied that salt reduction had adverse effects on plasma hormone and lipid levels which might mitigate any benefit that occurs with a long-term fall in BP. However, Graudal et al&#8217;s meta-analysis included a large number of very short-term trials with a large change in salt intake, e.g. from 20 to less than 1 g/d for only 4-5 days, and such metabolic studies are irrelevant to the current public health recommendations for a modest reduction in salt intake for a long period of time. Our meta-analysis demonstrates that, with a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake, there is no significant change in plasma cholesterol, LDL, HDL or triglycerides. Indeed, in Graudal et al's own meta-analysis, the changes in lipids only occurred with short term trials, and a sub-group analysis including  trials with a duration of 4 or more weeks showed no significant change in lipid levels (<LINK REF="REF-Graudal-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Graudal--2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graudal 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>When salt intake is reduced, there is a fall in extracellular volume and physiological stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as well as the sympathetic nervous system. These compensatory responses are bigger with sudden and large decreases in salt intake, and much smaller or minimal with a longer-term modest salt reduction. Our meta-analysis shows that, with a longer-term modest reduction in salt intake, there is only a small physiological increase in plasma renin activity, aldosterone and noradrenaline. It is worth noting that all of the studies that were included in our meta-analysis with these hormones measured, had a duration of only 4-6 weeks (median duration: 4 weeks). It is likely that such effects may attenuate over time. Indeed, a study by Beckmann et al demonstrated that a modest reduction in salt intake, along with a reduction in body weight and saturated fat for one year, significantly reduced arterial plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline in hypertensive individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Beckmann-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beckmann 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Salt reduction lowers BP by a similar mechanism to that of thiazide diuretics. Both stimulate the renin-angiotensin system and, in the short term, the sympathetic nervous system. However, outcome trials have demonstrated that long-term treatment with thiazide diuretics significantly reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive individuals (<LINK REF="REF-ALLHAT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ALLHAT 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of salt reduction on cardiovascular risk</HEADING>
<P>There is much evidence that raised BP throughout its range starting at 115/75 mmHg is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-PSC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">PSC 2002</LINK>). A modest reduction in salt intake lowers BP and, therefore, would reduce cardiovascular risk. It was estimated that a reduction of 6 g/d in salt intake would reduce stroke by 24% and coronary heart disease by 18% (<LINK REF="REF-He-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2003</LINK>). This would prevent &#8776;35,000 stroke and coronary heart disease deaths a year in the UK and &#8776;2.5 million deaths worldwide.</P>
<P>Both prospective cohort studies and outcome trials have shown that a lower salt intake is related to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Strazzullo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strazzullo 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="REF-He-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2011</LINK>). Two recent papers in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), however, claimed that a lower salt intake was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Stolarz_x002d_Skrzypek-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stolarz-Skrzypek 2011</LINK>) or a J-shaped association existed between salt intake and cardiovascular risk (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donnell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donnell 2011</LINK>). These two papers have many methodological flaws, e.g. measurement error in assessing daily salt intake, confounding factors not controlled for, and reverse causality (i.e. the low salt intake is the result rather than the cause of participants' illness) (<LINK REF="REF-He-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2012</LINK>). Therefore, the results from these studies should be interpreted with great caution. A meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies showed that an increase of 5 g/d in salt intake was associated with a 23% increase in the risk of stroke and a 17% increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Strazzullo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strazzullo 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence from outcome trials of long term salt reduction is very limited due to the innate difficulty in conducting such trials. A recent meta-analysis of 7 randomised trials by Taylor et al, published simultaneously in The Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011a</LINK>) and the American Journal of Hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2011</LINK>), claimed that "<I>Cutting down on the amount of salt has no clear benefits in terms of likelihood of dying or experiencing cardiovascular disease</I>"  and The Cochrane Library&#8217;s press release headline stated &#8220;<I>Cutting down on salt does not reduce your chance of dying</I>&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2011</LINK>). Both of these statements are incorrect. Despite this, these headline grabbing statements received very misleading worldwide media publicity.</P>
<P>Among the 7 trials included in Taylor et al&#8217;s meta-analysis, one in heart failure should not have been included as the participants were severely salt and water depleted due to aggressive diuretic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Paterna-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paterna 2008</LINK>). Additionally, the findings in patients with severe heart failure on multiple drug treatments are not generalisable to the general population. In the remaining 6 trials, there is a reduction in all clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and events), although none of these are statistically significant. The non-significant findings are most likely due to a lack of statistical power, particularly as Taylor et al analysed the trials for hypertensives and normotensives separately. A re-analysis of the data by combining hypertensives and normotensives together shows that there is a significant reduction in cardiovascular events by 20% (P&lt;0.05) (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>) and a non-significant reduction in all-cause mortality (5-7%), in spite of the small reduction in salt intake of 2.0-2.3 g/d (<LINK REF="REF-He-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2011</LINK>).  These results add strongly to the evidence that salt reduction has a major impact on reducing strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Salt reduction is one of the most cost-effective public health measures to reduce cardiovascular disease</HEADING>
<P>Several studies have shown that a reduction in salt intake is one of the most cost-effective interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease in both developed and developing countries. For instance, a recent study in the US showed that even a very modest reduction in salt intake of only 10% which could be easily achieved, as demonstrated in the UK, would prevent hundreds of thousands of strokes and heart attacks over the lifetimes of adults aged 40-85 years who are alive today, and could save more than $32 billion in medical expenses in the US alone (<LINK REF="REF-Smith_x002d_Spangler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith-Spangler 2010</LINK>). A larger decrease in salt intake would result in a larger health improvement and greater cost savings (<LINK REF="REF-Bibbins_x002d_Domingo-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bibbins-Domingo 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>The UK salt reduction campaigns which started in 2003/2004 have been successful and the average salt intake, as measured by 24-hour urinary sodium, has fallen gradually from 9.5 to 8.1 g/d by 2011 (i.e. a 15% reduction, P&lt;0.05 for the downward trend) (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2008</LINK>). A cost-effective analysis by NICE showed that the UK salt reduction campaigns cost £15 million and a 0.9 g/d reduction in salt intake that was achieved by 2008, led to &#8776;6000 fewer CVD deaths per year, saving the UK economy &#8776;£1.5 billion per annum (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>). Based on NICE&#8217;s estimation, the further reduction of 0.5 g/d from 2008 to 2011, would prevent approximately additional 3000 CVD deaths per year and result in even greater cost savings to the UK economy.   </P>
<P>Asaria et al estimated the effects and cost of strategies to reduce salt intake and control tobacco use for 23 low- and middle-income countries that account for 80% of chronic disease burden in the developing world.  They demonstrated that a 15% reduction in mean population salt intake could avert 8.5 million cardiovascular deaths and a 20% reduction in smoking prevalence could avert 3.1 million cardiovascular deaths over 10 years (<LINK REF="REF-Asaria-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asaria 2007</LINK>). The modest reduction in salt intake could be achieved by a voluntary reduction in the salt content of processed foods and condiments by manufacturers combined with a sustained mass-media campaign aimed to encourage dietary change within households and communities. The main costs of the strategy to reduce salt consumption would be awareness campaigns through mass-media outlets and regulation of food products by public-health officers, with an average cost estimated to be US$0.09 per person per year.  The cost for tobacco control, including both price and non-price measures, was US$0.26 per person per year. These figures clearly suggest that a reduction in salt intake is more, or at the very least just, as cost-effective as tobacco control in terms of reducing cardiovascular disease on its own, the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-28 12:29:34 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our meta-analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake, as currently recommended, has a significant effect on BP both in individuals with raised BP and in those with normal BP. The fall in BP is observed in both whites and blacks, men and women. These findings provide further strong support for a reduction in population salt intake. This will likely lower population BP and, thereby, likely reduce strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a dose-response relationship, i.e. the greater the reduction in salt intake, the greater the fall in BP. The current recommendations to reduce salt intake to 5-6 g/d will have a major effect on BP, but are not ideal. A further reduction to 3 g/d will have a greater effect. Therefore, 3 g/d should become the long-term target for population salt intake. Indeed, NICE has recommended a reduction in salt intake to 3 g/d by 2025 for UK adult population (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many developed countries are now adopting a policy of reducing salt intake, firstly by persuading the food industry to reformulate food with less salt, as is occurring successfully in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-FSA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FSA 2008</LINK>) and Finland (<LINK REF="REF-Karppanen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karppanen 2006</LINK>), and also encouraging people to use less salt in their own cooking and at the table. The major challenge now is to spread this out to all other countries, particularly developing countries where often salt intake is high and &#8776;80% of the global BP-related disease burden occurs. All countries should adopt a coherent and workable strategy to reduce salt intake. A reduction in population salt intake will likely have major beneficial effects on health along with major cost savings in all countries around the world.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-04-27 18:58:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence that relates salt intake to BP is very strong. The mechanisms whereby salt raises BP are not fully understood. The existing concepts focus on the tendency for an increase in extracellular fluid volume. Increasing evidence suggests that small increases in plasma sodium may have a direct effect on BP independent of extracellular volume (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Wardener-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Wardener 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-He-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 2005</LINK>). Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms, in particular, the role of plasma sodium in regulating BP.</P>
