<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with blood circulation problems in their legs can develop leg ulcers. The majority of ulcers result from poor blood flow in the veins and are treated by compression. Arterial leg ulcers occur because of poor blood supply to the legs when there is a block in a leg artery or narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Without treatment of the underlying poor arterial blood supply, ulcers take a long time to heal or may never heal. These ulcers are treated by covering them with dressings, or using creams or ointments (topical agents), or both to promote healing and protect the ulcers from infection. A variety of types of dressings can be used depending on the overall aim of the treatment. The intention is to select dressings to reduce ulcer pain, manage exudate if present (the fluid that can leak from these ulcers) and promote healing.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>One trial was included in the review, which involved a total of 40 people with arterial leg ulcers who were randomised to either 2% ketanserin ointment in polyethylene glycol (PEG) or the vehicle (PEG) alone, administered twice a day over eight weeks. The study reported accelerated healing in the ketanserin group, when compared with vehicle alone. However, as there were only a small number of participants included with arterial disease, there were very little data reported and the follow-up period was short, making it impossible to determine whether there was any difference in the number of ulcers healed. There is therefore insufficient evidence to determine whether the choice of topical agent or dressing affects the healing of arterial leg ulcers. It should also be noted that ketanserin is not licensed in all countries for use in humans.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence was low with a single small included study which had inadequate reporting of the results, and had too short a follow-up time (eight weeks) to be able to capture sufficient healing events to allow comparisons to be made. In addition, the study was of low methodological quality. The methodological quality of the study was rated as low because the authors of the study did not thoroughly describe the methods of the study, including how the participants were chosen and randomised, making the risk of bias unclear.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-16 09:07:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is estimated that people in industrialised countries have a 1% chance of suffering from a leg ulcer at some time in their life. The majority of leg ulcers are associated with circulation problems; poor blood return in the veins causes venous ulcers (around 70% of ulcers) and poor blood supply to the legs causes arterial ulcers (around 22% of ulcers). Treatment of arterial leg ulcers is directed towards correcting the poor arterial blood supply, for example by correcting arterial blockages (either surgically or pharmaceutically). If the blood supply has been restored, these arterial ulcers can heal following principles of good wound care. Dressings and topical agents make up a part of good wound care for arterial ulcers but there are many products available and it is unclear what impact these have on ulcer healing. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating dressings and topical agents in the treatment of arterial leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion.

<P>One trial met the inclusion criteria, which was a small trial that compared 2% ketanserin ointment in polyethylene glycol (PEG) with vehicle alone (PEG) control, changed twice a day in 40 participants with arterial leg ulcers. The overall quality of the evidence was low with a single small included study which showed inadequate reporting of the results and had too short a follow-up time (eight weeks) to be able to capture sufficient healing events to allow comparisons to be made. In addition, the study was of low methodological quality. The majority of the 'risk of bias' domains received an 'unclear' risk rating as very little information was provided in the text on the methods of the study. The trial demonstrated increased wound healing in the ketanserin group, compared with the control group, but the trial was too small and had too short a follow-up period (eight weeks) to be able to determine whether there was any difference in healing rates. It should also be noted that ketanserin is not licensed in all countries for use in humans.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Leg ulceration is a common, chronic condition that is painful and reduces health-related quality of life. A systematic review estimated that 0.12% to 1.1% of the adult population suffered from open ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2003</LINK>). The major causes of ulceration include venous insufficiency, diabetes, and arterial disease. Although the majority of leg ulcers are due to venous disease, a significant number (around 22%) of patients have arterial insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>). Arterial leg ulcers are due to inadequate blood supply to the skin. This may be caused by narrowing of the arteries to the legs (atherosclerosis). It is essential to differentiate between arterial and venous ulcers, as the mainstay of treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2012</LINK>), which if applied to arterial leg ulcers may lead to skin necrosis or potentially even to amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Diagnosis is made by taking a medical history. The most common accompanying complaint is pain, which may occur during exercise, such as walking. When cramping pain occurs in the leg after exercise, and resolves on resting, it is called intermittent claudication. This complaint can progress until eventually the patient complains of pain even at rest. Patients with neuropathy (poor sensation to the feet and legs) may not experience this pain.</P>
<P>In order to assess how much blood flow there is in a leg, tests are often undertaken to confirm the presence or absence of arterial disease. Generally the first evaluation is the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and if this test results in an ABPI of less than 0.7, compression treatment is inadvisable, and these patients are referred to vascular specialists who can order further tests, such as duplex ultrasound or arteriography (<LINK REF="REF-Grey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grey 2006</LINK>). The ABPI threshold differs between literature for arterial leg ulcers and generally ranges between 0.6 and 0.7.</P>
<P>The key to treatment of arterial insufficiency is to improve the blood supply and, therefore, surgery is often required in order to bypass or clear the blockage. In a number of patients this may not be possible due to the patient's preference, patient's age and general health, and diffuse distal arterial disease, where the vessels to be reconstructed are very small. Non-surgical options might include good wound care, patient exercise to increase blood supply to the leg, pharmaceutical interventions, or physical therapies such as hyperbaric oxygen. This review only considers the use of wound dressings and topical agents in the treatment of arterial ulcers.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dressings are usually placed over the ulcer. Ever since <LINK REF="REF-Winter-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winter 1962</LINK> observed in pigs that an acute wound covered by an occlusive dressing healed more rapidly than one exposed to air, clinicians have tried to create the ideal wound-healing environment by applying dressings that limit the loss of water vapour from the wound. However, it is not clear whether a moist wound environment is best for all wounds regardless of aetiology (their cause). In some arterial leg ulcer damage (for example with dry black toes or dry black heels) best practice recommends keeping the ulcers dry, until the dead tissue separates naturally from the healthy tissue. According to the British National Formulary (BNF), the main requirements of a dressing are to keep the wound moist with exudate, but not macerated, free of infection and reduced slough, free of toxic chemicals or fibres, at the optimal healing temperature, undisturbed, and at an optimal pH level (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2013</LINK>). In the UK, the BNF has classified dressings into categories to aid clinicians in selecting appropriate products. Different countries may use different systems for classifying dressings and topical agents. In addition, there are a number of topical agents which aim to change the wound environment, for example cadexomer iodine, honey, phenytoin, silver and ketanserin. Topical agents are often used in combination with dressings and provide an antimicrobial and antibacterial environment (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>). Other therapies that have been used to treat arterial ulcers include hyperbaric oxygen, vacuum therapy and skin grafting. These are not considered in this review.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dressings have the ability to allow excess exudate to be removed from the wound surface, provide a moist micro-environment, reduce ulcer pain, act as a semi-permeable membrane, be impermeable to micro-organisms and to provide thermal insulation (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>). There is a large array of dressings, not all have all the above abilities, however dressings should be sterile and contaminant free (i.e. leave no dressing material in the wound), should not cause an allergic reaction and should not cause trauma when removed. Different topical agents also have different modes of action and can act to reduce or prevent infection, facilitate cleansing and debridement, and also reduce platelet aggregation in the capillaries and improve blood flow (<LINK REF="STD-Rooman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rooman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vanhoutte-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanhoutte 1988</LINK>).</P>

<P>Men and women of any age with an arterial leg ulcer, irrespective of the method of diagnosis used.

</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:40:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions of interest included any dressing or topical agent applied to arterial leg ulcers. Comparisons were against either no dressing/topical agent, or against other dressings or local agents. Placebo comparators were accepted as well, but it was not possible to describe any comparator as a true placebo, as every local agent will have an effect on the rate of moisture loss from the surface of the ulcer, and thus may potentially have an impact on healing. Studies that included compression treatments for all participants were excluded as compression is a treatment generally specific to venous ulcers, and can be harmful when applied to arterial ulcers. Compression treatments can be used safely in patients with an ABPI &#8805; 0.8 but patients with moderate to severe arterial disease will generally have an ABPI lower than 0.7 and should be referred to an appropriate specialist (<LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2010</LINK>). These kinds of trials were therefore excluded as they are most likely studies with primarily venous ulcers.</P>

<P>Although the primary outcome of interest is the complete ulcer healing rate (defined as the number of participants achieving complete healing), some trials report changes in ulcer area over time. These are less valid indicators of effectiveness, as the rate of decrease of ulcer area may vary during the healing process without resulting in complete ulcer healing. In addition, expressing outcomes as either a percentage of initial ulcer area healed, or absolute area healed may lead to bias, favouring either the small or large ulcer group where there are different ulcer sizes in the treatment groups at baseline. Both percentage and absolute healing rates were used where reported and attempts made to describe the direction of any potential bias due to poor baseline comparability.</P>

<P>For the update of this review, we screened 104 new reports plus 13 reports previously recorded as 'awaiting classification'. Fifty-nine new reports plus five reports previously in 'awaiting classification' were assessed as not relevant. Four studies were included in the previous version as excluded studies. Thirty-four new studies (38 reports) were excluded, plus eight from previously 'awaiting classification'. One study was included in the previous version of the review, which is now reclassified as excluded, and two studies were added to the <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> list as not enough information could be retrieved on the study to determine inclusion/exclusion.

<P>The one included trial, by Rooman and Janssen (<LINK REF="STD-Rooman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rooman 1991</LINK>), compared 2% ketanserin ointment in PEG with the vehicle (PEG) alone used as a control, applied twice daily, for eight weeks. For participants with purely arterial disease, there were 19 allocated to the ketanserin group and 21 to the control (vehicle alone) group. This multi-centre study recruited 299 participants with decubitus ulcers: 80 had pressure ulcers; 134 had venous ulcers; 45 had diabetic ulcers; and 40 had arterial ulcers. The method of identifying the sample was not described - this can have an impact on the transferability of the results to other settings as the characteristics of participants recruited from a tertiary referral centre, or a primary care setting may well be different, e.g. duration of ulceration, severity of underlying pathology - and no inclusion nor exclusion criteria were reported. The degree of arterial impairment was not reported for either group. Wound area as a function of time was the only outcome reported for the arterial leg ulcers subgroup and from the graph, time to 50% healing could be determined.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The study that was included in the review, <LINK REF="STD-Rooman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rooman 1991</LINK>, evaluated the use of 2% ketanserin ointment in PEG compared with the vehicle (PEG) alone control group in 299 participants, of which, only 40 were due to arterial disease. We were only able to evaluate outcomes from the study as it gave subgroup analysis for the 40 arterial ulcer participants alone. The only outcome to report by ulcer aetiology was wound area as a function of time, which determined that ketanserin ointment accelerated the healing of arterial ulcers nearly twice as fast compared with a vehicle alone control group.</P>
<P>Whilst the results of the only included trial might appear positive, the inadequate reporting of results, in combination with the lack of reporting of methods used in the trial, (e.g. method of allocation to the two groups) means that one cannot confidently conclude that there is an accelerated healing due to ketanserin 2% ointment when compared with vehicle alone. In addition, the follow-up time was too short (at eight weeks) to be able to capture sufficient healing events to allow comparisons to be made. The lack of inclusion and exclusion criteria in the included trial means that the method of identifying arterial ulcers is unclear, and thus reduces the generalisability of the results. Also, it should be noted that ketanserin is not licensed in all countries for use in humans.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study was included, <LINK REF="STD-Rooman-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rooman 1991</LINK>, which was of relatively low quality, gave little explanation of methods, and offered very little outcome data for the arterial ulcer subgroup. There were few participants and the follow-up time was inadequate. Therefore, the data that were available were incomplete and could not be generalised to the greater population of people who suffer from arterial leg ulcers.</P>
<P>There are many underlying reasons why so little, high-quality evidence is presented for this topic. Venous ulcers are far more prevalent than arterial ulcers, so gaining enough participants for a trial in only arterial ulcers is much more difficult. Trials in wound care will always be faced with participants who vary in a large number of respects, for example the size and duration of the ulcer, the degree of arterial impairment, and concurrent treatments such as wound cleansing, exercise, nutrition and other self-care activities. The variability in patient characteristics means that an investigation examining which treatment option to use needs to use a study design that takes into account the differences between people. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) is the most powerful study design, however, designing a double-blind RCT in dressing efficacy is also challenging due to difficulty controlling the variables associated with co-morbidities, calculating sample sizes to achieve statistical significance, recruiting enough participants, challenges with validating infection, inflammation and wound sizes, and challenges with validating subjective assessments such as comfort and user friendliness. In the UK, dressings are considered 'medical devices'; they are CE marked (Conformité Européenne or European Conformity<B>)</B>, therefore safe to be used in the context for which they have been designed, but they are not submitted to rigorous trial processes like pharmaceutical products (i.e. drugs). There is therefore little incentive to fund large trials. This lack of research is hindered by limited legislation, as manufacturers are not required by law to provide evidence of efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Madden-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madden 2012</LINK>). Therefore simply recommending further RCTs or CCTs may not be helpful. We recommend instead that alternative methodologies are explored to provide some guidance to clinicians on the best way to care for arterial leg ulcers.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence was low, due to the single small included study that had inadequate reporting of the results and had too short a follow-up time (eight weeks) to be able to capture sufficient healing events to allow comparisons to be made. In addition, the study was of low methodological quality. The methodological quality was deemed to be low because the majority of bias domains received an 'unclear' rating due to inadequate reporting. Only two domains of six were rated as 'low' risk: attrition bias and reporting bias. The study randomisation methods and allocation concealment were not discussed. Although the study claims to be double-blinded, no indication of methods of blinding were given, nor of how well the blind performed. Outcome assessors were not identified as being blinded, and the low number of participants could bias the results. Essential information about how and where the participants were recruited was not given, neither were inclusion and exclusion criteria.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Precautions that were taken to prevent reviewer biases in the review process included independent, duplicate inclusion and exclusion of identified studies, performing risk of bias and data extraction. For this particular review, a concern with bias lies in the fact that many studies did not indicate whether their included participants had arterial disease or did not indicate any diagnostic criteria that would allow the readers to determine arterial disease. This could have led to studies not being included that did in fact meet the inclusion criteria. To combat this issue, the review authors read every study carefully and any uncertainties were discussed between them.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No other systematic reviews have been identified at this time that evaluate healing of arterial leg ulcers when comparing different dressings or topical agents.</P>
<P>A systematic review that was last published in 2006 evaluated the effects of different dressings on venous leg ulcers when applied under compression bandages (<LINK REF="REF-Palfreyman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palfreyman 2006</LINK>). Although a total of 42 studies were included in the review, the authors could not conclude superiority of any one type of dressing over another. This review has since been split in to four separate reviews to look at specific dressing types to determine any effect of alginate dressings (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2013</LINK>), foam dressings (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2013b</LINK>), hydrocolloid dressings (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 2014</LINK>) and hydrogel dressings (<LINK REF="REF-Ribeiro-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ribeiro 2013</LINK>). The foam and the alginate dressing reviews still found no difference in dressing type on ulcer healing, and the hydrocolloid and hydrogel reviews are still being written and currently only have a protocol provided. While no conclusions regarding arterial ulcers can be drawn from these reviews, they provide relevant information on the topic of dressings for ulcers as well as the current state of knowledge and research.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-06-26 07:30:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review has indicated a lack of evidence to support or reject the use of dressings or topical agents in the healing of arterial leg ulcers. As indicated in the <LINK TAG="APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS" TYPE="SECTION">Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</LINK> section there are many issues that inhibit designing and performing RCTs for the issue of dressings and topical agents for ulcers. We recommend that alternative methodologies are explored to satisfy the requirement for developing a body of knowledge that is useful to clinicians. Recommending further RCTs or CCTs on this topic precludes an understanding of the challenges faced by the researcher in the ability to balance the control of variables with the application of the findings to the variety of arterial leg ulcer patients.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there is a requirement for the following studies in the healing of arterial leg ulcers:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comparison between various modern dressings;</LI>
<LI>comparison between wound dressings alone versus topical agents applied underneath wound dressings.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These studies should have clear inclusion and exclusion criteria and sufficiently long follow-up to determine dressing effectiveness.</P>

<P>In the previous version of the review <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 2002</LINK> was classified as an included study. However, on further investigation into the trial design, it was determined that the control group was not adequate to be determined an RCT or CCT. <LINK REF="STD-Hartman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hartman 2002</LINK> was therefore reclassified as an excluded study.</P>
<P>In the <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK> section we have added 'compression' interventions as exclusionary criteria as we felt it was an important distinction to make. Making this alteration did not effect the inclusion or exclusion of any previously considered studies.</P>
