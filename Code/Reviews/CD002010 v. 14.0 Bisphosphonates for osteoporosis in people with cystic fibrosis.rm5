<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-08 13:50:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder that affects many organs (e.g. lung and pancreas). It commonly leads to reduced bone mineral density, known as osteoporosis, which increases the likelihood of fractures. The short-term and long-term effects of fractures (e.g<I>.</I> rib and vertebral) may make lung disease worse. Bisphosphonates are drugs that increase bone mineral density by slowing down bone resorption. They are used to treat osteoporosis caused by menopause or the use of corticosteroid drugs.</P>
<P>The evidence available was limited to six trials with participants who had not undergone lung transplants (total of 203 adults) and one trial with 34 adults who had undergone lung transplantation. Bisphosphonates consistently increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip regions. The rates of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral) or deaths were not reduced by bisphosphonate therapy. However, this may be related to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials. Severe bone pain and flu-like symptoms were commonly linked to intravenous bisphosphonates, especially in people not using corticosteroids. More research is needed to assess the effect of pre-treatment with corticosteroids. Additional trials are needed to determine if bone pain is more common or severe (or both) with the stronger drug zoledronate and if corticosteroids lessen or prevent these adverse events. Additional trials are also required to further assess gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. Trials in larger populations are needed to determine effects on fracture rate and survival.</P>

<P>Nine trials were identified and seven (with a total of 237 adult participants) were included.</P>
<P>Data were combined (when available) from six included studies in participants without a lung transplant. Data showed that there was no significant reduction in fractures between treatment and control groups at 12 months, odds ratio 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 3.80). No fractures were reported in studies with follow-up at 24 months. However, in patients taking bisphosphonates after six months the percentage change in bone mineral density increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 4.61 (95% confidence interval 3.90 to 5.32) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 3.35 (95% confidence interval 1.63 to 5.07); but did not significantly change at the distal forearm, mean difference -0.49 (95% confidence interval -2.42 to 1.45). In patients taking bisphosphonates, at 12 months the percentage change in bone mineral density increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 6.10 (95% confidence interval 5.10 to 7.10) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 4.35 (95% confidence interval 2.99 to 5.70). At 24 months, in patients treated with bisphosphonates the percentage change in bone mineral density also increased at the lumbar spine, mean difference 5.49 (95% confidence interval 4.38 to 6.60) and at the hip or femur, mean difference 6.05 (95% confidence interval 3.74 to 8.36). There was clinical heterogeneity between studies and not all studies reported all outcomes. Bone pain was the most common adverse event with intravenous agents. Flu-like symptoms were also increased in those taking bisphosphonates.</P>
<P>In participants with a lung transplant (one study), intravenous pamidronate did not change the number of new fractures. At axial sites, bone mineral density increased with treatment compared to controls: percentage change in bone mineral density at lumbar spine, mean difference 6.20 (95% confidence interval 4.28 to 8.12); and femur mean difference 7.90 (95% confidence interval 5.78 to 10.02).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-13 10:46:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common serious autosomal recessive genetic disorder in the Caucasian population. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene (<LINK REF="REF-Riordan-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riordan 1989</LINK>). This genetic disorder occurs in approximately one in 3500 live births in the United States of America; the incidence varies between racial and ethnic groups, being more common in Caucasians (<LINK REF="REF-Cystic-Fibrosis-Foundation-Patient-Registry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry 2013</LINK>). One in 25 individuals carry the defective gene (<LINK REF="REF-Yankaskas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yankaskas 1999</LINK>). The major components of CF are lung disease and pancreatic insufficiency. In the past, only one third of individuals with CF lived to the age of 18 years (<LINK REF="REF-Yankaskas-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yankaskas 1999</LINK>). However, recent advances in medical science and technology have increased the life expectancy of people with CF into the fourth and fifth decades of life (<LINK REF="REF-Cystic-Fibrosis-Foundation-Patient-Registry-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry 2013</LINK>). In the United States of America, the predicted median survival in 1992, 2002 and 2012 was 29.4 years, 31.3 years and 41.1 years respectively. Hence, as survival improves, long-term sequelae of the disease (<LINK REF="REF-Quon-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quon 2012</LINK>), such as osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Paccou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paccou 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stalvey-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalvey 2013a</LINK>), diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2013</LINK>) and liver disease (<LINK REF="REF-Rowland-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowland 2011</LINK>) are of increasing significance.</P>
<P>Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone mineralisation that decreases bone mineral density (BMD) and makes bones brittle and more susceptible to fracture. Osteopenia refers to a milder degree of bone demineralisation. Bone density is currently measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which measures absolute bone density in grams per centimetre squared (gm/cm<SUP>2</SUP>) and can be compared to a population mean. It is usual to express BMD as standard deviations from the population mean, either as a Z-score (compared to age- and sex-matched data) or a T-score (compared to the healthy young adult mean for the participant's sex). The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies osteopenia as a T-score of between -1 and -2.5, and osteoporosis as a T-score of -2.5 or less (<LINK REF="REF-Kanis-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanis 1994</LINK>). The International Society for Clinical Densitometry has recommendations with regard to BMD reporting (<LINK REF="REF-ISCD-Official-Positions-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISCD Official Positions 2013</LINK>). However, BMD is only one of the factors that determine the risk of fracture. It is osteoporotic fractures which account for the morbidity and mortality associated with osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Decreased BMD has been observed in children with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sermet_x002d_Gaudelus-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sermet-Gaudelus 2007</LINK>), adolescents with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buntain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buntain 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Caldeira-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caldeira 2008</LINK>) and adults with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Bianchi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bianchi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Buntain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buntain 2004</LINK>). A longitudinal study of 151 adults with CF aged 15 to 52 years showed that 34% of participants had a DXA Z-score of &#8804; -2 (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). A recent systematic literature review with meta-analysis reported the pooled prevalence of osteoporosis (total of 888 patients) and osteopenia (total of 697 patients) in adults with CF was 23.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.6 to 31.0) and 38% (95% CI 28.2 to 48.3) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Paccou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paccou 2010</LINK>). Other studies have not detected differences in BMD between children with CF and those without (<LINK REF="REF-Buntain-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buntain 2004</LINK>), but inadequate bone mass accrual during childhood and adolescence has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Buntain-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buntain 2006</LINK>). Definitions of osteoporosis and osteopenia may vary between studies.</P>
<P>The etiology of CF-related bone disease is thought to be multifactorial. An imbalance of increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation has been observed (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2010</LINK>), even in young prepubertal patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ambroszkiewicz-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ambroszkiewicz 2013</LINK>). Proposed contributing factors to bone disease include malnutrition and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; vitamin D, vitamin K or calcium deficiency; poor nutrition and growth resulting in low body weight; systemic inflammatory cytokines; use of exogenous glucocorticoids; sex hormone insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity resulting in decreased weight bearing activity and organ transplantation with associated immunosuppressive therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gore-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gore 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haworth-2010b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haworth 2010b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Javier-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Javier 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paccou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paccou 2013</LINK>). Abnormalities of calcium metabolism independent of vitamin D status have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2003</LINK>). Many of these factors are inter-related (e.g<I>.</I> pancreatic exocrine insufficiency contributing to malabsorption of vitamin D, exacerbated by decreased sun exposure if indoors due to poor health). Furthermore, BMD has been positively associated with pulmonary function, physical function, nutritional status and negatively associated with chronological age and recurrent pulmonary exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Alicandro-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alicandro 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Donadio-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donadio 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Legroux_x002d_Gerot-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Legroux-Gerot 2012</LINK>). Mutation of the CFTR gene itself may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of CF-related bone disease (<LINK REF="REF-Dif-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dif 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Le-Henaff-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Henaff 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paccou-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paccou 2013</LINK>). Studies have indicated that the loss of CFTR activity in osteoblasts decreases the secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG) resulting in accentuated inflammation-driven bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Heron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Heron 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stalvey-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalvey 2013</LINK>).The glycoprotein OPG acts a decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor &#954;B ligand (RANKL), blocking the interaction of RANKL with the receptor RANK. The RANKL/RANK interaction stimulates the formation and activation of osteoclasts, hence OPG exerts an anti-resorptive effect (<LINK REF="REF-Weitzmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitzmann 2013</LINK>). A recent study identified that the risk of osteoporosis was related to gene polymorphisms of the gene encoding the inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (<LINK REF="REF-Shmarina-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shmarina 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The clinical consequences of CF-related bone disease include low bone density with potential fractures, including rib and vertebral fractures, which may be precipitated by coughing. In the systematic review by Paccou, the pooled prevalences of radiological vertebral fractures (total of 683 patients) and non-vertebral fractures (total of 553 patients) in young adults with CF were 14% (95% CI 7.8 to 21.7) and 19.7% (95% CI 6.0 to 38.8) respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Paccou-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paccou 2010</LINK>). A study in post-lung transplant participants with CF found an approximate two-fold increase in the risk of non-vertebral fractures for women aged 16 to 34 years (P = 0.015) and men aged 25 to 45 years (P = 0.04) compared with the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 1998</LINK>). Vertebral compression and rib fractures were 100-fold and 10-fold more common respectively than predicted (P &lt; 0.001). Incident new vertebral fractures are commonly defined as a 15% or greater reduction in anterior, posterior, or middle vertebral height. Acutely, vertebral and rib fractures may result in pain and debilitation, resulting in diminished lung function, ineffective cough and airway clearance, limitations in respiratory physiotherapy, in addition to reduced physical activity. Chronic consequences may include kyphosis and chest wall deformities which may worsen lung function. Hence a vicious cycle of further impairment in lung function and deterioration in bone health may result (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hayes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hayes 2011</LINK>). Established bone disease may exclude the patient from lung transplantation, as the high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppression required post-transplantation can be expected to worsen bone disease further (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 1996</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-02-04 15:35:11 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bisphosphonates are a class of drugs that inhibit bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2007</LINK>). Considerations in using bisphosphonate therapy include different formulations (oral, intravenous), dosage, frequency of administration, intermittent versus continuous dosing and duration of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Potential side-effects include an acute-phase response leading to fever and 'flu'-like symptoms (myalgia, malaise). This has been most commonly observed after the first exposure to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates administered intravenously, and associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Sauty-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sauty 1996</LINK>). Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been associated with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonate therapy in patients with malignancy (<LINK REF="REF-Pendrys-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendrys 2008</LINK>). Prolonged bisphosphonate use (exceeding five years) has been associated with atypical femoral fractures, a rare subset of subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Saleh-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saleh 2013</LINK>). Upper gastrointestinal side-effects (e.g. oesophagitis) have been associated with oral agents (<LINK REF="REF-Cryer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cryer 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-02-04 15:37:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bisphosphonates are selectively taken up by bone and exert inhibitory effects on osteoclasts, cells that act to dissolve and resorb bone (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2007</LINK>). Individual drugs within this class have different mineral binding affinities and molecular modes of action (e.g<I>.</I> nitrogen-containing pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate and zoledronate are more potent than the non-nitrogen containing etidronate and clodronate) (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bisphosphonates have proven effective treatments for disorders of excessive bone resorption (<LINK REF="REF-Giger-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giger 2013</LINK>). These disorders include Paget's disease of bone, myeloma, bone metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Russell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2006</LINK>); postmenopausal osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>); other forms of osteoporosis (e.g<I>.</I> associated with glucocorticoid administration (<LINK REF="REF-Saag-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 1998</LINK>)); and children with the 'brittle bone' disorder, osteogenesis imperfecta (<LINK REF="REF-Glorieux-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glorieux 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Phillipi-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phillipi 2008</LINK>). Positive outcomes have included increased bone mass, BMD and a reduction in fracture frequency.</P>
<P>Bone resorption has been observed to increase during CF pulmonary exacerbations due to the stimulatory effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on osteoclast activity (<LINK REF="REF-Shead-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shead 2010</LINK>). Loss of the CFTR in osteoblasts may exacerbate the effect of inflammation to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (<LINK REF="REF-Le-Heron-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Le Heron 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stalvey-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stalvey 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weitzmann-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weitzmann 2013</LINK>). Since bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, these agents may minimise bone loss in this context.</P>
<P>A two-year study of intermittent cyclical etidronate in 423 postmenopausal women demonstrated a significant increase in BMD at the spine and a decrease in new fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Watts-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watts 1990</LINK>). In a study of 2027 women with at least one existing vertebral fracture, alendronate was shown to increase BMD at the spine and hip and to decrease fractures at the hip, wrist and spine after three years of treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Black-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1996</LINK>). Pamidronate in combination with calcium was studied over an 18-month period in an initial cohort of 35 postmenopausal women (mean age 64.5 years) with at least one atraumatic vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis. After one year, BMD increased in the lumbar spine (P &lt; 0.001), although there were no changes in the femoral neck (<LINK REF="REF-Fromm-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fromm 1991</LINK>). Oral risedronate has been observed to secondarily prevent vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study of 477 participants with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis found alendronate to be highly effective in increasing BMD at the spine and femoral neck, with a significant reduction in the number of incident fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Saag-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saag 1998</LINK>). Another one-year study compared two regimens of intravenous pamidronate (a single infusion or once every three months) for the primary prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. The study population consisted of 32 participants who required long-term glucocorticoid therapy with at least 10 mg of prednisone daily. A highly significant difference was observed between both pamidronate regimens and the control group at the lumbar spine (P &lt; 0.001) and femoral neck (P &lt; 0.01). Both pamidronate regimens effectively achieved primary prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (<LINK REF="REF-Boutsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boutsen 2001</LINK>). This evidence is particularly promising since corticosteroid use is associated with osteoporosis among people with CF.</P>
<P>A three-year randomized double-blind trial of 300 mg oral pamidronate daily compared with placebo was conducted in 105 participants with rheumatoid arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Eggelmeijer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eggelmeijer 1996</LINK>). Inflammation, decreased mobility and glucocorticoid use may contribute to the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with rheumatological conditions. After three years, lumbar spine and forearm BMD had increased significantly in the pamidronate-treated group, while there were non-significant changes in the placebo-treated group. Changes were significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="REF-Eggelmeijer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eggelmeijer 1996</LINK>).</P>

<P>A multi-faceted approach to the prevention and treatment of low BMD has been recommended including optimising vitamin, calcium and nutritional status, encouraging weight-bearing exercise, endocrinological assessment and management of delayed puberty or hypogonadism, aggressive treatment of pulmonary infections, minimizing exposure to corticosteroids and treatment of CF-related diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 2005</LINK>). A consensus statement addressing the issue of bone health and disease in CF recommends consideration of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates in individuals with DXA T- or Z-scores &#8804; 2.0, awaiting transplant or BMD loss more than 3% to 5% per year (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 2005</LINK>). A caution is placed on the use of intravenous bisphosphonates due to the association with severe bone pain in this population group.</P>
<P>The UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust Bone Mineralisation Working Group outlined specific recommendations for consideration of bisphosphonate treatment in adults and children, justifying the importance of the previous Cochrane reviews of the available evidence assessing bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Cystic-Fibrosis-Trust-Report-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cystic Fibrosis Trust Report 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The more recent European Cystic Fibrosis Bone Mineralisation guidelines outline detailed recommended assessment, prevention and treatment strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Sermet_x002d_Gaudelus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sermet-Gaudelus 2011</LINK>). Specifically, these guidelines recommend consideration of bisphosphonate treatment in adults who:</P>
<OL>
<LI>are taking continuous systemic oral glucocorticoids for at least three months with a BMD Z/T-score of -1.5 or less;</LI>
<LI>sustain a low trauma fracture while taking systemic glucocorticoids;</LI>
<LI>have had a low trauma fracture or in whom the lumbar spine or total hip or femoral neck Z/T-score is -2 or less (or both) and there is evidence of significant bone loss (more than 4% per year) on serial DXA measurements despite optimisation of clinical care;</LI>
<LI>are awaiting or have undergone solid organ transplantation and have a BMD Z/T-score of -1.5 or less;</LI>
<LI>are starting a prolonged course of oral glucocorticoids (longer than three months) and have a BMT Z/T-score of -1.5 or less (<LINK REF="REF-Sermet_x002d_Gaudelus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sermet-Gaudelus 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>These 2011 guidelines also recommend the consideration of bisphosphonate treatment in children after failure of optimal conservative treatment who:</P>
<OL>
<LI>are taking continuous systemic glucocorticoids for at least three months and have a history of low trauma fracture or BMD Z-score of -2 or less (or both);</LI>
<LI>have a BMD Z-score of -2 or less in the total body or lumbar spine and a history of low-trauma extremity fractures or vertebral compression fractures;</LI>
<LI>are awaiting or have undergone solid organ transplantation and have a BMD Z-score of -2 or less;</LI>
<LI>are prescribed continuous systemic glucocorticoids and have a BMD Z-score of -2 or less (<LINK REF="REF-Sermet_x002d_Gaudelus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sermet-Gaudelus 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>In transplant recipients, the recommendations are that:</P>
<OL>
<LI>low BMD and a history of low trauma fractures are not an absolute contraindication for lung transplant listing in people with CF;</LI>
<LI>bone loss after solid organ transplantation can be lessened by the prescription of bisphosphonates in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Sermet_x002d_Gaudelus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sermet-Gaudelus 2011</LINK>).</LI>

<P>In the original review, each author independently extracted data for the outcome measures listed below. The review authors contacted the first authors of the included trials to verify their data and obtain unpublished data where necessary. The authors used the Cochrane Review Manager software (Version 4.1) to compile and analyse the data (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2003</LINK>). The authors compared their data and resolved differences by referring to the original article; they planned to resolve any remaining differences with a third individual.</P>
<P>From 2009 onwards, the authors (LC, AC) reviewed trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria and recorded the following information when available: study setting; year of study; source of funding; participant recruitment details (including number of eligible participants); inclusion and exclusion criteria; randomisation and allocation concealment method; numbers of participants randomised; blinding (masking) of participants, care providers and outcome assessors; dose and type of intervention; duration of therapy; co-interventions; numbers of participants not followed up; reasons for withdrawals from study protocol (clinical, side-effects, refusal and other); side-effects of therapy; and whether intention-to-treat analyses were possible. The review authors requested further information from the two authors but no response was received. Data were reported at time-points 6 months, 12 months and annually thereafter which are appropriate time-points to assess treatment effects on fracture frequency and duration. For per cent change in BMD, the review authors combined and reported data for the end of study as it is unknown what length of study is needed for effect of treatment to be evident. The review authors used the Cochrane Review Manager software (Version 5.1) to compile and analyse the data (<LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 2011</LINK>). Similarly, the authors compared their data and resolved differences by referring to the original article.</P>
<P>The review authors conducted separate analyses for participants who had received a lung transplant and for those who had not. At this stage, the number of people with CF who have received other organ transplants is small. Therefore, the authors included individuals with other organ transplants in the analysis of participants with a lung transplant, since they share a common risk factor for osteoporosis, that is the long-term use of immunosuppressive agents which lower BMD.</P>

<P>In the original review (<LINK REF="REF-Brenckmann-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenckmann 2001</LINK>), two studies were identified. With the present update, a total of nine clinical trials were identified that were all published in English (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Conway-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Conway 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hardin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hardin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).

<P>Seven clinical trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). One trial was published only as an abstract (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>). We contacted the lead investigator for details of the full publication, without receiving a reply. Four trials were published both as abstracts and full review papers (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>). Two trials were published as full review papers (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>All the trials had similar designs, duration of planned intervention (12 to 24 months) and outcome measures. None of the trials reported sample size or power calculations. None of the studies included children (aged 18 years or less). In the Boyle trial, enrolment was ceased after five participants were randomised and follow-up duration was decreased from 12 months to 6 months due to adverse events (i.e. musculoskeletal pain) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>). The follow-up duration of another trial was also shortened from 12 months to 6 months due to adverse events (i.e<I>.</I> bone pain) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial assessed 24 months of intravenous pamidronate in 34 post-transplant adults with CF (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>). The participants in the other six trials were non-transplanted adults with CF.</P>
<P>Other factors that will contribute to the heterogeneity in the results of the review include differences in trial populations and concomitant general health, activity levels and medications (prednisone, cyclosporin A, azathioprine in the transplant group).</P>
<P>All participants in six of the trials received supplemental calcium and vitamin D (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). In the study by Haworth and colleagues, participants with pancreatic insufficiency were prescribed long-term oral vitamin D supplements (all participants except one participant in the control group) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Oral prednisolone was administered to all participants of one study for three days starting on the morning of the first infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>). This was repeated with subsequent infusions if a reaction to the first infusion was thought likely.</P>
<P>The types of bisphosphonate assessed in the trials included intravenous pamidronate in two trials, 31 participants in the earlier Haworth trial and 34 participants in the earlier Aris trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>); oral alendronate in two trials, 53 participants in the later Aris trial and 56 participants in the Papaioannou trial (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>); oral risedronate (36 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>); intravenous zoledronate (22 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>) and intravenous zoledronate (40 participants planned) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Funding for one trial was provided by grants from the CF Foundation and the Verne S. Caviness General Center for Clinical Research (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>). Another trial was funded by the U.S. Food and Drug administration, Merck and Co, Inc., the Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, the Verne S. Caviness General Center for Clinical Research at University of North Carolina, the CF Foundation and the NIDDK (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). Novartis Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, Australia partly funded one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>). Study funding was also provided by Merck Frosst Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). Haworth and colleagues received funding from the CF Trust in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>). The later Haworth study was funded by unrestricted educational grants from Proctor &amp; Gamble (Norwich, USA) and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, with support to investigators from the UK National Institute of Health Research (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>All trials stated that allocation was in accordance to randomisation. One trial reported the use of a computer-generated randomisation code, stratified according to institution (prepared by an independent randomisation centre) with use of block allocation to ensure equitable distribution to each treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). In another trial, participants were allocated to treatment or placebo using a computer programme to minimise differences between groups in treatment centre, sex and baseline lumbar spine BMD (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>). We judged these two trials to have a low risk of bias. Two trials described a "blocks of four" design, but the actual method of randomisation was not discussed. We judged the risk of bias due to the generation of the randomisation sequence as unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). In the other trials, the method of randomisation and hence the risk of bias was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Clinician or person delivering treatment</HEADING>
<P>In one trial, clinicians giving the interventions were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>) and thus risk of bias was high and in another, this was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Three trials were described as "double-blind", but the blinding of those delivering treatment was not specifically discussed (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>). In another trial, blinding was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Hence, these four trials were judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Clinicians delivering treatment were blinded in two trials, leading us to judge them to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In one trial, participants were not blinded to the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>) (thus a high risk of bias) and in another trial, this was not reported leading to an unclear risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Participants were blinded to the intervention group in the other five trials, which we therefore judged to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome assessors</HEADING>
<P>In one trial, only the radiologist who interpreted the DXA scans was blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>). In the Chapman trial, it was stated that the personnel who performed and analysed the DXA scans were blinded to the treatment group, but it was not clear whether all the outcome assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>). In one trial, blinding was not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>) and two other trials were described as "double-blind" although it was not specifically discussed whether all the outcome assessors were blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Hence considering these different types of participants and personnel together, there was some risk of bias in five of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>In one trial, five withdrawals between commencement of protocol and outcomes measured at six months were described, but not delineated as to whether they were in the treatment or the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). In the earlier Aris trial, it was described that three participants died during the course of the study before the first primary end-point measurement (causes of death were one each from sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and obliterative bronchiolitis). These participants were excluded from the final analysis of baseline characteristics and outcome data. However, it was not reported which treatment group they were in (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>). Hence the risk of bias was unclear for both these trials. In another trial, it was unclear which specific participants had BMD measurements available at each time-point, particularly for forearm measures (fewer measurements compared with lumbar spine and femoral neck) (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial by Boyle, 40 participants were planned for enrolment but only five enrolled (three in treatment group) before the study was stopped by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board after three participants experienced adverse effects. It was assumed that the three patients with bone pain were in the treatment group although this was not stated, hence was judged to be low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>). Details of withdrawals were provided by the author for one study i.e. unpublished data (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>) thus judged as low risk of bias.

<P>Withdrawal rates and hence risk of attrition bias varied. For example, from protocol commencement to BMD (lumbar spine) measurement at end of study, total withdrawals were 0/34 (0%) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>),13/53 (25%) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>), 3/22 (14%) (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>), 3/31 (10%) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>), 12/36 (33.3%) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>), 8/56 (14.2%) (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>) and 3/5 (60%) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>At the six-month time-point, data from the four studies showed there was a significant increase in BMD measured at the lumbar spine in the treatment group, MD 4.61 (95% CI 3.90 to 5.32) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). In the study by Aris, participants receiving oral alendronate had increased lumbar spine BMD after six months of the intervention; lumbar spine BMD decreased in control group participants at this time-point (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). The MD for per cent change BMD at the lumbar spine after six months was 5.50 (95% CI 4.11 to 6.89) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). The Boyle trial was ceased after only five participants were enrolled (three in the treatment group). The mean (SD) lumbar spine BMD had increased by mean (SD) 4.7 (0.6)% six months after the single dose of intravenous zoledronate compared to no change in the two participants in the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>).

In the Haworth study, after six months intravenous pamidronate intervention, participants in the control group had decreased lumbar spine BMD; participants in the treatment group had gained BMD in this region, MD for per cent change lumbar spine BMD at six months was 5.80 (95% CI 2.91 to 8.69) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).

These combined data showed a significant increase in BMD in favour of bisphosphonates, MD 6.10 (95% CI 5.10 to 7.10). In the study by Aris, participants in the treatment group had increased lumbar spine BMD after 12 months of the intervention. This decreased in control group participants at this time-point, MD 6.70 (95% CI 4.51 to 8.89) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>).

<P>Data for lumbar spine BMD at the 24-month time-point were reported by two trials and this result, too, was significant in favour of the treatment group, MD 5.49 (95% CI 4.38 to 6.60), although only one trial showed a statistically significant positive effect of bisphosphonates with MD 5.70 (95% CI 4.55 to 6.85) (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>) compared with MD 3.00 (95% CI -0.95 to 6.95) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>); for this time-point I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 40% (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">a. Bone Pain</HEADING>
<P>In one study of oral alendronate for 12 months, none of the participants in either the intervention or the control group experienced bone pain (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). The other study also assessing oral alendronate for 12 months did not report bone pain in any participants; three of the participants in the treatment group used oral corticosteroids with the mean yearly cumulative dose 49.32 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). In the 24-month trial of oral risedronate, four participants withdrew completely due to bone pain (three in the first 12 months) and one participant discontinued the study medication due to bone pain. The Haworth trial of oral risedronate reported that bone pain was recorded 19 times by nine different risedronate patients in the first year after randomisation, while there were no episodes of bone pain in the placebo group, OR 43.59 (95% CI 2.27 to 837.56). Fourteen of 19 (74%) episodes occurred within the first 56 days after randomisation. Five events (26%) were classified as severe and led to the discontinuation of the study medication. Of the other events, ten were classified as moderate and four as mild. Only two (11%) events were considered to be unrelated to the study medication. Bone pain usually started within 24 hours of the first dose of risedronate and lasted for approximately 72 hours (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling the results for intravenous bisphosphonates, including the study in which participants received oral prednisone daily for three days on the morning of the first infusion (repeated with subsequent infusions if a reaction to the first infusion was thought likely), the occurrence of bone pain was significantly higher in participants in the treatment groups (18 out of 28) compared to control groups (2 out of 32), OR 14.17 (95% CI 3.64 to 55.17) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Boyle reported that three participants experienced dramatic musculoskeletal pain, two requiring emergency room assessment. Symptoms began six to eight hours after infusion, peaked at 12 to 18 hours, and were characterized by severe chest and back pain. Although the most severe symptoms resolved within 48 to 72 hours, participants reported continued arthralgias for up to a week. It was presumed that these three participants were those in the treatment group (no reply was received to an attempt to contact the author) (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>).

In the Aris study, three cases of diarrhoea were reported; one participant was receiving alendronate and two were receiving placebo. This was accompanied by abdominal cramping and loss of appetite. These participants continued to experience diarrhoea after discontinuing the study medication. One participant reported dysphagia but it was not clear which study group they were in (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). In Papaioannau's trial of oral alendronate, there were 10 gastrointestinal-related adverse events in the treatment group (three events of nausea or vomiting or both and one event of each of reflux, difficulty swallowing, oesophagitis, constipation, gastrointestinal upset, intestinal obstruction and stomach pain or burn). There were seven gastrointestinal-related adverse events in the control group (four events of nausea or vomiting or both and one event of each of constipation, intestinal obstruction and stomach pain or burn) (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also reported in the oral risedronate trial (26 in the treatment group and 16 in the placebo group).

<I>d. Other adverse effects</I>
</P>
<P>Chapman reported that musculoskeletal side effects were experienced following 27 of 63 zoledronate infusions, but after only 4 of 73 placebo infusions. This was despite administering prednisolone to all participants with at least the first infusion, and these side effects were more common after the first than the subsequent infusions. In six participants, the reactions were described as severe, in two cases resulting in withdrawal. One of these participants required admission to hospital with severe pain and fever restricting movement, with onset 12 hours after the first infusion; this resolved after four days, but led to subsequent withdrawal from the study. The other participant experienced fever, rigor, bone pain and headache 24 hours after the first infusion with resolution in five days. Similar effects were experienced after the second infusion followed by study withdrawal (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 24-month trial of oral risedronate, two participants discontinued the study medication in the first 12 months due to muscle aches or generalised pain. Within two years of randomisation 346 adverse events were recorded; most events were classed as respiratory exacerbations (n = 230) and it was stated that there was no difference in incidence between the two groups (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>Papaionnou reported serious adverse events in the alendronate group as exacerbation of CF (n = 3), bronchial superinfection (n = 1), hypoglycaemic seizure (n = 1), gastrointestinal obstruction (n = 1) and intestinal obstruction (n = 1). Serious adverse events reported for the control group included an exacerbation of CF (n = 3), with two of these participants experiencing additional gastrointestinal complaints (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Withdrawals</HEADING>
<P>We have presented data for withdrawals due to adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>) and total withdrawals (<LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies described withdrawals from the study. At 12 and 24 months, there were significantly more withdrawals due to adverse events in the treatment group compared to the control group, OR 4.07 (95% CI 1.11 to 14.90) and 16.34 (95% CI 1.98 to 134.89) respectively. At 6, 12 and 24 months, data from these trials do not show any significant difference between treatment or control groups for total withdrawals for any reason (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Aris study, of the 53 participants who started the protocol, five dropped out in the first six months. The reasons included pregnancy (n = 1, experienced a spontaneous abortion in her first trimester), dysphagia (n = 1, experienced difficulty swallowing the first tablet and had similar difficulties swallowing other medications), and diarrhoea (n = 3). For the first two participants, it was unclear which group they were allocated to. One of the participants experiencing diarrhoea was receiving alendronate and two were receiving placebo. No participants withdrew due to gastrointestinal reflux symptoms. Of the 48 participants who completed DXA assessment at six months beyond baseline, 4 out of 24 in each group withdrew before the DXA assessment at 12 months beyond baseline. In the treatment group, the withdrawals were due to lung transplantation (n = 1), moving (n = 2) and non-compliance (n = 1); in the control group these were due to lung transplantation (n = 2), death (n = 1) and moving (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the first 12 months of the later Haworth trial, 3 out of 17 in the oral risedronate group withdrew from the study completely (due to bone pain) and three patients discontinued the study medication (one citing bone pain and the other two participants citing muscle aches or generalised pain) but remained in the study for follow up. Between 12 and 24 months one further participant withdrew from the intervention group (citing bone pain). At 24 months, 12 participants remained in study with nine still taking the study drug. Immediately after randomisation one participant in the placebo group withdrew consent before taking the study medication. Therefore, only 18 participants were commenced on placebo. By 12 months, two participants in the placebo group withdrew consent and one participant had died. By 24 months, three participants in the placebo group had withdrawn consent and four patients had died, hence at 24 months, 12 participants remained in the control group of the study. In the 24 months there was no significant difference between groups with respect to total withdrawals (8 of 17 in the risedronate group ceased the medication, 7 out of 19 in the control group), OR 1.52 (95% CI 0.40 to 5.78) (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the 12-month trial by Papaioannou, 4 of 27 in the oral alendronate group withdrew (one due to an adverse event, one withdrew consent and two due to non-compliance). In the placebo group, 5 of 29 withdrew (two due to non-compliance, two due to an adverse event and one was lost to follow-up) (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>At 24 months, Chapman reports there was no significant difference between intravenous zoledronate and control with respect to total withdrawals (3 out of 10 in the treatment group, 6 out of 12 in the control group), OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.07 to 2.50) or withdrawals due to adverse events (2 out of 10 in the treatment group, 0 of 12 in the treatment group), OR 7.35 (0.31 to 173.13). The adverse events have been described previously. The withdrawal that was unrelated to adverse events in the treatment group was due to loss to follow-up. The six withdrawals in the control group were due to loss to follow-up (n = 1), decreased BMD to withdrawal threshold (n = 3), poor compliance to study requirements (n = 1) and a combination of the latter two reasons (n = 1) (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Haworth also reports no significant difference between intravenous pamidronate and control groups with respect to total withdrawals over the six months (2 out of 15 in the pamidronate group, 1 out of 16 in the control group), OR 2.31 (95% CI 0.19 to 28.47). One participant from each group died, while a second participant in the pamidronate group withdrew in order to receive a double lung transplant. No participant withdrew due to other adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the 48 participants in the oral alendronate trial who completed DXA assessment at six months beyond baseline, one participant out of 24 in the control group died during the latter six months of the study compared to none in the treatment group. This difference was not statistically significant, OR 3.13 (95% CI 0.12 to 80.68) (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-03-13 10:55:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Six studies investigated the effect of bisphosphonates in adults with CF who had not undergone lung transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). One study assessed this in adults with CF who had undergone lung transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>). Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates increased BMD in adults with CF. However, severe bone pain and flu-like symptoms were common with intravenous agents, especially in participants not taking glucocorticoids. A reduction in fracture rate was not observed.</P>
<P>Oral bisphosphonates (alendronate and risedronate) were associated with increased BMD at the lumbar spine and hip or femur regions in adults with CF who had not undergone lung transplantation in the meta-analysis from three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). Three trials assessing different intravenous bisphosphonate regimens (agent, duration and frequency) in this population group also showed improved lumbar spine BMD (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Both trials with hip or femur BMD as a measure showed positive effects on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). The two studies that assessed radial BMD had conflicting results. Radial BMD was significantly improved in the zoledronate study of 24-months duration (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>), but not in the pamidronate study with six-months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was significant clinical heterogeneity between the studies but in the majority, only low statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Lumbar spine and hip BMD were also improved by intravenous pamidronate in a single trial in adult CF participants post-lung transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>These trials provide valuable data on two different populations; adults with CF who have received a transplant and those who have not. Although the inclusion criteria, duration of follow up and the magnitude of effect were different for the trials, similar trends for BMD effect were seen, suggesting that the beneficial effects of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates might be generalisable to a fairly broad population of people living with CF.</P>
<P>Bone mineral density is only an intermediate outcome. The more clinically important endpoint is the occurrence of new fractures. There was no significant effect of treatment on fractures (total, vertebral or non-vertebral) in participants with or without lung transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Only one trial assessed quality of life, with no significant effect of intervention on physical or mental components of the score (<LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fever was not reported in association with oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>). Gastro-oesophageal symptoms were reported, but not significantly increased, in the trials of oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Bone pain was reported in one of the three trials of oral bisphosphonates (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>). Participants who did not receive corticosteroids during the clinical trial of intravenous pamidronate were more likely to experience bone pain (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). The observed relationship between the regular use of glucocorticoid therapy and lack of bone pain may be explained by evidence that corticosteroids suppress the release of TNF-alpha (<LINK REF="REF-Steer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steer 1997</LINK>), an inflammatory cytokine known to increase bone resorption. Haworth suggests that bone pain may be avoided by prescribing a short course of oral corticosteroids before and at the time of pamidronate infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>). Zoledronate, a more potent bisphosphonate than pamidronate was associated with severe musculoskeletal pain resulting in discontinuation of one trial early in enrolment (<LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>). In a subsequent study of intravenous zoledronate, participants were prescribed daily prednisolone for three days commencing on the day of the first infusion (and repeated if thought necessary with subsequent infusions). Musculoskeletal pain was not significantly increased in the treatment group. However, fever and other flu-like effects were more commonly reported, severe in some participants, although the majority continued treatment. The authors proposed that a longer period of treatment with corticosteroids, including pre-treatment dosing may diminish such adverse effects (<LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>). A consensus statement has recommended pre-treatment with oral corticosteroids for three to five days prior to bisphosphonate infusion, but this has not been studied in an RCT (<LINK REF="REF-Aris-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aris 2005</LINK>). None of the participants in the lung-transplanted group, all of whom were receiving corticosteroids, experienced any bone pain.</P>
<P>For treatment duration of 12 to 24 months, there were significantly more withdrawals due to adverse events than in those not receiving bisphopsphonates. There was no significant effect on survival. The lack of significant differences in the rate of fractures, gastrointestinal adverse effects, withdrawals or survival may relate to the small numbers of participants involved and the short duration of the trials</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the trials due to blinding was judged as present (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2001</LINK>), unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Aris-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Aris 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Boyle-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Boyle 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chapman-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Chapman 2009</LINK>) or low (<LINK REF="STD-Haworth-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Haworth 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Papaioannou-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Papaioannou 2008</LINK>). When participants are aware of the treatment they are receiving, they may be more or less likely to report adverse events. The judgment of individuals who collect and interpret patient data may be affected when the assessor is aware of the treatment a participant is receiving. Lack of blinding may result in biased results.</P>

<P>Based on seven small trials, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates cause a rapid increase in spine and hip or femoral BMD in adults with CF. Only two trials assessed the effect on distal radial BMD, with only the study of longer duration reporting an improvement. Severe bone pain is common with the use of intravenous bisphosphonates in participants with CF not receiving oral corticosteroids, and may limit tolerability. Severe bone pain was also observed in one of three trials of oral bisphosphonates. Oral bisphosphonate treatment did not cause increased gastrointestinal symptoms. Only one trial assessed quality of life and did not show a benefit. These short-term trials (maximum of two years) did not show fracture reduction or survival benefit. Currently, no other options for the treatment of CF-related osteoporosis have been reported in the public domain. Thus, although bisphosphonates increase BMD, no recommendation can be made concerning the use of bisphosphonates in participants with CF as an effect on fractures could not be demonstrated.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-30 08:37:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This area of research would benefit from a large multicentre RCT of bisphosphonates (oral and intravenous) with separate analyses for participants with and without lung transplantation to measure the effectiveness of these therapies on outcomes important to people with CF, such as fractures and survival. These outcomes would require long-term studies. Data on adverse events such as gastrointestinal events, bone pain and fever, in addition to the use of corticosteroids should also be recorded. Studies assessing pre-treatment with corticosteroids are required.</P>

<P>
<B>Intervention group</B>: in the first 12 months, 3 out of 17 in the oral risedronate group withdrew from the study completely (due to bone pain) and 3 patients discontinued the study medication (one citing bone pain and the other 2 participants citing muscle aches or generalised pain) but remained in the study for follow up.

<P>
<B>Placebo group</B>: immediately after randomisation 1 participant in the placebo group withdrew consent before taking the study medication. Therefore, only 18 participants were commenced on placebo. By 12 months, 2 participants in the placebo group withdrew consent and 1 participant had died. By 24 months, 3 participants in the placebo group had withdrawn consent and 4 patients had died, hence at 24 months, 12 participants remained in the control group of the study.</P>

<P>The study was stopped by its Data and Safety Monitoring Board after 3 participants experienced dramatic musculoskeletal pain, 2 requiring emergency room assessment. Symptoms began 6 to 8 hours after infusion, peaked at 12 to 18 hours, and were characterized by severe chest and back pain. Along with musculoskeletal pain, one participant also experienced a fever of 104<SUP>o</SUP>F lasting for several hours and a rise in Tumour Necrosis Factor-&#945;. Although the most severe symptoms resolved within 48 to 72 hours, participants reported continued arthralgias for up to a week.</P>
