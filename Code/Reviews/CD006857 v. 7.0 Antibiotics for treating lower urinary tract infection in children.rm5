<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children. The most commonly presenting infection of the urinary tract is known as cystitis and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. This review identified 16 studies investigating antibiotics for UTI in children. Results suggest that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments; there was not enough data to draw conclusions about other treatment durations, or effectiveness of particular antibiotics. Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific regimen.</P>

<P>Sixteen RCTs, analysing 1,116 children were included. Conventional 10-day antibiotic treatment significantly increased the number of children free of persistent bacteriuria compared to single-dose therapy (6 studies, 228 children: RR 2.01, 95%CI 1.06 to 3.80). No heterogeneity was observed. Persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment was reported in 24% of children receiving single-dose therapy compared to 10% of children who were randomised to 10-day therapy. There were no significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence following treatment, or re-infection following treatment. There was insufficient data to analyse the effect of antibiotics on renal parenchymal damage, compliance, development of resistant organisms or adverse events. Despite the inclusion of 16 RCTs, methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-05 21:52:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with UTI, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower UTI. This review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. This data adds to an existing Cochrane review comparing short and long<I>-</I>course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-19 14:43:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-05 21:53:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants and children and the most common bacterial infection in infants under three months (<LINK REF="REF-Stanley-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanley 2005</LINK>). Infection of the urinary tract presents in three ways; as covert bacteriuria on screening; non-systemic symptoms and infection limited to the urethra and bladder (cystitis or lower UTI); or systemic symptoms and infection of the kidneys (pyelonephritis or upper UTI). Lower UTI is the most commonly presenting and in the majority of cases can be easily treated with a course of antibiotic therapy with no further complications. Some children, particularly young infants who are unable to describe how they feel, present with non-specific symptoms making it difficult to diagnose as either lower or upper UTI, whereas older children present with more specific complaints such as dysuria or frequency. The prognosis of lower UTI in childhood is largely unknown. The relationship between UTI, renal scarring and vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is unclear, as is the progression of lower UTI to pyelonephritis and subsequent damage to the kidneys. Current practice and treatment decisions are not underpinned by strong evidence and are largely the result of clinical judgment and the biological plausibility of future kidney damage.</P>
<P>It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of the number of infants and children who will present with a lower UTI during childhood. Current practice in most countries is based on historical data from studies conducted in secondary and tertiary referral centres and renal registries. This fails to adequately describe the larger primary care population for whom very limited population-based data, of robust quality, exists. Of the population-based studies available, variable incidence rates, ranging from approximately 0.1% (<LINK REF="REF-Messi-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messi 1988</LINK>) to 3% (<LINK REF="REF-Winberg-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Winberg 1974</LINK>) have been presented. The cumulative incidence of childhood UTI is likely to be somewhere between 5% and 12% (<LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hellstrom-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellstrom 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>A number of antimicrobials have been used to treat children with lower UTIs; however there is neither agreement on the most effective agent, nor the optimal dosage. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat lower childhood UTI by investigating the alleviation of symptoms and persistence of bacteriuria following treatment, recurrent symptomatic UTI and renal parenchymal damage.</P>
<P>An existing Cochrane review investigates antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in children (<LINK REF="REF-Hodson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodson 2007</LINK>) and another compared short to standard duration oral antibiotic treatment for acute UTI in children (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003</LINK>). The latter concluded that a 2-4 day course of oral antibiotics appears to be as effective as 7-14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI (cystitis) in children. Two additional reviews were identified (<LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK>) comparing the efficacies of single-dose, short-course and standard course antimicrobial therapy for childhood UTI. This review provides additional data in Cochrane format, particularly on the duration of antibiotic therapy.</P>

<P>We initially identified 2316 potentially relevant reports of studies. After evaluating their titles and abstracts we excluded 1823 articles because they were not RCTs, included adult patients, or did not investigate antibiotics for UTI. The full-text articles of the remaining 493 studies were evaluated, with a further 393 excluded, leaving 100 potentially relevant RCTs. After further assessment 16 studies met out inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<P>We were unable to perform the pre-specified subgroup analyses. The majority of studies did not report results for different paediatric sub-populations, so this analysis could not be undertaken. Comparing older and newer manuscripts was also not possible because there were not enough 'newer' manuscripts. With the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2001</LINK> (which was the only study to compare 10-day TMP with 10-day TMP-SMX) and <LINK REF="STD-Komoroski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Komoroski 1999</LINK> (single-dose versus 10-day treatment), all studies compared were performed within a 10-year period of each other. Because the method of randomisation was not sufficiently described for most of the studies, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis that excluded quasi-RCTs. Data of randomisation, method of allocation concealment and blinding were not reported by the majority of studies and we were therefore unable to conduct sensitivity analyses comparing higher and lower quality studies.</P>
<P>Formal testing for publication bias using funnel plots was not possible because of the small number of studies identified.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-06-05 22:13:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>UTIs are relatively common childhood illness and require antibiotic treatment to alleviate symptoms and clear infection from the urinary tract. This review was designed to include all randomised and quasi-RCTs addressing all aspects of antibiotic treatment for children with lower UTI. Relatively few studies investigated the same comparisons, therefore meta-analyses included only a small number of studies. Nevertheless, we did not identify many instances of heterogeneity. The included studies predominantly examined bacteriological outcomes (persistent bacteriuria, recurrence, re-infection) rather than clinical outcomes (persisting symptoms) as measures of treatment efficacy. Amoxicillin or amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX were the most common antibiotics given in the included studies.</P>
<P>Compared to single-dose therapy, 10-day antibiotic treatment was more effective in eliminating bacteriuria (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.80). When we limited our analysis to only include those studies using the same antibiotic (amoxicillin) in both treatment groups, the differences no longer remained statistically significant (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.33). It is unclear whether this is attributable to bias considering most of our included studies were of poor quality and sample sizes were too small to detect differences; or whether just by chance. Nevertheless, the actual numbers of children with persistent bacteriuria, 18/63 (29%) in the single-dose group compared to 8/68 (12%) of the 10-day group, represent a clinically significant difference. No differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups; this data adds to an existing Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003</LINK>) comparing short and long-courses of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.</P>
<P>No comparisons showed any significant differences between groups for persistent symptoms, recurrence, or re-infection following treatment for any other dosing regimens. In this review, there were not enough data to draw conclusions about these results; at this stage, the lack of significant differences is more likely due to the inclusion of small, poorer quality studies, rather than demonstrating equivalence between different antibiotic or dosing regimens.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-06-05 17:02:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>While there were 16 RCTs included in this review, the number of children analysed totalled 1116 (1331 randomised); only three studies included more than 100 children. The median sample size was small (49 children), and wide CIs around most of the effect estimates suggest that studies probably lacked the statistical power to identify such differences. Of the 16 studies included, 13 were conducted between 1981 and 1990. Diagnosis of bacteriuria since this time has not changed significantly, but not all of the antibiotics used in these studies remain available. In most of the meta-analyses carried out, there were few studies included, preventing a thorough investigation of the sources of heterogeneity between study results. In particular, we could not explore the influence of specific sources of bias or methodological quality, and most importantly we could not offer results stratified by age subgroups. Adverse events were reported by some studies, but were not analysed by any included studies; this hindered our efforts to present a full picture of the benefits and harms of antibiotics treatment for lower UTI, which was our intended aim.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-06-05 22:13:42 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the included studies for every comparison was 'very low' according to GRADE criteria (see <I>Summary of findings tables</I>). The lack of reporting of randomisation method, allocation concealment and blinding in most studies, and the large losses to follow-up in three studies are likely to contribute to biases in the results reported. Despite the inclusion of 16 studies, their methodological weakness and small sample sizes made it difficult to conclude if any of the included antibiotics or regimens were superior to another.</P>
<P>It was unfortunate that no study specifically addressed whether the efficacy of therapies differed according to patient age; we had planned subgroup analyses to investigate this because there are claims that UTIs can lead to long-term damage in younger children (<LINK REF="REF-Vernon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vernon 1997</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Fine-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fine 1985</LINK>, 90% of the adolescents included were sexually active; this may have caused bias in that sexually active people (particularly women) are known to experience more frequent UTIs than those who abstain (<LINK REF="REF-Leibovici-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leibovici 1987</LINK>). Four studies included young people over the age of 16 years: <LINK REF="STD-Shapiro-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Shapiro 1981</LINK> included children aged 2-18 years, but the mean age was 5.6 years; <LINK REF="STD-Stahl-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stahl 1984</LINK> included children aged 2-17 years, but the mean age was 4.75 years; <LINK REF="STD-Komoroski-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Komoroski 1999</LINK> included children aged 0-18 years, but 80% were younger than 16 years; <LINK REF="STD-Fine-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fine 1985</LINK> included female adolescents aged 12-18 years with a mean age of 16.5 years. Although a lower tract UTI in an adolescent female is likely a very different condition than lower tract UTI in an infant or young child, post-hoc sensitivity analysis, removing <LINK REF="STD-Fine-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Fine 1985</LINK> did not alter the conclusions for persistent bacteriuria.</P>
<P>None of the included studies systematically collected data on the adverse effects of antibiotics; this made our original objective of summarising the benefits and harms of antibiotic treatment difficult. Although it is not possible to compare the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy from the included studies, from the few adverse antibiotic effects reported it seems unlikely that the expected side-effects course of antibiotics would be significant.</P>
<P>Data on resistant organisms were only reported in one study. There is concern regarding the increasing resistance to antibiotics, specifically to penicillins and cephalosporins. Increasing antibiotic resistance complicates the choice of empiric regimens and is likely to become an increasing problem, particularly considering the majority of health professionals prescribe antibiotics prior to knowing results of urine cultures. Utilizing local antimicrobial susceptibility data (e.g. hospital or laboratory data) to predict the antibiotics that would likely be active may be useful.</P>
<P>Optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in children has both cost and practical implications. Single-dose treatment, if effective can increase compliance as the treatment can be administered at the healthcare site and is likely to be cheaper. These advantages are even more important in under-resourced countries and in lower socio-economic areas.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-06-05 22:16:20 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The literature search included major international databases and a fairly broad search strategy was utilized to ensure all relevant studies were identified. We assume that we identified all RCTs relevant to our review question; however many of the excluded studies were foreign language articles and there is the potential that a relevant study was overlooked in the translation process. Although we stated in out protocol that we would attempt to contact investigators for missing or additional data, 10/16 studies were over 20 years old and the most recent of the remaining six studies was published a decade ago and we were not able to make contact with any investigator.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-06-05 22:18:22 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A Cochrane review comparing short (2-4 days) with standard (7-14 days) duration antibiotic therapy of the same antibiotic in children with UTI found no significant differences between groups and concluded that short duration of treatment offers a reasonable option for children with lower tract UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003)</LINK>. We excluded this comparison from our analysis to avoid duplication, however we did include the comparison with different antibiotics; the results did not differ to <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003</LINK>; there were no differences between 2-4 day and 7-10 day antibiotic treatment. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Keren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keren 2002</LINK> compared short (both single-dose and 2-4 days) with long (7-10 days) treatment. Of the 17 included studies, no differences were found between groups for treatment failure or re-infection. Subgroup analyses with one day, and 2-4 day groups did not change these results. A systematic review by <LINK REF="REF-Tran-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tran 2001</LINK> reported that overall, short-course therapy was not as effective as conventional long-course. The review found insufficient evidence for single-dose aminoglycoside treatment to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>A Cochrane review in non-pregnant adult women with lower UTI found that three days of antibiotic therapy was similar to 5-10 days in achieving symptomatic cure, while the longer treatment was more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure (<LINK REF="REF-Milo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Milo 2005</LINK>). Our review did not have enough data on persisting symptoms at the completion of treatment to investigate the differences between bacteriological and symptomatic cure.</P>

<P>This review adds to the evidence that short-course therapy is an appropriate therapy for children with lower UTI. While 10 days of therapy was significantly more effective than single-dose therapy, there were no differences in either this review or <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2003</LINK> between short and longer duration antibiotic therapy. Single-dose therapy is not recommended in children with UTI; 10-day treatment was significantly more effective in eliminating bacteriuria. No comparisons showed any differences between groups for persisting symptoms, recurrence, or re-infection following treatment, however this is due to a paucity of RCTs rather than demonstrating equivalence. This review did not provide incontrovertible evidence about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy or which antibiotic should be used.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-06-05 21:47:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adequately powered RCTs investigating single-dose compared to standard (7-14 day) therapy, and single-dose compared to short duration (2-4 days) therapy should be conducted to establish the effectiveness of single-dose treatment. Additional studies comparing single-dose with 10 days of amoxicillin are needed to investigate whether single-dose쟧ncreases persistent bacteriuria. Outcomes for further studies should include both clinical and bacteriological measures.</P>

<LI>Nine patients receiving ceftriaxone 250 mg were excluded from this analysis. It appears the study was originally designed to investigate ceftriaxone 250 mg versus control. The ceftriaxone 500 mg groups was added at a later date. When high treatment failures were reported, the 250 mg group was discontinued. The ceftriaxone 250 mg group is not reported as part of this review; using block randomisation, the groups should be of equal size. It does not seem logical that only 9 children were allocated to the ceftriaxone 250 mg group when more than double this number were allocated to the other 2 groups.</LI>
