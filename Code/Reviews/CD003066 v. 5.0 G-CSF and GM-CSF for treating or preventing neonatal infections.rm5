<P>Infants born before 32 weeks and infants that are small for their gestational age are at high risk of developing infections while in hospital. These infections can cause death, disability (including cerebral palsy) as a result of damage to nervous tissue as well as contributing to chronic lung disease. Infection-related deaths have remained constant for two decades and antibiotic resistance is increasing, emphasising the need for new ways to prevent infection.<BR/>
<BR/>The haemopoietic colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are naturally occurring substances (cytokines) that can increase circulating white blood cells (neutrophils) and their ability to destroy bacteria. Common minor side effects are low grade fever and skeletal pain. The review authors identified seven treatment studies of 257 premature infants with suspected systemic bacterial infection. Adding G-CSF or GM-CSF to antibiotic therapy did not improve survival, overall. It may be, however, that infants who had clinically low neutrophils at the start of treatment did show some reduction in number of deaths by day 14 (taken from three studies). In three studies in which 359 low birthweight or premature neonates were treated preventatively (prophylaxis) no reduction in deaths was evident in those neonates receiving GM-CSF. GM-CSF was well tolerated with no adverse reactions in these small studies.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), are naturally occurring cytokines that stimulate the production and antibacterial function of neutrophils and monocytes. Two strategies have been adopted for exploring whether CSFs can provide clinical benefit for preterm infants. The first has investigated their use as a treatment to improve outcome in established systemic infection, especially when complicated by a low neutrophil count. The alternative strategy has been to use CSFs prophylactically, to prevent sepsis prospectively through stimulation of neutrophil production and bactericidal function.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the efficacy and safety of the haemopoietic colony stimulating factors (G-CSF or GM-CSF) in newborn infants, when used for:<BR/>a) treatment of suspected or proven systemic infection to reduce mortality, or<BR/>b) prophylaxis, to prevent systemic infection in infants at high risk of nosocomial infection.<BR/>To determine, in subgroup analysis, the influence of pre-existing or high risk of neutropenia on the outcome of therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) were searched in April 2003 using the keywords: G-CSF, GM-CSF, infant newborn, with and without the limit Clinical Trial. In addition, reference lists of identified RCTs, meta-analyses and personal files were searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>The criteria used to select studies for inclusion were:<BR/>Design: RCT.<BR/>Subjects: Newborn infants in intensive care.<BR/>Interventions: G-CSF or GM-CSF given as treatment in conjunction with antibiotics for suspected or microbiologically proven systemic infection. G-CSF or GM-CSF given as prophylaxis with the aim of reducing the incidence of systemic infection. <BR/>Outcomes: Treatment studies reporting all cause mortality. Prophylaxis studies reporting subsequent incidence of sepsis and / or mortality.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Relative risks (RR) and risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effect model are reported. Number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for the outcomes that showed a statistically significant reduction in RR.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Seven treatment studies of 257 infants with suspected systemic bacterial infection and three prophylaxis studies comprising 359 neonates are analysed.<BR/> <BR/>Treatment studies: There is no evidence that the addition of G-CSF or GM-CSF to antibiotic therapy in preterm infants with suspected systemic infection reduces immediate all cause mortality. No significant survival advantage was seen at 14 days from the start of therapy [typical RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.38,1.33); typical RD -0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.04)]. However all seven of the treatment studies were small, the largest recruiting only 60 infants. <BR/>The subgroup analysis of 97 infants from three treatment studies who, in addition to systemic infection, had clinically significant neutropenia (&lt; 1.7 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/l) at trial entry, does show a significant reduction in mortality by day 14 [RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.92); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.33, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3-33)].</P>
<P>Prophylaxis studies have not demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality in neonates receiving GM-CSF [RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.24,1.44); RD -0.03 (95% CI -0.08,0.02)]. The identification of sepsis as the primary outcome of prophylaxis studies has been hampered by inadequately stringent definitions of systemic infection. However, data from one study suggest that prophylactic GM-CSF may provide protection against infection when given to preterm infants who are neutropenic or at high risk of developing postnatal neutropenia.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to support the introduction of either G-CSF or GM-CSF into neonatal practice, either as treatment of established systemic infection to reduce resulting mortality, or as prophylaxis to prevent systemic infection in high risk neonates. No toxicity of CSF use was reported in any study included in this review. The limited data suggesting that CSF treatment may reduce mortality when systemic infection is accompanied by severe neutropenia should be investigated further in adequately powered trials which recruit sufficient infants infected with organisms associated with a significant mortality risk. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-21 10:07:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of death. Published rates of sepsis in preterm newborns range from 25-50% (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cooke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 1997</LINK>) and neonates in whom late onset sepsis develops are significantly more likely to die than those who avoid infection (17% vs 7%; p &lt; 0.0001) (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>). Sepsis also leads to disability, including cerebral palsy through damage to white matter and other brain injury (<LINK REF="REF-Damman-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Damman 1998</LINK>), and contributes to the aetiology of chronic lung disease. These conditions are powerful determinants of outcome after preterm birth. Sepsis related mortality has remained constant for two decades (<LINK REF="REF-Stoll-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 1996</LINK>) and antibiotic resistance is increasing, emphasising the need for novel strategies to prevent infection and its consequences.</P>
<P>Neutropenia, which occurs frequently in infants born before 32 weeks and particularly in those with intrauterine growth restriction, adds substantially to the risk of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Gessler-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gessler 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engle 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koening-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koening 1989</LINK>). When sepsis is associated with severe neutropenia, mortality exceeds 50% (<LINK REF="REF-Rodwell-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodwell 1993</LINK>). Neutropenia is due to immaturity of neutrophil production (<LINK REF="REF-Christensen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christensen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000a</LINK>), but preterm infant neutrophils are also functionally immature (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000b</LINK>); both factors contribute to infection risk and morbidity.</P>
<P>The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), are naturally occurring cytokines that are in routine clinical use in adults and children to accelerate neutrophil recovery following chemotherapy. In this setting both CSFs have been shown to be free from serious adverse effects. Common minor side effects are low grade fever and skeletal pain. Rarely, capillary leak and pulmonary infiltrates have been reported when high doses are administered rapidly. In neonates there is a theoretical risk that activation of neutrophils and monocytes in the circulation might exacerbate lung disease or necrotising enterocolitis.</P>
<P>The earliest published case of CSF use in a human neonate was in 1991 and reported the successful correction of persistent neutropenia and associated recurrent infections in a preterm infant following administration of G-CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1991</LINK>). During the early 1990's several studies demonstrated the ability of both G- and GM-CSF to protect newborn rat pups from sepsis-related death (reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Carr-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 1997</LINK>). Encouraged by these data and following the two earliest phase I/II pilot studies in human neonates of G-CSF (<LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>) and GM-CSF (<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1995</LINK>), a small number of randomised studies have been undertaken investigating the potential of CSFs to protect against infection and infection-related death in preterm infants at high risk of sepsis.</P>
<P>Two strategies have been adopted for exploring whether CSFs can provide clinical benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Modi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modi 2000</LINK>). The first has investigated their use as a treatment to increase circulating neutrophils and improve outcome in established sepsis complicated by a low neutrophil count. G-CSF has been used in these studies because of its powerful ability to mobilise preformed neutrophils from the marrow into the circulation and its effect on neutrophil precursor proliferation.</P>
<P>The alternative strategy has been to use CSFs prophylactically, to prevent sepsis by prospectively stimulating neutrophil production and enhancing phagocyte bactericidal function. Some prophylactic studies have taken established neutropenia as an indication for commencing CSFs. These studies have tended to use G-CSF. Other investigators have adopted the approach that the prevention of neutropenia may be a more effective sepsis prophylaxis strategy and provide benefit to a more inclusive population of infants at risk. These studies have tended to use GM-CSF, because in addition to its stimulating effect on neutrophil production, it upregulates bactericidal function of both neutrophils and monocytes to a greater extent than that achieved by G-CSF (<LINK REF="REF-Lejeune-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lejeune 1999</LINK>), and thus may correct the phagocytic functional defects believed to contribute to the high incidence of neonatal sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2000b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2000b</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an appropriate time to undertake a systematic review of the subject as the first cohort of clinical studies has now been published. The review includes randomised controlled studies in which a CSF was used as prophylaxis to prevent infection, or used as a treatment adjunct to antibiotic therapy in established infection to reduce mortality. Studies using either G- or GM-CSF are included.</P>

Increased incidence of chronic lung disease or necrotising enterocolitis.</P>
<P>b) Prophylaxis studies:</P>
<P>Primary outcome:<BR/>i) Sepsis. <BR/>Definition of sepsis: The diagnostic criteria used for identifying sepsis may differ and this has been taken into account when analysing trials. Trials have been grouped, and analysed separately, according to whether they used: a) Clinical plus microbiological criteria; b) Either clinical criteria, or microbiological criteria alone.</P>
<P>Definitions of short-term and long-term sepsis prevention: The study period during which sepsis is prevented by CSF therapy is likely to be defined differently in different studies and will depend on the treatment protocol and duration of CSF administration. However, to achieve some comparability between studies, data have been sought to permit analysis of a) short term sepsis prevention, defined as during CSF therapy and up to 10 days following discontinuation of CSF, and b) long term sepsis prevention, defined as during the subsequent reported follow up period, up to the time of discharge from hospital.</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes:<BR/>i) Failure to prevent or correct pre-exisiting neutropenia. (As defined above)<BR/>ii) All cause mortality: Short term and long term.

<P>Heterogeneity of treatment effects between trials was assessed graphically and tested using the standard chi-squared test. A weighted estimate of the relative risk (RR) across trials was calculated using a fixed effects model. Risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) were also calculated. 95% CIs were calculated for all outcomes. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a random effects model to allow for possible between trial heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the robustness of the results of the review to trial quality.</P>

<P>USE OF G-CSF OR GM-CSF</P>
<P>TREATMENT STUDIES: Six studies used G-CSF (Filgrastim, "Neupogen" - Amgen Corp. USA). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) used GM-CSF (Molgramostim, "Leucomax" - Novartis, UK). Administration was either by subcutaneous injection or by slow intravenous infusion. Apart from the phase I/II dose-finding study (<LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>), all the G-CSF studies used a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day for 3 days, or in one study for the duration of antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>). The GM-CSF study (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) used 5 mcg/kg/day for seven days.</P>
<P>PROPHYLAXIS STUDIES: All published randomised studies have used GM-CSF, but in two different preparations. <LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK> used Molgramostim ("Leucomax" Novartis) which is a non-glycosylated recombinant protein. <LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1999</LINK> used sargramostim ("Leukine", Immunex Corp. USA) which is a glycosylated recombinant protein. They are believed to have equivalent in vivo activity. The former study used 10 mcg/kg/day by SC injection; the latter 8 mcg/kg/day by IV infusion.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-11-06 14:14:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See Additional table: <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> Methodological quality of included studies</P>
<P>Size: All seven of the treatment studies were small; the largest recruiting 60 infants. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Miura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 2001</LINK>) reported power or justified sample sizes.</P>
<P>Bias: Adequate allocation concealment (grade A) was described in only two of the 10 studies; in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) allocation was quasi-random (alternate) and in the remainder the method of randomisation was unclear. In five studies a placebo was used to blind the intervention. However, because the administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF rapidly increases peripheral blood neutrophil counts, true blinding of treatment allocation can never be fully achieved. When outcomes other than mortality are used, blinding of outcome assessment is more important as in neonates the identification of systemic infection involves an element of clinical judgement. Eight of the ten studies reported results using an intention to treat approach, including all randomised infants. The two remaining treatment trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossou_x002d_Agakidou-_x0027_98" TYPE="STUDY">Drossou-Agakidou '98</LINK>) analyse infants with clinical signs of sepsis plus a positive blood culture. Our interpretation is that recruitment of infants into these two studies was delayed until culture results were available. However it is not entirely clear whether some infants were recruited on clinical suspicion of infection and those subsequently found to have negative blood cultures excluded from the analysis (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: completeness of follow-up unclear). Clarification could not be obtained though both authors were contacted. Recruitment to one study (<LINK REF="STD-Miura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 2001</LINK>) was stopped early following an interim analysis, because of lack of evidence of efficacy. This may produce a biased estimate of the treatment effect.</P>
<P>A quality score was produced by assigning one point for adequate handling of each of the following potential sources of bias: adequate allocation concealment, blinding of the intervention, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of follow-up of all randomised subjects for short term outcomes, and completing the planned recruitment. The quality score therefore ranges from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). There were five high quality trials (one score of 5, four scores of 4).</P>
<P>Treatment studies: The identification of systemic infection as a recruitment criterion was inadequate in one study, being based only on "the initiation of antibiotics" (<LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>). In this study less than 5% of recruits had sepsis confirmed by positive blood culture. The remaining studies used appropriate clinical and/or laboratory criteria. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Drossou_x002d_Agakidou-_x0027_98" TYPE="STUDY">Drossou-Agakidou '98</LINK>) required a positive blood culture for recruitment (however see above). The outcome of infants with culture positive "confirmed" systemic infection was not reported for any study.</P>
<P>Prophylactic studies: All studies reported the incidence of systemic infection as the primary outcome. However, all three used different criteria for identifying episodes of sepsis. The incidence of infection as an outcome will be very different depending on whether episodes are identified by both clinical and microbiological criteria together, or by either clinical criteria or microbiological criteria alone. Because of the difficulty of diagnosing systemic infection in neonates, high quality studies should pre-define this outcome on the basis of both objective clinical and microbiological criteria, and use assessors that are blind to the randomised intervention. This standard was not met by any study.</P>
<P>Toxicity: Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) discussed individual clinical features that might indicate toxicity. The general statements concerning lack of toxicity in other studies gives no indication of how closely information on toxicity was sought. No studies included long term follow up of all recruits.</P>
<P>Countries undertaking studies:<BR/>The location of studies involving infection may affect the outcome, because of differences in the incidence of nosocomial infection, the spectra of causative bacteria and the nature of the newborn population studied. Treatment studies: three studies recruited infants in the US, and one each in Greece, Mexico, Turkey and UK. Prophylaxis studies: two studies in US, one in UK.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-10-21 10:07:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>See: List of comparisons</P>
<P>616 infants have been enrolled into fully published RCTs to evaluate the potential benefit of G-CSF or GM-CSF when used as treatment or prophylaxis of sepsis in preterm neonates. The analyses have been grouped under 3 headings:<BR/>1) treatment studies<BR/>2) prophylaxis studies<BR/>3) toxicity of G-CSF and GM-CSF</P>
<P>TREATMENT STUDIES [Comparisons and Data Tables 01.]<BR/>These are studies that have examined the ability of G-CSF or GM-CSF to reduce mortality in suspected or microbiologically proven systemic bacterial infection. Seven studies (n = 257) met the inclusion criteria and reported at least one outcome of interest. Five used G-CSF, one used GM-CSF and one (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2002</LINK>) had both a G-CSF and a GM-CSF treatment arm. In two studies (n = 95) (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Drossou_x002d_Agakidou-_x0027_98" TYPE="STUDY">Drossou-Agakidou '98</LINK>) a positive blood culture plus clinical signs of sepsis were criteria for recruitment. In the remaining studies 30% (48/162) of recruited infants with clinically suspected sepsis were subsequently found to be blood culture positive. The outcomes of the culture positive subgroup were not specifically identified in any study and therefore separate analysis was not possible.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes - mortality to day 14 and day 28 from study entry:<BR/>Mortality to day 14 [comparison 01.01]:</P>
<P>All cause mortality to day 14 was available for all seven studies (n = 257). Overall there was no significant reduction in mortality in treated infants [RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.38,1.33); RD -0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.04)]. Only one study showed a significant benefit from CSF therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) [RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.94); RD -0.23 (95% CI -0.42, -0.05)]. This study had features which may be of relevance to its efficacy: all infants had microbiologically proven infection, which in over 75% of cases was due to gram negative organisms, and all subjects were neutropenic. It was also the largest study to use GM-CSF. If this study is excluded, the 6 remaining treatment studies showed almost no effect of G-CSF treatment on mortality [RR 1.09 (95% CI 0.52, 2.29); RD 0.02 (95% CI -0.09, 0.12)].</P>
<P>Mortality to day 28 [comparison 01.02]:<BR/>Data on mortality to day 28 could be extracted from five studies (n = 194). Between D14 and D28 there were five additional control and two additional treatment group deaths in studies with mortality outcome reported for both timepoints. This increased the difference between the groups to show an overall reduction in mortality in treated infants which just reaches significance [RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.27, 0.98); RD -0.12 (-0.23, -0.01); NNT 9 (95% CI 5-100)]. However this result was affected to a large extent by the Bilgin GM-CSF study described above. If this is excluded, the four G-CSF studies did not show significant reduction in mortality [RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.29, 1.39); RD -0.08 (95% CI -0.21, 0.06)].</P>
<P>Primary outcomes - mortality to day 14 and day 28 from trial entry - neutropenic subgroup:<BR/>Mortality to day 14, in infants neutropenic at trial entry [comparison 01.05]:<BR/>Neutropenia, for the purpose of this subgroup analysis was defined as &lt; 1.7 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/l. In two studies neutropenia of this degree was a recruitment criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>). While all but one study noted that some recruited infants were neutropenic, their outcomes were not separately reported. The study authors were contacted to obtain outcome data on those infants who had neutropenia, as defined, at study entry. To date, additional data have been received only from Bedford-Russell.</P>
<P>Thus three studies (n = 97) (<LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) contribute to this subgroup analysis. Together they show a significant reduction in mortality to day 14 when a CSF is given to neonates with systemic infection and neutropenia [RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.92); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.33, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3 - 33)]. However this result is again influenced to a major extent by the Bilgin study, which contributed 67% of the infants in this subgroup. In sensitivity analyses using either a random effects model or only the high quality studies, there is no longer a significant reduction.</P>
<P>Mortality to day 28: in infants neutropenic at trial entry [comparison 01.06]:<BR/>The same three studies were analysed for mortality at day 28 from recruitment. There was one additional death in each treatment group between day 14 and 28, the overall outcome is therefore similar [RR 0.38 (95% CI 0.16, 0.95); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.34, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3 - 34)].</P>
<P>Secondary outcomes<BR/>Mortality to discharge:<BR/>Five studies reported the number of infants who survived to discharge. In one study [<LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>] there were no deaths and thus four studies contribute to this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) (n = 136) [RR 0.53 (95% CI 0.25, 1.16); RD -0.09 (95% CI -0.20, 0.02)]; [comparison 01.03].<BR/>When only those infants with neutropenia at the start of the trial intervention are included (n = 97) there is a significantly lower all cause mortality following CSF treatment [RR 0.38 (95% CI 0.16, 0.95); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.34, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3 - 33)]; [comparison 01.07].</P>
<P>Failure to correct neutropenia within 48h from trial entry [comparison 01.04]:<BR/>This was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>) (n = 88).There was a significant difference in the risk of failure to correct neutropenia between infants treated with CSF and controls by 48h from the start of the intervention [RR 0.13 (95% CI 0.04, 0.46); RD -0.39 (95% CI -0.55, -0.24)]. The greatest effect was seen in the GM-CSF treatment study, however the number of infants in whom this outcome was reported following G-CSF treatment (n = 13) was small. An additional study (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2002</LINK>) specifically compared the neutrophil counts at day two, five, seven between those infants treated with G-CSF and GM-CSF. G-CSF resulted in a significantly more rapid correction of neutropenia by day 7 (p = 0.03).</P>
<P>Long term follow-up; mortality and disability reported beyond discharge:<BR/>This has only been reported in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>), and then only for part of the study population. Twenty one of the original 33 treated and nine control infants were examined at median two years (range 15 to 36m) (Rosenthal 1996). There had been no deaths since the primary report. The cognition, language and social developmental performance scores were within the normal range for age and motor deficits were "typical of high-risk, low birth weight neonates". However there was no comparison made between G-CSF and control infants.</P>
<P>PROPHYLAXIS STUDIES (Comparisons and Data Tables 02.)<BR/>These are studies in which G-CSF or GM-CSF have been given prophylactically, starting as soon as possible after birth, with the aim of enhancing neonatal immunity in order to reduce the incidence of systemic infection and infection related mortality. Only three studies have been published (n = 359). All three used GM-CSF and all restricted recruitment to infants &lt; 1500g or &lt; 32w gestation. The primary outcome of prophylactic studies for this review is a reduction in systemic infection. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) (n = 75) identified episodes of sepsis by the onset of indicative clinical signs supported by a positive blood culture. The other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1999</LINK>) (n = 284) used either clinical or microbiological criteria alone for identifying sepsis as an outcome. Only the secondary outcome short term mortality is comparable and can be combined for all three studies.</P>
<P>Primary outcomes:<BR/>Sepsis incidence to 10 days after intervention complete [comparison 02.03]:<BR/>Short term sepsis prevention, where sepsis is defined by clinical plus microbiological criteria, is reported only by (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) (n = 75). Although there was a trend to reduce sepsis in the GM-CSF prophylaxis group, the reduction in sepsis incidence observed did not reach significance [RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.36, 1.20); RD -0.16 (95% CI -0.37, 0.06)]; [comparison 02.03.01].<BR/>In studies where sepsis was defined by either clinical or microbiological criteria alone (<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1995</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1999</LINK>) (n = 284) sepsis incidence did not differ between treated and control infants [RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.76, 1.37); RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.11, 0.12)]; [comparison 02.03.02].</P>
<P>Sepsis from start of intervention to discharge:<BR/>Longer term sepsis prevention was only reported by (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) [RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.75, 1.24); RD 0.10 (95% CI -0.32, 0.13)].</P>
<P>Sepsis incidence to 10 days after intervention complete, in infants with pre-existing neutropenia or at high risk of developing neutropenia at trial entry [comparison 02.02]:<BR/>Neutropenia, for the purpose of this subgroup analysis was defined as &lt; 1.7 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/l; high risk of postnatal neutropenia was defined as infants with a birth weight below the tenth centile, or born to mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Only one study separately identified neutropenic or high neutropenia-risk infants (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>). The number of these infants developing sepsis following GM-CSF (5/16), was less than controls (8/15) but the difference, based on such small numbers, was not significant [RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.25, 1.39); RD -0.22 (95% CI -0.56, 0.12)].</P>
<P>Secondary outcome:<BR/>Mortality to 10 days after intervention complete [comparison 02.01]:<BR/>Short term all cause mortality is reported for all studies. In the phase I/II study (<LINK REF="STD-Cairo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cairo 1995</LINK>) there were no deaths, thus two studies (n = 339) contribute to the analysis. Overall mortality was 5.3%. There was no significant mortality reduction in treated infants [RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.24, 1.44); RD -0.03 (95% CI -0.08, 0.02)].</P>
<P>Correction of existing, or prevention of subsequent neutropenia:<BR/>Only one study addressed this issue (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) and observed that prophylactic GM-CSF completely prevented the occurrence of neutropenia for up to 28 days following GM-CSF prophylaxis.</P>
<P>Long term outcomes:<BR/>These have not been reported for any prophylaxis study.</P>
<P>Toxicity:<BR/>G-CSF: Six studies used G-CSF, with a total of 107 infants receiving treatment. All commented on the absence of adverse events attributable to G-CSF therapy. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>) quantified possible adverse events, including oedema, bradycardia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatraemia and oxygen index. There were no differences between the groups, though the oxygen index worsened in more placebo group infants.</P>
<P>GM-CSF: Five studies used GM-CSF, with a total of 225 infants receiving GM-CSF as sepsis treatment or prophylaxis. Again all authors commented that GM-CSF was well tolerated with no adverse reactions. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>) specifically analysed clinical outcomes which might be attributable to GM-CSF and found no difference in fever, weight change, oxygen requirement during therapy, chronic lung disease or necrotising enterocolitis.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity:<BR/>In part because of the small size of the studies available for inclusion, there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between the studies.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-21 10:07:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>TREATMENT STUDIES<BR/>There is no evidence from the seven published studies included in this meta-analysis that the addition of G-CSF or GM-CSF to antibiotic therapy in preterm infants with suspected systemic infection reduces immediate all cause mortality. No significant survival advantage was seen at 14 days from the start of therapy [RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.38, 1.33); RD -0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.04)]. However, all seven of the treatment studies were small, the largest recruiting only 60 infants. As this review is limited to studies where there is a full peer reviewed publication, there is substantial potential for publication bias.</P>
<P>The subgroup analysis of 97 infants from three treatment studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bedford_x002d_Russell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bedford-Russell 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>) who, in addition to systemic infection, had clinically significant neutropenia (&lt; 1.7 x10<SUP>9</SUP>/l) at trial entry, shows a significant reduction in mortality to day 14 in those infants receiving G-CSF or GM-CSF [RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.92); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.33, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3 - 33)]. That CSF therapy influences mortality directly related to the septic episode is suggested by noting that only 10% of deaths in these analyses occurred beyond 14 days and was equally distributed between treated and control infants. However the conclusion that CSF therapy reduces sepsis related mortality in infants who are neutropenic cannot be viewed as definitive. Sixty seven percent of subjects in the neutropenic subgroup were from a single study (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>) and in sensitivity analyses using a random effects model the reduction in mortality is no longer significant. Despite this caveat, the Bilgin study may have an important message when selecting infants for future CSF studies, in that all recruited infants were severely neutropenic (&lt; 1.5 x10<SUP>9</SUP>/l) and 75% were bacteraemic with a gram negative or group B Streptococcal infection.</P>
<P>A similar conclusion, that CSF therapy may improve survival in septic neonates who are also neutropenic, was reached by the one previous published meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2001</LINK>). This analysis of five studies including 155 subjects did not include the quasi-randomised Bilgin study but did include two small non-randomised studies excluded from this review.</P>
<P>When the effect of G-CSF on outcome is analysed having excluded the two trials in which neutropenia &lt;1.7 x10<SUP>9</SUP>/l was a pre-specified recruitment criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Bilgin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bilgin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schibler-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Schibler 1998</LINK>), mortality is similar in both treated and control infants. The three treatment studies (<LINK REF="STD-Drossou_x002d_Agakidou-_x0027_98" TYPE="STUDY">Drossou-Agakidou '98</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gillan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gillan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miura-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Miura 2001</LINK>) in which neutropenia, as defined in this review, was not a recruitment criterion, when combined with the non-neutropenic subjects reported by Bedford Russell, had a RR 1.22 (95% CI 0.50, 2.99); RD 0.03 (95% CI -0.10, 0.15); [comparison 01.08]. The lack of effect of G-CSF on sepsis related mortality in the absence of neutropenia is supported by the largest randomised controlled trial of CSF therapy undertaken in septic neonates (<LINK REF="STD-La-Gamma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">La Gamma 2000</LINK>). This large multicentre study, which has only been reported in abstract form and so excluded from this meta-analysis, randomised 137 infants with late onset nosocomial infection, as indicated by clinical and laboratory signs, to receive G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/d for 5 days or placebo. There was no difference in mortality between the groups, which was 14% at 28 days from trial entry in each arm.</P>
<P>PROPHYLAXIS STUDIES<BR/>Only three prophylaxis studies have been published. Although all three used GM-CSF, they adopted very differing treatment regimens and do not use comparable criteria for identifying the primary outcome, episodes of systemic infection. The incidence of sepsis will differ depending on whether septic episodes are identified by both clinical and microbiological criteria together, or by either clinical criteria or microbiological criteria alone. This is because the majority of blood culture isolates from preterm newborns are coagulase negative staphylococci and it is estimated that approximately half of such isolates represent contamination rather than true systemic infection. In the protocol for this review we stated that studies using these two different levels of diagnostic criteria were not comparable and should be analysed separately. Thus, only the outcome of short term mortality could be combined for all three studies. GM-CSF prophylaxis did not lead to a significant reduction in mortality.<BR/>
<BR/>Prophylactic GM-CSF may provide protection against infection when given to infants less that 32 weeks gestation who are neutropenic (&lt; 1.7 x10<SUP>9</SUP>/l) or at high risk of developing postnatal neutropenia. However this high risk group has only been recruited into one study (<LINK REF="STD-Carr-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Carr 1999</LINK>). The incidence of systemic infection in this subgroup was reduced from 53% to 31%, but the numbers were small (n = 31) and the difference not statistically significant [RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.25, 1.39); RD -0.22 (95% CI -0.56, 0.12)]. A similar effect was observed in a small non-randomised prophylactic study using short term G-CSF in neonates with established neutropenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kocherlakota-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kocherlakota 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The authors are currently investigating the effect of prophylactic GM-CSF in high neutropenia risk neonates in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial in the UK. This trial is recruiting infants who are both less that 32 weeks gestation and less than the tenth centile for birth weight (<LINK REF="STD-PROGRAMS" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRAMS</LINK>).</P>
<P>EFFECTS ON LABORATORY PARAMETERS AND CLINICAL TOXICITY<BR/>Both G-CSF and GM-CSF appear to be effective at correcting neutropenia, as they are in adult clinical practice. No toxicity associated with either G-CSF or GM-CSF was reported in any study included in this review, or in other published non-randomised studies. However, some anxieties have been expressed about the theoretical possibility of late haematological toxicities. These include the development of leukaemia, cytopenias as a result of "lineage steal" effect, and the formation of antibodies to exogenously administered CSFs. In a recent review (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2003</LINK>) we concluded that cellular biology studies of the mode of CSF action, and clinical studies in children and adults, have not provided any evidence in support of these theoretical risks in neonates. Although rare outcomes are unlikely to be detected in RCTs, future studies should monitor for clinical outcomes which might be related to unexpected long term adverse effects.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-10-21 10:07:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to support the introduction of either G-CSF or GM-CSF into neonatal practice, either as treatment of established systemic infection to reduce resulting mortality, or as prophylaxis to prevent systemic infection in high risk neonates. No toxicity associated with the use of either G-CSF or GM-CSF was reported in any study included in this review, or in other published non-randomised studies.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-10-21 10:07:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reduction in mortality observed when G-CSF or GM-CSF have been given to infants with suspected or microbiologically proven systemic infection associated with severe neutropenia needs to be investigated further in adequately powered, well designed RCTs. Data from existing studies suggest that future trials should focus on infants with systemic infection and a neutrophil count less than 1.7 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/l, and should be designed to recruit sufficient infants infected with organisms associated with a significant mortality risk. The data available do not support further study of CSFs in septic infants who are not neutropenic.</P>
<P>Neutropenia or high risk of neutropenia also appears to be of relevance to efficacy in prophylactic studies. Whether prophylactic GM-CSF can reduce systemic infection or mortality in infants at high risk of postnatal neutropenia is currently being investigated in a UK study funded by Action Research, with a long term follow up study funded by the Wellcome Trust (<LINK REF="STD-PROGRAMS" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRAMS</LINK>). This study will complete recruitment in 2004 and it is hoped that it will provide definitive guidance on the role of prophylactic CSFs in neonatal practice.</P>
<P>As infection in neonates not only causes short term mortality but may also be a major contributor to long term neurodisability, all future studies should include long term neurological and neurodevelopmental follow up.</P>
