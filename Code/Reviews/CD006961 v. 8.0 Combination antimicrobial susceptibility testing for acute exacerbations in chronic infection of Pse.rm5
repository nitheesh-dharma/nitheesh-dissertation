<TITLE>Testing antibiotics in combination for acute infections of <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in cystic fibrosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-04-04 15:12:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of testing antibiotics in combination for acute airway infections in people with long-term (chronic) infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>The main cause of death in people with cystic fibrosis is chronic lung infection. People with cystic fibrosis now live longer due to the aggressive use of antibiotics to treat lung infections. Traditionally, antibiotics are chosen based on the results of laboratory testing of each antibiotic separately against the bacterium (or bug) that is found in the lungs of the person with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotics tested in combination may work effectively against a bacterium even if not effective when tested alone. However, when choosing antibiotics to treat lung infections caused by <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in people with cystic fibrosis, it is unclear whether basing the choice of antibiotics on the results of combination testing is better than basing choice on the results of testing antibiotics separately.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to: 19 December 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The search identified one study that tried to answer this question and was eligible for inclusion in the review. The study enrolled 132 people with cystic fibrosis, most of whom (82 people) had acute lung infections with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, and randomly put them into two treatment groups. In the first group two antibiotics were selected following the testing of combinations of antibiotics and in the second group the two antibiotics were chosen after testing individual antibiotics to see how effective the drugs were against the bacterium. The study was run across several centres and assessed the clinical outcomes in the participants after a 14-day course of treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The study investigators were only able to provide us with data for those who were infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> for their main outcome (the time until the next acute lung infection). Choosing antibiotics based on the results of combination antibiotic testing did not lead to a longer time until the next lung infection compared to choosing antibiotics based on results of separate testing. They could not provide us with any results people infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> for other outcomes in our review.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We are satisfied that the people taking part were divided into the different treatment groups completely at random and no one could have foreseen which group any individual would be in. We are also satisfied that during the study, neither the individuals or clinic personnel knew which treatment group each individual was in. There were no missing data from the study. The quality of the evidence for the only outcome for which we have data (time to the next lung infection) is moderate, but we could not judge the quality of the evidence for other outcomes as there were no separate results available for people infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-09 11:39:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Antibiotic therapy for acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis is usually chosen based on the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of individual drugs. Combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing assesses the efficacy of drug combinations including two or three antibiotics in vitro and can often demonstrate antimicrobial efficacy against bacterial isolates even when individual antibiotics have little or no effect. Therefore, choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing could potentially improve response to treatment in people with cystic fibrosis with acute exacerbations. This is an updated version of a previously published review.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-09 11:39:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To compare antibiotic therapy based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing to antibiotic therapy based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis and chronic infection with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>.</P>

<P>Both authors independently selected studies, assessed their quality and extracted data from eligible studies. Additionally, the authors contacted the study investigators to obtain further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-05-04 13:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The search identified one multicentre study eligible for inclusion in the review. This study prospectively assessed whether the use of multiple combination bactericidal antibiotic testing improved clinical outcomes in participants with acute pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis who were infected with multiresistant bacteria. A total of 132 participants were randomised in the study. The study investigators provided data specific to the 82 participants who were only infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>for their primary outcome of time until next pulmonary exacerbation. For participants specifically infected with only <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, the hazard ratio of a subsequent exacerbation was 0.82, favouring the control group (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.51) (P = 0.52). No further data for any of this review's outcomes specific to participants infected with <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> were available. The risk of bias for the included study was deemed to be low. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the only outcome providing data solely for individuals with infection due to <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>. For other outcomes, we were unable to judge the quality of the evidence as no data were available for the relevant subset of participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:44:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current evidence, limited to one study, shows that there is insufficient evidence to determine effect of choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to choosing antibiotics based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in people with cystic fibrosis with chronic <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> infection. A large international and multicentre study is needed to further investigate this issue.</P>
<P>The only study included in the review was published in 2005, and we have not identified any further relevant studies up to March 2017. We therefore do not plan to update this review until new studies are published.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-08 15:28:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-08 15:28:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting genetic condition in white populations and respiratory failure caused by chronic pulmonary infection is the primary cause of death in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> and <I>Haemophilus influenzae</I> are typically initially detected in respiratory cultures. Over time, people with CF become chronically infected with mucoid <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) with associated declining pulmonary function and increasing symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henry-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henry 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kosorok-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosorok 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pamukcu-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pamukcu 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-09 15:19:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Over the past several decades, the life expectancy of people with CF has increased significantly, due partly to the aggressive use of antibiotics in the treatment of respiratory infections (<LINK REF="REF-Gibson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibson 2003</LINK>). The standard of care for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations includes intravenous (IV) antibiotic use. Bacterial strains isolated from the respiratory tract of people with CF are commonly tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. Conventional in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing is done on selected morphotypes, or colony types, of bacteria such as <I>P aeruginosa</I>. However, there may be a significant amount of variability in the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of different morphotypes and even of individual colonies of the same morphotype of <I>P aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Foweraker-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foweraker 2005</LINK>). Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing may thus underestimate resistance and results are often not reproducible. Although in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been shown to be of benefit in guiding antibiotic choices for pulmonary infections in people who don't have CF, the role of conventional susceptibility testing in guiding the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF is less clear (<LINK REF="REF-Gaillard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaillard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>). In fact, clinicians will often ignore the results of susceptibility testing of bacterial strains obtained during a pulmonary exacerbation if the individual is already improving on IV antibiotics.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-09 15:20:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>If conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing identifies a multi-drug resistant bacterial strain from the respiratory tract of an individual with CF, combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be undertaken on the strain. This type of testing often shows that combinations of two or three antibiotics have in vitro activity against a bacterial isolate when individual antibiotics have little or none (<LINK REF="REF-Aaron-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aaron 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saiman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 1996</LINK>). Although combination antibiotic therapy may be better than antibiotic monotherapy to treat CF exacerbations caused by <I>P aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>), choosing antibiotics based on multiple combination bactericidal antibiotic testing (MCBT), a type of combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing, may not affect clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Aaron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aaron 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Both conventional and combination antimicrobial testing are usually done on bacteria growing planktonically or "free-floating". There is growing evidence that bacterium such as <I>P aeruginosa</I> actually grows as a biofilm or a "slime layer" in the airways of people with CF with chronic pulmonary infections (<LINK REF="REF-Drenkard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drenkard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>). Biofilms are communities of bacteria embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix and are highly resistant to killing by antibiotics (<LINK REF="REF-Prince-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prince 2002</LINK>). Work has been done to develop antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on biofilm growth of bacteria rather than planktonic growth in an effort to mimic the pathophysiology of the CF lung (<LINK REF="REF-Ceri-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceri 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moskowitz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moskowitz 2005</LINK>). Although biofilm antimicrobial susceptibility testing of <I>P aeruginosa </I>strains has demonstrated different, more resistant susceptibility profiles, the effect of these results on treatment outcomes has yet to be determined.</P>

<P>Using a data collection form, authors VW and FR independently obtained data from published reports or from study investigators. They would have resolved any disagreement by discussion with a third person (Nikki Jahnke (NJ)). In addition to information about study references and authors and verification of study eligibility, the data collection form included information about the methods of the study (e.g. study duration, type of trial, blinding, number of dropouts and potential confounders). The authors also reported characteristics of the study participants including age, sex and setting of the study on the form. The authors described the intervention, specifically antibiotic therapy, with regards to type of antibiotic, route of delivery, doses and length of treatment. The authors collected data for all randomised participants. When possible, the authors planned to record the mean change (before and after antibiotic therapy) in FEV&#8321; and FVC, the mean quality of life score after antibiotic therapy, the mean hospital length of stay, the mean change in sputum bacterial density (before and after antibiotic therapy) and the number of adverse events and mortalities. For each mean value, they also planned to obtain the standard deviation. For time to next exacerbation, they planned to collect log-rank estimates and Cox model estimates.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2017-04-04 15:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For dichotomous data (adverse events, mortality), the authors planned to gather information on participants randomised to each treatment group, based on an intention-to-treat analysis. They planned to include interim results from individual randomised participants from ongoing studies in the analysis. They defined time points for each study outcome according to when it was measured (less than a week, one to two weeks, more than two weeks to three weeks, more than three weeks to four weeks); they planned to analyse study outcomes separately according to these time points. As the authors identified only one study for inclusion in the review, they did not combine results from different studies. However, for future updates, when they are able to include more studies, they plan to pool the treatment effect across studies to determine an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for each study outcome.</P>
<P>For continuous data (FEV&#8321;, FVC, quality of life, length of hospital stay, sputum bacterial density), the authors planned to calculate the difference between the mean values (mean difference (MD)) of treatment effect for each group. As a summary statistic across studies, they will use the MD if the same scale is used or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales are used (e.g. quality of life measurements). For time-to-event data (time to next exacerbation), most studies use Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The authors thus planned to collect log-rank estimates and Cox model estimates to subsequently summarise the time-to-event data as a hazard ratio with 95% CIs (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>).</P>

<P>Although a true intention-to-treat analysis must include all participants who were randomised, regardless of whether their outcomes were actually collected, in reality, data are often missing for participants who are lost to follow up. This was not the case in the only study included in the review. However, for future updates, the authors will perform an available-case analysis (analysing data for every participant for whom the outcome is obtained) in these situations. The authors will collect the percentages of participants from whom no outcome data were available and will report these on the data collection form. The authors will include data on only those whose results are known, using as a denominator the total number of people who completed the study for the particular outcome in question.

<P>In performing a meta-analysis, the authors planned to measure the variability of results between trials (heterogeneity) using the I² statistic described by Higgins (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The I² statistic describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than by chance. It is calculated using Cochran's heterogeneity statistic and the degrees of freedom. The I² statistic can range from 0% to 100%, where a value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. A value greater than 50% may be considered substantial heterogeneity.</P>

<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-04 15:22:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>As the searches identified only one study which was eligible for inclusion, the authors were not able to assess publication bias. If sufficient studies are included in the future, they will assess publication bias in a future update by constructing a funnel plot. In the absence of bias, the plot should resemble a symmetrical inverted funnel (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).

<P>The authors identified only one study for inclusion the review. For future updates, if the authors include more studies, they plan to combine multiple studies as follows. If the studies are too clinically diverse (e.g. different lengths of antibiotic treatment), the authors will not perform a meta-analysis. If the studies are considered clinically similar enough to combine and where there is no significant heterogeneity, they will calculate the pooled effect estimates using a fixed-effect model. If there is statistical heterogeneity, the authors will investigate as outlined below and will perform a random-effects meta-analysis to incorporate heterogeneity among studies.</P>

For example, study results may vary if different types of combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing are used (e.g. MCBT compared to checkerboard dilution assays). In addition, results may vary if one study has more adult participants who can produce sputum (a more accurate sample with potentially more reliable susceptibility results) and another study has more pediatric participants who can only do throat swabs (a less reliable respiratory tract sample).</P>

<P>When the authors are able to include more studies in the review, they will perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the results. They will investigate whether changing which studies are included, based on our assessment of the methodological quality (including or excluding CCTs, including or excluding trials reporting degrees of blinding etc.) or changing our chosen statistical model (i.e. random effects model compared to a fixed-effect model) changes the results of our review. If the sensitivity analysis does not significantly change the results, it strengthens the confidence that can be placed in these results.</P>

<P>To determine the quality of the evidence we used the GRADE approach in which the quality of the evidence is downgraded where there was high risk of bias in included trials, indirectness of the evidence to our population of interest, imprecision of the results or a high risk of publication bias.

<P>The only included study was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind controlled clinical study that prospectively assessed whether the use of combination antibiotic susceptibility testing improved clinical outcomes in participants with acute pulmonary exacerbations of CF who were infected with multiresistant bacteria. Participants who developed an exacerbation of pulmonary disease were randomised to receive a 14-day course of any two IV antibiotics (labelled "antibiotic #1" and "antibiotic #2") chosen on the basis of either results from conventional sputum culture and sensitivity testing or the result of MCBT. Individuals were eligible for enrolment into the study if they had a confirmed diagnosis of CF, were at least 12 years old, could spontaneously produce sputum for culturing and were chronically infected with multiresistant <I>P aeruginosa</I>, <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I> complex, <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophili</I>a or <I>Achromobacter xylosoxidans</I>. Although the study included participants who were infected with different types of multiresistant organisms, the majority were infected with <I>P aeruginosa</I> (67.2% in the MCBT group and 57.4% in the control group). The authors have provided us with the data specific to the participants who were only infected with <I>P aeruginosa</I> for the study's primary outcome; however the information about the study participants given below pertains to the whole study cohort. The primary outcome of the study was time from randomisation until the participant's next pulmonary exacerbation and corresponded to the length of participant follow up. Outcome measurements were taken and reported for day 0 and day 14 of antibiotic treatment.</P>
<P>A total of 132 participants were randomised in the study; 64 to the MCBT-treated group and 68 to the conventionally-treated (control) group. All 132 participants received the intended treatment and all 132 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean age (SD) in the MCBT group was 29.5 years (8.2) and in the control group was 25.8 years (6.5). In the MCBT group, 29 participants were male and 35 were female and in the control group, 31 were male and 37 were female. The baseline FEV&#8321; (SD) in the MCBT group was 1.67 L (0.66) and was 1.63 L (0.67) in the control group. The number of participants with diabetes was 15 (23.4%) in the MCBT group and 13 (19.1%) in the control group. The number of participants with pancreatic insufficiency was 63 (98.4%) in the MCBT group and 65 (95.6%) in the control group. The number of participants with liver disease was 6 (9.4%) in the MCBT group and 8 (11.8%) in the control group.</P>

<P>We judged there to be an unclear risk from other sources of bias for a number of reasons. In this study antibiotics were prescribed for participants randomised to the MCBT arm by one investigator, whereas antibiotics were prescribed for participants randomised to the control arm by the participants' own doctors. This approach was necessary, since the local physicians had to remain blinded to the MCBT results, but it could have affected the study outcomes. A second limitation is that this study was powered to show a 79% increase in the time to next exacerbation, but did not have the statistical power to exclude a smaller effect of MCBT-directed therapy. FInally, conventional clinical microbiological testing and MCBT testing both involve the culture of planktonically growing bacteria (i.e., free floating bacteria growing in broth). Bacteria growing in biofilms, e.g. <I>P aeruginosa</I>, have been shown to be significantly more resistant to antimicrobials than those growing planktonically.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-06 19:21:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The only included study showed that the use of multiple combination bactericidal antibiotic testing (MCBT) to guide antibiotic treatment of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) with acute pulmonary exacerbations due to <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> (<I>P aeruginosa</I>) did not result in longer times to subsequent pulmonary exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Aaron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aaron 2005</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-13 09:49:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>It is important to note that the results of this study are based on one method of MCBT and they may not be generalizable to other methodologies such as checkerboard dilution assays. The primary outcome chosen by the investigators, time until the next pulmonary exacerbation, is highly clinically relevant to people with CF. However, the Aaron study was powered to detect a difference in this outcome for people with CF infected with several different types of multiresistant gram negative bacteria and not for people with CF infected with only <I>P aeruginosa </I>(subject of this review).</P>
<P>Any individual with CF who was chronically infected with multiresistant gram negative bacteria was eligible for enrolment into the study. However,in practice, MCBT tends to be reserved for those who fail empirically chosen antibiotic treatment or who have respiratory bacterial strains that are resistant to all antibiotics tested by conventional methods. It is possible that the use of MCBT may improve outcomes in this subset of people with CF.</P>
<P>In addition, testing antibiotics against bacteria grown planktonically, or "free-floating", in the laboratory may not accurately reflect the environment in the CF lung. For example, <I>P aeruginosa</I> is known to grow as a biofilm, or a slime layer, in the sputum of people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Drenkard-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drenkard 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2000</LINK>). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on biofilm growth of <I>P aeruginosa</I> may therefore be a more rational way of choosing antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations and may lead to improved clinical outcomes in people with CF.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-04 14:12:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>The main strengths of the study were the quality of the methods (randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding) and the choice of a clinically relevant primary outcome.</P>
<P>If the antibiotics chosen based on the MCBT test were more effective than those chosen based on the conventional test, we would expect the pulmonary bacterial load to decrease more in the MCBT group than in the control group, leading to a longer time before a subsequent exacerbation (<LINK REF="REF-Regelmann-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Regelmann 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1999</LINK>). The Aaron study was powered to detect a difference in the time until the next pulmonary exacerbation in people with CF infected with several different types of multiresistant gram negative bacteria.</P>
<P>There were some limitations to the study. The study was only powered to show a minimum of 79% increase in the time to next exacerbation and did not have the power to detect a smaller increase in the time to next exacerbation. Given the multifactorial nature of pulmonary exacerbations in CF, it is unlikely that antibiotic choices alone could almost double the time to next exacerbation. Therefore, we cannot exclude a smaller effect of MCBT-guided therapy. Furthrmore, in the included study, one person prescribed antibiotics for the MCBT group while multiple individual physicians prescribed antibiotics for the control group. Although this was meant to simulate "real life" conditions, it introduces a significant degree of variability that the authors could not control for as there is no standardized method for choosing antibiotics. Choosing antibiotics based on their ability to kill bacteria in vitro may also not be as important as their potential anti-inflammatory effects. The study investigators correctly point out that the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which has no bactericidal effect against <I>P aeruginosa,</I> but may have an anti-inflammatory effect, has been associated with clinical improvement in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Equi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Equi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saiman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saiman 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall, we found the quality of the body of evidence to be moderate for the only outcome (time to next exacerbation) for which data were available for those people with infection due to <I>P aeruginosa</I>; for other outcomes we were unable to judge the quality of the evidence as no data were available for the relevant subset of participants (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-03-13 09:51:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Overall, there was little risk of bias in the review process. We performed a comprehensive search of the literature not limited by language; we used broad search terms when searching the Cochrane CF clinical trials register, the clinicaltrials.gov website and the WHO trials website. The two authors independently assessed the studies, extracted the data, analysed the data and assessed the studies for bias.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-04-04 15:18:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There are no other studies or trials examining this particular question in CF. However, other studies that have examined the relationship between in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing and clinical outcomes in individuals with CF have similarly been unable to find a correlation. No study to date has identified a superior antibiotic regimen in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people with CF, highlighting the multifactorial, complex nature of the infection and response to therapy.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:04:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:03:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The current evidence-base, limited to one study, is insufficient to determine the effect of choosing antibiotics based on combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing compared to choosing antibiotics based on conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations and chronic infection in people with CF with <I>P aeruginosa</I>.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-03-08 16:04:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>A larger, adequately-powered, study is needed to determine if combination antimicrobial susceptibility testing may be beneficial in people with CF infected specifically with <I>P aeruginosa. </I>A subgroup analysis could be undertaken on individuals who fail empirically chosen antibiotic treatment or who have respiratory bacterial strains that are resistant to all antibiotics tested by conventional methods. Such a study requires international collaboration in order to have sufficient power to detect a more modest improvement in a similar clinically relevant outcome.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>A potential limitation of this study is that antibiotics were prescribed for participants randomised to the MCBT arm by one investigator, whereas antibiotics were prescribed for participants randomised to the control arm by the participants' own doctors. This approach was necessary, since the local physicians had to remain blinded to the MCBT results, but it could have affected the study outcomes.</P>
<P>A second limitation is that this study was powered to show a 79% increase in the time to next exacerbation and did not have the statistical power to exclude a smaller effect of MCBT-directed therapy.</P>
<P>Conventional clinical microbiological testing, and MCBT testing, involves the culture of planktonically growing bacteria (i.e. free floating bacteria growing in broth). Bacteria growing in biofilms, e.g. <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, have been shown to be significantly more resistant to antimicrobials than those growing planktonically.</P>
