<TITLE>Intravenous naftidrofuryl for treating critical limb ischaemia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:48:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease is relatively common, particularly in late middle age. Blockages in the leg arteries can reduce blood flow in the legs enough to cause cramping leg pain that limits walking (termed intermittent claudication). They can become severe and cause critical limb ischaemia, pain at rest, leg ulceration and gangrene that requires amputation. When a patient with critical limb ischaemia is being assessed for vascular surgery or if they are unsuitable or refuse surgery, they are treated conservatively as with bed rest. Drug therapy may be used to relieve symptoms and reduce progression of disease. Vasodilator drugs such as prostaglandins increase local blood flow to the leg but may not improve blockages (stenoses). Naftidrofuryl is also vasoactive and blocks serotonin. It has been used intravenously in severe critical limb ischaemia for rapid effect.</P>
<P>The review authors identified eight controlled trials that randomly allocated a total of 269 participants from five different countries to receive intravenous naftidrofuryl, other treatments, and placebo alone or with another treatment. There was no clear indication that short-term intravenous naftidrofuryl significantly improves either symptoms of ischaemic rest pain or skin necrosis. Treatment with naftidrofuryl tended to reduce pain, measured using a scale or with analgesic consumption, and improve rest pain and skin necrosis but the effects were not clear (statistically significant). The trials were generally of low methodological quality, included small numbers of predominantly elderly participants with varying levels of severity of critical limb ischaemia and used different measures of effect. The duration of treatment was short, from three to 42 days, most often seven days. Other treatments were haemodilution, anti-coagulant medication, prostaglandins, bed rest and reflex heating, and gingko biloba. Side effects included mild blood clotting (thrombophlebitis) at the injection site and in one trial two participants experienced renal insufficiency. Intravenous naftidrofuryl was withdrawn as a treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease in 1995 because of reported side effects.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Peripheral arterial disease affects five per cent of men and women by late middle age. Approximately 25% of those affected will develop critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ulceration and gangrene) within five years. Naftidrofuryl is a vasoactive drug which may be beneficial in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether naftidrofuryl, when administered intravenously, is effective in alleviating symptoms and reducing progression of disease in patients with critical limb ischaemia.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:48:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched May 2012) and CENTRAL (2012,<I> </I>Issue 4). We searched the reference lists of articles. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies for any unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials of critical limb ischaemia in which participants were randomly allocated to intravenous naftidrofuryl or control (either pharmacological, inert placebo or conservative therapy) were included. People with intermittent claudication were not included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:14:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Sixteen trials were identified, but eight were excluded because of poor methodology. The eight included trials involved a total of 269 participants from five different countries. The following outcomes were reported: pain reduction, rest pain/necrosis, progression of disease in terms of incidence of surgical reconstruction/amputation, mortality and side effects. On extraction of the data, odds ratios and mean differences were estimated where appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-07-30 15:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Treatment with naftidrofuryl tended to show reduction of pain evaluated by both analogue score and analgesic consumption, but the effect was statistically non-significant (mean difference (MD): 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI)1.19 to 0.35). Similarly, improvement in rest pain or skin necrosis occurred, but these effects were also non-significant. The effect on mean ankle systolic pressure was inconclusive.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:48:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on the results of these trials, it cannot be confirmed that intravenous naftidrofuryl is effective in the treatment of people with critical limb ischaemia. However, these results were based on trials of generally low methodological quality which had only a small number of participants, the duration of treatment was extremely short, and the methods varied between the trials. The wide range of endpoints effectively precluded any meaningful pooling of the results. Intravenous naftidrofuryl was withdrawn as a treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease in 1995 because of reported side effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:25:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:25:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease is a relatively common condition and by late middle age about five per cent of men and women demonstrate symptoms of intermittent claudication. Approximately 25% of all claudicants referred to a peripheral vascular clinic progress to critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ulceration and gangrene) within five years. Many of these people undergo major surgery and the amputation rate can be as high as five per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Leng-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leng 1993</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:25:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>Conservative treatment, such as bed rest or exercise programmes, is initially used to treat the acute ischaemic symptoms in people who are either being assessed for revascularization, or are considered unsuitable for surgery. When standard therapy has been unsuccessful, or is not possible, drug therapy is an alternative option which may be considered. However, vasodilator drugs, such as prostanoids which increase local blood flow to the ischaemic limb, do not appear to improve haemodynamically significant stenoses.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:25:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The vasoactive drug, naftidrofuryl, can be administered either intravenously or orally. It is a serotonergic receptor antagonist which may be beneficial in the treatment of severe lower limb disease. Intravenous treatment has been preferred initially in severe critical limb ischaemia because of the more rapid conversion to active metabolites, and has been used at a higher dosage than the oral form. This drug increases oxidative metabolism and reduces lactic acidosis in ischaemic cells.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:24:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>A meta-analysis of clinical trials of the effect of oral naftidrofuryl on intermittent claudication found that walking distance was significantly improved in people treated with naftidrofuryl (<LINK REF="REF-Lehert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lehert 1990</LINK>). Fewer trials have been conducted on more severe peripheral arterial disease, although naftidrofuryl has been widely prescribed in Europe for the treatment of critical limb ischaemia and was initially considered to have only minor side effects. This systematic review assessed the therapeutic effects of intravenous naftidrofuryl on critical limb ischaemia.</P>

<P>Sixteen trials examining the effect of intravenous naftidrofuryl on critical limb ischaemia were identified. Eight studies were not included in the review because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, or were of poor quality (<I>see </I>
<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). The eight included trials were relatively small and involved a total of 269 participants. Three trials were conducted in the UK, three in Germany and one each in France and Austria. There does not appear to be any other trials in progress.</P>
<P>The severity of critical limb ischaemia varied. Four of the trials used participants with rest pain and/or necrosis (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>), whereas the remainder used participants with rest pain only (<LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>). In four trials, unsuitability for reconstructive surgery was used as an inclusion criterion. The majority of trials excluded people with other medical conditions. Most trials were conducted on predominantly elderly people of both sexes. In two of the trials, the sex of the people was not stated (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>A combination of naftidrofuryl and other therapy, including haemodilution (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>), bed rest and reflex heating (<LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>) and anti-coagulant medication (<LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>), rather than treatment with naftidrofuryl alone was used in some of the trials. The dosage and duration of treatment also varied between the studies. The most commonly used dosage was 800 mg intravenous (i.v.) naftidrofuryl daily, but other trials used 600 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>) or 400 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>). Duration of treatment varied between three and 42 days, but seven days was the most frequent length of treatment.</P>
<P>Three trials compared naftidrofuryl with prostaglandins (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>), and four trials against placebo/conservative therapy. In the placebo-controlled trials, three trials used placebo i.v. fluids, either alone (<LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>), with haemodilution (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>), or with anti-coagulant medication (<LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>). In the Meehan trial, the control group received bed rest and reflex heating. The Horsch trial (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>) compared naftidrofuryl with gingko biloba.</P>
<P>Evaluation of pain, either subjectively or objectively using either analogue scales or analgesic consumption was reported in all the trials, as was the reporting of side effects from naftidrofuryl. State/healing of skin necrosis was reported in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>).

There was one report of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>) and two reports of amputation as a non-fatal outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>).</P>

Three trials were randomised by a randomisation list (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>); by random numbers (<LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>); or by a random numbers table (<LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>). Double blinding occurred in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>). The Meehan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>) was blinded only in respect to outcome. It was unclear whether blinding was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>). Losses to follow up occurred in most studies, particularly in the <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK> trial, in which 11 participants out of 40 were lost to follow up.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-06-07 13:48:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>
<B>
<I>All cause mortality</I>
</B>
<BR/>There was one report of all-cause mortality (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>). One patient in the naftidrofuryl group died from bronchopneumonia, which was unrelated to treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Pain evaluation by analogue score</I>
</B>
<BR/>Three trials which evaluated ischaemic pain by an analogue scale (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>) found that pain decreased in those treated by naftidrofuryl compared to the control groups. Although the age of participants and the duration of the Meehan and Testart trials were similar, the dosage of intravenous naftidrofuryl used was twice as high in the Testart trial (800 mg) than in the Meehan trial (400 mg). In the Horsch trial, the dosage was 400 mg daily but duration was 21 days. These data were unable to be analysed in a meta-analysis because no standard deviations were reported (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Pain evaluation by analgesic consumption</I>
</B>
<BR/>Three trials evaluated pain using scores based on the amount and type of analgesia required to alleviate pain (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>). In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>), analgesic requirements were lower in the naftidrofuryl treated groups compared with the control groups after seven or eight days respectively, but the difference was statistically non-significant (mean difference (MD) -0.42; (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to 0.35). In the Horsch trial, the number of participants who reduced their analgesic intake was higher in the control group compared with the naftidrofuryl group. The Horsch data were unable to be included in the meta-analysis since actual values were given rather than mean values and standard deviations.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Rest pain/skin necrosis</I>
</B>
<BR/>Assessment of rest pain, and state of skin necrosis recorded photographically were reported in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>). Rest pain was evaluated by five grades of severity according to Peitgen (<LINK REF="REF-Peitgen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peitgen 1985</LINK>) in the Heiss trial, and by changes in clinical symptoms in the Bohme trial. The trial conducted by Bohme used the prostaglandin, alprostadil, as control. In addition to naftidrofuryl or placebo, haemodilution (Rheomacrodex) was used as therapy in both groups in the Heiss trial.</P>
<P>In total, 83.3% of the treated subjects improved compared with 70.6% of the controls. However, improvement in symptoms using naftidrofuryl was not statistically significant in either trial.</P>
<P>In the Horsch trial, rest pain was measured using a visual analogue scale. There was no statistically significant difference in rest pain between the two groups. With regard to skin necrosis, there was a greater reduction in maximal length and width of necrosis in the naftidrofuryl group compared with the gingko biloba group (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Incident reconstructive surgery/amputation</I>
</B>
<BR/>It was stated that in four of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>) participants were either unsuitable for reconstructive surgery, or had refused surgery. In the remainder, the incidence of reconstructive surgery was not reported. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>), one patient in the naftidrofuryl group dropped out following femoral amputation.</P>
<P>Only one study examined incidence of amputation after treatment with naftidrofuryl (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>). This study found that the incidence of amputation within 45 days after hospitalisation was 7.5%, which increased to 21% after a follow-up period of a maximum of two years. It was noted that only one of the nine participants who eventually underwent amputation had been treated by naftidrofuryl.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Mean ankle systolic pressure</I>
</B>
<BR/>Mean ankle systolic pressures were measured before and after treatment in two trials. In the Bohme trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>), ankle pressure in the naftidrofuryl group rose significantly to 40 mm Hg (standard deviation (SD) 20) during treatment from the initial level of 17 mm Hg (SD 19), P &lt; 0.05, whereas the ankle systolic pressures of the group allocated to alprostadil dropped slightly from 43 mm Hg (SD 41) to 39 mm Hg (SD 41). There were no significant differences in ankle systolic pressure levels after treatment between the naftidrofuryl and control groups MD 1.00 (95% CI -30.2 to 32.2). However, the mean ankle pressure was much lower in the naftidrofuryl group than in the alprostadil group before treatment commenced. In the Karnik trial (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>), ankle systolic pressures were slightly higher in the prostacyclin group compared to those treated by naftidrofuryl. After one week of treatment, there were no significant changes in either group.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Side effects</I>
</B>
<BR/>In the Bohme trial (<LINK REF="STD-Bohme-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bohme 1994</LINK>), one patient in each of the treatment groups suffered dizziness during infusion of the drugs.</P>
<P>Systemic side effects were reported in 35% of participants receiving naftidrofuryl/rheomacrodex therapy at a dosage of 800 mg daily, and in 32% of participants randomised to placebo/rheomacrodex in the Heiss study (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>). These included renal insufficiency, nausea/vomiting, pruritus (itching), pulmonary congestion, somnolence (drowsiness), dyspnoea and depression. Seven participants in the naftidrofuryl group also developed thrombophlebitis at the injection site.</P>
<P>Minor side effects were recorded in three participants who received naftidrofuryl in the Karnik trial (<LINK REF="STD-Karnik-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Karnik 1986</LINK>). These consisted of flushing (two participants) and pain in the extremities (one patient).</P>
<P>Nine cases of thrombophlebitis were noted out of a total of 323 infusions in the Meehan trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meehan-1982a" TYPE="STUDY">Meehan 1982a</LINK>).</P>
<P>A minor infection and a thrombosis occurred at the cannulation site of two participants (<LINK REF="STD-Negus-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Negus 1987</LINK>).</P>
<P>Side effects were not reported in the Raftery trial (<LINK REF="STD-Raftery-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Raftery 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>No specific side effects were mentioned in the Testart study (<LINK REF="STD-Testart-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Testart 1994</LINK>), but the participants were observed as showing 'good overall tolerance' of naftidrofuryl.</P>
<P>In the Horsch trial (<LINK REF="STD-Horsch-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Horsch 1998</LINK>), one patient dropped out of the study because of a skin reaction to naftidrofuryl. Intravenous gingko biloba was well tolerated by all participants in that group.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-30 14:58:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>The trials included in this review involved a small number of participants and there was substantial variation in both treatment dosage of naftidrofuryl and in outcome measures. The duration of intravenous treatment was also very short. There was no clear indication that short-term intravenous naftidrofuryl significantly improved either symptoms of ischaemic rest pain or skin necrosis. Although participants had reduced pain after treatment in comparison with controls, this was also statistically non-significant.</P>
<P>Similarly, there was little clinical benefit from treatment by naftidrofuryl on ankle systolic pressures which if increased would indicate an improvement in circulation. This lack of effect may be due to the small numbers of participants, and the short duration of treatment.</P>
<P>Side effects were generally local and mild. However, in the trial conducted by Heiss (<LINK REF="STD-Heiss-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Heiss 1985</LINK>), two participants were withdrawn from treatment using naftidrofuryl because of renal insufficiency.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-05-04 13:17:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>On the basis of these trials, there is no clear indication of clinical benefit from using intravenous naftidrofuryl in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia. Following a review by the UK and other European regulatory authorities, naftidrofuryl in the form of 200 mg/10 ml ampoules was withdrawn in 1995 as an intravenous treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease. This was because the risks of cardiac and neurological side effects were found to outweigh the possible benefit of intravenous naftidrofuryl in peripheral arterial disease.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Although intravenous naftidrofuryl has been withdrawn as a treatment for severe peripheral arterial disease, oral treatment with this drug is permitted. In many of the trials included in this review assessing intravenous naftidrofuryl, oral naftidrofuryl was continued after the intravenous phase was completed. A systematic review of oral naftidrofuryl in the treatment of critical limb ischaemia is required.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>Although this appeared to be an adequately designed randomised controlled trial of naftidrofuryl versus conservative therapy, measurement of tissue pH was the only outcome reported.
