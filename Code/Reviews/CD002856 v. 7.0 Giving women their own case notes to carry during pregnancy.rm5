<P>In some healthcare systems women are given their own case notes to look after and bring to each antenatal visit.

All the trials reported that more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy, but there was not enough evidence to determine the effect of women carrying their own case notes on health behaviours such as smoking and breastfeeding, women's satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and assessed study quality.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-13 15:41:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials were included (n = 1176 women). Overall, the quality of the evidence was graded as low to moderate mainly due to the nature of the intervention not allowing blinding. The updated search identified one cluster-randomised trial, which was included.</P>
<P>Women carrying their own notes were more likely to feel in control (two trials, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.06; 450 women; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), although there is no evidence of difference in women's satisfaction (two trials, average RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.29); 698 women; <I>low quality evidence</I>). More women in the case notes group wanted to carry their own notes in a subsequent pregnancy (three trials, RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.03; 552 women; <I>low quality evidence</I>). Overall, the pooled estimate of the two trials (n = 347) that reported on the risk of notes lost or left at home was not significant (average RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.84). There was no evidence of difference for health-related behaviours (cigarette smoking and breastfeeding (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>)), analgesia needs during labour (<I>low quality evidence</I>), maternal depression, miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal deaths (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). More women in the case notes group had operative deliveries (one trial, RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12; 212 women), and caesarean sections (one trial, average RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.08; 501 women; <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-10-13 08:16:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The four trials are small, and not all of them reported on all outcomes. The results suggest that there are both potential benefits (increased maternal control and increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance) and harms (more operative deliveries). Importantly, all of the trials report that more women in the case notes group would prefer to carry their antenatal records in another pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence on health-related behaviours (smoking and breastfeeding), women's satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. It is important to emphasise that this review shows a lack of evidence of benefit rather than evidence of no benefit.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-10-05 04:39:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-10-05 04:39:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the last few years, there has been much interest regarding the best way in which to deliver antenatal care to women (<LINK REF="REF-Munjanja-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munjanja 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2015</LINK>). Challenges to the traditional methods of antenatal care and its effectiveness are being made (<LINK REF="REF-Backe-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Backe 1993</LINK>), and research from the UK has suggested that women want more control over their care during pregnancy and labour (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 1993</LINK>). One aspect of the change in provision of care is giving women their own case notes to carry throughout their pregnancy. This will empower women by facilitating greater participation in their medical care (<LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>), improve the availability of records when needed and reduce the cost. An important benefit of giving women their own case notes is that all healthcare providers will write in one record, which will reduce clinical error and aid carer to carer communication. In addition, it has been hypothesised that women who take responsibility for their own case notes will also exhibit other improved obstetric behaviours such as reduced smoking, reduced need for analgesia in labour and improved breastfeeding (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-06-25 07:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In many low-income countries record keeping is problematic as hospitals struggle to maintain their infrastructure with limited funds, often resulting in 'lost' records or no access to records. This was part of the motivation to develop the 'Road to Health' card; a parent-carried card detailing a child's growth, medical history and immunisation record. This was shown to be of value in a low-income country (<LINK REF="REF-Donald-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Donald 1984</LINK>). More recent work showed that parents and staff liked the concept of the 'Road to Health' card, but wanted it to be more detailed, including illustrations, charts and more health information, more personalised to each child and in the parents' home language (<LINK REF="REF-Harrison-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrison 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-06-25 07:13:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many of the same motivations for woman-carried records apply for the antenatal period. Woman-carried records are also important when women move from one facility to another during pregnancy, which is common in both high- and low-income countries. In many countries, pregnant women have been issued with a summary of their notes and pregnancy history and progress in a woman-carried card, which they bring with them for each visit. The objective is to have easy access to each pregnant woman's medical record and also to reduce the administrative costs involved in keeping and retrieving traditional hospital records. The other advantage of woman-carried records which incorporate clinical, and where available ultrasound fetal growth charts, is that even if the woman moves between health facilities, fetal growth can be monitored and a constant and more accurate assessment of gestational age maintained (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmeyr-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmeyr 1994</LINK>). An indirect benefit of woman-carried case notes is that the quality of care will improve as communication between the woman and the caregiver is more likely, and the woman is better able to participate in the information exchange.</P>
<P>The content of women-held maternity care notes is important; they should contain all the information that is pertinent to her pregnancy and childbirth care, particularly if the woman is issued with an abbreviated form of the main case notes. Merely replacing traditional hospital kept records with incomplete or inadequate woman-carried case notes will not be of benefit.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-09-30 11:25:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>A foreseeable problem with woman-carried case notes is if they are lost, or if the woman does not bring her case notes with her when she attends antenatal care or arrives in labour.</P>
<P>Many countries may be encouraged to implement a practice of women carrying their own case notes before there is clear evidence of benefit or harm. This review aims to evaluate the impact of giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy on both the quality of care and clinical outcomes, thus providing evidence as to the benefits or harms of this practice that can be used in health policy decision-making.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparisons:</P>
<OL>
<LI>number of women who felt in control and involved in decision-making during their pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>number of women who reported that they were satisfied with their antenatal care;</LI>
<LI>number of women who wanted to carry their own notes in a subsequent pregnancy;</LI>
<LI>number of women choosing to breastfeed;</LI>
<LI>number of women needing analgesia during labour;</LI>
<LI>number of women who had a caesarean section;</LI>
<LI>mortality of neonates (including stillbirth or neonatal death).</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a 'Summary of findings' table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 1176).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Location</HEADING>
<P>Three included studies were conducted within the public health sector of well-resourced countries, two in the United Kingdom (UK) and one in Australia. One study in the UK was conducted in a teaching hospital antenatal clinic serving a predominantly low-income population with a large proportion of lone parents, high unemployment and racial groups disproportionately affected by social deprivation (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>). The other UK study was conducted in a rural setting at a consultant-led peripheral antenatal clinic, and there is no comment on the socioeconomic profile of these women (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>). The Australian study was carried out at the antenatal clinic in a teaching hospital in an urban area; no socioeconomic profile of the participants is provided other than that they were all English speaking (<LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>). A fourth included study took place in Bulgan, rural Mongolia (<LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All four studies recruited women for the trial at their first antenatal 'booking' visit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>In three trials the intervention groups were given their complete antenatal records to carry and the control groups were given a card referred to as a co-operation or 'co-op' card, which is a card carried by the pregnant woman but with much abbreviated information and no clinical follow-up or clinical progress information. In the fourth trial (<LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK>), women in the intervention group carried a handbook to log maternal health, pregnancy and delivery information as well as child health measures, such as immunisation and growth charts; women in the control arm of this trial received standard antenatal care, and the intervention was rolled out in control clusters after nine months.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For all four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK>), data on the primary and secondary outcomes were collected using self-administered questionnaires. None of the trials reported whether questionnaires were validated. <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK> also collected data from pregnant women by questionnaire at one month post-birth; additionally, data collectors visited clinics and hospitals for records of antenatal visits and delivery outcomes.</P>
<P>All four trials reported on the number of women who reported being satisfied with care, but availability of antenatal records at time of delivery was not addressed in any of the trials. Three trials reported the number of notes lost or left at home and the number of women who wanted to carry their own notes (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>); two trials reported on number of women who felt in control (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>). However, the outcomes were reported differently in each trial; <LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK> used rate ratios, while <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK> reported percentages.</P>
<P>None of the secondary outcomes were reported in all four trials. Partner involvement was addressed indirectly in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>), and the number of women who stopped smoking was reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK> addressed each of the following outcomes: the number of women needing analgesia; number who had an assisted delivery (caesarean section and forceps); miscarriage; stillbirth and neonatal death; and the number of women breastfeeding after delivery. <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK> reported several secondary outcomes, including breastfeeding; assisted vaginal delivery; caesarean section; stillbirth or neonatal death; admission to neonatal intensive care unit, maternal intensive care unit admission and maternal depression.</P>

There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (Heterogeneity: Tau = 0.01; I = 53%), but there was no evidence of a meaningful difference between subgroups based on the randomisation unit (Test for subgroup differences: Chi = 2.14, df = 1 (P = 0.14), I = 53.4%). It is possible that the population of pregnant women, trial location (London UK and rural Mongolia), or structure of care may each contribute to heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Further evidence could not be included in our meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK> evaluated maternal satisfaction with overall care using 17 indirect parameters (evaluated using a five-point Likert scale) in a questionnaire with women; none of these showed statistically significant differences between the two groups (no data given). <LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK> reported no statistically significant differences in satisfaction with care between women carrying their own notes and women holding only co-operation cards; no data were provided in the published paper.</P>

The I test showed significant heterogeneity (I = 66.1%), however the resultant random-effects model was very close to the fixed-effect model. Whilst there is significant heterogeneity, all of the trials follow the same direction of effect. Overall, the combined result indicates that the number of women wanting to carry their own notes in a subsequent pregnancy was significantly higher in the case notes group (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.03). This effect is more marked in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>), (RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.93), however, we could not identify any difference between the trials to explain this.

<P>Additionally, Elbourne reported no difference between the women-held and hospital-held notes groups in terms of availability of notes in antenatal clinics; however, no data were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>).</P>

<P>Two trials commented briefly on partner involvement but did not directly address the outcomes outlined above. In one trial, findings from open-ended questions suggested that women carrying their case notes felt it gave them an opportunity to share information with their partners, especially important if the partners could not attend antenatal appointments with them (<LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>). The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>), reported no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of involvement of the baby's father (no data given).</P>

Both reported no significant differences between the women-held notes and control groups. Data were not provided at all for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>) that additionally reported no difference in terms of 'within-person' changes over the study period in the number of cigarettes smoked. Another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>), reported no change in smoking behaviour in non smokers, smokers of one to 10 cigarettes per day and smokers of more than 11 per day at eight to 16 weeks or 32 to 34 weeks' gestation. Percentages of women smoking within these groups were provided at the different gestations. Denominators were not provided by the authors, and because of the varying numbers of women completing a given question, they could not be calculated. A RevMan analysis graph could therefore not be generated for this outcome.</P>
<P>Alternatively, <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015 </LINK>found reduced smoking among other members in the household in intervention clusters compared with control cluster households (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.99; one trial, 499 women).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK> (n = 212) reported 'assisted delivery' as caesarean and forceps deliveries combined and found that more women in the case notes group (30/104) were delivered by caesarean section or forceps compared to the control group (17/108); (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-10-13 15:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women carrying their own case notes were significantly more likely to feel in control. This is supported by the results from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>) that reported on a sense of control directly. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK>) reported on women's sense of satisfaction, which showed no evidence of a difference. Three trials suggest that significantly more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy. In addition to the four trials included in the review, we identified a qualitative study on 21 women who participated in face-to-face interviews, which were coded for thematic analysis, to explore the impact on women of carrying their own records during pregnancy. The reaction of the women in the study was overwhelmingly supportive towards carrying their own notes as it improved the level of communication between the women and their healthcare providers and provided a greater sense of sharing and communication (<LINK REF="STD-Phipps-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Phipps 2001</LINK>).The results of three of the four included trials are discordant for one outcome as one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>) suggests that women carrying their own notes prevents loss or misplacement of notes and the other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homer-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Homer 1999</LINK>) report no difference.</P>
<P>The evidence for the effect of women-held notes on health-related behaviours is inconclusive.</P>
<P>Clinical outcomes were reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lovell-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Lovell 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mori-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Mori 2015</LINK>). It is of concern that in this trial women in the case notes group had significantly more assisted deliveries (defined as caesarean section and forceps deliveries), which is not accounted for by the use of epidural analgesia.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-09-30 11:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>The four trials are small (all included fewer than 500 women) and from both middle-income (rural Mongolia) and high-income settings (UK and Australia), and not all of them reported on all outcomes; this means we cannot be sure about the effect of giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy on administrative outcomes, maternal satisfaction and control, health-related behaviours, and clinical outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-09-30 11:22:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather Maxwell">
<P>There is a high risk of Type II error due to the small size of included trials. It is important to emphasise that this review shows a lack of evidence of benefit rather than evidence of no benefit; more research is needed. The nature of the intervention means that there is a possibility of introducing bias due to lack of blinding. We judged the quality of the evidence using GRADE and judged the evidence for giving case notes versus control (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>); moderate quality for women who felt in control, breastfeeding, Caesarean section and stillbirth or neonatal death; low quality of evidence for women's satisfaction with antenatal care, women who wanted to carry case notes in a subsequent pregnancy, and epidural analgesia used in labour. We downgraded because most studies had design limitations and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-06-30 07:46:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three included trials used self-administered questionnaires to evaluate the effect of women-held notes; this method is subject to respondent bias and means the outcomes reported in the trials must be interpreted with caution. A patient note audit would provide a more objective measure of quantifiable outcomes. One trial collected and analysed urine samples to obtain a more objective assessment of women's reported smoking behaviour (<LINK REF="STD-Elbourne-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Elbourne 1987</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-13 08:14:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A policy of giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy has both potential benefits (increased maternal control and increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance) and harms (more operative deliveries). Importantly, all of the trials report that more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence of the effect of giving women their own case notes to carry during pregnancy on health-related behaviours (smoking and breastfeeding), women's satisfaction and clinical outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-10-13 15:59:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Giving women their own case notes seems to already be in widespread use including in many low-income countries despite inconclusive evidence and none of the trials having been conducted in a low-income country. The potential risk of increased caesarean sections and operative vaginal births has significant resource implications in a low-income setting. For this reason there would be value in a large multicentre trial including low-income countries that looks specifically at clinical outcomes in women and their babies and administrative issues, and qualitative studies to explore women's satisfaction, empowerment and sense of control.<BR/>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>5 hypotheses were made about women carrying their own notes:<BR/>1) they would feel more satisfied with their maternity care;<BR/>2) women would feel better about their pregnancy, better informed, less anxious, more in control, more confident and that the babies father was more involved in the pregnancy, labour and care of the child;<BR/>3) women would be less likely to suffer depression and find it easier to communicate with staff;<BR/>4) women carrying their own notes would result in increased availability of notes and a saving of clerical resources.</P>

<P>The authors reported baseline imbalances between clusters for travel time to health centre and wealth.</P>
<P>The authors reported that recall bias may exist due to data collection at 1 month after birth.</P>
<P>Analyses were undertaken with methods appropriate for cluster trials; the authors used GEE methods to adjust for the effects of cluster design and baseline variables.</P>
<P>A sample size calculation was undertaken and met.</P>
<P>Recruitment bias - All of the eligible women were registered with the health centres in their soums, and had been visited by the doctors. There is a possibility for them to go to another health centre in a different soum for their antenatal visit or any other visit. Recruitment was done by home visiting of their doctors, not by women's visiting health centres, as the home visits are mandatory for these doctors.</P>
