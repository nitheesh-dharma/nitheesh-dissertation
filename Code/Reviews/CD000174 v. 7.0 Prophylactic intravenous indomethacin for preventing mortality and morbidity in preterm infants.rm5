<P>Substantive amendment</P>
<P>An initial literature search (English only) was undertaken in October 1994 in three databases: MEDLINE at NLM (1980 - September 1994); EMBASE (1974 - 1994) in DIALOG; and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials (ODPT) (Version 1.3, Disk issue 7, Spring 1992). A search by first author of any abstracts was done in the Science Citation Index to try and identify any corresponding full manuscripts published. None were identified.</P>
<P>The literature search was updated in February 1997 by assessing a trials list supplied by the Cochrane Collaboration Neonatal Review Group and by searching in MEDLINE (September 1994 - January 1997) using a similar strategy to the original search. EMBASE was not searched again as the original search in this database failed to identify any appropriate trials not identified by searching MEDLINE.</P>
<P>The search was updated a third time in October 2001, searching in MEDLINE ["indomethacin AND infant AND (prophylactic OR prophylaxis OR prevention)"], and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2001 ["indomethacin AND (infant OR newborn)"].</P>

<P>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when an artery near the heart and lungs, which should close off soon after birth, stays open. Babies born preterm (premature) who have a PDA are at higher risk of severe illness and death. Indomethacin, a drug more commonly used for muscle and bone pain in adults, when given to preterm infants can help close a PDA. This review found evidence that giving all preterm infants (especially very preterm infants) indomethacin on the first day after birth reduced their risk of developing a PDA and the complications associated with PDA (including brain damage due to bleeding into the brain). However, despite these short term effects, the trials found evidence that indomethacin does not increase survival or reduce disability in the longer term.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-15 15:23:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-06-15 15:23:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>About one-third of very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) (birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) infants develop a haemodynamically-important patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) during the first few days after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1990</LINK>). The incidence of PDA is inversely related to weight and gestational age at birth and is higher in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. PDA is persistent in about one-half of extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (birth weight &lt; 1000 grams) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Following the postnatal fall in pulmonary vascular pressures, infants with a haemodynamically-important PDA experience shunting of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary arterial circulation (<LINK REF="REF-Evans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Evans 1996</LINK>). This "left to right" shunt alters the blood flow distribution to the lungs and other organs and may contribute to a higher risk of severe and prolonged respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and death in infants with a PDA compared to similar infants whose PDA has closed (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipman-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipman 1982</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-06-15 15:23:15 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PDA closure may be achieved surgically, by transthoracic ligation or transcatheter occlusion, or pharmacologically using prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as indomethacin or ibuprofen (<LINK REF="REF-Heymann-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heymann 1976</LINK>). Current data are insufficient to determine if surgical or medical treatment is the better initial option for closing a PDA in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Malviya-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malviya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mosalli-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mosalli 2008</LINK>). Currently, surgical ligation or transcatheter occlusion is usually reserved for instances in which pharmacological intervention has been unsuccessful.</P>
<P>Three broad strategies of pharmacological therapy for PDA can be considered (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2001</LINK>):</P>

<LI>treatment of all at risk infants within the first 24 hours after birth ("prophylactic treatment").</LI>
</UL>
<P>This review focusses on prophylactic treatment of PDA in preterm infants using indomethacin. Another Cochrane review examines ibuprofen prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-06-15 10:57:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Prophylactic treatment aims to achieve PDA closure prior to the development of shunting and haemodynamic disturbances that are associated with morbidity and mortality but without the need for screening or surveillance using echocardiography. However, universal prophylaxis exposes a substantial proportion of infants in whom PDA closure would have occurred spontaneously to a pharmacological intervention. This is important because, as well as having potential benefits, treatment with prophylactic indomethacin may have harms related to reducing perfusion of essential organs such as reduced cerebral blood flow which may oppose any neurodevelopmental benefits due to possible reduction in the incidence of IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1990</LINK>); reduced gastrointestinal perfusion that potentially limits any effect of PDA closure on reducing the risk of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Coombs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coombs 1990</LINK>); and reduced renal perfusion, glomerular filtration and urine output causing fluid and electrolyte disturbances in the early neonatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Cifuentes-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cifuentes 1979</LINK>). Indomethacin may also inhibit platelet function and disrupt haemostasis that may cause clinically-important bleeding e.g. IVH (<LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1978</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-06-15 07:59:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the uncertainty that exists about the balance between the putative benefits and harms associated with prophylactic indomethacin in preterm neonates, and the potential for this intervention to affect several major outcomes in this population, an attempt to detect, appraise, and synthesise evidence from randomised controlled trials is justified.<BR/>

<P>The criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodological quality of any included trials in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents or caregivers and assessors to the intervention and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. Additional information from the trial authors was requested to clarify methodology and results as necessary. In addition, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation: Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment: Was allocation adequately concealed? </P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors: Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment? </P>
<P>4. Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? </P>
<P>5. Selective outcome reporting: Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting? </P>

<P>The size of the trials ranged from single centre studies enrolling less than 50 infants to a large international multi-centre study in which 1202 infants participated (<LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>). Thirteen trials were conducted within North America and the others in Latin America, Europe and Asia. The large international trial included centres in North America, Australasia and Asia (<LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most trials, participants were very preterm or VLBW infants receiving standard intensive care interventions such as mechanical ventilation. The largest included trial restricted participation to ELBW infants (<LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>). Surfactant was given either as prophylaxis or rescue therapy in seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Couser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Domanico-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Domanico 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ment-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Ment 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ment-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Ment 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Supapannachart-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Supapannachart 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yaseen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Yaseen 1997</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<B>Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>All the studies used prophylactic intravenous indomethacin as treatment. The dosage schedules varied from a single dose of 0.2 mg/kg at 24 hours of age to a daily dose of 0.1 mg/kg given for six days. A placebo, typically saline, was used as control in all trials apart from <LINK REF="STD-Krueger-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Krueger 1987</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Most trials examined short-term clinical outcomes prior to discharge from hospital. Many of the outcome definitions varied, in particular the definition of BPD. Several studies looked at a variety of measures of renal function including urine output and renal biochemistry but there was little consistency between studies as to which measures and which cut-off points were used. The same issue arose when examining haemostasis when the platelet count, bleeding time and "clinical bleeding" were variably used in different studies.</P>
<P>Data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes up to 36 months corrected age were available from five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bandstra-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Bandstra 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Couser-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Couser 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ment-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Ment 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vincer-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Vincer 1987</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-06-15 08:00:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review of 19 randomised controlled trials in which more than 2800 preterm infants participated found evidence that prophylactic indomethacin does not have a substantial effect on mortality or neurodevelopmental outcomes. The homogeneity in the meta-analyses and the narrow confidence intervals around the estimates of effect suggest that small but potentially important effects are unlikely to exist and that further trials of this intervention are not a research priority.</P>
<P>With regard to secondary outcomes, the available evidence indicates that prophylactic administration of indomethacin has short term benefits including a reduction in the incidence of symptomatic PDA, the need for surgical PDA closure, and the incidence of severe IVH. Safety concerns have largely been allayed. The available data indicate that any indomethacin-associated renal impairment is transient and there is no evidence that prophylactic indomethacin affects the risk of NEC or clinically-important bleeding.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2010-05-20 10:54:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials were generally of good methodological quality and the effect size estimates consistent between trials suggesting that the meta-analyses were valid. The participants in the included trials reflect the population for which this intervention is currently considered, that is VLBW and particularly ELBW infants. On post hoc inspection of forest plots, the findings appear consistent across trials conducted before surfactant replacement and antenatal corticosteroid therapy were established as standards of care compared with trials undertaken during the later 1990s.<BR/>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2010-06-15 08:01:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most of the trials included in the review were relatively small. Two large multi-centre studies contributed about 60% of the total number of participants (<LINK REF="STD-Ment-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Ment 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>). There is some variation in study design, particularly with regard to birth weight eligibility criteria and the indomethacin dosage regimens used but the meta-analyses did not reveal statistical heterogeneity. The validity of the long term assessment data is enhanced by the impressive completeness of follow-up in the largest trials. <LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK> provided data on more than 95% of survivors at 18 months and showed no statistically significant differences in a variety of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Longer term assessments have not been performed in <LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK> and some caution should perhaps be exercised in applying these findings at 18 months since it has been suggested that assessments done at a relatively young age may be insufficiently predictive of longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes, particularly with regard to cognitive functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Ment-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Ment 1994b</LINK> provided data on 85% of survivors at eight years and also failed to detect any statistically significant differences in a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes including educational and cognitive performance.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-06-15 08:01:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the lack of evidence of effect on long term outcomes, the decision to use prophylactic indomethacin will depend on the values that families and clinicians attach to the short term benefits. In neonatal units without ready access to cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic services, a reduction in symptomatic PDA and a reduction in the need for surgical closure may be considered a greater benefit than in other units with ready access to these services. Cost implications may need to be considered although economic evaluation of this intervention has been limited to date (<LINK REF="STD-TIPP-2001" TYPE="STUDY">TIPP 2001</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:01:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of prophylactic indomethacin versus placebo are unlikely to be considered a research priority. Exploring and evaluating parental perceptions and concerns regarding the use of prophylactic indomethacin may help guide policy and practice development.<BR/>Although data are available on long term neurodevelopmental outcomes at the age of 18 months to five years in many children and at eight years in a smaller cohort, continuing follow-up of these children would be justified as more subtle differences in later childhood and adulthood may become apparent (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>431 infants were randomised. 45 died before hospital discharge and their group of allocation is known. At 36 months follow-up, 343 (89% of survivors) were assessed for the presence or absence of cerebral palsy. Fewer were formally assessed for hearing impairment (135) and visual impairment (158). 251 infants underwent objective cognitive function testing. Cognitive function testing was limited to children who spoke English as their first and only language because of concerns that the instruments used were not valid in non-English speaking or multilingual children. The proportions of survivors who were tested for cognitive function at follow-up were similar for the indomethacin and placebo groups. However, no data were provided on those children not assessed.</P>
<P>At 54-months follow-up, vision and hearing were assessed in 337 infants, presence or absence of cerebral palsy in 323 and cognitive testing in 233. For the purposes of this review, we used the 54-month outcomes for vision and hearing and the 36-month outcome for cerebral palsy to minimise loss to follow-up.</P>
<P>Follow-up neurodevelopmental and/or educational outcomes assessments at aged 8 years were reported for 328 of 384 surviving children (85%).</P>
