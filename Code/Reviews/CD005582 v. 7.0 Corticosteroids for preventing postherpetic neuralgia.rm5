<TITLE>Corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:40:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful condition that is one of the most common complications of an acute herpes zoster infection. Herpes zoster presents as a localised rash resembling localised chicken pox, often called 'shingles'. Postherpetic neuralgia may persist lifelong once it occurs and has major implications for quality of life and use of healthcare resources. Corticosteroids have a potent anti-inflammatory action, which it has been suggested might minimise nerve damage and thereby relieve or prevent the pain experienced by people suffering from this condition. Five trials were identified from a systematic search of the literature which were of high enough quality to be included in the review. These trials involved 787 participants in total. We were able to combine the results from two trials (114 participants) and there was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and control groups in the presence of postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. Two of the three other included trials reported results at less than one month, so these participants did not fulfil the current criteria for a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia. The last trial reported results in a format unsuitable for meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroids and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. It can be concluded that, based on moderate quality evidence, corticosteroids are not effective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:26:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We updated the searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids for preventing postherpetic neuralgia in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (16 April 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012), and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (1978 to 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials, contacted authors and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:39:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>We included all RCTs involving corticosteroids given by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes for people of all ages with herpes zoster of all degrees of severity within seven days after onset, compared with no treatment or placebo but not with other treatments. We did not include quasi-RCTs (trials in which a systematic method of randomisation such as alternation or hospital number was used).</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:39:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Two authors identified potential articles, extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias of each trial. Disagreement was resolved by discussion among the co-authors.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:39:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Five trials were included with 787 participants in total. All were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of two trials (114 participants) and the results gave moderate quality evidence that oral corticosteroids did not prevent postherpetic neuralgia six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99). One of these trials was at high risk of bias because of incomplete outcome data, the other was at low risk of bias overall. The three other trials that fulfilled our inclusion criteria were not included in the meta-analysis because the outcomes were reported at less than one month or not in sufficient detail to add to the meta-analysis. These three trials were generally at low risk of bias. Adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment were reported in all five included trials. There were no significant differences in serious or non-serious adverse events between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. There was also no significant difference between the treatment groups and placebo groups in other secondary outcome analyses and subgroup analyses. The review was first published in 2008 and no new RCTs were identified for inclusion in subsequent updates in 2010 and 2012.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:39:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>There is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. In people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. Corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. If further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. Future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:41:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful condition that occurs in people following an acute herpes zoster infection (commonly referred to as 'shingles'). Shingles is an acute vesicular eruption involving one or two adjacent dermatomes, with pain often preceding the eruption by days to weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Kost-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kost 1996</LINK>). Herpes zoster results from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus acquired during chicken pox, the primary varicella infection. Reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus from dorsal root ganglia is responsible for the classic dermatomal rash and pain that occurs with herpes zoster (<LINK REF="REF-Kost-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kost 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Herpes zoster is a sporadic disease with an estimated lifetime incidence of 10% to 20%. Its incidence increases sharply with advancing age, roughly doubling in each decade past the age of 50 years. Herpes zoster is uncommon in people less than 15 years old. The normal age-related decrease in cell-mediated immunity is thought to account for the increased incidence in older age (<LINK REF="REF-Stankus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankus 2000</LINK>). People with disease states that affect cell-mediated immunity, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and certain malignancies, are at increased risk. Chronic corticosteroid use, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may increase the risk of developing herpes zoster (<LINK REF="REF-Fillet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fillet 2002</LINK>). Ethnic background may influence susceptibility to herpes zoster. Black people are one fourth less likely than white people to develop it. Although herpes zoster is not as contagious as primary varicella infection, people with reactivated infection can transmit varicella-zoster virus to non-immune contacts. There is no seasonal incidence and the areas of the body affected tend to be the chest and abdomen and the territory of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.</P>
<P>PHN is one of the most common complications of herpes zoster. It may persist until death and has major implications for quality of life and use of healthcare resources. Although PHN has been defined in different ways, recent data support the distinction between acute (within 30 days of rash onset), subacute (30 to 120 days after rash onset) and PHN (defined as pain lasting at least 120 days from rash onset) (<LINK REF="REF-Desmond-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although age, acute pain severity and rash severity appear to be correlated with incidence of PHN, accurate predictors for PHN have not been defined (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). About 20% of people with herpes zoster develop PHN. Its incidence is between 9% and 14% one month after the herpes zoster eruption. The most established risk factor is age. As age increases, the risk and duration of PHN also rise (<LINK REF="REF-Griffin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rosler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosler 1996</LINK>). The incidence of PHN after an outbreak of shingles is 10% in people over 40 years, and 20% to 50% in people over 60 years. PHN is rarely seen in people under 30 years. Other possible risk factors for the development of PHN are ophthalmic zoster, prodromal pain before the appearance of skin lesions and an immunocompromised state (<LINK REF="REF-Stankus-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stankus 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is a tendency for PHN to improve with time and as few as 3% of people are left with severe PHN after one year. However, some series report that as many as 40% of people with PHN will continue to have long-term problems because of incomplete or no pain relief from treatments. There is no way of predicting who will recover (<LINK REF="REF-de-Moragas-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Moragas 1957</LINK>).</P>
<P>Varicella-zoster virus is a highly contagious DNA virus. It is thought that the varicella virus passes to the dorsal root ganglion via the skin during the initial infection (chicken pox) and lies dormant. The latent virus becomes reactivated when immune mechanisms are impaired and it is manifested by the rash and the pain. The pathophysiology of PHN remains unclear. However, pathologic studies have demonstrated damage to the sensory nerves, sensory dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horns of the spinal cord. The presence of PHN may reflect the persistence of more than the low amounts of varicella-zoster virus found during latency with continued inflammation. If this is the case, there may be a rationale for the aggressive treatment with aciclovir, and perhaps corticosteroids, of people who have zoster (<LINK REF="REF-Mahalingam-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahalingam 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of herpes zoster has three major objectives: (1) treatment of the acute viral infection, (2) treatment of the acute pain associated with herpes zoster, and (3) prevention of PHN. Antiviral agents, oral corticosteroids and adjunctive individualised pain-management modalities are used to achieve these objectives.</P>
<P>Treatment of PHN is difficult and a variety of treatments are offered without consensus about their effectiveness. The complexity of the underlying changes might account for the lack of efficacy of a single therapeutic approach (<LINK REF="REF-Alper-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alper 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). The effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN has been evaluated in a separate Cochrane review; it concluded that oral aciclovir was ineffective in reducing the incidence of PHN while insufficient evidence was found to recommend other antiviral treatments to prevent PHN (<LINK REF="REF-Li-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some older studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids such as prednisolone or triamcinolone prednisone therapy in preventing PHN have suggested decreased pain at three and 12 months (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keczkes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Keczkes 1980</LINK>). Other studies have demonstrated no significant benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Lancaster-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lancaster 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Volmink-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volmink 1996</LINK>). Another two large randomised, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the combination of corticosteroids and the antiviral agent aciclovir. One claimed that the addition of prednisone reduced the incidence and severity of acute pain but provided no additional benefit for long-term pain over aciclovir alone (<LINK REF="REF-Wood-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 1994b</LINK>). The other suggested that aciclovir and a corticosteroid did not significantly alter the course of long-term zoster-associated pain but might improve quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). Despite the lack of clear evidence, corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of herpes zoster. A systematic review of corticosteroids for preventing PHN is needed to try and clarify the evidence and include in any meta-analysis the results of past and future trials.</P>
<P>The first version of this Cochrane review, published in 2008, indicated that there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusion about the efficacy of corticosteroids in preventing PHN. In this update, which includes more up to date data analysis methodology, we conclude that there is moderate quality evidence that there is no benefit of corticosteroids in preventing postherpetic neuralgia, but that this evidence is limited.</P>

The following search terms were used singly and in appropriate combinations: 'herpes zoster', 'shingles', 'postherpetic' or 'post-herpetic', 'neuralgia' or 'neuropathy' or 'pain', 'glucocorticoids', 'adrenal cortex hormones', 'corticosteroid', 'steroid', 'prednisolone', 'triamcinolone', 'dexamethasone', 'hydrocortisone' and 'prednisone'. We adapted this strategy to search CENTRAL (2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012), LILACS (January 1982 to April 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System (January 1978 to February 2012). We also reviewed the bibliographies of the trials identified, contacted the authors and known experts in the field, and approached pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.</P>

<P>Two review authors (YH, JZ) assessed the risk of bias in each trial. The assessment of risk of bias took into account security of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and any other potential sources of bias. These items were assessed by two authors independently according to the Cochrane Collaboration standard scheme (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). All included trials were judged for each item as 'High risk of bias', 'Low risk of bias' or 'Unclear risk of bias'. We used 'Unclear risk of bias' if: there was insufficient detail to assess risk of bias, information was available but the risk of bias was unclear, or when the entry was not relevant to the study. We resolved any disagreement by discussion, with reference to a third author if necessary.</P>

<P>We used RevMan 5 for the statistical analysis and reported data according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria.

<P>To avoid unit-of-analysis error resulting from combining results of more than one time point for each study in a standard meta-analysis, we evaluated outcomes based on the periods of follow-up (six months after disease onset).

<SEARCH_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-27 09:44:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>For the 2012 update, the electronic searches retrieved a number of references: 20 from the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, 73 from CENTRAL, 760 from MEDLINE, 164 from EMBASE, 6 from LILACS, and 338 from the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System. After scrutinising these titles and abstracts, we selected 43 possible RCTs, 35 of which were the same as those in the first version of this review. We found three additional potentially relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brusco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brusco 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2011</LINK>) during the search for the 2012 update, but these were found not to be RCTs on further checking. No other new trials were found by searching other sources. We excluded four trials that were awaiting assessment in the previous update as the participants' course of disease from onset to start of treatment exceeded seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>); one study is still awaiting assessment (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>We excluded 37 trials (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Of these, two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Benoldi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Benoldi 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Keczkes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Keczkes 1980</LINK>) compared corticosteroids with other treatment.

In seven trials, participants received therapy that was mismatched in dosage, course of treatment or basal medication between corticosteroids and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Guo-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Guo 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jiang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Jiang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yin-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Yin 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zheng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zheng 2004</LINK>). Four trials defined PHN as pain persisting at the site of shingles two weeks after the onset of the acute rash (<LINK REF="STD-Chang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2002</LINK>) and another trial defined PHN as pain persisting one week after total decrustation (<LINK REF="STD-Liao-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Liao 2005</LINK>); the follow-up of each of these studies was less than one month. As described above, four trials exceeded our seven days in the treatment criterion (<LINK REF="STD-Lin-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xu-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Xu 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The study currently awaiting classification did not clarify the exact course of disease from onset of herpes zoster to receipt of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Hu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Hu 2001</LINK>). We contacted the study authors by mail but obtained no reply. Another article (<LINK REF="REF-Levinson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levinson 1985</LINK>), which was classified as a study awaiting assessment in the first version of this Cochrane review, was a review of the previous studies. Although the authors said they were investigating the feasibility of a multicentre trial in this field, we did not find any subsequent trial report so we removed the reference from studies awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>Five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) fulfilled the selection criteria (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the 2012 update we did not find any new trials for inclusion. Although we found two more trials published in the last two years in the Chinese databases (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zeng-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Zeng 2011</LINK>) and one trial in LILACS (<LINK REF="STD-Brusco-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brusco 1993</LINK>), we excluded all three because their participants were not truly randomly assigned to groups.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial design</HEADING>

Two of these were performed in a single centre (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK> conducted in Denmark; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK> conducted in a Miami dermatology inpatient service) and the others were performed in multiple centres (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK> conducted in Aarhus and Copenhagen, Denmark; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK> conducted in 15 university hospitals or affiliated clinics in USA; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK> conducted in four centres in the United Kingdom).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>A total of 787 participants were enrolled in the five included studies. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) reported the range of ages as 16 to 91 years old. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) stated the gender distribution (male 307, female 427) and mean age of participants. All of the five trials defined explicit inclusion criteria. Among them, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) included participants with early, severely painful zoster; four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) included participants with herpes or pain of different grades of severity. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) included participants aged at least 60 years and with onset of herpes zoster less than 96 hours before admission. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) included immunocompetent adults older than 50 years of age who fell ill less than 72 hours before study enrolment. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) included adults who fell ill less than 72 hours before study enrolment. All five included trials also defined explicit exclusion criteria. They excluded participants with peptic ulcer, psychosis, malignant disease, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac insufficiency, adrenocortical disease, tuberculosis, lymphomas, leukaemias, bacterial infections, pregnancy, or those who were on corticosteroid treatment. The time of onset to start of treatment was zero to seven days for four included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) only stated that the mean time was five days, and more details could not be obtained.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The treatment regimens varied between studies (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) compared corticosteroids with placebo. One trial used oral triamcinolone 16 mg three times daily for seven days, 8 mg three times daily for seven days, and 8 mg twice daily for seven days (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>). One trial administered corticosteroid orally or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) intramuscularly (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>). Prednisone was given in doses of 45 mg daily during the first week, 30 mg daily during the second week, and 15 mg daily tapered to zero during the third week. ACTH (Synacthen depot, 1 mg) was given intramuscularly three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) amounting to a total of seven injections. Placebo tablets or injections that were indistinguishable from the active medication were used (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>). Three trials used aciclovir in combination with corticosteroids versus aciclovir in combination with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). One trial used 800 mg aciclovir orally five times daily for seven days and coded tablets containing either prednisolone or calcium lactate for 21 days. The dose of prednisolone was 40 mg daily for seven days, 30 mg for four days, 20 mg for three days, 10 mg for four days, and finally 5 mg for three days (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>). One trial used prednisone or a matched placebo orally, 60 mg/day for days one to seven, 30 mg/day for days eight to 14, and 15 mg/day for days 15 to 21 (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). Aciclovir or a matched placebo was administered orally at 800 mg five times daily for 21 days. Matched medications were identical in taste and appearance. The four treatment regimens given were aciclovir plus prednisone, aciclovir plus prednisone placebo, prednisone plus aciclovir placebo, and placebos for both aciclovir and prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). Another trial administered aciclovir 800 mg orally five times daily, beginning on day zero (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). The participants in the groups assigned to seven days of aciclovir therapy (with or without corticosteroid) received matching placebo beginning on day seven. Prednisolone was administered according to the following schedule: on days zero through six, 40 mg per day; days seven through 10, 30 mg per day; days 11 through 14, 20 mg per day; days 15 through 18, 10 mg per day; and days 19 through 21, 5 mg per day (total dose 535 mg). Prednisolone was given as 5 mg tablets. The participants in the groups not receiving corticosteroid received matching placebo tablets. The four treatment regimens given were: aciclovir for seven days with corticosteroids, aciclovir for seven days without corticosteroids, aciclovir for 21 days with corticosteroids, and aciclovir for 21 days without corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). All trials followed the participants for at least six months or until the PHN ended or the participant no longer returned. One trial monitored all participants for three years (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>The outcome measures used differed between trials. Four trials reported the duration of PHN or presence of PHN at six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). Two trials did not provide separate information on the number of participants with PHN at six months and were therefore not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). All five included trials did not report, as a separate outcome, pain severity measured by a validated visual analogue scale or numerical descriptive scale after three, six and 12 months or the quality of life measured with the SF-36 Health Survey after six months. All five included trials reported adverse events during treatment or within two weeks after stopping treatment. Adverse events were categorised as serious or not serious.</P>

<P>See: the 'Risk of bias' table of each included study in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>All included trials were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel studies. The method of randomisation was reported in three included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). The Eaglstein study (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) used randomisation with a centralised code generated at a pharmacy. A supply of medication for each participant was assigned a different code number and distributed to the participants; the code of each participant was opened after a three-year follow-up. The Whitley and Wood studies both used a computer-generated randomisation code to randomly assign participants; in <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK> the randomisation code was stratified by study centre to assign participants in blocks of eight to either group so that allocation concealment might be performed; the method of allocation concealment in <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK> was unclear. <LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK> did not describe the method of randomisation, and it was not clear from the reports if there was adequate allocation concealment in either study. The five included trials were all double-blind, using placebo in the control group. One of these trials used lactose as placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>), another used calcium lactate (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>), and the other three studies only stated placebo tablets indistinguishable from the active medication but did not describe their composition (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). Three of the five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) included aciclovir as routine treatment. All trials considered baseline clinical features. In four trials the baseline clinical features were similar between groups (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). In one trial baseline differences were not described (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) but the authors reported no serious imbalances in baseline prognostic factors between groups.</P>
<P>All five included studies reported the time of follow-up; three used six months (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>), one 10 months (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>), and one three years (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) six participants were withdrawn but it was unclear whether the lack of compliance was due to inefficacy or side effects. The group that those participants were first assigned to was not specified so bias from incomplete outcome data was possibly an issue in this study. The other four studies all reported information about follow-up and dropouts and described the reasons for dropping out clearly. Only one study claimed that an intention-to-treat analysis was used (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>); the other four included studies did not state whether, or not, the analysis was by intention to treat, but there was sufficient information in three trial reports (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) to restore them to the correct group and perform an intention-to-treat analysis in our review.</P>
<P>For each included study, outcomes listed in the methods section were all reported. Publication bias should be taken into account since most of the included and excluded studies were published in English or Chinese, although we have attempted to do our best to search all probable literature without any language restrictions and have contacted investigators to get more information. The included studies used different cut-off times to definite PHN so, although we clearly stated that PHN was pain persisting, or recurring, at the site of shingles at least one month after the onset of the acute rash, we have not restricted inclusion to studies using the same definition in order not to introduce more missing data.</P>
<P>For this update, according to the new 'Risk of bias' assessments (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), we updated 'blinding' and performed the analyses in two parts: blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment. Two (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) of the trials were rated as at low risk of bias, two (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) as unclear risk of bias, and one (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) as at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Presence of PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash</HEADING>
<P>One trial comparing triamcinolone with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) provided data on the presence of PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. There was no significant difference in the number of participants with PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash between those in the corticosteroids group (2/15,13.3%) and those in the placebo group (2/20, 10.0%). However, the wide CIs meant we could not rule out significant benefit or harm (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.21 to 8.41). This study also reported the presence of PHN at other time points during follow-up, including one and four months after the onset, which are also commonly used to evaluate incidence of PHN. The presence of PHN was not statistically different between groups (9/15 versus 14/20 at one month, P = 0.55; 2/15 versus 4/20 at four months, P = 0.61). Another trial comparing prednisolone plus routine treatment with placebo plus routine treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) provided data for our primary outcome. The trial compared aciclovir plus corticosteroids with aciclovir plus placebo. The presence of PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash following corticosteroids plus antiviral agents (9/42, 21.4%) was not significantly different from its presence following placebo plus antiviral agents (9/37, 24.3%) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.98).</P>
<P>We conducted a meta-analysis combining relevant data from the above two trials, with a total of 114 participants, and the results showed that oral corticosteroids did not play a part in preventing PHN six months after the onset of herpes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.99, P = 0.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The Clemmensen study (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>) used a cut-off time of six weeks for defining PHN, concluding that prednisone did not decrease the incidence of PHN. Since the numbers of participants with PHN six months after the rash onset could not be obtained, these data were not included in any meta-analysis for effects of corticosteroids (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two other trials provided relevant data for this outcome although not in a format which permitted inclusion in our meta-analysis. In a trial with 201 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), a Cox regression model analysis of the main effect of prednisone compared with no prednisone showed no significant difference in the time to cessation of zoster-associated pain (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.75). From their Cox regression model, we used the generic inverse variance approach to calculate the main effect of prednisone compared with no prednisone and confirmed that there was no significant difference in the time to cessation of zoster-associated pain (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.27) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). In the trial with 400 participants, of whom 349 completed the study (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>), the investigators did not detect significant differences between any of the treatment groups in the time to complete cessation of pain. The median time to cessation of pain was 147 and 120 days in the groups receiving 7-day and 21-day aciclovir without a corticosteroid and 146 and 120 days in the two groups who received aciclovir with corticosteroids. Thus, the results of both these large trials agreed with the conclusion from the meta-analysis of the two smaller trials that corticosteroids did not significantly affect the presence of PHN after six months.</P>

<P>Four included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) evaluated pain intensity after using corticosteroids to treat acute herpes zoster, but three of them (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) recorded the data only during the first month and they used different pain evaluation methods; so we were not able to include the data in a meta-analysis even when attempting to convert outcomes to dichotomous data. The Clemmensen study graded pain from zero (no pain) to three (insufferable pain). There was no significant difference in mean pain score between prednisone and placebo during the 21-day treatment period, and the score was significantly lower in the ACTH group during the first four days of the trial (P = 0.02 to 0.03) but not after (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>). One trial reported that in participants more than 60 years old, pain resolved spontaneously but more rapidly with corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>). In the Wood trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) the reduction in pain score was significantly larger in the corticosteroids groups than the no-corticosteroids groups on days 7 and 14 (P &lt; 0.01). Only one trial reported pain at six months: 18 participants had pain, of whom 15 had light pain; two had moderate pain; and one had severe pain. Among them nine had received prednisone and nine placebo but the severity of pain was not reported by group (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>).</P>

The other three trials all reported several serious adverse events during or within two weeks after stopping treatment, including acute cardiac insufficiency (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>), myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>), pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>), chest infection (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>), haematemesis (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) and death from other unspecified causes (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>). In the meta-analysis, the incidence of serious adverse events for corticosteroids (6/376, 1.6%) was not significantly different from that for placebo (3/379, 0.8%) (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.29, P = 0.40) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>

<P>All five trials reported details of non-serious adverse events, including clinical manifestation or laboratory results, the number of participants experiencing each adverse event, and their distribution between groups. The most frequently reported non-serious adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms (such as dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), dizziness, headache, sweats, rash, oedema, hyperglycaemia, and increase of serum aspartate glutamyltransferase. In our meta-analysis of data from the five trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>), the overall incidence of non-serious adverse events for corticosteroids (55/376, 14.6%) was not statistically significant compared to placebo (43/379, 11.3%) (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.87, P = 0.16).</P>

<P>The Eaglstein study (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) reported duration of pain for each participant in bar charts which clearly showed the age of each participant. Two other trials (<LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) only enrolled participants aged more than 60 or 50 years old, respectively. So a subgroup analysis involving only adults aged 50 years or more was potentially possible for these three trials. Unfortunately the Whitley study was not included in the meta-analysis since detailed numbers of events could not be extracted from this article. Thus in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) including 107 participants aged 50 years or more, the presence of PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash was similar in the corticosteroids group (11/53, 20.8%) to that in the placebo group (11/54, 20.4%) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.04) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Clemmensen study (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>) reported 33 participants in the group of participants aged over 55 years, of whom nine developed PHN (four in the prednisone group, one in the placebo group, and four in the other treatment group) without significant differences between groups. However, the study defined PHN using a six-week cut-off time and only reported the mean duration of PHN as 4.2 months (range 1.5 to 10.0 months), so we were not able to obtain the separate data on participants with PHN after six months follow-up.</P>

<P>In one trial with six participants (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>), none developed PHN after six months follow-up. In the Clemmensen study (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>) none of the 22 participants aged 55 years or less developed PHN (the mean duration of PHN was 4.2 months). Relevant data could not be obtained from the other trials.</P>
<P>One of the participants in the Eaglstein study was not included in either the younger or older subgroup as she was withdrawn because of possible side effects. Her age was not reported in the article (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical therapeutic effect</HEADING>
<P>Our aim was to review the evidence from RCTs on the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in preventing PHN. Only five studies examining the prevention effects of corticosteroids in a total of 787 participants were suitable for this review. This is a relatively small number in relation to the known variability in the outcome of PHN.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis of two trials which provided data for our primary outcome measure showed no significant difference between the corticosteroid group and the placebo group in the number of participants with PHN six months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash. There was no significant difference in time to cessation of pain in two larger trials, one with 201 and one with 359 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Established PHN may be intractable and lead to considerable disability in social and domestic activities. Pain evaluation is the key step to controlling neuropathic pain. Doctors must make a detailed and full-scale pain evaluation during the period of treatment and follow-up, including pain character, intensity, position and scope. The most used evaluation methods are the validated visual analogue scale (VAS) or numerical descriptive scales (NRS). Four of the trials included in this review evaluated pain intensity changes but used different pain evaluation methods, so we were unable to combine the data in our meta-analysis. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Clemmensen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Clemmensen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) reported that corticosteroid treatment did not give additional pain relief during the three or six months of follow-up. One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>) reported that pain tended to resolve spontaneously without therapy but more rapidly with corticosteroid therapy, but this trial only included 35 participants.</P>
<P>Despite the lack of benefit in terms of reduction of PHN, which was the focus of this review, there is some evidence of a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes. A trial with 359 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>) showed that pain intensity after two and three weeks had reduced from baseline significantly more in those who received corticosteroids than in those who did not. Another trial with 201 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) showed significantly faster recovery with corticosteroids than without. On evaluation after one month, with the Cox regression model, the main effect of prednisone compared with no prednisone was significant for all four outcomes reported:</P>
<OL>
<LI>time to cessation of acute neuritis (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.86);</LI>
<LI>time to return to uninterrupted sleep (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.41);</LI>
<LI>time to return to 100% usual daily activity (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.51);</LI>
<LI>time to total cessation of analgesic therapy (RR 2.25, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.54).</LI>
</OL>
<P>The results of these two papers suggest that corticosteroids may have a significant effect in accelerating healing and reducing acute zoster pain. This conclusion differs from the lack of effect of corticosteroids on the persistence of PHN and suggests that the relationship between acute inflammation, pain and PHN is not simple.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>All five included trials reported adverse events, but these were not significantly more common in corticosteroid than in placebo participants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Although the most established risk factor for PHN is age, accurate predictors for PHN have not been defined (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>). We conducted subgroup analyses according to age of participants but did not find a significant benefit either in those older than 50 years or those younger. Small numbers make this conclusion very uncertain. There was a lack of sufficient detail to permit extraction of all required data concerning most subgroups of interest. In the absence of a significant effect in the primary outcome measures, and the fact that individual trials were too small to detect moderate effects, more extensive subgroup analysis would have been unreliable. We hope that publication of this review will encourage authors of future PHN prevention trials to collect and publish data which will allow the analysis of subgroups in subsequent systematic reviews.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>In the trials reviewed, the outcome measures involved crude clinical endpoints or a simple pain scale which may be insufficiently responsive to detect meaningful clinical effects. None of the trials reported separate data on pain severity measured by validated visual analogue scales or numerical descriptive scales after three, six or 12 months. However, even the results using these scales are affected by difficulties in standardisation, which make it difficult to draw useful conclusions.</P>
<P>None of the trials reported separate data on quality of life measured with the SF-36 questionnaire after six months.The SF-36 questionnaire is used to assess physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health, but can also be used for evaluating quality of life among pain patients (<LINK REF="REF-Ware-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ware 1998</LINK>). None of the four trials used this questionnaire to assess the quality of life among participants with pain, and only one trial evaluated aspects of quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>). Future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should monitor long-term quality of life regularly, which could allow better evaluation of the efficacy of corticosteroids. Regular monitoring of participants' quality of life would improve understanding of the natural progression of PHN with respect to its impact on the physical, emotional and social well-being of those affected.</P>
<P>No trial has incorporated cost-effectiveness calculations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Future trials</HEADING>
<P>The meta-analysis of two small studies (<LINK REF="STD-Eaglstein-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Eaglstein 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Esmann-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Esmann 1987</LINK>) and the analysis of another two large studies (<LINK REF="STD-Wood-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Wood 1994a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitley-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Whitley 1996</LINK>) showed that corticosteroids did not reduce pain at six months after the onset of the acute rash more than the control group. However, the results of the Wood and Whitley studies suggested that corticosteroids may reduce the acute pain in herpes zoster and may improve quality of life.</P>
<P>The relationship between acute inflammation, pain and PHN is complicated. The effect of corticosteroids is not clear at different stages in the transition from acute pain to PHN. Dworkin et al have recommended the use of systemic corticosteroids as soon as possible after diagnosis of herpes zoster for people with at least moderately severe pain and no contraindications, and that these should be initiated only in combination with antiviral therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2007</LINK>). However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion and the evidence for the effect of corticosteroids on preventing PHN at six months would not support this recommendation. Trials addressing short-term pain relief with corticosteroids are lacking. If they were performed they should also include a long-term follow-up to assess the transition from short-term to long-term pain. Further high quality RCTs using validated and generally accepted outcome measures should be considered for both short and long-term pain prevention and treatment in PHN. In a condition where the natural course is spontaneous recovery in the majority of cases, the number of participants has to be large enough to give the study the power to detect clinically relevant improvements.</P>
