<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-10-11 18:26:16 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Viral infection occasionally triggers myocarditis (inflammation and necrosis of the heart muscle) which can result in serious, acute heart failure. The first signs of this condition may be flu-like symptoms which evolve into non-specific chest discomfort, shortness of breath or palpitations. The majority of patients recover spontaneously but others have continuing heart problems which require medication and can be severe enough to cause death.</P>
<P>The effect of hormone treatment on viral myocarditis remains controversial. The review authors conducted a thorough search of the medical literature. Eight randomised trials with 719 patients which met the inclusion criteria compared hormone treatment plus conventional therapy with no hormone. Hormone treatment did not reduce mortality from viral myocarditis. Improvements in heart function were found but the trials were of low quality and small size so this finding must be regarded as uncertain. Further trials comparing hormone treatment in people suffering viral myocarditis with placebo are warranted. There are no conflicts of interest in the review.<BR/>

<P>Myocarditis is defined as inflammation of the myocardium accompanied by myocellular necrosis. Experimental evidence suggests that autoimmune mechanisms follow viral infection, resulting in inflammation and necrosis in the myocardium.

<P>Eight RCTs (with 719 participants) were included in this update. The trials were small in size and methodological quality was poor. Viral detection was performed in 38% of participants, among whom 56% had positive results. Mortality between corticosteroids and control groups was non-significant (RR, 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24). At 1 to 3 months follow-up, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was higher in the corticosteroids group compared to the control group (MD 7.36%, 95% CI 4.94 to 9.79), but there was substantial heterogeneity. Benefits were observed in LVEF in two trials with 200 children given corticosteroids (MD 9.00%, 95% CI 7.48 to 10.52). New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and left ventricular end-stage systole diameter (LVESD) were not affected. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (MD -104.00 U/L, 95% CI -115.18 to -92.82), Isoenzyme of creatine phosphate MB (CKMB) (MD 10.35 U/L, 95% CI 8.92 to 11.78), were reduced in the corticosteroids group compared to the control group, although the evidence is limited to small participant numbers. There were insufficient data on adverse events.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the condition</HEADING>
<P>Myocarditis is defined as inflammation of the myocardium accompanied by myocellular necrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Batra-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Batra 2001</LINK>). Myocarditis is always associated with virus infection (<LINK REF="REF-Calderaro-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calderaro 2010</LINK>). Viral myocarditis is a multiple phases disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2003</LINK>). It is a potentially devastating disease that results from viral infection and T cell-mediated autoimmune disease (<LINK REF="REF-Metzger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Metzger 2011</LINK>). At the end-stage of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy usually develops (<LINK REF="REF-Simon-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simon 2008</LINK>). Even in people diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, viral infection and inflammation were found in their myocardium (<LINK REF="REF-Baughman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baughman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orinius-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orinius 1968</LINK>). Although immunosuppressive medicines including corticosteroids were applied in many studies, their effects remain controversial.</P>
<P>There are several underlying causes of myocarditis. Among them, viral myocarditis is the result of viral infection that can lead to substantial cardiac damage and severe acute heart failure (<LINK REF="REF-Kearney-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kearney 2001</LINK>). It appears that viruses may induce myocarditis in genetically susceptible individuals, and that children are more likely to suffer this condition. More than 27 viruses can cause viral myocarditis, including Coxsackie viruses group A and B, Echo, human immunodeficiency virus 1(HIV-1), influenza virus and hepatitis A and C viruses (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2013</LINK>). The majority of patients recover spontaneously, but those with persistent ventricular dysfunction face a 20% one-year mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Liu-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 1996</LINK>). Viral myocarditis also significantly increases the mortality rate of cardiac transplantation after dilated cardiomyopathy in children (<LINK REF="REF-Pietra-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pietra 2012</LINK>). In recent years, virus-associated diseases have become more complex: for example, the Pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1), which had worldwide implications and its associated high mortality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Adedayo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adedayo 2011</LINK>). Fulminant myocarditis was reported to be correlated with the influenza A virus or HIV (<LINK REF="REF-Cabral-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabral 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magula-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magula 2003</LINK>). H1N1 influenza would make myocarditis more common in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Kandolf-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kandolf 2011</LINK>), and viral myocarditis induced by H1N1 virus could possibly cause more serious results (<LINK REF="REF-Gdynia-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gdynia 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haessler-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haessler 2011</LINK>). A national survey performed in Japan discovered an incidence rate of 60% among people infected with the H1N1 virus in 2009, while the morbidity and mortality reached as high as 28% (<LINK REF="REF-Ukimura-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ukimura 2012</LINK>). Very recently, H7N9 virus was also detected in China, which was said to cause severe viral myocarditis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These challenges requires further research of the most effective treatment for viral myocarditis.</P>
<P>In the previous version of our review, 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were initially selected but had to be excluded (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2006</LINK>). One of the controversies was the diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis. The Dallas criteria (defined in Dallas city in the USA in 1986) were internationally accepted for the diagnosis of viral myocarditis, and relied on endocardial biopsy (<LINK REF="REF-Angelini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angelini 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uemura-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uemura 2001</LINK>). However, recent evidence weakens the Dallas criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the Dallas criteria depend on the site of the biopsy. Variable viruses could cause different presentations. In addition, experts' views on diagnosing myocarditis in some biopsies were not always consistent. (<LINK REF="REF-Mahrholdt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahrholdt 2004</LINK>) and did not identify patients suffering myocarditis who responded to immune modulation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2003</LINK>). Doubts about their applicability were therefore raised in recent years (<LINK REF="REF-Baughman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baughman 2006</LINK>). On the other hand, endocardial biopsy would be considered ethically debatable in some countries. Comprehensive diagnostic criteria would be needed to promote clinical practice. For those countries with limited medical resources, the classification of myocardiopathy by the World Health Organization/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHO/ISFC) in 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-McKenna-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenna 1996</LINK>), or similar criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Ma-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 1999</LINK>), provide comprehensive considerations with clinical presentations and requisite laboratory examinations for diagnosis. The disadvantage of these criteria is that they lack any pathological standard.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Description of the intervention</HEADING>
<P>Direct viral response and excessive immune response are two causes of myocardial damage in viral myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2011</LINK>). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is considered useful for controlling virus infection, and for reducing the prevalence of virus-associated cardiomyopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Barbaro-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbaro 2011</LINK>). A recent review has also suggested that virus infection involves the evolution of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Immune clearance of the virus could also improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Andreoletti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreoletti 2009</LINK>). Prednisone, combined with azathioprine, is usually observed to improve histological abnormalities and ejection fraction (EF) in some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Salvi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2009</LINK>). This evidence has contributed to the rationale for the application of corticosteroids for viral myocarditis.쟄owever, these medicines are unavailable in developing countries. According to the results of recent research, immuno-proteasome (IP) deficiency was positively related to severe myocardial tissue damage in viral myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Opitz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opitz 2011</LINK>). Corticosteroids have long been applied as an immunosuppressive agent. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids might enhance the capacity of macrophage type 2, so as to suppress T lymphocyte-mediated interferon-&#612; (IFN-&#612;) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) production, which provides the rationale for the application of corticosteroids to treat viral myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Kraaij-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraaij 2011</LINK>). Corticosteroids have therefore been proposed to be immunosuppressive. Immunological suppression therapeutics based on corticosteroids differ between countries. Many English-language studies applied prednisolone 2.5 mg/kg a day for one week for children, then slowly reduced the dosage (<LINK REF="STD-Camargo-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Camargo 1995</LINK>). For adults, prednisolone was prescribed at 1.25 mg/kg a day for two to four weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Latham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 1989</LINK>), or with oral azathioprine or cyclosporine (<LINK REF="STD-Maisch-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Maisch 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 1995</LINK>). In China, dexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg a day was venously injected for one week for children, then switched to oral administration and slow reduction of the dosage. For adults, dexamethasone 10 ~ 30 mg a day was venously injected for one to six weeks (in most research for one week), and then switched to oral administration and reduction of the dosage in accordance with the patient's condition (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Why it is important to do the review</HEADING>
<P>The criteria that we used for RCTs of virus-induced myocarditis in the previous version of this review were too strict, leading to none being located (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2006</LINK>). In the RCTs excluded in the previous review, only few patients were examined for evidence of virus using varying methods. The belief that viral infection is the main cause of myocarditis and DCM was based on animal experimental results (<LINK REF="REF-Garg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garg 1998</LINK>), and was restated recently (<LINK REF="REF-Shauer-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shauer 2013</LINK>). For this updated review, we have therefore re-selected and included RCTs of myocarditis which was definitely or possibly caused by a virus in order to evaluate the effect and safety of corticosteroids on viral myocarditis, using different diagnostic criteria.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Key findings</HEADING>
<P>A total of eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 719 myocarditis patients, were included in our updated review. The trials were small and of poor quality. Overall mortality was 37.7%; and mortality was not reduced with corticosteroids either for children or for adults. Corticosteroids may improve cardiac function (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) but there was no effect on NYHA class, which classifies cardiac function in clinical practice. Left Ventricular End - Diastolic Diameter seemed to be improved by using corticosteroid, but this result came from combination of four RCTs with significant heterogeneity. From the results of this review, we conclude that corticosteroids may improve LVEF for people with viral myocarditis, either in adults or children, but they have no effects on improving cardiac diastolic function, or reducing mortality. It is important to treat this result with caution since the trials were small, of poor quality and with moderate to significant heterogeneity in the beneficial effects.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-10-05 07:50:17 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Viral detection was performed in 38% of participants included in the review, among whom 56% had virus-positive results. The prevalence of virus-associated myocarditis was very similar to that reported in a previous study (<LINK REF="REF-Andreoletti-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreoletti 2009</LINK>). However, the prevalence of myocarditis is reported to be high in some countries, and low in others. This difference may be attributable to variations in diagnostic criteria between countries (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the previous version of this review, we identified 10 RCTs, but excluded all of them, either for failure to meet a strict diagnostic criterion, or because of confounding of corticosteroids with concomitant treatment with Chinese traditional medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2006</LINK>). In this updated review, diagnosis of viral detection was extended beyond the Dallas criteria, and RCTs without virus-negative evidence are now included. We therefore re-selected and combined data from eight RCTs, but they are of low quality.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids are not recommended for most conditions (<LINK REF="REF-McNamara-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNamara 2002</LINK>). For people with myocarditis where a virus is detected, corticosteroids may have a detrimental effect, while those without virus detection may benefit from the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2005</LINK>). Viruses may cause severe sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Zahariadis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahariadis 2003</LINK>) and may aggravate the clinical outcomes of sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Heininger-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heininger 2011;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Kalil-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalil 2011</LINK>). Sepsis induced by a virus is similar to that caused by bacteria, but the risks of virus are often underestimated. Toll-like receptor 3 and NF-kB transcription factor play an important role in virus-associated sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Zahariadis-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zahariadis 2003</LINK>). Viral myocarditis could possibly be one form of virus-associated sepsis, even though the inflammation of the myocardium was more severe than in other tissues. For people with severe sepsis, or even septic shock, hydrocortisone at doses as low as 200 to 300 mg per day could improve the clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Sprung-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprung 2011</LINK>). Corticosteroids could increase circulating cortisol levels and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, and thereby balance the inflammatory response (<LINK REF="REF-Salluh-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salluh 2010</LINK>). There is therefore a plausible basis for the use of low doses of corticosteroids for viral myocarditis. But the best regimens remains unclear.</P>
<P>Only one RCT reported adverse events, in which renal injury seemed to be severe, but other immunosuppressive medicines were combined with corticosteroids and may have confounded this finding. In some non-RCTs, hirsutism and Cushing's syndrome were commonly observed (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gagliardi-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gagliardi 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Salvi-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salvi 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vester-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vester 1997</LINK>).

Corticosteroids may cause many other adverse events, although they were not observed or reported in the studies included in this review. For example, myocarditis can be induced by steroids (<LINK REF="REF-Fukae-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fukae 2000</LINK>). Severe soft tissue infection and adrenal insufficiency have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Hosenpud-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosenpud 1985</LINK>). Another risk of corticosteroids is hip avascular necrosis. It is reported that about 90% of atraumatic hip avasculars necrosis is attributed to corticosteroids therapy or to excess alcohol consumption (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 2009</LINK>). Corticosteroids could induce hip avasculars necrosis by regulating genes expression (<LINK REF="REF-Tong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tong 2011</LINK>). However, no hip avascular necrosis was observed in the studies covered by this review.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 16:58:59 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall quality of the included studies was poor. Two RCTs stated they used block randomisation tables to allocate their participants (<LINK REF="STD-Latham-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Latham 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 1995</LINK>), while the other trials did not report any details of randomisation. The type of medicines varied: corticosteroids included prednisolone, prednisone, and dexamethasone. Other combination interventions were variously used among the RCTs, which could compromise the results of these studies. Furthermore, data on adverse events was generally not reported and could not be quantified.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-09-25 17:01:44 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are few systematic reviews studying corticosteroids for viral myocarditis. A 2004 review concluded that corticosteroids had no effects on improving the prognosis of acute myocarditis (<LINK REF="REF-Hia-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hia 2004</LINK>). However, this review included only one RCT. In 2006, we undertook our systematic review to assess the effects of corticosteroids on viral myocarditis. Our selection criteria were strict, eliminating any RCTs that could be included. In a recent study of participants with myocarditis which excluded those with positive detection of virus, immunosuppressive therapy included prednisone 1 mg/kg daily for four weeks followed by 0.33 mg/kg daily for five months, and azathioprine 2 mg/kg daily for six months (<LINK REF="STD-Frustaci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frustaci 2009</LINK>). In a retrospective case series, participants who were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and where the virus was detected, were treated with interferon beta 1b, and those with inflammation and no detectable virus were treated with prednisolone (<LINK REF="REF-Zimmermann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zimmermann 2005</LINK>). These results confirm the conclusions from the ESETCID study (<LINK REF="STD-ESETCID-2000" TYPE="STUDY">ESETCID 2000</LINK>). Corticosteroids may have a role in treating myocarditis without viral evidence. However, although the virus could not be detected in cardiac tissue, viral myocarditis could not be excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Frustaci-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Frustaci 2009</LINK>). It therefore remains difficult to evaluate the effects of corticosteroid on viral myocarditis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-09-25 17:03:24 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For people diagnosed with viral myocarditis and low left ventricular ejection fraction, corticosteroids do not reduce mortality. Cardiac function may be improved by applying corticosteroids, but this needs to be interpreted with caution since the evidence is based on small-scale trials of poor methodological quality.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-09-25 21:22:06 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are warranted in people suffering viral myocarditis, comparing corticosteroids with placebo. It is important to clarify and standardise diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis, and to design high-quality RCTs with sufficient statistical power. As well as mortality, patient-related outcomes, such as NYHA class or quality of life, should be evaluated. Different types and dosages of corticosteroids should be compared, to determine the best therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, adverse events of steroids should be carefully observed and reported in the studies.</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2013-10-11 18:43:55 +0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In the previous version of this review, we identified 10 RCTs, but excluded all of them, either for failure to meet a strict diagnostic criterion, or because of confounding of corticosteroids with concomitant treatment with Chinese traditional medicines (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2006</LINK>). In this updated review, diagnosis of viral detection was extended beyond the Dallas criteria, and RCTs without virus-negative evidence are now included. We therefore re-selected and combined data from eight RCTs, but they are of low quality.</P>
