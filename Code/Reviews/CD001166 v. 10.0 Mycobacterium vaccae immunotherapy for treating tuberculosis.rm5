<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>No benefit from immunotherapy with <I>Mycobacterium vaccae </I>in people with tuberculosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Injections that aim to influence a person's immune system have been used by doctors to lessen the chance of a person developing a disease, or sometimes to reduce the damage the disease does to the body. <I>M. vaccae</I> is a type of bacterium related to the one that causes tuberculosis. Scientists have wondered if injections of this could reduce the damage done to someone when they are infected with tuberculosis, and some early trials suggested this might be true. However, this overview involving eight trials identified that the research does not show any consistent effect of this injection on death or the course of tuberculosis illness. It may be that the early trials had methodological problems that led to false optimism about this intervention.</P>

Most immunotherapy recipients experienced local adverse reactions (RR 18.82, 95% CI 5.47 to 64.77; 131 participants, 2 trials), some of which progressed to ulceration and scarring.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-25 20:59:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Immunotherapy aims to alter a person's immune response with the intention of reducing illness either by protecting against it or reducing the severity of the condition (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1997</LINK>). Allergen immunotherapy, for example, aims to reduce a person's sensitivity to an allergen that causes allergic symptoms, such as asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2000</LINK>) or allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Bousquet-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bousquet 1998</LINK>). Venom immunotherapy is used to modify the response to venoms, such as those of bees or wasps, for people who have severe reactions following prior exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Ewan-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ewan 1998</LINK>). Immunotherapy for a wide range of infectious agents has been tested, including chronic viral infections, chronic bacterial infections, and parasitic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Convit-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Convit 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Straus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Straus 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In tuberculosis, the host immune response influences the damage caused by the infection (<LINK REF="REF-Rook-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rook 1996</LINK>). Experiments in animals suggest that a type 1 lymphocyte response is less likely to be associated with death of local tissues than a mixed lymphocyte response that includes both type 1 and type 2 responses (<LINK REF="REF-Grange-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grange 1998</LINK>). A person's immunity to tuberculosis is thought in part to be related to a type 1 response, characterized by production of interferon-gamma (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Mycobacterium vaccae</I> is a rapid-growing mycobacterium species found in the environment. The use of this bacterium as a whole-cell killed vaccine has been advocated as immunotherapy for tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1994</LINK>). Although the mechanisms of its potential effect are unknown, it has been proposed that immunotherapy allows immune recognition of antigens common to all mycobacteria or that immunotherapy directs T-lymphocyte responses towards a type 1 pattern. There is some indirect experimental evidence that this occurs in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Rook-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rook 1994</LINK>). More recently, the reduction of allergic responses through induction of regulatory T cells by immunization with <I>M. vaccae</I> has been demonstrated (<LINK REF="REF-Zuany_x002d_Amorim-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zuany-Amorim 2002</LINK>). Immunotherapy is thought to enable the host to destroy organisms and achieve a more rapid cure of infection.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We attempted to identify all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress). We used the following search terms for all trial registers and databases: tuberculosis and vaccae. </P>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (October 2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (published in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2002, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), and LILACS (September 2002). </P>
<P>We contacted organizations and individuals working in the field for information regarding unpublished data and work in progress. We also drew on existing reviews of this topic (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1994</LINK>) and checked the citations of all the trials identified by the above methods.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-25 21:22:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first author screened the full articles of potentially relevant studies for eligibility. In cases of doubt, both authors reviewed the papers and reached a consensus decision. Both authors assessed the risk of bias in the trials, and the second author checked data extraction. We assessed the risk of bias in relation to the method of generation of allocation sequence and allocation concealment (adequate, inadequate, or unclear as defined by <LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>), the use of blinding, and losses to follow up.</P>
<P>Data were extracted for outcome variables and entered and analysed in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5</LINK>. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD) with the same CI. Sensitivity analysis of effect estimates were performed on the adequacy of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>In trials that recruited people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-positive) and people not infected (HIV-negative), we would have stratified the analyses by HIV status had the data been available. This is because the number of deaths in the HIV-positive group would be likely to be higher than in the HIV-negative group and imbalance in numbers could confound the results. We combined the results if no difference was evident visibly in the analyses or statistically.</P>

<P>Eight trials met the inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>') and 11 trials were excluded for reasons including that they were of poor quality, abstracts with little information, or trials that had been carried out and no data were available (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'). The included trials were conducted in China (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999</LINK>), Kuwait (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1990a</LINK>), Romania (<LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>), South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>), Uganda (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), and the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Kon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kon 1998</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK> was conducted in Malawi and Zambia. The trials enrolled 2140 adults, of whom slightly more than 60% were males. Participants ranged from 15 to 80 years in age. Two trials enrolled HIV-positive participants (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In all but two of the trials the participants were undergoing treatment for a first episode of pulmonary tuberculosis. The exceptions were one trial that enrolled people with recurrent disease (<LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>) and another that did not state whether participants were receiving retreatment (<LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>). BCG scars were present in 49% and 83% of patients from Uganda and South Africa, respectively, and in 38% of control patients from the trial in Kuwait.</P>
<P>The participants were all on standard chemotherapeutic regimens, as routinely prescribed in the country where the trial was being conducted. <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK> used an eight-month regimen, <LINK REF="STD-Stanford-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 1990</LINK> used a nine-month regimen, and the other six trials used six-month regimens. All but <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK> used rifampicin and isoniazid in the continuation phase, which lasted four to seven months. Differences between the trials mainly involved the drugs used for the initial eight weeks.</P>
<P>Chemotherapy was given on an inpatient basis for two to four months in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Stanford-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Stanford 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>) and in the Malawian participants in another (<LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>).

One trial reported that participants received 25 mg of pyridoxine daily (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Immunotherapy was generally a single dose of 10<SUP>9</SUP> heat-killed organisms. Five trials reported the strain used (NCTC 11659). Immunotherapy was given on day eight of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), between days seven and 14 (<LINK REF="STD-Kon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kon 1998</LINK>), in the first two weeks of antituberculous chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>), or day 28/one month in three trials (<LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>). One trial administered 0.1 mg of the vaccine product (equivalent number of organisms not stated) in sterile water at the end of week two of chemotherapy, and at week four increased to 0.5 mg every two weeks for an unstated duration (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999</LINK>).</P>

<P>Four trials assessed the number of deaths to the completion of chemotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>) and, when combined, did not demonstrate a difference between the immunotherapy and placebo groups (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.42; 1741 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis that only included trials with adequate allocation concealment did not change this finding (analysis not shown).</P>
<P>Three trials measured the number of participants whose sputum smear converted to negative at two months (<LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 1999</LINK>). More conversions occurred in the immunotherapy group (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.43; 356 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). No sensitivity analysis was possible as these trials all had unclear allocation concealment.</P>
<P>The number of participants who were sputum culture negative at two months was examined in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>). The forest plot suggests heterogeneity (chi-square 10.55, P = 0.03, 1441 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). The analysis of trials with adequate allocation concealment was not statistically significant (1136 participants, 3 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>). When measured at completion of chemotherapy, no statistically significant difference was apparent (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.06; 1490 participants, 5 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

There were fewer with cavities at trial entry in the placebo group (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.27; 447 participants, 3 trials), but no significant difference was detected between the groups for the number of cavities seen at completion of chemotherapy (240 participants, 2 trials) or at six months after completing chemotherapy (226 participants, 2 trials).</P>
<P>The combined results of two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>, also found no significant differences in x-ray scores at entry to the trial (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), as defined by the trial authors (307 participants, 2 trials). The scores tended to improve in the treatment group at completion of treatment and at six months after treatment had ended, and were significant in <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>. Neither trial reported on methods to blind the radiographic assessors to the treatment group.</P>
<P>The <I>M. vaccae</I> immunotherapy group was associated with a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the end of chemotherapy compared with the placebo group (WMD 8.96 mm/h, 95% CI 12.95 to 4.97; 299 participants, 2 trials, <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Weight gain was measured in five trials. <LINK REF="REF-Stanford-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanford 1990a</LINK> reported a mean difference of 1.60 kg in weight from the start to end of treatment in the <I>M. vaccae</I> group (95% CI 0.41 to 2.79; 112 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK> and reported no difference, but no standard deviation was given. <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK> reported greater weight gain in the intervention group, but no statistical test or standard deviation was given; however, in these two trials, weight at the completion of treatment did suggest higher mean weight in the <I>M. vaccae</I> group (WMD 2.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.78; 299 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Local adverse reactions were reported in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kon-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kon 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>); see <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>. They were more common overall in immunotherapy recipients (RR 18.82, 95% CI 5.47 to 64.77; 131 participants, 2 trials). Swelling and redness were significantly more common in recipients of immunotherapy (RR 10.71, 95% CI 6.81 to 16.85; 374 participants, 1 trial), as was ulceration (RR 17.79, 95% CI 5.05 to 62.70; 505 participants, 3 trials). Immunotherapy also resulted in more reports of scarring in the two trials that contained events (RR 10.33, 95% CI 6.61 to 16.13; 706 participants).</P>
<P>One trial, <LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>, systematically monitored serious adverse events and did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the groups for any systemic adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.62; 385 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Three of the eight included trials had adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>). Of these three trials, no impact was demonstrated on death, sputum culture at three months, and sputum culture at completion of treatment; nor was there any trend with these outcomes. Overall, the analysis showed no consistent evidence of a benefit of immunotherapy over placebo for people with pulmonary tuberculosis receiving antituberculous chemotherapy, nor has an effect of immunotherapy on mortality been demonstrated. </P>
<P>Two of the trials, <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997a" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Corlan-1997b" TYPE="STUDY">Corlan 1997b</LINK>, did not assess adherence to prescribed chemotherapy. Also, participants found to have resistance to prescribed agents may not have received a second-line drug because of the lack of availability of these agents in Romania at the time the trials were conducted. The number of participants in each group requiring a change in therapy because of resistance to prescribed agents was not disclosed. These factors may have influenced the effect of drug therapy on the course of the illness, making drug treatment a source of potential bias in the outcome of these trials. </P>
<P>Overall, the earlier trials were small and had methodological weaknesses around allocation concealment, blinding, and accuracy of reporting losses to follow up. In these trials, some benefits with some outcomes were apparent. The recent rigorous trials from South Africa (<LINK REF="STD-DITG-1999" TYPE="STUDY">DITG 1999</LINK>), Uganda (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2000</LINK>), and Malawi and Zambia (<LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 2002</LINK>) have consistently shown no effect of this intervention.</P>
<P>There is no evidence that immunotherapy recipients, including those with HIV infection, had a greater rate of serious adverse events recorded in the same trial. No trials have as yet reported on important outcomes such as the effect of immunotherapy on HIV disease progression, although the impact of tuberculosis itself on survival was clearly demonstrated in the Zambian trial by the 10-fold difference in mortality rate over the trial period between those infected with HIV and those without.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>
<I>M. vaccae</I> immunotherapy does not benefit people with tuberculosis.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The results of this systematic review underline the importance of carefully planned and executed randomized controlled trials, with strict adherence to concealment of allocation. </P>
<P>No further trials are warranted and, as a result, the authors do not intend to update this review.</P>
