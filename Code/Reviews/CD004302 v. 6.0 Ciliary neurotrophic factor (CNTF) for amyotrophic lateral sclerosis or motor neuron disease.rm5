<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-04 15:21:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or motor neuron disease (MND) is a fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness that results in paralysis. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been shown to slow disease progression and improve muscle strength in an animal model of MND, through survival-promoting effects on motor neurons. Ciliary neurotrophic factor treatment did not show any significant effect on the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and side effects were observed at high concentrations.The review found only two eligible trials with a total of 1300 participants; the risk of bias was low for one trial but was unclear for the other trial; they did not show any significant effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor on progression of ALS or MND in man. On the other hand, several adverse effects were observed after treatment with ciliary neurotrophic factor. An updated search was performed in April 2011, but no new studies were found.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-08-24 18:16:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease (MND), is a fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness that results in paralysis. It occurs in about one to three people per 100,000 population per year; its prevalence is about five to nine per 100,000. ALS targets the motor neurons responsible for transmitting impulses to the voluntary muscles. Without muscle stimulation by electrical impulses the muscles lose strength and atrophy. Upper motor neurons in the brain send impulses to lower motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, which in turn send impulses through nerve processes to the muscles; both types of motor neurons are affected in ALS or MND. Symptoms of upper motor neuron damage include stiffness (spasticity) and repetitive muscle contractions (clonus). Symptoms of lower motor neuron damage include muscle weakness, muscle twitching (fasciculation) and muscle shrinking (atrophy).</P>
<P>The hypothesis that neuronal degeneration is caused by a lack of trophic factors (namely molecules that support cell survival and promote cell differentiation) that are specific to motor neurons is old but it could not be tested until recently (see <LINK REF="REF-Sendtner-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sendtner 2000</LINK> for review). Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have emerged as prominent motor neuron trophic factors; both show remarkable survival-promoting effects on motor neurons in cell cultures, embryos and adult animals (<LINK REF="REF-Arakawa-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arakawa 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kishino-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kishino 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oppenheim-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oppenheim 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sendtner-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sendtner 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sendtner-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sendtner 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yan 1992</LINK>). In particular, CNTF has been shown to retard disease progression and improve muscle strength in the wobbler mouse model of MND (<LINK REF="REF-Mitsumoto-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsumoto 1994b</LINK>). Subcutaneous injection of CNTF and BDNF on alternate days arrested disease progression in wobbler mice for one month (<LINK REF="REF-Mitsumoto-1994a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitsumoto 1994a</LINK>). Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) have also been reported as having beneficial effects on injured or diseased motor neurons in animal models (<LINK REF="REF-Giehl-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giehl 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hantai-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hantai 1995</LINK>). Investigations with neurotrophic factors have rapidly progressed to clinical studies (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aebischer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aebischer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BDNF-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">BDNF 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Borasio-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borasio 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lai-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lai 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miller-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ochs-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ochs 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mitchell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mitchell 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phase I and II trials indicated that in people with ALS or MND subcutaneous doses of human CNTF up to 5 &#956;g/kg were generally well tolerated (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>), whereas higher concentrations were not (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995b</LINK>). Delivery of human CNTF should directly expose motor neurons to the neurotrophic factor, while avoiding side effects related to its peripheral administration. This can be achieved by transplanting immunoprotected xenogeneic cell lines genetically engineered to release human CNTF (<LINK REF="REF-Aebischer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aebischer 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sagot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagot 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The efficacy and safety of cell transplantation was first demonstrated in rodents (<LINK REF="REF-Sagot-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sagot 1995</LINK>). A device containing baby hamster kidney cells that released CNTF was implanted in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord in 12 patients (<LINK REF="REF-Aebischer-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aebischer 1996</LINK>). According to the protocol the implants were retrieved after three months and replaced by a second capsule. Viable cells and human CNTF secretion were observed in all retrieved implants. No limiting adverse effects were observed in any of the implanted patients. Human CNTF was undetectable before implantation but detectable levels of CNTF were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid up to 20 weeks after transplantation. The biological results demonstrate that neurotrophic factors can be delivered to the central nervous system through transplantation of encapsulated, genetically-modified cells. The small number of patients, however, did not allow the assessment of a potential slowing of the degeneration process. Phase III of this trial has not been published.</P>

<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (19 April 2011) using the following search terms: 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis' or its synonyms 'Charcot's disease', 'motor neuron disease', 'motor neurone disease', 'motoneuron disease', 'Lou Gehrig's disease' and 'ciliary neurotrophic factor' or 'CNTF' and 'nerve growth factor'. We adapted this strategy to search the following databases: CENTRAL (2011, issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2011). We contacted the authors of identified studies to obtain additional unpublished results or clinical trials.

<P>The number of papers retrieved by the current strategies in this review are: MEDLINE 115 (57 new papers); EMBASE 185 (16 new papers); Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register 25 (3 new papers) and CENTRAL 13. The searches identified five clinical trials of CNTF treatment for ALS, also known as MND, and no new trials were identified for this update. We excluded three trials, because the treatment period was shorter than six months (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995b" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996a" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996a</LINK>, see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>). Only two clinical trials met the selection criteria (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>, see table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>In these two trials, a total population of 1,300 ALS or MND patients was enrolled. In both trials different concentrations of CNTF were used. In the first study (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>) there were three treatment arms: 15 &#956;g/kg rhCNTF, 30 &#956;g/kg rhCNTF and placebo. In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) there were four subgroups: 0.5, 2, and 5 &#956;g/kg/day rhCNTF and placebo. For this reason we had 914 treated patients but only 386 control patients. Both trials compared subcutaneous injections of rhCNTF with placebo. In the first trial (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>) the study drug was administered three times a week. In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) participants received daily injections of CNTF or placebo but at lower concentrations than in the first study (<I>see</I> table <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome measure: survival during the study period</HEADING>
<P>Our primary outcome measure was survival after six and 12 months, as stated in our protocol. Data on survival were published in both trials but they represented a secondary outcome. Moreover, data were available only at the end of the trial: at seven months (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) and at nine months (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>). For this reason, we modified the primary outcome and considered death at any time during the entire study. We considered intubation and tracheostomy as a surrogate of death, but in both trials it was not specified if death data included those of tracheostomy or intubation, or both.</P>
<P>Of 914 patients treated with CNTF, 141 died during the study compared with 60 of 386 patients treated with placebo. Differences between CNTF and placebo groups were not significant: RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.41) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> , and <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK> for deaths). Only the group of patients treated with CNTF 5 &#956;g/kg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) showed a significantly higher mortality as compared to patients treated with placebo.</P>

<P>For one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) data were not available after three months (the time point specified in our protocol) but was available at the end of the study (seven months). In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>) data were available after one, two, four, six, eight and nine months of treatment. For this reason, we compared muscle strength at the end of the treatment. Data were expressed as change from baseline value of isometric muscle strength (combination megascore). In both trials no significant differences were observed between treatment and control groups. The MD of both trials was -0.04 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.03) in favour of the placebo group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, and <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).</P>

Consequently, we compared respiratory function at the end of the study. Data were expressed as change from baseline measures of forced vital capacity as a percentage of the predicted value (FVC %). No significant differences were observed between the CNTF and placebo groups with any CNTF concentration. When the results of the two trials were combined, the MD was 0.96 in favour of the CNTF group (95% CI -1.65 to 3.58) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> and <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>

<P>This outcome was published by both trials but different scales were used. In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) it was measured as change in Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scores. At the end of the study (seven months) the MD was -0.74 of a grade in favour of the placebo group (95% CI -2.50 to 1.02), which was not significant (see<I> </I>

In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>) changes in functionality were included in the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) results. Data were reported as slopes of disease outcome measures (30 &#956;g/kg: -0.27, SD ±0.42; 15 &#956;g/kg: -0.22, SD ± 0.37; placebo: 0.22, SD <U>+</U>0.25). No significant differences were noted at the end of the study between 30 &#956;g/kg and placebo (P = 0.85) or between any CNTF dose (pooled 15 and 30 &#956;g/kg) and placebo (P = 0 .99).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-09 22:01:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only two trials of CNTF treatment for ALS, also known as MND, were found that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. They were both multicentre studies, with a large number of participants (730 in <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>, 570 in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>). Thus they almost contributed an equal weight to the analysis for this review. The methodological quality of <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK> study was considered adequate, whereas lack of information, despite attempts to contact the author, limited the assessment of the quality of the <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK> study, which was judged unclear. Each study included different CNTF-treated groups (0.5 &#956;g/kg, 2 &#956;g/kg or 5 &#956;g/kg CNTF in <LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>; 15 &#956;g/kg or 30 &#956;g/kg CNTF in <LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1996" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1996</LINK>); data were examined either separately for each dose or combined. The analysis of these trials revealed a defect in outcome measures in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>): outcome data were available for this trial only at the end of the study (six months of treatment plus one more month) and not after three months, as expected from the protocol. For this reason, we analysed outcome measures at the end of the study for both trials, even though the other study reported the required data. In the absence of any significant effect of CNTF this change should not have influenced the results. Please see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK> for details.</P>
<P>Data showed that subcutaneous administration of CNTF at different concentrations did not alter the progression of ALS or MND compared with placebo. Outcomes published in these two trials were very similar even though CNTF concentrations were different. Administration of CNTF was associated with several adverse events that were more frequent in groups treated with the higher concentrations. Moreover, in the group treated with 5 &#956;g/kg CNTF (<LINK REF="STD-Miller-1996b" TYPE="STUDY">Miller 1996b</LINK>) there was a significant increase in the number of deaths.</P>
<P>It has been demonstrated in different rodent models of ALS or MND that CNTF reduced motor neuron cell death. The two studies examined in this review did not show significant effects of CNTF in any outcome measures we considered. There are some explanations for the lack of effectiveness of CNTF. First of all, CNTF doses may be too low. It has been observed that only doses of 30 &#956;g/kg produced plasma CNTF levels which may potentiate motor neuron survival in vivo. Moreover, patients treated with CNTF developed anti-CNTF antibodies, which may decrease both the negative and positive effects of the neurotrophic factor. The increased incidence of adverse events can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that CNTF is able to activate receptors for interleukin-6 (IL-6), which in turn activate the acute phase response (<LINK REF="STD-ACTS-Group-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">ACTS Group 1995a</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Ciliary neurotrophic factor when administered subcutaneously had no effect on ALS or MND progression. At high concentrations, several side effects were observed.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Ciliary neurotrophic factor in combination with other neurotrophic factors should be tested, as suggested by results on animal models. More efficient delivery methods, such as implantation of cells genetically engineered to produce CNTF and other neurotrophic factors, should be developed. In addition, future trials should standardize outcome measures, in particular with regard to quality of life scales.</P>
