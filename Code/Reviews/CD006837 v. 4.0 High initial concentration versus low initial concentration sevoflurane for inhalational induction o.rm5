<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials comparing high initial concentrations of sevoflurane with low initial concentrations to see whether the evidence supports use of high initial concentrations to reduce induction times and complications for inhalational induction of anaesthesia. This update of a review first published in 2013 is current to February 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>General anaesthesia for surgery can be induced by having patients breathe a mixture of sevoflurane (a sweet-smelling inhaled anaesthetic vapour or drug) and oxygen through a mask. This technique has been reported to be safe, reliable and well accepted by patients. The initial concentration of sevoflurane used for induction can be low or high. The low initial concentration technique involves administering a low concentration of sevoflurane (less than 4%), then gradually increasing the concentration until the patient is anaesthetized. The high initial concentration technique involves administering high concentrations of sevoflurane (from 4% to 8%) from the beginning, then continuing until the patient is anaesthetized. Immediately following loss of consciousness and before anaesthesia is deep enough to allow surgery, patients can go through a stage where they cough, their breathing and heart rate become irregular and they may hold their breath and make uncontrolled movements. A high concentration might shorten this stage.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We included in our review 11 randomized controlled trials (829 participants). These trials were conducted between 1997 and 2014 and differed with regard to participants (adults vs children), concentrations of sevoflurane used, addition of nitrous oxide and opioids and other factors. Some elements of the methods suggested low-quality evidence would be obtained. The studies could not always be combined, and study results cannot be stated with certainty.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The high initial concentration technique shortened induction time (six studies, 443 participants, low-quality evidence) and led to similar rates of cough (eight studies, 589 participants, low-quality evidence), sudden sustained closure of the vocal cords that prevented breathing (seven studies, 588 participants, low-quality evidence), breath holding (five studies, 389 participants, low-quality evidence), sudden movements (five studies, 445 participants, low-quality evidence) and slow heart rate (three studies, 199 participants, low-quality evidence). The high initial concentration technique showed greater suspension of breathing when compared with the low initial concentration technique (two studies, 160 participants, low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included studies provided low-quality evidence, and study results should be interpreted with caution. More studies are needed to enable firm conclusions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:12:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sevoflurane induction for general anaesthesia has been reported to be safe, reliable and well accepted by patients. Sevoflurane induction uses either low or high initial concentrations. The low initial concentration technique involves initially administering a low concentration of sevoflurane and gradually increasing the concentration of the dose until the patient is anaesthetized. The high initial concentration technique involves administering high concentrations from the beginning, then continuing with those high doses until the patient is anaesthetized. This review was originally published in 2013 and has been updated in 2016.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:28:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We aimed to compare induction times and complication rates between high and low initial concentration sevoflurane anaesthetic induction techniques in adults and children who received inhalational induction for general anaesthesia. We defined 'high' as greater than or equal to and 'low' as less than a 4% initial concentration.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the updated review, we searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2)<I>, </I>MEDLINE (1950 to February 2016), EMBASE (1980 to February 2016), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to February 2016) and the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1946 to February 2016). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings and contacted the authors of included trials. The original search was run in September 2011.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We sought all published and unpublished, randomized controlled trials comparing high versus low initial sevoflurane concentration inhalational induction. Our primary outcomes included two measures of anaesthesia (time to loss of the eyelash reflex (LOER) and time until a weighted object held in the patient's hand was dropped), time to successful insertion of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and time to endotracheal intubation. Other outcomes were complications of the technique.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used standardized methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methods and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We conducted all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis, when possible. We estimated overall treatment effects by using a fixed-effect model when we found no substantial heterogeneity, whereas we applied the random-effects model in the presence of considerable heterogeneity.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We reran the searches and included one new study (100 participants) in this updated review. In total, we included 11 studies with 829 participants, although most analyses were based on data from fewer participants and evidence of low quality. We noted substantial heterogeneity in the included trials. Thus, our results should be read with caution. It was not possible to combine trials for the primary outcome (LOER), but individual trials reported faster induction times (typically 24 to 82 seconds faster, 41 seconds (31.37 to 50.62)) with high initial concentration sevoflurane (six studies, 443 participants, low-quality evidence). Apnoea appeared to be more common in the high initial concentration sevoflurane group (risk ratio (RR) 3.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 5.7, two studies, 160 participants, low-quality evidence). We found no evidence of differences between the two groups in the incidence of cough (odds ratio (OR) 1.23, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.81, eight studies, 589 participants, low-quality evidence), laryngospasm (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.16 to 15.9, seven studies, 588 participants, low-quality evidence), breath holding (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.83, five studies, 389 participants, low-quality evidence), patient movement (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.89, five studies, 445 participants, low-quality evidence) or bradycardia (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.88, three studies, 199 participants, low-quality evidence), and the overall incidence of complications was low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A high initial concentration sevoflurane technique probably offers more rapid induction of anaesthesia and a similar rate of complications, except for apnoea, which may be more common with a high initial concentration. However, this conclusion is not definitive because the included studies provided evidence of low quality.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>General anaesthesia (GA) may be induced by receiving an intravenous injection (IV induction) or by breathing in through a mask an anaesthetic vapour mixed with oxygen (inhalational induction). Inhalational anaesthetic induction may be the preferred method in children and in some adult patients who refuse intravenous cannulation (<LINK REF="REF-Eger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eger 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goresky-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goresky 1996</LINK>) or who have poor venous access or potentially difficult airways. One of the volatile anaesthetic agents commonly used for inhalational induction of anaesthesia is sevoflurane (Ultane<SUP>®</SUP>, Sevorane<SUP>®</SUP>, Sojourn&#8482;). Sevoflurane (2,2,2-trifluoro-1-[trifluoromethyl] ethyl fluoromethyl ether) was first introduced into clinical practice in Japan in 1990; it is sweet-smelling, non-flammable and less irritating to mucous membranes than other agents.</P>
<P>Induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane has been reported to be safe, reliable and well accepted by patients (<LINK REF="REF-De-Hert-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Hert 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Berg-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Berg 2005</LINK>). Its characteristics include inherent stability; low flammability; non-pungent odour; limited irritation to airways; low blood or gas anaesthetic solubility, which allows rapid induction of and emergence from anaesthesia; minimal cardiovascular and respiratory side effects; and minimal end-organ effects (<LINK REF="REF-Delgado_x002d_Herrera-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delgado-Herrera 2001</LINK>). The muscle relaxant properties of sevoflurane allow insertion of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or endotracheal tube (<LINK REF="REF-Aantaa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aantaa 2001</LINK>) without a muscle relaxant, provided adequate concentrations of anaesthetic are given.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhalational induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane involves the use of a low or a high initial concentration of sevoflurane. The low initial concentration technique involves initially administering a low concentration of sevoflurane, then gradually increasing the concentration until the patient is anaesthetized (<LINK REF="REF-Eger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eger 2003</LINK>). The high initial concentration technique involves administering high concentrations of sevoflurane (from 4% to 8%) from the beginning, then continuing until the patient is anaesthetized (<LINK REF="REF-Eger-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eger 2003</LINK>). Both techniques can be carried out by using different breathing patterns - vital capacity or tidal volume breathing. The vital capacity method consists of breathing out the residual volume, then taking a maximal breath and holding it as long as is comfortable, followed by spontaneous respiration; the tidal volume method involves normal breathing and respiratory rates.</P>
<P>Other interventions or medications can be used to improve the quality of induction of anaesthesia, for example, inspiratory pressure support at 15 cm H<SUB>2</SUB>O via an anaesthetic ventilator (<LINK REF="REF-Banchereau-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banchereau 2005</LINK>); priming of the breathing circuit with high concentration sevoflurane in oxygen, with or without prior nitrous oxide induction of anaesthesia (<LINK REF="STD-Yurino-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yurino 1995</LINK>); use of nitrous oxide with sevoflurane and oxygen (<LINK REF="STD-Dubois-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Shea-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Shea 2001</LINK>); and use of sufentanil (<LINK REF="REF-Meaudre-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meaudre 2004</LINK>), midazolam (<LINK REF="REF-Nishiyama-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nishiyama 2002</LINK>), clonidine (<LINK REF="REF-Watanabe-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watanabe 2006</LINK>) or dexmedetomidine (<LINK REF="REF-Mizrak-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mizrak 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yao-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yao 2015</LINK>) before induction of anaesthesia. Induction time- time to loss of the eyelash reflex (LOER) - is measured to compare the efficacy of different methods. However, complications during induction of anaesthesia such as coughing, salivation, failed induction at the first attempt, laryngospasm, breath holding, apnoea, severe movement or panic reaction, hypotension, an epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) and bradycardia can increase morbidity (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaisti-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaisti 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Larrauri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Larrauri 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Merquiol-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merquiol 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Roodman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roodman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vakkuri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakkuri 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yurino-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yurino 1995</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>High concentration volatile anaesthetic induction has been reported to result in a shorter (faster) induction time (<LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Larrauri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Larrauri 2004</LINK>). A high inspired sevoflurane concentration could increase sevoflurane concentration in alveoli and in the brain, so the action of sevoflurane is more rapid than with a low inspired sevoflurane concentration. A high concentration might shorten the second stage of anaesthesia, reducing the time during which coughing and breath holding may occur. On the other hand, a high initial concentration might cause increased irritation to the patient's airways.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A shorter induction time is usually desirable, but this may be accompanied by several complications such as breath holding, laryngospasm, severe movement, salivation and hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-Dubois-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Epstein-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Epstein 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Martin_x002d_Larrauri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Martin-Larrauri 2004</LINK>). More frequent apnoea of longer duration (<LINK REF="STD-Pancaro-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pancaro 2005</LINK>) has been reported after induction with a high concentration of sevoflurane, as have a higher incidence of bradycardia (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2000</LINK>) and an epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) (<LINK REF="REF-Constant--2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Constant 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vakkuri-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vakkuri 2001</LINK>).</P>

As a result of the small number of events, we used the Peto method for dichotomous data. Therefore, we could not present the risk ratio (RR) as mentioned in the protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Boonmak-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boonmak 2007</LINK>). Instead we used the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). We combined data using the mean difference (MD) for continuous data and presented them together with 95% CIs. We agreed to add two continuous outcomes (time to endotracheal intubation and time to successful insertion of a laryngeal mask) to the analysis because both are clinically important outcomes. Only one study reported time to intubation (<LINK REF="STD-Dubois-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Dubois 1999</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Review authors found that included studies were conducted so differently, especially with regard to the number of subgroups, with varying concentrations of sevoflurane, addition of nitrous oxide and opioids and different patient groups (adults vs children) that it is impossible to offer reliable conclusions. Evidence from six studies of 443 participants contributing data to the primary outcome of this review showed that the high initial concentration technique reduced time to loss of eyelash reflex (LOER). Combining the studies was not possible, but analysis of individual studies revealed that LOER appears to be quicker, typically by 24 to 82 seconds (six studies, 443 participants, low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence of increased apnoea (two studies, 160 participants) associated with the high initial concentration technique. However, the incidence of other complications was similar in each group and was generally low. Data were comparable in the incidence of cough (eight studies, 589 participants, low-quality evidence), laryngospasm (seven studies, 588 participants, low-quality evidence), breath holding (five studies, 389 participants, low-quality evidence), bradycardia (three studies, 199 participants, low-quality evidence) and patient movement (five studies, 445 participants, low-quality evidence).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The short duration of the included trials meant that no study reported incomplete data. All studies reported outcomes needed to evaluate the sevoflurane induction technique. All trials took place in recent years and used drug and anaesthetic techniques in current practice. However, the main limitations of these findings were the quality of the evidence and the small numbers of participants for many outcomes, so it is difficult for review authors to draw firm conclusions regarding many of our outcome measures. We included only 11 studies in the review (829 participants), and the number of participants for individual outcomes varied between 139 and 589 participants. Some included studies reported unclear blinding because participant blinding was inevitable. Other included studies had inadequate allocation concealment. Overall applicability of the results of this review is limited because of the great variety of techniques and participants included, although the techniques remain current.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in this review 10 studies with 829 participants. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Green-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Green 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pancaro-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Pancaro 2005</LINK>) had low risk of bias.

Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Yurino-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yurino 1995</LINK>) had high risk of bias associated with the sampling technique. We have presented details in the risk of bias tables and in <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. We found that overall the quality of the evidence for most outcomes was low or moderate as the result of performance bias and selection bias. However, performance bias (sevoflurane concentration blinding) had no effect on LOER nor on other adverse events.</P>
<P>Sufficient studies measured time to LOER that we could perform subgroup analysis according to age group, supplemental drug (nitrous oxide and opioid), initial dose of sevoflurane and technique of administration. The high initial concentration sevoflurane technique showed a consistently shorter time to LOER than was seen with the low initial concentration sevoflurane technique.</P>
<P>Possible effects of study design on our findings include considerable clinical variation in techniques used; different studies applied different initial sevoflurane concentrations, breathing techniques, priming techniques, drug supplementation and anaesthetic circuits.</P>
<P>Initial concentrations in the low initial inhalational induction groups described varied from 2% to less than 4% before sevoflurane was increased, but in the high initial concentration groups we noted initial concentrations ranging from 4% to 8%. Differences between groups in a particular study would be more likely if the difference between starting concentrations was large. However, after subgroup analysis, we determined time to LOER differences in both groups. The initial concentration in the high concentration group might be only one cause of the difference. Other than initial concentration, breathing techniques varied from single to multiple vital capacity breathing and tidal volume breathing in both groups. The effect of different breathing techniques on LOER is unpredictable, although vital capacity breathing seemed to have shorter time to LOER than tidal volume breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1999</LINK>; 
<LINK REF="REF-Lejus-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lejus 2006</LINK>; 
<LINK REF="REF-Liu-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liu 2010</LINK>). Opioid, a sedative drug, and nitrous oxide supplementation varied in dose and time of administration. These adjuncts will  influence time to LOER and rate of complications, but again not in a predictable way. In other studies, nitrous oxide supplementation had variable effects on time to LOER and complications (<LINK REF="REF-Bordes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordes 2006</LINK>;

<LINK REF="REF-Siau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siau 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Furthermore, measurements of induction time may be inaccurate among included studies. Investigators used two different measures - time to LOER and time to drop a weighted object. Time to LOER was defined as time from the start of induction until the patient lost his or her eyelash reflex, whilst time to drop a weighted object was defined as time from the start of induction until the patient dropped a 20 mL syringe full of water from between his or her thumb and index finger. We could not pool these induction outcomes. The frequency at which the eyelash reflex was tested varied from every two seconds to every 10 seconds across studies, which might have led to inaccuracies in measurement.</P>
<P>The complications that we aimed to study were also variously defined, with many study authors using their own particular definitions and reporting only adverse events of interest to them. Overall incidence might be greater than in the studies. We found no trials comparing high and low initial concentrations that reported patient satisfaction, nor any that aimed to monitor the EEG for epileptiform activity.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review suggests that the high initial concentration sevoflurane technique seems to offer a shorter induction time than is seen with a low initial concentration. This result was also reported in other reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bordes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghatge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghatge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lerman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 2009</LINK>) and was consistent across all age groups, with or without nitrous oxide supplementation.</P>
<P>Complications in the high and low initial concentration induction groups were comparable except for apnoea, which appeared more common in the high initial concentration group. Previous studies have reported comparable complications during inhalational induction (<LINK REF="REF-Bordes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghatge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghatge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lerman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2004</LINK>) but have presented no clear conclusions about the effects of differential concentrations of sevoflurane on bradycardia, the epileptiform EEG and apnoea.</P>
<P>Bradycardia (three studies; 199 participants) was comparable between the groups in our review (66 per 1000). Narrative reviews have provided no firm conclusions about bradycardia with high concentrations in healthy adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Bordes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2004</LINK>).

<P>Apneoa (two studies; 160 participants) was more common in high than in low initial concentration groups (141:1000). A previous narrative review suggested increased apnoea in children receiving a high concentration with midazolam (<LINK REF="REF-Lerman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cough (38:1000 in the low concentration group), laryngospasm (6:1000 in the low concentration group), breath holding (56:1000 in the low concentration group), patient movement (145:1000 in the low concentration group) and salivation (21:1000 in the low concentration group) were comparable between groups in our review. Other studies reported that a high initial concentration sevoflurane technique is not associated with these clinical side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Bordes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bordes 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ghatge-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghatge 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lerman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lerman 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathan 2004</LINK>).</P>

However, <LINK REF="REF-Merquiol-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Merquiol 2006</LINK> found that high initial (6%) sevoflurane induction had more epileptiform EEG than incremental sevoflurane induction in children (abstract only).<LINK REF="REF-Gibert-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gibert 2012</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2012</LINK> found that end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations 4% or greater can cause epileptiform EEG in children. 
<LINK REF="STD-Kreuzer-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kreuzer 2014</LINK>
 reported that 8% sevoflurane induction showed higher epileptiform EEG than 6% sevoflurane induction in children. In adults, <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2016</LINK> reported epileptiform EEG during 8% sevoflurane induction before elective carotid endarterectomy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-quality evidence suggests that the high initial concentration sevoflurane technique probably results in shorter time to induction of anaesthesia than is seen with the low initial concentration sevoflurane technique (difference of 24 to 82 seconds). Likewise, the difference in complication rates is unlikely to be great. We do not have sufficient evidence to determine effects of the high initial concentration sevoflurane technique on complication rates, although apnoea was more common with the high initial concentration. No trial reported patient satisfaction and epileptiform EEG with these techniques.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-06-27 06:14:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We required high-quality evidence to examine the effects of high initial concentration induction on adverse events, especially on epileptiform EEG. Larger studies with allocation concealment and blinding are needed for a firm conclusion. We also required standardized definitions of adverse events for comparison between groups. Variation in induction techniques (breathing techniques, priming techniques, anaesthetic circuits, supplement drug) prevented comparison between groups that would lead to meaningful conclusions. We recommend that future trials must focus on each induction technique along with patient satisfaction with each technique.</P>
