<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Starting androgen suppression (hormone) therapy early, before advanced prostate cancer starts progressing may improve chances of longer survival.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The prostate gland is part of the male sex gland and is a common site of cancer in older men. Treatments for prostate cancer include surgery and radiation therapy. Male hormones (androgens) stimulate prostate cancer growth. Hormone suppression therapy, decreasing the levels of these hormones, is therefore also used to try to treat prostate cancer. It is not clear however whether it is better to start hormone treatment straight after diagnosis, or to wait until the disease progresses. The review found that early hormone suppression treatment decreased the progression of advanced prostate cancer and improved survival. Further studies are needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in men. Treatment goals for men with advanced prostate cancer include prolonging survival, preventing or delaying symptoms due to disease progression, improving and maintaining quality of life, reducing treatment related morbidity. Androgen suppression therapy is considered a mainstay of treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. However it is not clear whether early androgen suppression for men with locally advanced disease or asymptomatic metastases improves length and quality of life compared to androgen suppression deferred until signs and symptoms of clinical progression. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This systematic review assessed the efficacy and adverse effects of primary therapy with early versus deferred androgen suppression therapy in men with advanced prostate cancer. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Randomized controlled trials were searched in general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CancerLIT, Cochrane Library, VA Cochrane Prostate Disease register) and by reviewing bibliographies including those of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Technology Evaluation Center/Evidence-based Practice Center of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (BCBS/TEC-AHRQ) report No.4. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All published randomized trials were eligible for inclusion provided they: randomized men with advanced prostate cancer to early versus deferred androgen suppression; reported overall, progression-free, and cancer-specific survival, and/or adverse events; did not utilize androgen suppression as adjuvant therapy to radiation treatment. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>An independent reviewer using a standardized form extracted information on trial characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. Results were reviewed for accuracy and discrepancies resolved by discussion. The main outcome measure for comparing effectiveness was the overall survival at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years. Progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, complications due to disease progression and the incidence of adverse effects of treatment were also measured. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:57:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four trials involving 2167 patients were included in this review. All of the trials were conducted prior to use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing. There was variability between studies regarding the treatments used and the requirements for initiation of treatments. The percent overall survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years for the early treatment group was 88%, 73%, 44%, and 18%. For the deferred therapy group the percent overall survival was 86%, 71%, 37%, and 12%. The pooled estimate for the difference in overall survival favored early therapy but was significant only at 10 years when few patients had survived (OR=1.16 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.49) at 1 year; OR=1.08 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.33) at 2 years; OR=1.19 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.50) at 5 years, and OR=1.50 (95% CI: 1.04 to 2.16) at 10 years). The pooled estimate of prostate cancer specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years favored early therapy though the confidence intervals were wide and the results not statistically different. The risk differences at 2, 5, and 10 years were 2.7%, 5.8%, and 4.6%. Although each study used unique definitions of progression free survival, all studies found progression free survival was consistently better in the early intervention group at all time points. Complications due to disease progression were only reported in one study but were more frequent in the deferred treatment group. Adverse events due to treatment were also only reported in one study but occurred more frequently in the early treatment group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The evidence from randomized controlled trials is limited by the variability in study design, stage of cancer and subjects enrolled, interventions utilized, definitions and reporting of outcomes and the lack of PSA testing for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. However, the available information suggests that early androgen suppression for treatment of advanced prostate cancer reduces disease progression and complications due to progression. Early androgen suppression may provide a small but statistically significant improvement in overall survival at 10 years. There was no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer specific survival but a clinically important difference could not be excluded. These outcomes need to be evaluated with the evidence suggesting higher costs and more frequent treatment related adverse effects with early therapy. Additional studies are required to evaluate more definitively the efficacy and adverse effects of early versus delayed androgen suppression in men with prostate cancer. In particular trials should evaluate patients with advanced prostate cancer diagnosed by PSA testing and men with persistent or rising PSA levels following treatment options (e.g. radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or observation) for clinically localized disease. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-03 13:37:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. The number of new cases in the United States for 2001 is approximately 198,100, with an expected number of 31,500 deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Landis-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landis 2000</LINK>). The 1994 United States Medicare expenditures for the treatment of prostate cancer were almost 1.5 billion dollars (<LINK REF="REF-Holtgrewe-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holtgrewe 1997</LINK>). A large proportion of this expense was related to the use of anti-androgen interventions. Treatment goals in men with advanced prostate cancer include prolonging survival, preventing or delaying symptoms due to disease progression, improving quality of life, and reducing treatment related morbidity. </P>
<P>Androgen suppression therapy is considered a mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Huben-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huben 1991</LINK>) although it is not clear whether immediate androgen suppression used as primary therapy in men with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer, improves length and quality of life compared to androgen suppression deferred until signs and symptoms of clinical progression. Recently, hormone therapy has been initiated at earlier stages of disease and in younger patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wirth-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wirth 1999</LINK>). This has resulted in an increase in the duration of hormone therapy with associated increased financial costs and risks for treatment related adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Adolfsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adolfsson 1999</LINK>). However, there has not been sufficient evidence from RCT and meta-analysis that early therapy is superior to delaying androgen suppression until development of symptoms due to disease progression (<LINK REF="REF-Adolfsson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adolfsson 1999</LINK>) . </P>
<P>In 1998 the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Technology Evaluation Center (BCBS-TEC), an Evidence-based Practice Center of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) conducted a systematic review on the relative effectiveness of androgen suppression therapies for advanced prostate cancer (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1999</LINK>). One key question of the report compared early to deferred androgen suppression therapy in various patient populations: men who had previously undergone definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) for initially localized prostate cancer; men who were newly diagnosed with locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and were undergoing primary therapy with androgen suppression; and men who had locally advanced or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and were undergoing radiation therapy. </P>
<P>Our goal was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to update, reevaluate and disseminate evidence from the AHRQ report related to the timing of androgen suppression for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. We included data where androgen suppression was initiated immediately following radical prostatectomy in men with clinically localized prostate cancer who were found to have nodal metastases on pathological examination at the time of prostatectomy. Studies where androgen suppression was utilized as adjuvant treatment to "definitive radiation treatment" were excluded. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Primary: To evaluate the relative efficacy of early versus deferred androgen suppression therapy on overall survival in men with advanced prostate cancer. </P>
<P>Secondary: (1) To compare the relative efficacy of early versus deferred androgen suppression on prostate cancer specific survival and/or prostate cancer progression-free survival in men with advanced prostate cancer; (2) To evaluate the incidence of complications due to disease progression; and (3) To evaluate the adverse effects of treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>For efficacy outcomes the review included published randomized controlled trials of early and deferred androgen suppression, for advanced prostate cancer. Studies involving adjuvant hormone therapy given immediately after surgery were included. Studies utilizing hormone therapy adjuvant to radiation were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Trials were included if they enrolled men with advanced prostate cancer who were not previously treated with hormonal therapy or radiation, and reported survival outcomes. </P>
<P>Advanced prostate cancer was defined as: (a) regional or disseminated metastasis (D1 or D2; N+/ M0 or M1); (b) minimally advanced disease (C; T3-4/ N0 or Nx/M0); and (c) signs of progression after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of early versus deferred androgen suppression on survival. For this review early intervention was defined as initiating androgen suppression: 1) immediately at the time of diagnosis, 2) immediately following surgery for clinically localized but pathologically advanced prostate cancer, 3) for persistently elevated PSA levels following surgery, and 4) immediately upon rising PSA levels in patients with previously undetectable PSA. Deferred androgen suppression was defined as withholding androgen suppression therapy until symptoms, clinical signs, or radiological evidence of clinical progression. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Eligible trials that measured overall survival, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival and/or adverse effects of treatment were used for analysis. Each of these measures were compared and analyzed separately. To determine the validity of data synthesis across separate studies, the reviewer abstracted definitions used by each study to describe cancer-specific survival and progression-free survival.</P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>The BCBS/TEC-AHRQ methodology was used (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1999</LINK>). The review was based only on published literature. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials. The search process used MEDLINE, CancerLIT, and EMBASE databases. The search of these data bases focused on all randomized controlled trials published between 1966 and August 2001, that included any of the following terms in the title, abstract or in their key word list: leuprolide, goserelin, buserelin, flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide and orchiectomy (castration, orchidectomy). The search was limited to include only those articles that are indexed under the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) "prostatic neoplasms;" and addressed studies on human subjects. In addition, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the VA Cochrane Prostate Disease and Urologic Cancer register were searched for trials focused on any of the agents in men with prostate cancer. The yield from this strategy was matched against the table of contents list of trials compiled by the Prostate Cancer Trialist Collaborative Group (1995) and trials cited in the MetaWorks meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Caubet-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caubet 1997</LINK>) to determine if any relevant trials were omitted. To supplement this strategy, issues of current contents on diskette was searched to identify recently published articles that were not indexed by the online databases. </P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 13:53:19 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively designed to define: study objectives; search strategy; study selection criteria and methods for determining study eligibility; data elements to be abstracted and methods for abstraction; and methods for study quality assessment. The titles and abstracts identified by the electronic search were screened by an independent reviewer and evaluated against inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewer abstracted data for the eligible study using a standardized data abstraction form. Data elements included the following: trial identifiers; study methods (including enrolment and withdrawal numbers); patient characteristics; outcomes; and comments. The reviewer sought information on 3 types of actuarial outcomes: overall-survival, progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival. The proportion of patients surviving 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years were sought in addition to median survival duration. When not reported, these elements were estimated from survival curves available in the published reports. After data abstraction, the data were reviewed with one of the other authors (TW) and disagreement resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>The quality of the studies was assessed using various parameters such as successful randomization, success in concealing randomization, compliance with intervention and blinded assessment of outcomes. Quantitative analyses of outcomes were based on intention to treat. Data were analyzed with the random effects model according to the methodology outlined by DerSimonian and Laird (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Odds ratios and risk differences for overall, cancer-specific and progression-free survival at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years were calculated for the individual studies. The pooled odds ratio and the pooled risk difference were calculated to determine the overall direction and magnitude of treatment effect. If the studies provided the actual numbers surviving at each time period, then this figure was used for the analyses. If not provided this number was estimated from the graphs. The number at risk at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years was available only in the Medical Research Council Prostate Cancer Working Party Investigators Group (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>) trial. For the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>) study the number at risk was available for 20, 40, 60 and 100 months. We used the number at risk closest to and preceding the year of interest to represent the number at risk for that time period. In the Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group's studies (<LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK> &amp; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>) we assumed the number at risk at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years to be equal to the number at risk at baseline.</P>
<P>Whenever possible the data for the subgroups were analyzed separately. The VACURG-I study had outcome measures data according to stage of disease. For the MRC trial, where data on outcome measures based on metastatic status was provided, we analyzed results in 2 subcategories: M0 (patients without evidence of metastases) and M1 + MX (which included patients with known metastases and those in whom the metastatic status was unknown).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 13:23:06 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The literature search and selection criteria identified 4 randomized controlled trials involving 3,447 men that compared immediate to deferred androgen suppression therapy in advanced prostate cancer (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK> = 98; <LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK> = 938; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK> = 1903; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK> = 508). The treatments used in the studies were not uniform. Additionally, tumor staging, randomization processes and initiation of treatment varied between studies, and none were conducted during the era of routine PSA testing. A description of each of the studies is provided below.</P>
<P>The VACURG studies were conducted in 14 Veterans Administration Hospitals in the United States. They were begun in the late 1960s and involved patients with previously untreated carcinoma of the prostate (<LINK REF="REF-VACURG-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">VACURG 1967</LINK>). These trials were designed to test the efficacy of orchiectomy, Diethylstilbestrol (DES) at various doses and orchiectomy alone or in combination with DES. In the VACURG trials stage III was defined as local extension beyond the prostatic capsule, whereas stage IV was marked by elevated prostatic acid phosphatase or demonstrated metastases (<LINK REF="REF-Byar-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Byar 1988</LINK>). The VACURG-I study had a total of 1903 patients with stage III and IV prostate cancer. Men were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups: DES 5mg, Orchiectomy + Placebo, Orchiectomy + DES and Placebo. The VACURG-II study had a total of 508 men with stage III and IV disease who were randomized to four treatment modalities: 0.2mg DES, 1 mg DES, 5 mg DES, and placebo. Hormone therapies tested in the VACURG trials and found to be ineffective (DES 0.2 mg) or excessively toxic (DES 5 mg) are not reviewed here (n = 1202). The number of subjects enrolled in the VACURG studies and utilized in this review was 1209 (<LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK> = 953; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK> = 256). Therefore, 2,167 of the 3,447 men (63%) enrolled in the four trials were included in this review. In the VACURG studies, placebo group patients received active therapy when the physician judged that a change in therapy was necessary for the welfare of the patient. Thus the patients in the placebo arm could be considered as having received deferred hormonal therapy. The VACURG studies did not provide demographic data of the population studied.</P>
<P>The MRC study involved 938 patients with "local disease considered too advanced for curative treatment (T2 to T4) or metastatic disease not causing symptoms." Men were randomized to either immediate treatment (orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue) or to the "same treatment deferred until indication occurred." Indications for treatment in deferred subjects were at the discretion of the participating physician. There were 469 men in immediate treatment and 465 in deferred treatment. The mean age in the deferred group was 73.7 years. Demographic data were not provided for the immediate treatment arm but the authors note that the randomization process used an algorithm to limit chance differences among groups in age, T stage, and M stage. Men randomized to immediate treatment were required to start androgen suppression within 6 weeks of entry, while those in the deferred treatment group started therapy an average of 18 months after study entry. On the basis of the metastatic status the subjects belonged to 3 groups: M0, men without evidence of metastatic disease as evidenced by bone scan; MX, men with no evidence of metastatic disease, but without confirmatory bone scan; M1, men with definite evidence of metastatic disease. The percentage of men with M0, MX, and M1 disease in the two treatment arms were: 52.5, 19.4, and 28.2 respectively for the deferred treatment group and 54.6, 17.7, and 27.7 respectively in the immediate treatment group.</P>
<P>The ECOG study included 100 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for clinically localized disease, and were found to have microscopic evidence of nodal metastases on pathological examination (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>). Men were randomized to receive immediate androgen suppression with either goserelin, or bilateral orchiectomy, or to be followed until disease progression. Of the 100 enrolled patients, 2 were found to be ineligible, leaving 98 who were included in the trial analyses. Seven patients had clinical stage T1b prostate cancer and 91 had stage T2 disease. None of the patients had evidence of metastases as evaluated by bone scan and chest X-ray obtained prior to prostatectomy. Patients underwent randomization within 12 weeks after prostatectomy. Median follow up was 7.1 years (range, 3 to 10). The median age was 65.1 years in the immediate therapy group and 66.6 years in the deferred treatment group. The median Gleason score in both the immediate and the deferred treatment groups was 7. The median time from randomization to initiation of hormone therapy in the deferred treatment group was 20 months and the median PSA level at the start of such treatment was 14 ng/mL.</P>

<P>The patients were randomly assigned to treatment in all 4 studies and the analyses were done according to intention to treat. In the MRC trial randomization process used an algorithm to limit the chance differences between groups in age, T stage, and M stage (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>). The VACURG studies and the ECOG trial did not provide information on the randomization method. In studies where orchiectomy was among the treatment choices, blinding was considered to be not applicable.</P>
<P>There was proper allocation of concealment in the MRC trial (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>).

<P>Overall survival:<BR/>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>) involving 2167 men provided data regarding overall survival at 1 year. 3 trials involving 982 men provided data regarding overall survival at 10 years. The 10-year survival data were not available for the VACURG-II study, and the numbers of patients at risk at the end of 10 years in the MRC and ECOG trials were very small. Therefore, over 97% of 10 year overall survival data are from men (n=966) enrolled in VACURG I.</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>) demonstrated a survival benefit in favor of immediate treatment at the end of 5 years. However, only the VACURG-II study was statistically significant: OR=1.73 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.90). The pooled overall survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years for the early treatment group was 87.6%, 73.0%, 43.7%, and 17.8%. For the deferred therapy group the overall survival was 85.7%, 70.9%, 37.5%, and 12.3%. Men treated with early androgen suppression had a progressively increased relative survival compared with men assigned to receive deferred therapy. This difference was statistically significant only at 10 years of follow-up (OR=1.16 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.49) at 1 year; OR=1.08 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.33) at 2 years; OR=1.19 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.50) at 5 years, and OR=1.50 (95% CI: 1.04 to 2.16) at 10 years. The pooled estimate of the risk difference (RD) increased slightly over time favoring early therapy, though they were statistically significant only at 10 years: RD = 0.01 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.03) at 1 year; RD = 0.02 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.05) at 2 years; RD = 0.04 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.09) at 5 years; and RD = 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.08) at 10 years. The pooled NNT was 100 at 1 year, 50 at 2 years, 25 at 5 years, and 20 at 10 years.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of VACURG-I by stage found the relative overall survival between treatment groups to be similar for both stages III and IV disease. In men with stage III disease the Odds Ratio was 1.22 (95% CI: 0.72 to 2.08) at 1 year, 1.01(95% CI: 0.71 to 1.42) at 5 years and 1.35 (95% CI: 0.88 to 2.07) at 10 years. For men with stage IV disease the Odds Ratio decreased from 1.29 (95% CI: 0.83 to 2.02) at 1 year to 1.00 (95% CI: 0.65 to 1.55) at 5 years and then increased to 1.88 (95% CI: 0.86 to 4.07) at 10 years. The VACURG-II study reported a survival advantage in favor of the early treatment group that was significant only at 5 years: OR=1.18 (95% CI: 0.61 to 2.28) at 1 year; OR=1.15 (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.93) at 2 years; OR= 1.73 (95% CI: 1.03 to 2.90) at 5 years. No survival data were available at 10 years.</P>
<P>Pooled analyses of the results from the ECOG study and MRC trials, which used orchiectomy or LHRH agonist, reported no significant difference in overall survival between early and deferred therapy at 1, 5 or 10 years: OR=1.02 (95% CI: 0.48 to 2.17) at 1 year; 1.38 (95% CI: 0.87 to 2.18) at 5 years; and 3.39 (95% CI: 0.40 to 28.99) at 10 years. Subgroup analyses of data from the MRC trial at one and two years showed a statistically insignificant improvement in survival for early therapy in men with M0 disease. At 5 years both M0 and M1+ MX showed a benefit favoring early therapy, though the confidence intervals were wide and the results not statistically significant. The pooled estimate of the MRC study gave an OR of 1.02, 0.94, and 1.24 at 1, 2, and 5 years. There were too few subjects available at 10 years for reliable assessment.</P>
<P>Cancer-specific survival:<BR/>Data on cancer specific survival were available for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>). None of the studies described a definition of death due to prostate cancer nor utilized a validated blinded adjudication process for assessing cause of death. The pooled estimate of the prostate cancer specific survival at 1, 5, and 10 years favored early therapy though the confidence intervals were wide and the results not statistically significant. Prostate cancer specific survival for early versus deferred androgen suppression was 95.2% vs. 94.2%; 85.5% vs. 82.8%; 69.8% vs. 63.3%; and 57.8% vs. 48.8% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years respectively. The risk difference at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years were 1%, 2.7%, 5.8%, 4.6% and therefore provided a NNT to prevent prostate cancer death at the corresponding time intervals equal to 100, 37, 17, 22.</P>
<P>Cancer-specific survival results were similar across the three available studies. The VACURG-I study found that cancer-specific survival was better in the early therapy group at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years: OR = 1.38 (95% CI: 0.83 to 2.28) at 1 year, 1.25 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.76) at 2 years, 1.21 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.59) at 5 years and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.11 to 1.86) at 10 years (<LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the ECOG study all the patients were alive in both the immediate and deferred treatment group at the end of 1 year. At 2, 5, and 10 years the immediate treatment group had a better cancer-specific survival than the deferred group: OR = 5.00 (95% CI: 0.23 to 106.95) at 2 years, and 5.24 (95% CI: 1.03 to 26.57) at 5 years, and 4.67 (95% CI: 0.30 to 73.39) at 10 years (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>). However, the confidence intervals were extremely wide and results were only significant at five years.</P>
<P>The pooled estimates of the MRC and ECOG trials reported an OR of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.31 to 3.04) at 1 year, the subsequent years found a benefit in favor of the early therapy group that was statistically insignificant: OR was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.74 to 1.90) at 2 years, 1.94 (95% CI: 1.22 to 3.09) at 5 years, and 2.09 (95% CI: 0.37 to 11.86) at 10 years.</P>
<P>Progression free survival:<BR/>While progression free survival was reported in all four studies each trial used a unique definition of prostate cancer progression (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>). However, results from all four studies favored early androgen suppression therapy. The MRC study provided data only for patients with non-metastatic (M0) prostate cancer, and defined disease progression as development of local progression or distant metastases. The ECOG study defined prostate cancer progression as evidence of local or disseminated disease recurrence as detected on computed tomographic scan, chest X-ray, bone scan, physical examination, or biopsy. In the VACURG studies progression was defined as advancement from stage III to stage IV disease. The pooled estimates showed that progression free survival was better with early versus deferred therapy. The percentage of patients who were free of distant metastases with early and deferred therapy were 95.7% vs. 84.4% at 1 year, 90.7% vs. 71.2% at 2 years, 76.6% vs. 53.5% at 5 years, and 67.6% vs. 38.1% at 10 years.</P>
<P>In the MRC trial, fewer patients without metastases progressed in the early therapy group than in the deferred therapy group. The proportion of patients free of distant metastases in the early versus deferred hormone therapy group was 94.9% vs. 85.1% at 1 year, 87.8% vs. 71.8% at 2 years, and 63.1% vs. 42.2% at 5 years. At the end of 10 years there were very few patients on whom data were available.</P>
<P>The ECOG study also reported a higher proportion of subjects with disease recurrence among men in the deferred therapy group. The proportion of patients who were free of recurrence in the early as compared to deferred hormone therapy was 100% vs. 88.2% at 1 year, 97.8% vs. 52.8 at 2 years, and 84.2% vs. 42.1% at 5 years.</P>
<P>Both VACURG studies demonstrated that early androgen suppression therapy delayed disease progression. The VACURG-I study showed a risk difference of 10%, 14.7%, 19.9%, and 29.7% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years between early and deferred androgen suppression therapy. In the VACURG-II study the risk difference at 1, 2, and 5 years were 19.8%, 31.8%, and 35.3%, respectively.</P>
<P>Complications due to disease progression:<BR/>Only one study reported complications due to disease progression (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>). The most common complication was development of extra-skeletal metastases, which occurred in 11.8% of men in the deferred therapy group as compared to 7.9% in the early treatment group. Pathological fractures were reported in 4.5% of men in the deferred therapy as compared to 2.3% of men in the early therapy group. Ureteric obstruction was reported by 11.8% in the deferred treatment group versus 7% of men in the immediate treatment group.</P>
<P>Adverse effects of treatment:<BR/>Only the ECOG trial provided data on adverse effects of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>). Treatment related adverse events were more frequently reported in the immediate versus the deferred treatment group. Twenty-two of 46 men (48%) in the immediate treatment group complained of nonspecific genitourinary effects as compared to only 6 in the deferred treatment group. While 27 patients (59%) in the immediate treatment arm reported experiencing hot flashes, none of the men in the deferred treatment group experienced them. Ten men (22%) in the immediate therapy group reported gynecomastia compared to 1 in the deferred therapy group. Incontinence was experienced by 20 (43%) in the immediate treatment arm versus 15 (30%) (in the deferred treatment group. There were no data on quality of life, general health status, libido, bone or muscle loss. In the VACURG studies only data related to cardiovascular deaths were reported which were similar in the immediate and deferred treatment arms.</P>
<P>Sensitivity Analyses:<BR/>The ECOG study involved men with clinically localized but pathologically advanced prostate cancer. All men underwent radical prostatectomy prior to randomization. Therefore, this study may be unique from the other trials. We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding the ECOG results. Our findings and conclusions did not differ with exclusion of the ECOG study. The OR for overall survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years were 1.16; 1.08; 1.15; 1.47. For cancer specific survival the OR were 1.18; 1.20; 1.33; 1.44. The OR for progression-free survival were 3.87; 3.63; 2.84; 3.41.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-03 13:37:40 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review assessed the evidence from randomized controlled trials, regarding the effect of early versus deferred androgen suppression therapy used as primary treatment or adjuvant to radical prostatectomy, on overall survival, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, complications due to disease progression and adverse effects of treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer.</P>
<P>The pooled results suggest a small, but not statistically significant improvement in overall survival at 1, 2, and 5 years due to early androgen suppression therapy. At 10 years a statistically significant absolute difference in overall survival of 5.5% was observed in favor of early androgen suppression. The number of subjects available for analysis at 10 years was small and almost entirely from the older VACURG studies. Cancer-specific survival also favored early androgen suppression therapy at all time periods but the confidence intervals were wide and the results not statistically significant. While the majority of data available for the pooled overall and cancer specific survival outcomes were from the older VACURG studies results were consistent across all four studies (<LINK REF="STD-ECOG" TYPE="STUDY">ECOG</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>). The VACURG-I trial reported that the overall survival at 5 years was 42 percent in the immediate therapy arm compared to 30 percent in the deferred therapy arm. The MRC trials reported that the overall survival at 5 years was 41% compared to 37%. The subgroup analysis found that the benefit in the MRC trial was observed only in men with M0 disease.</P>
<P>Early androgen suppression appeared to have the greatest benefit in reducing disease progression. Three of the 4 studies (<LINK REF="STD-MRC" TYPE="STUDY">MRC</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-I" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - I</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-VACURG-_x002d_-II" TYPE="STUDY">VACURG - II</LINK>) showed improvement at 1, 2, and 5 years with a pooled absolute difference in disease progression at 5 years of 23%. At 10 years the VACURG-I trial also showed a significant advantage of early androgen suppression in delaying progression. Additionally, complications due to disease progression were lower in the early therapy group. However, this was only reported in the MRC trial and patients were not closely monitored with PSA testing. The occurrence of treatment related adverse events was greater in the immediate therapy group, probably owing to the longer duration of treatment.</P>
<P>The BCBS/TEC-AHRQ review reported relative overall, cancer-specific, and progression-free survival results of similar magnitude to our findings (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1999</LINK>). The BCBS/TEC-AHRQ review and Bayoumi (<LINK REF="REF-Bayoumi-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bayoumi 2000</LINK>) also compared the costs and effects of initiating androgen suppression therapy early (at the time of diagnosis) or late (when asymptomatic distant metastases develop). Their results indicated that waiting to initiate therapy until the patient has developed symptomatic metastases is both the least expensive and most beneficial therapeutic strategy. The greatest quality-of-life benefit was obtained when orchiectomy was performed late, slightly fewer benefits were reported when antiandrogen therapy was started at the occurrence of asymptomatic metastases, and the fewest benefits accrued when antiandrogens were started at the time of diagnosis. Similar results were obtained with respect to combined androgen blockade (CAB) with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen and an LHRH agonist or orchiectomy. When biochemical markers (PSA levels) were incorporated into the analyses the relative rankings of strategies remained unchanged.</P>
<P>Some methodological considerations utilized in this systematic review necessitate caution in interpreting these results and translating the findings into clinical practice. These include: 1) compared to the BCBS/TEC-AHRQ report our Cochrane review utilized odds ratios as the effect measure across studies rather then hazard ratios; 2) pooled risk differences and mean number needed to treat were calculated to provide a clinically meaningful estimate of the magnitude of the treatment benefit; 3) there were analytical difficulties due to the fact that therapies in these trials were not all the same and that they were not compared against the same control; 4) none of the trials were conducted during 'the modern era' when PSA testing was widely utilized for prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring; and 5) studies utilized different definitions of disease progression and none had validated assessments of prostate cancer specific mortality.</P>
<P>The BCBS/TEC-AHRQ report utilized hazard ratios in their pooled analyses and did not incorporate results from the ECOG study. Their results were similar to our findings indicating that there was "a possible mortality advantage for immediate treatment in studies where hormonal treatment is the primary therapy, although the combined result does not attain statistical significance (HR = 0.914, 95% CI: 0.815 to 1.026)" (<LINK REF="REF-Aronson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronson 1999</LINK>). The fact that different methods of androgen suppression were utilized in the various trials is unlikely to alter the validity of the pooled survival results from our review and the BCBS/TEC-AHRQ report regarding timing of androgen suppression. A section of the full BCBS/TEC-AHRQ report demonstrated that there was no difference in overall survival among different forms of monotherapy. Furthermore, the difference in survival with CAB versus monotherapy was small (median survival difference = 3.3 months and 5 year absolute survival difference = 2% to 3%). Patients currently being diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer are likely to have earlier, lower volume disease and would be subject to longer duration of androgen suppression therapy. Additionally, the routine use of PSA testing for careful monitoring of disease makes it less likely that patients would develop extensive metastatic disease and pathologic fractures prior to institution of androgen suppression. The VACURG studies also have been criticized because approximately 60% of patients in the deferred treatment group received hormonal therapy before they develop clear evidence of progression. Nonetheless, the results from this systematic review provide the best available information regarding the relative effectiveness and adverse effects of early vs. deferred androgen suppression for men with advanced prostate cancer. The results also highlight the need for the conduct and completion of additional RCT.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>In men with advanced prostate cancer early utilization of androgen suppression reduces prostate cancer progression compared to deferred therapy. However, there is no convincing evidence to determine whether early androgen suppression improves survival except in men who have had a radical prostatectomy for localized disease and are found to have microscopic evidence of lymph node metastases. These men, however, are more likely to have adverse effects due to early treatment. Less than 5% of men currently diagnosed with prostate cancer meet this criteria. In other men, the improvement in overall survival due to early intervention does not occur until 10 years after initiating therapy and is relatively small in magnitude (absolute risk reduction = 5.5%). There is no improvement in prostate cancer specific mortality though a clinically significant benefit cannot be ruled out. </P>
<P>There is inadequate information available regarding men with clinically localized disease who develop PSA recurrence or progression following surgery in the absence of additional signs and symptoms. Early therapy increases androgen suppression related costs and adverse events but reduces complications due to disease progression. Careful monitoring of patients with serial PSA testing was not routinely performed in these studies. Therefore, it is not known whether similar complications would occur if men closely monitoring and treatment were provided according to changes in PSA levels. </P>
<P>Men who undergo immediate hormonal treatment for advanced prostate cancer should be informed that they have a longer duration of therapy in which they may experience adverse effects and costs of androgen suppression. However, complications due to disease progression may be decreased by early treatment. Current patients have earlier disease and are likely to undergo a longer duration of treatment compared to subjects enrolled in randomized trials available for this review. Cost-effectiveness, which the AHRQ report found to be better with deferred androgen suppression therapy, as well as quality of life should be considered when discussing the timing of androgen suppression for patients with advanced prostate cancer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Future RCT should compare androgen suppression initiated at PSA rise or persistence to androgen suppression deferred until clinical signs or symptoms of progression among men who undergo definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy) or active surveillance (a.k.a. watchful waiting, expectant management) for clinically localized disease. Outcomes should include overall survival, validated/adjudicated assessment of prostate cancer specific survival, disease progression and complications, treatment related adverse effects, quality of life, and cost effectiveness.</P>
