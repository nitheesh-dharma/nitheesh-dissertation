<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-06-25 21:59:16 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question: </B>This Cochrane systematic review evaluated all fluid and pharmacological agents that aim to prevent adhesion formation after gynaecological surgery (gels were defined as fluid agents).</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Adhesions are defined as internal scar tissue that may form as part of the body's healing process after surgery. They can also be caused by pelvic infection and endometriosis. Adhesions join together tissues and organs that are not normally connected. They are common after gynaecological surgery and can cause pelvic pain, infertility and bowel obstruction. Women with adhesions may need further surgery, which is more difficult and can lead to additional complications. The fluid agents are placed inside the pelvic cavity (which contains all female reproductive organs) during surgery and physically prevent raw, healing tissues from touching. These fluids can be broken down into hydroflotation agents or gels; hydroflotation agents are fluids placed in large volumes (usually around a litre); gels are directly applied to the internal surgical site. Pharmacological agents act by changing part of the healing process.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> We included 29 randomised controlled trials in the review (3227 participants). Of these, results of 18 trials were pooled (2740 participants). Results from the remaining 11 trials could not be used in the meta-analysis because investigators did not use a way of measuring adhesions that would allow findings to be pooled with other data, or because important statistical information was not reported. We searched all evidence up to April 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results: </B>Only one study evaluated pelvic pain and provided no evidence that the adhesion prevention agent made a difference. No evidence suggests that any of the investigated agents affected live birth rate. Regarding adhesions, participants given a fluid agent during surgery were less likely to form adhesions than participants who did not receive a fluid agent. When fluids and gels were compared with each other, gels appeared to perform better than fluids. No pharmacological agents showed good evidence of causing a significant effect on adhesions. No studies looked at differences in quality of life. All studies apart from one stated that investigators were going to assess serious adverse outcomes associated with the agents, and no adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>For gels, results suggest that for a woman with a 77% risk of developing adhesions without treatment, the risk of developing adhesions after a gel is used would be between 26% and 65%. For a woman with an 83% risk of worsening of adhesions after no treatment at initial surgery, the chance when a gel is used would be between 16% and 73%. Similarly, for hydroflotation fluids in a woman with an 84% chance of developing adhesions with no treatment, the risk of developing adhesions when hydroflotation fluid is used would be between 53% and 73%.</P>
<P>Fluids and gels appear to be effective in reducing adhesions, but more information is needed to determine whether this affects pelvic pain, live birth rate, quality of life and long-term complications such as bowel obstruction. Further large, high-quality studies should be conducted in which investigators use the standard way of measuring adhesions as developed by the American Fertility Society (the modified AFS score).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence: </B>The quality of the evidence ranged from low to high. The main reasons for downgrading of evidence were imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and poor reporting of study methods.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-25 18:44:21 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-nine trials were included (3227 participants), and nine were excluded. One study examined pelvic pain and found no evidence of a difference between use of hydroflotation agents and no treatment. We found no evidence that any of the antiadhesion agents significantly affected the live birth rate. When gels were compared with no treatment or with hydroflotation agents at second-look laparoscopy (SLL), fewer participants who received a gel showed a worsening adhesion score when compared with those who received no treatment (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.57, P value 0.005, two studies, 58 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) and with those given hydroflotation agents (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.66, P value 0.003, two studies, 342 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence). Participants who received steroids were less likely to have a worsening adhesion score (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.58, P value 0.0008, two studies, 182 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, low-quality evidence). Participants were less likely to have adhesions at SLL if they received a hydroflotation agent or gel than if they received no treatment (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.55, P value &lt; 0.00001, four studies, 566 participants, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence; OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.56, P value 0.0006, four studies, 134 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence, respectively). When gels were compared with hydroflotation agents, participants who received a gel were less likely to have adhesions at SLL than those who received a hydroflotation agent (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.67, P value 0.001, two studies, 342 women, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, high-quality evidence). No studies evaluated quality of life. In all studies apart from one, investigators stated that they were going to assess serious adverse outcomes associated with treatment agents, and no adverse effects were reported.</P>
<P>Results suggest that for a woman with a 77% risk of developing adhesions without treatment, the risk of developing adhesions after use of a gel would be between 26% and 65%. For a woman with an 83% risk of worsening of adhesions after no treatment at initial surgery, the chance when a gel is used would be between 16% and 73%. Similarly, for hydroflotation fluids for a woman with an 84% chance of developing adhesions with no treatment, the risk of developing adhesions when hydroflotation fluid is used would be between 53% and 73%.</P>
<P>Several of the included studies could not be included in a meta-analysis: The findings of these studies broadly agreed with the findings of the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence, which was assessed using the GRADE approach, ranged from low to high. The main reasons for downgrading of evidence included imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and poor reporting of study methods.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-06-25 13:41:28 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Gels and hydroflotation agents appear to be effective adhesion prevention agents for use during gynaecological surgery, but no evidence indicates that they improve fertility outcomes or pelvic pain, and further research is required in this area. Future studies should measure outcomes in a uniform manner, using the modified American Fertility Society (mAFS) score. Statistical findings should be reported in full.</P>

<P>
<BR/>
</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-06-26 14:51:49 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adhesions are fibrin bands that form as the result of aberrant peritoneal healing (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2001</LINK>). Normally, peritoneal damage causes an inflammatory response; this activates the coagulation cascade, and a fibrin plug is formed over the damaged mesothelium, which is then broken down to reveal regenerated peritoneum. However, in adhesion formation, fibrinolysis of the fibrin plug is decreased and, consequently, a fibrin matrix develops. Adhesions may be defined as &#8216;de novo,&#8217; meaning that<I> </I>they have formed at a location that was previously free from adhesions, or &#8216;re-formed,&#8217; which describes adhesions that recur post adhesiolysis. A variety of factors influence the extent of adhesion formation, including type of surgery performed (i.e. laparoscopic or open), haemostasis and the presence of endometriosis and infection, particularly pelvic inflammatory disease (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>). Although the aetiologies are different, the basic pathogenesis is similar.   </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-06-25 22:05:06 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adhesion prevention agents can be divided into three types: fluid, pharmacological and barrier. This review will examine fluid and pharmacological agents. A separate review evaluates barrier agents.</P>
<P>Fluid agents include both hydroflotation products and gels. Examples of hydroflotation devices are 4% icodextrin solution (Adept, Baxter, Berkshire, UK), an iso-osmolar and non-viscous high molecular weight glucose polymer, and 32% dextran (Hyskon Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), a polysaccharide-containing solution that is no longer approved for use as an antiadhesion agent. Both agents can be used as intraperitoneal irrigants and/or instillants.</P>
<P>Derivatives of hyaluronic acid form the basis of a number of antiadhesion gels. Hyaluronic acid is a linear polysaccharide with repeating disaccharide units composed of sodium D-glucuronate and <I>N</I>-acetyl-D-glucosamine. SepraSpray (Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA) contains hyaluronic acid in addition to carboxymethylcellulose powder and is applied to relevant tissues with the use of a preloaded delivery device. SepraCoat (Genzyme Corporation) is a dilute hyaluronic acid solution that is applied before and after surgery. Hyalobarrier gel (Nordic Pharma, Reading, UK) contains auto-cross-linked hyaluronic acid. Intergel (Gynecare, Lifecore Biomedical, Chaska, MN, USA) contains ferrous hyaluronic acid, although it has been withdrawn from the market. <I>N,O</I>-carboxymethyl chitosan is a derivative of chitin and is similar in structure to hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose. It is formed when the gel and solution components are combined. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based gels are also available. CoSeal (Baxter) is formed by mixing a powder and a liquid intraoperatively, both of which contain PEG and are then applied as a gel to relevant surfaces using a specific instrument. SprayGel (Confluent Surgical Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) is formed by two PEG-containing liquid precursors, which create a cross-linked gel when combined. Intercoat (FzioMed, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA) is an Oxiplex/AP viscoelastic gel composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO), which is very similar to PEG but has a different molecular weight, and carboxymethylcellulose.</P>
<P>Steroids have been used to prevent adhesions and can be administered in a number of ways, including systemically before, during and after surgery; intraperitoneally during surgery; and via hydrotubation postoperatively. Other pharmacological agents used to prevent adhesions include noxytioline, an antibacterial agent; promethazine, an antihistamine; and reteplase, a thrombolytic drug, all of which are instilled intraperitoneally; as well as heparin, an anticoagulant used for intraoperative irrigation. A nasal gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) has also been used preoperatively and postoperatively.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-06-25 22:06:53 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hyaluronic acid is a major component of many body tissues and fluids, where it provides physically supportive and mechanically protective roles (<LINK REF="STD-Johns-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Johns 2001</LINK>). PEG is a polymer; when the two PEG-containing liquids are sprayed simultaneously, they form a cross-linked gel. Gels are thought to decrease adhesion formation mainly by preventing denuded tissues from touching.</P>
<P>Steroids and antihistamines (e.g. promethazine) act as immunomodulating agents and were used in the belief that they promote fibrinolysis during healing, without hindering the healing process. GnRHa may work by decreasing oestrogen-related growth factors and promoting fibroblasts. Fluid agents such as icodextrin and dextran work through the act of hydroflotation, whereby the fluid separates raw opposing surfaces until the healing process has been completed. Fluid agents are believed to remain in the peritoneal cavity for several days, which is considered a sufficient length of time, given that adhesions form within eight days of surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Diamond-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diamond 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hosie--2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hosie 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-06-26 14:56:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adhesiolysis is the only available treatment for adhesions, although controversy regarding its efficacy is ongoing (<LINK REF="REF-Hammoud-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammoud 2004</LINK>). The focus of adhesion management is now prevention. Intraperitoneal adhesions are associated with considerable co-morbidity and have large economic and public health repercussions. They are the most common complication of gynaecological surgery, forming in 50% to 100% of women (<LINK REF="REF-diZerega-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">diZerega 1994</LINK>). Women present with the secondary effects of adhesions including dyspareunia, subfertility, bowel obstruction and chronic pelvic pain, although the latter has a controversial association with adhesions, as no correlation with extent of adhesions and severity of pain is apparent. Nevertheless, these consequences can greatly decrease a woman&#8217;s well-being and require further surgery. Subsequent surgery in women with adhesions is more difficult, often takes longer and is associated with a higher complication rate. It is estimated that in the first year after lower abdominal surgery, the cost of adhesion-related readmissions in the UK is £24.2 million, which increases to £95.2 million over the subsequent nine years (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 2002</LINK>). The Surgical and Clinical Adhesions Research (SCAR) study found that 5% (n = 245) of readmissions 10 years after open gynaecological surgery were due to adhesions (<LINK REF="REF-Lower-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lower 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lower-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lower 2004</LINK>). An English study estimated that the National Health Service (NHS) could save £700,000 per year if an antiadhesion agent that reduced adhesions by 25% and cost £110 was used or, at worst, that this approach would be cost-neutral (<LINK REF="REF-Cheong-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheong 2011</LINK>).</P>

</I>
</P>
<P>Of the 29 included studies, 19 were conducted at multiple centres and 10 at a single centre. Nine were conducted in the USA, six in Europe, two in the USA/Europe, two in the Netherlands, three in Australia, one in Sweden, two in Italy and one in Germany/Canada/Netherlands/Antilles; three studies did not state their location.</P>
<P>Results of nine of the included trials could not be entered into the meta-analysis because the data were not reported in an appropriate format. In some cases, the study authors used different ways of assessing adhesions, such as reporting only individual sections of the mAFS, as in <LINK REF="STD-Hellebrekers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hellebrekers 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Diamond-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Diamond 2003</LINK>, or the adhesion area (cm<SUP>2</SUP>), as in <LINK REF="STD-Coddington-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Coddington 2009</LINK>. Another reason why studies could not be entered was that complete statistical data were not published, for example, <LINK REF="STD-Thornton-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Thornton 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenberg-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenberg 1984</LINK> did not report standard deviations (SDs) or standard errors of the mean (SEMs), and although <LINK REF="STD-Fossum-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Fossum 2011</LINK> reported the outcomes we were examining, results were displayed on a graph without actual numbers stated at any point in the text. <LINK REF="STD-DiZerega-2007" TYPE="STUDY">DiZerega 2007</LINK> was not entered into the meta-analysis, as investigators reported only the effect that the antiadhesion agent had on AFS endometriosis score, and as the results were presented per adnexa, not per participant.

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mettler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mettler 2008</LINK>) was at high risk for reporting bias. The authors of the study decided "in hindsight" to change the primary outcome scoring method from the total mAFS score, as stated in the original protocol, to the mAFS of the posterior uterus, as discussed during data analysis. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis was conducted and found that excluding <LINK REF="STD-Mettler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mettler 2008</LINK> made no difference to the direction of treatment effect. Thus the study was excluded from analysis. Twenty-five studies were at low risk for reporting bias, and three studies did not provide sufficient information to allow judgement on reporting bias risk.</P>

A potential source of bias in <LINK REF="STD-Jansen-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 1988</LINK> was that the practice of adding hydrocortisone sodium succinate to the irrigation solution was stopped after 46 participants had received it because a possible detrimental effect was reported in an earlier study.

The study by <LINK REF="STD-Ten-Broek-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ten Broek 2012</LINK> was "prematurely ended due to financial and organizational reasons.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 16:18:24 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pelvic pain as an outcome was reported by one study evaluating a hydroflotation agent that reported no evidence of an effect. No evidence suggested that any agent significantly affected live birth rate. Hydroflotation agents and gel agents (including those containing hyaluronic acid, PEG and PEO) compared with no treatment significantly reduced the likelihood of adhesions at second-look laparoscopy. Gel agents compared with no treatment also lowered the mean adhesion score and led to fewer participants with a worse adhesion score. When gel and hydroflotation agents were compared, participants receiving a gel were less likely to have adhesions present and had a lower mean adhesion score. Noxytioline, heparin and promethazine were found to have no significant effect on adhesion formation, apart from steroids, which were found to decrease the likelihood of worsening in adhesion score (compared with no treatment or placebo). No evidence was found of a higher rate of clinical pregnancy, miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy for any of the interventions. According to one study, steroids improved the adhesion score, but no other agents improved the adhesion score. Quality of life outcomes were not reported. The fluid and pharmacological agents examined in this review appeared to be safe; investigators in all included studies apart from one stated that they were going to assess serious adverse outcomes that may be due to these agents, and none were reported. Several studies could not be included in the meta-analysis but were included within the review; the findings of these studies were broadly consistent with the findings of our meta-analyses.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-06-26 16:19:32 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Adhesion formation is a complex process that is affected by many factors. The ongoing pathological process, the magnitude of surgical insult, infection and haemostasis after surgery may influence the formation of adhesions after surgery. The studies used in this review included heterogeneous participants with diverse gynaecological pathology who were undergoing both minimal access procedures and open surgery. In addition, some studies looked at adhesion prophylaxis as a primary prevention of de novo adhesions after surgery, whilst others looked at secondary prevention after surgical adhesiolysis to prevent re-formation. Unfortunately a subanalysis comparing the effects of antiadhesion agents on de novo adhesions versus re-formed adhesions could not be conducted, as too few studies discriminated between the different types of adhesions.</P>
<P>Only one study explored pelvic pain. It is important to note that although a causal relationship has been established between adhesions and infertility (or bowel obstruction), the correlation between adhesions and pelvic pain is uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Hammoud-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hammoud 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies recorded live birth rate, although these were mainly the earlier studies, conducted in 1984, 1985 and 2003.</P>
<P>A gap in knowledge has been noted regarding the effects that antiadhesion agents have on quality of life, as no studies were found that examined this.</P>
<P>Studies included in this review were performed in Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and Columbia. These results are thought to be applicable to developed countries.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-06-26 16:21:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Quality ranged from low to high. The main reasons for downgrading of evidence were imprecision (small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals) and poor reporting of study methods.</P>
<P>Only one of the included studies was considered to have a high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Mettler-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Mettler 2008</LINK>) regarding both performance and detection bias. Pilot studies were included, and although eight studies performed a power calculation, most studies were not statistically powered to detect differences between treatments, although this fact would not have affected internal validity. The results of a number of studies could not be included because of the way researchers assessed adhesions. Study authors were contacted for complete results so they could be included in the meta-analyses, but from most, no reply was received. Despite the fact that the American Fertility Society developed a scoring system and advised that it be used in trials, this was not the case, and the SMD had to be used or, as mentioned, results could not be used. The review authors are not aware of one measurement shown to have more bearing on clinical outcomes than another. The different methods of reporting adhesions also led to a variety of similar secondary outcomes investigated regarding measurement of adhesions to allow maximum study inclusion. Additionally, and unfortunately, several studies could not be included in the meta-analysis because statistical data were reported incompletely, thus limiting our meta-analysis. Additionally, the wide variety of methods used to measure adhesions meant that some studies could not be included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Jansen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Jansen 1990</LINK> was included in the previous version, and the same data have been used in this review. Results were obtained from the study author, but little information was available on the characteristics of the study; therefore these results should also be interpreted with caution.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-06-26 14:42:05 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The review authors made every effort to identify all studies that should be considered for inclusion. Since the time of the previous review, the necessary detail required for inclusion in Cochrane reviews has increased substantially. Although the previously included studies were all reassessed for bias, some information was required from the study authors themselves. We attempted to contact them but to no avail.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-06-27 09:08:47 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review with meta-analysis of the efficacy of auto-cross-linked hyaluronan gel for adhesion prevention in laparoscopy and hysteroscopy was identified. It concluded that the gel prevented both intraperitoneal adhesions after laparoscopic myomectomy and intrauterine adhesions after hysteroscopic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Mais-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mais 2012</LINK>). A Cochrane review analysing adhesion prevention after non-gynaecological abdominal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2009</LINK>) included a single study (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2006</LINK>) looking at fluid and pharmacological agents. In this study, participants underwent surgery in which the gastrointestinal tract was opened. An unacceptably higher rate of postoperative complications was reported for participants receiving 0.5% ferric hyaluronate gel. Recruitment was suspended and efficacy was not assessed. Both the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee have published documents stating that evidence of efficacy for fluid or pharmacological agents was insufficient (<LINK REF="REF-ASRM-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASRM 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2010</LINK>). The Anti-Adhesions in Gynaecology Expert Panel for the European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy has published guidelines to encourage the adoption of adhesion reduction strategies, advising consideration of agents with data supporting safety and efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-De-Wilde-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Wilde 2012</LINK>). The same panel published a consensus position that is consistent with the conclusion of our review that evidence for pharmacological agents is lacking, with gels and 4% icodextrin showing efficacy in reducing adhesions (<LINK REF="REF-De-Wilde-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Wilde 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-06-26 14:45:44 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, hydroflotation and gel agents appear beneficial in reducing adhesion formation after gynaecological surgery, compared with no treatment. However, a large gap in evidence has been identified regarding actual effects on clinical outcomes, which are more important to patients than the extent of their adhesions.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-06-26 16:24:31 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies evaluating antiadhesion agents should report outcomes in a uniform way, using the mAFS. The statistics should be reported in full, as is good practice. The effects that adhesion prevention agents and adhesions themselves have on pelvic pain, live birth rate and quality of life should be explored in greater detail. Knowledge regarding the effects that different adhesion prevention strategies have on various patient subgroups (e.g. patients with and without active endometriosis or PID) and differences noted between de novo and re-formed adhesions is also required. The longer-term effects regarding outcomes such as small bowel obstruction should be evaluated.</P>

<P>We decided to alter the outcomes slightly from the previous version of the review, so that the primary outcomes focus on what is most important to patients, rather than on adhesion formation, which has little correlation with symptoms experienced. A subanalysis comparing the effects of antiadhesion agents on de novo adhesions versus re-formed adhesions was planned, although it was not performed because of lack of data.</P>
