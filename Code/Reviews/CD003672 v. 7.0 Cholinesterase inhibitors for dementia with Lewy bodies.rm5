<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The characteristic features of dementia with Lewy bodies are dementia, marked fluctuation of cognitive ability, early and persistent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. Other symptoms are repeated falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, and hallucinations in other modalities. This combination of features can be particularly difficult to manage, as antipsychotic drugs used to treat hallucinations, delusions and agitation will worsen Parkinsonian symptoms. The one included trial (of rivastigmine compared with placebo on 120 patients) showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 20 weeks. A possible beneficial effect on neuropsychiatric features was found only in analysis of observed cases, and may therefore be due to bias.<BR/>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was first described in 1983, and clinical diagnostic criteria were published in the early to mid 1990s. It has been suggested DLB may account for up to 15-25% of cases of dementia among people aged over 65, although autopsy suggests much lower rates. Characteristic symptoms are dementia, marked fluctuation of cognitive ability, early and persistent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. Falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, and hallucinations in other modalities are also common. This combination of features can be difficult to manage as neuroleptics can make the Parkinsonian and cognitive symptoms worse. There is evidence to suggest that the cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial in this disorder; small case series indicate that cholinesterase inhibitors are safe, and will improve both cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 25 February 2002 using the terms 'Lewy body', 'Lewy bodies' and 'Lewy'. This register contains records from all major health care databases and trial databases and is updated regularly.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized, double-blindtrials in which treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors was administered and compared with alternative interventions in patients with DLB are included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two reviewers (TP, RW) independently assessed quality of trials according to criteria described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Each drug was to be examined separately, and together as a group. We also analysed data by time to outcome measurement; short-term (up to one month), medium term (one month up to six months) and long term (Six months and longer).</P>
<P>The primary outcome measures of interest are in the following areas:neuropsychiatric features. i.e. psychiatric symptoms and behavioural disturbances, cognitive function, activities of daily living, global assessments, quality of life, including maintaining role and social functioning, effect on carers, safety as measured by incidence of adverse events and side effects, acceptability of treatment as measured by withdrawal from trials, and by patient/carer assessment, institutionalization and death.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>There was one included trial of rivastigmine compared with placebo on 120 patients. </P>
<P>Neuropsychiatric Inventory<BR/>The 10-item test found no significant difference between the two groups in change of scores from baseline using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis at 20 weeks and last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis. The treatment effect was statistically significant in favour of rivastigmine if only observed cases (OC) were analysed (WMD -6.94, 95% CI -11.59 to -2.29, P=0.003). There were similar results for the NPI-4, with only the OC analysis showing a significant superiority of rivastigmine to placebo at 20 weeks (WMD -3.75, 95%CI -6.62 to -0.88, P=0.01).</P>
<P>MMSE:<BR/>Analysis of these results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 20 weeks.</P>
<P>CGC-plus:<BR/>Analysis of the proportion of patients who had no change or became worse found no statistically significant difference between the two groups at 20 weeks for the ITT, LOCK and OC analyses.</P>
<P>Adverse Events:<BR/>The placebo group experienced significantly fewer adverse events than the treatment group (54/59 vs 46/61,OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.19 to 10.43). However, using ITT analysis of 20-week data, there was no significant difference between the two groups when serious adverse events were considered.<BR/>There were no significant differences in death rates between the two groups at 20 weeks.</P>
<P>Drop-out Rates:<BR/>Analysis of these results showed no difference between the two groups at 20 weeks using ITT analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies who suffer from behavioural disturbance or psychiatric problems may benefit from rivastigmine if they tolerate it, but the evidence is weak. Further trials using rivastigmine are needed, as are trials of other cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia with Lewy bodies.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-28 14:31:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-28 14:30:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>Dementia with Lewy bodies was first described as a pathologically distinct entity in 1983, (<LINK REF="REF-Yoshimura-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yoshimura 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kosaka-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kosaka 1984</LINK>), and was originally called Diffuse Lewy Body Disease. Lewy bodies were discovered by Frederick Lewy in the basal ganglia of people with Parkinson's disease, but in dementia with Lewy bodies they are found also in the cerebral cortex. Lewy bodies are intracytoplasmic aggregates formed from damaged cytoskeletal components. They stain pink with standard haematoxylin and eosinophil staining but are more readily seen using the more recently developed anti-ubiquitin immunohistochemistry.<BR/>
<BR/>Clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB were published in the early to mid-1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Luis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Luis 1999</LINK>). Dementia affects approximately 5% of people over the age of 65, and the limited evidence on clinical prevalence suggests DLB accounts for 15 to 25% of cases of dementia in older people (<LINK REF="REF-Ballard-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballard 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holmes-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holmes 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shergill-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shergill 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rahkonen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rahkonen 2003</LINK>), which would make it the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Diagnostic criteria are subject to considerable observer error and much lower estimates of prevalence have been reported from autopsy studies (<LINK REF="REF-MRC-CFAS-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MRC CFAS 2001</LINK>). Its characteristic features are dementia, marked fluctuation of cognitive ability, early and persistent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. Dementia also occurs concomitantly in some cases of Parkinson's disease, and the relationship between this syndrome and DLB remains uncertain. Other symptoms that support the diagnosis are repeated falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, and hallucinations in other modalities. This combination of features can be particularly difficult to manage, as antipsychotic drugs used to treat hallucinations, delusions and agitation will worsen Parkinsonian symptoms through the mechanism of dopamine blockade, and possibly worsen cognitive functioning by their anticholinergic activity.</P>
<P>Enhancing cholinergic activity using cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial in DLB for a number of reasons;<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cholinesterase inhibitors improve cognitive functioning and clinicians' global ratings in mild to moderate AD when compared with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Birks-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2001a</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Birks-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birks 2001b</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Olin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olin 2001</LINK>). Some of the patients in these clinical trials met the diagnostic criteria for DLB (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Ser-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Ser 2000a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>DLB patients have a marked decrease in cholinergic functioning, which is greater than that seen in AD (<LINK REF="REF-Langlais-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langlais 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Perry-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 1994</LINK>), and the enzyme choline acetyltransferase is lower in DLB than AD (<LINK REF="REF-Samuel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Samuel 1997</LINK>). Therefore, the key neuropathological defect that is targeted by cholinesterase inhibitors is present in both AD and DLB. Moreover, the lower cholinergic functioning in DLB may indicate a greater potential improvement from these drugs than that seen in AD.</LI>
<LI>There are fewer neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, and less neuronal loss in DLB than AD (<LINK REF="REF-Lippa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippa 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Lippa-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lippa 1994</LINK>). This suggests that cortical neurons in DLB are more viable than those in AD, and could be more responsive to cholinergic stimulation.</LI>
<LI>Small case series indicate that cholinesterase inhibitors are safe, and will improve both cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB (<LINK REF="STD-McKeith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKeith 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shea-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shea 1998</LINK>).</LI>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 14:31:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Collins">
<P>
<B>
<BR/>Selection of studies:</B>
<BR/>Two reviewers (TP, RW) independently discarded citations judged irrelevant on the basis of the title of the publication and its abstract. The criteria for exclusion were: the studies did not use a cholinesterase inhibitor, were not clinical trials, or did not relate to DLB. Two reviewers (TP, RW) independently selected the trials from the culled citation list for initial inclusion in the review, and reasons for exclusion were presented in the review. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Further information was sought from authors of the studies when required.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Assessment of methodological quality:</B>
<BR/>Reviewers (TP, RW) independently assessed quality of trials according to criteria described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The reviewers regarded selection bias as particularly important. Studies were only included if participants were truly randomized, or stratified then randomized, to the treatment groups to be compared. Studies that did not conceal assignment were excluded, as lack of concealment can be associated with bias (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Shulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shulz 1995</LINK>). Inadequate concealment includes; randomization by alternation, the use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week, and any procedure transparent before allocation (such as an open list of random numbers). We indicated whether allocation concealment was adequate, unclear, inadequate, or not used. If this information was unclear from the study reports, we contacted the authors for clarification. Disagreements between the two reviewers (TP, RW) were resolved by discussion among all three reviewers (TP, RW, AB).</P>
<P>Other sources of bias were considered on a trial by trial basis, and studies excluded if all three reviewers (TP, RW, AB) agreed that there was likelihood of significant bias. In these instances, the reasons for exclusion were specified. Types of bias include; performance bias (systematic differences in care provided apart from the intervention being evaluated), attrition bias (systematic differences in withdrawals from the trial) and detection bias (systematic differences in outcome assessment). We conducted sensitivity analysis on any included trials where there was possible bias.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Data extraction:<BR/>
</B>Data were extracted from the published reports. The summary statistics required for each trial and each outcome for continuous data are the mean change from baseline, the standard error of the mean change, and the number of patients for each treatment group at each assessment. Where changes from baseline are not reported, the mean, standard deviation and the number of patients for each treatment group at each time point were extracted if available.<BR/>For binary data the numbers in each treatment group and the numbers experiencing the outcome of interest were sought.<BR/>The baseline assessment is defined as the latest available assessment prior to randomization, but no longer than two months earlier.<BR/>Data from titration phases prior to the randomized phase, or from open-label follow-up periods, were not used to assess safety or efficacy because patients were not randomized or treatments concealed.<BR/>TP and RW extracted data independently and resolved disagreement by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Rating scales:</B>
<BR/>A wide range of rating scales is available to measure outcomes in mental health trials. These scales vary in quality and many are poorly validated. The reviewers excluded data generated by the use of unpublished rating scales or from scales without established reliability and validity. In addition, the rating scales were either a self-report or completed by an independent rater or relative. The standards for instruments may become more stringent in future editions of this review.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Intention-to-treat analysis: </B>
<BR/>For each outcome measure, data were sought on every patient assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the data were sought irrespective of compliance, whether or not the patient was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not available in the publications, "on-treatment" or the data of those who complete the trial were sought and indicated as such. <U>
<BR/>
</U>
<BR/>
<B>Data analysis: </B>
<BR/>The outcomes measured in clinical trials of dementia and cognitive impairment often arise from ordinal rating scales. Where the rating scales used in the trials have a reasonably large number of categories (more than 10) the data were treated as continuous outcomes arising from a normal distribution.</P>
<P>Summary statistics (n, mean and standard deviation) were required for each rating scale at each assessment time for each treatment group in each trial for change from baseline.<BR/>The meta-analysis requires the combination of data from the trials that may not use the same rating scale to assess an outcome. The measure of the treatment difference for any outcome is the weighted mean difference when the pooled trials use the same rating scale or test, and the standardised mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the standard deviation when they use different rating scales or tests.</P>
<P>For binary outcomes, such as clinical improvement or no clinical improvement, the odds ratio is used to measure treatment effect.</P>
<P>For a meta-analysis a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials is calculated and an overall estimates of the treatment difference is presented. In all cases the overall estimate from a fixed effects model is presented and a test for heterogeneity using a standard chi-square statistic performed. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model is used. If, however, there is evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect between trials then either only homogeneous results are pooled, or a random-effects model used (in which case the confidence intervals are broader than those of a fixed-effects model).</P>
<P>We intended to carry out meta-analyses for each cholinesterase inhibitors separately and pooled. We also analysed data by time to outcome measurement; short-term (up to one month), medium term (one month up to six months) and long term (Six months and longer).<U>

<P>One trial was included (<LINK REF="STD-McKeith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKeith 2000</LINK>), comparing rivastigmine with placebo. Rivastigmine was started at a dose of 1.5 mg twice a day, titrated to a maximum of 6mg twice daily. The titration lasted up to 8 weeks. The mean daily stable dose at was 9.4 mg. The total period of randomised treatment was 20 weeks. The baseline demographic characteristics were similar in treatment and placebo groups. The mean age was 74 years, 52% male in the rivastigmine group and 61% in the placebo group. The mean MMSE scores were 17.9 and 17.8 in the rivastigmine and placebo groups respectively. Most patients had one or more co-existing medical conditions; musculoskeletal (28%), cardiovascular (28%), gastrointestinal (21%) and psychiatric (18%). The most common concomitant drugs were neurotropic agents, including dopaminergic drugs (30%), hypnotics and sedatives (25% in the rivastigmine group, 15% in the placebo group), and antidepressants (19% and 23% in rivastigmine and placebo groups respectively). For other details of the trial, see the table of included studies.</P>

<LI>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1994</LINK>). The NPI is a relatively brief interview assessing 10 behavioural disturbances; delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, and aberrant motor behaviour. Scores range from 1 (normal) to 144 (severely disturbed). The NPI-4 is a four item version, which is the sum of scores for dysphoria, apathy, delusions and hallucinations. This cluster of symptoms was identified as being characteristic of Lewy Body Dementia. (<LINK REF="REF-Del-Ser-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Del Ser 2000a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (<LINK REF="REF-Folstein-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Folstein 1975</LINK>). The MMSE evaluates cognition in five areas: orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed recall and language.

<LI>Clinical Global Change - plus (CGC-plus) (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>).

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The included study (<LINK REF="STD-McKeith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKeith 2000</LINK>) used a computer generated block-randomization technique; the investigator and patient were blind to allocation. There was a 23% drop-out rate, the main cause being adverse events. The analysis was either on an intention-to-treat basis or used the last observation carried forwards (see table of results for details). A number of neuropsychological tests were excluded from the analysis, owing to the large number of patients unable to complete the tests (e.g. Digit Symbol Substitution Task, Trail making test, Stroop congruent test, Block Design Test), which would have led to biased results.</P>

The published p-values for the comparisons between treatment groups refer to the results of nonparametric analyses using Koch's method (<LINK REF="REF-Koch-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1982</LINK>), and not to the comparisons between treatment resulting from the parametric analyses of covariance. It is not possible to estimate the magnitude of treatment effects from the non-parametric analyses, and the published treatment effects arise from the parametric analyses. <BR/>The two sets of p-values are presented in<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Although the p-values for the completers analyses are similar, the p-values for the non-parametric analyses are much smaller for the ITT and LOCF analyses.The use of Koch's method was not reported and discussed in<LINK REF="STD-McKeith-2000" TYPE="STUDY">McKeith 2000</LINK>but the nonparametric method was considered the more appropriate method for the analysis of the NPI data (personal communication Novartis)</P>
<P>KOCH'S METHOD FOR NONPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE<BR/>Parametric analysis of covariance depends on several assumptions, normality of error terms, equality of error variances for the treatment groups, equality of the regression slopes for the regression lines of the dependent variable on the covariate for each treatment group, linearity of regression. Rank analysis of covariance is used when these assumptions may not be satisfied. The method has been described by <LINK REF="REF-Koch-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 1982</LINK>. The technique is used to carry out nonparametric comparisons between treatments, after adjusting for one or more covariates. <BR/>The dependent variable and covariate are replaced by the rank scores. The residuals from the regression of the dependent variable on the covariate are saved. A Mantel-Haenszel statistic is calculated from the contingency table of treatment group x residuals. This statistic allows the mean values of the treatment groups to be compared, but the magnitude of a treatment effect cannot be calculated.<BR/>

<DISCUSSION>
<P>At the beginning of this review we outlined the physiological reasons why cholinesterase Inhibitors might be useful in the treatment of dlb and set out to look for evidence of efficacy in controlled clinical trials. At the present time there is only one RCT reported. This investigated the effectiveness of rivastigmine only and therefore we have not been able to include data about the other cholinesterase Inhibitors. The report of the trial paper explored 6 of the 10 outcome measures that we had identified.</P>
<P>The only positive finding was that taking rivastigmine was associated with a significant improvement in neuropsychiatric features of DLB when analysis was restricted to observed cases . However, this result was not significant when all patients entering the study were included in the analysis (intention-to-treat analysis, ITT). The two alternative explanations are that taking the drug has a beneficial effect that is too weak so be detected in the ITT analysis , or that there was a disproportionate number of non-responders in the group of patients who dropped out of the treatment arm of the trial. The former explanation is possible, as there was no significant difference in acceptability, as indicated by drop-out rates, between rivastigmine and placebo. The rate of serious adverse events showed no significant differences, although overall there were more adverse events in the rivastigmine group. It is difficult to interpret the differences between the non-parametric and parametric analyses of the NPI outcomes. These mostly affect the LOCF analyses, and our conclusions are not changed. <BR/>
<BR/>Rivastigmine did not show a significant benefit on cognitive functioning compared with placebo.</P>
<P>We found no data on the effect of rivastigmine in DLB on activities of daily living, quality of life, effect on carers or institutionalization.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is weak evidence that patients with DLB who suffer from neuropsychiatric symptoms may benefit from a trial of rivastigmine, and it is reasonably well tolerated. We are not aware of any other controlled trials that demonstrate the efficacy of other medication for these problems in DLB. Neuroleptics are often used for psychotic symptoms in dementia, but need to be given with caution to people with DLB owing to their high sensitivity to extrapyramidal side effects. Rivastigmine may provide an alternative.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Results from measures of neuropsychiatric symptoms were compatible with somesuperiority of rivastigmine over placebo, but were not statistically significant using intention-to-treat analysis. This could suggest that the effects are so small that the included study lacked sufficient power to show a significant result. Further studies using rivastigmine would be helpful to see if this interpretation is sustained by a future meta-analysis. Trial evidence for the effects of the other cholinesterase inhibitors on LBD is not available, and as we cannot assume the results will be similar to rivastigmine, studies using these drugs are needed. Trials of longer duration are also required, as the implications for longer term use of cholinesterase inhibitors are unclear. Future trials should consider including outcome measures for activities of daily living, quality of life, effect on carers, and institutionalization.</P>
