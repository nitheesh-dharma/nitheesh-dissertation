<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-10-13 22:07:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the available information regarding the added effect of corticosteroid eye drops in people with bacterial keratitis (corneal ulcers) who were also being treated with antibiotics.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Bacterial keratitis, or corneal inflammation due to bacterial infection, is a sight-threatening condition. Contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery have been linked to bacterial keratitis. Antibiotic eye drops are the standard treatment for eyes with bacterial keratitis. Corticosteroid eye drops also may be used to control the inflammation from infection. Eye doctors disagree about whether corticosteroid eye drops should be used with antibiotics to treat this condition due to potential side effects of using steroids in the eye.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We found four studies in which antibiotics alone had been compared with antibiotics plus corticosteroids for the treatment of bacterial keratitis. These studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa, and included a total of 612 eyes of 611 participants. The largest study included 500 participants followed for one year. The three smaller studies followed participants for two to three months. The evidence is current to July 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>None of the four studies reported an important difference between topical corticosteroid therapy and placebo or control treatment for reduction in ulcer size, change in visual acuity, adverse events, or quality of life. One study reported that healing or cure time in the steroid group was slower than the placebo group (for every 100 people cured in the control group, only 47 were cured in the steroid group during the same time period), but the largest study did not report any difference (for every 100 people cured in the control group, 92 were cured in the steroid group during the same time interval). For adverse events, none of the studies found a difference between the two groups, except that one study reported that more eyes in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. We did not find any information on economic outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Generally, the quality of the evidence based on the four studies we identified was moderate due to the proportions of participants who were not included in the final study analyses and the inconsistency of outcomes assessed across the four studies. In addition, three studies enrolled too few participants (30 to 42) to reach scientifically valid conclusions.</P>

<P>Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular infectious disease that can lead to severe visual disability. Risk factors for bacterial corneal infection include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery.

<P>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2014), the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials (<I>m</I>RCT) (<A HREF="http://www.controlled-trials.com/">www.controlled-trials.com</A>), ClinicalTrials.gov (<A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</A>) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (<A HREF="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en">www.who.int/ictrp/search/en</A>). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 14 July 2014. We also searched the Science Citation Index to identify additional studies that had cited the only trial included in the original version of this review, reference lists of included trials, earlier reviews, and the American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 22:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year. These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa.</P>
<P>All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group. The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94). However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11). For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups. The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90). One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available). We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes.</P>
<P>Although the four trials were generally of good methodological design, all trials had considerable losses to follow-up (10% or more) in the final analyses. Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-10-13 22:04:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is inadequate evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive topical corticosteroids compared with no topical corticosteroids in improving visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratitis. Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid, but may be due to insufficient power to detect a treatment effect.</P>

<P>Keratitis, also known as corneal inflammation or corneal ulcers, is a potentially sight-threatening condition that may have infectious or non-infectious etiology. Keratitis presents as a diagnostic challenge due to the large number of possible causes that may lead to this condition. Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular infectious disease that can lead to severe visual loss. Risk factors for bacterial corneal infection include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, corneal trauma, and previous ocular or eyelid surgery. Certain ocular diseases and systemic conditions that depress the immune system also increase the possibility of bacterial keratitis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>Approximately 30,000 cases of microbial keratitis, which includes bacterial, fungal, and parasitic causes, are diagnosed annually in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Pepose-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pepose 1992</LINK>). The proportion of people who develop corneal blindness secondary to bacterial keratitis is high in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chirambo-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chirambo 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Feng-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feng 1990</LINK>). The spectrum of bacterial keratitis also may be influenced by geographic and climate factors. Many differences in keratitis profile have been noted between populations living in rural or urban areas, in western or in developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burton-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaliamurthy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaliamurthy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schaefer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaefer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vajpayee-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vajpayee 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Certain bacteria that make up the normal ocular flora are usually implicated in cases of infectious keratitis. Due to the proximity of these organisms to the cornea, they are easily inoculated into damaged or abnormal corneal tissues. Host defenses are usually sufficient to prevent infection but once these are violated, for example, in trauma or debilitating diseases, florid bacterial contamination of ocular tissue may occur. Common causative organisms include staphylococci and streptococci, inherent residents of the ocular milieu (<LINK REF="REF-Mi_x00f1_o-de-Kaspar-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miño de Kaspar 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moeller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moeller 2005</LINK>). In the past several years there has been an increase in the number of contact lens wearers (<LINK REF="REF-Poggio-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poggio 1989</LINK>). The incidence of bacterial keratitis secondary to use of extended-wear contact lenses is about 8000 cases per year. Multiple organisms have been isolated from cases of microbial keratitis in association with contact lens wear (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Poggio-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poggio 1989</LINK>). A higher prevalence of gram-negative rods, such as pseudomonas, was reported in contact lens wearers compared to patients who do not use contact lenses (<LINK REF="REF-Dart-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dart 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schein-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schein 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conditions that disrupt ocular homeostasis may set the stage for bacterial contamination of the cornea. Agricultural workers, contact lens wearers, and patients who have received any form of ocular surgery or trauma all have increased risk of bacterial keratitis. Ocular surface disorders such as recurrent erosions and tear film abnormalities, lid abnormalities, and use and abuse of topical medications all predispose to infections. Debilitating diseases, immunocompromised states, and chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs also contribute to this disease condition (<LINK REF="REF-Bourcier-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bourcier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Killingsworth-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killingsworth 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musch-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musch 1983</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Presentation and diagnosis</HEADING>
<P>Patients with bacterial keratitis present with unilateral and, in rare instances, bilateral, pain and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia). Corneal epithelial breaks that are associated with ulcers expose corneal nerve endings and contribute to the pain and discomfort that are associated with this condition.</P>
<P>Typically, the anterior segment of the eye is inflamed and congested. Intense and diffuse conjunctival vessel injection is frequently observed. The discharge may be thick and profuse and is often mucoid to purulent in nature. The eyelids may be edematous and swollen and the underlying palpebral conjunctivae inflamed. The infected portion of the cornea usually contains a focal area of stromal infiltrate with an overlying area of epithelial excavation. The infiltrate is often, but not always, well circumscribed with distinct borders. The cornea is edematous and the visual acuity is reduced. The severity of visual loss is dependent on the extent and location of the lesion.</P>
<P>Severe cases of bacterial keratitis lead to profound anterior chamber reaction and hypopyon (an accumulation of pus cells in the anterior chamber). Ciliary body inflammation sometimes causes hypotony (lower intraocular pressure); on the other hand, the presence of inflammatory cells in the aqueous may also clog the trabecular meshwork and increase the intraocular pressure.</P>
<P>Determining the etiology of the keratitis by taking corneal scrapes and appropriate cultures is an essential step before the use of any topical antibiotic. However, empirical therapy need not be withheld until culture results become available. Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut signs that point to a bacterial cause of the keratitis. Patient history and on examination the status of the epithelium, the size and time to diagnosis of the corneal lesions, the degree of the stromal inflammation, the quality and quantity of discharge, and other associated findings all have to be considered to arrive at a presumptive diagnosis.</P>
<P>The yield from microbiological investigation may be low despite direct inoculation of a sample on the culture media. However, the positive culture will guide the ophthalmologist's choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-10-13 21:47:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topical antibiotics constitute the mainstay of treatment in cases of bacterial keratitis, whereas the use of topical corticosteroids remains controversial. The role of topical corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis has been discussed in many studies. Topical steroids are usually given to control inflammation using the smallest possible amount of the drug. Their use requires optimal timing, concomitant antibiotics, and careful follow-up. The effect of treatment on the viability of bacteria in the cornea, corneal wound healing, corneal scarring, increase in intraocular pressure, clinical outcomes, and adverse events warrants comparison between antibiotics alone and antibiotics plus corticosteroids.</P>
<P>Topical fluoroquinolone antibiotics are popular choices for initial broad-spectrum therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Gangopadhyay-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gangopadhyay 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hyndiuk-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyndiuk 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-OSG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">OSG 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parks-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parks 1993</LINK>). However, resistance to these drugs may occur with some organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Schaefer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schaefer 2001</LINK>). The new generation of fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, are currently gaining in popularity and these drugs show promise in the treatment of infectious corneal ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Hyon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kowalski-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kowalski 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dosing of the antibiotic is often dependent on the size of the ulcer and severity of keratitis. In severe cases, subconjunctival, subtenon, or intravenous antibiotics are instituted. Cycloplegic eyedrops may be given to reduce pain and inflammation.</P>
<P>However, the role of topical corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis is less clear.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-08-22 09:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topical corticosteroids have consistently been avoided by many practitioners for fear of causing immunosuppression and, consequently, potentiating bacterial replication. Judicious use of steroids with adequate antibiotic therapy may, however, be beneficial for the patient. Once the micro-organisms have been eliminated and adequate sterilization has been achieved, lessening the inflammatory response through corticosteroids may reduce corneal neovascularization and scarring.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-08-22 09:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Topical steroids are used to control damage from inflammation in bacterial keratitis. Although corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis have been discussed in many published reports, recommendations regarding the type and concentration of corticosteroid, frequency of dosing, optimal timing with respect to the introduction of topical antibiotics, and stage of healing are not consistent. A systematic review of available studies is needed to further understanding of the use of corticosteroids in treating bacterial keratitis and better define their role as an adjunctive treatment modality for bacterial corneal ulcers.</P>
<P>This review is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007 (<LINK REF="REF-Suwan_x002d_apichon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Suwan-apichon 2007</LINK>), where there was only one trial published for the use of topical steroid for keratitis (<LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK>). Over recent years, several additional trials have been conducted and investigated the effectiveness and safety of keratitis (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>), and we included these trials in the data synthesis for this review.

We assessed each domain as 'low risk', 'high risk', or 'unclear' risk of bias. We considered methods employed to address the following risks of bias to determine the methodological quality of included studies:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Selection bias: we assessed random sequence generation and allocation concealment before randomization. Any method of allocation concealment, such as centralized randomization or use of sequential, opaque envelopes, which provided reasonable confidence that the allocation sequence was concealed from participating physicians and patients was to be considered 'low risk'. We assessed trial reports without such explicit mention of a method of allocation concealment for convincing information on adequacy of allocation concealment. Whenever the adequacy of allocation concealment was unclear from the trial report, we contacted the primary investigators for clarification. If they did not respond within a two-week time period, we classified the studies based on available information and will update our classifications when more information becomes available.</LI>
<LI>Performance bias: we assessed masking of participants and care providers with regard to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Detection bias: we assessed masking of outcome assessors with regard to treatment allocation.</LI>
<LI>Attrition bias: we assessed whether rates of follow-up and reasons for loss to follow-up for intervention and control arms were similar and whether all participants were analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. We also examined whether both participants for whom no outcome was collected, and those who received only some or none of their allotted treatment, were included in the analysis. We interpreted the analysis as intention-to-treat only when both the above criteria were fulfilled. We assessed studies following an intention-to-treat analysis as having 'low risk' of attrition bias.</LI>
<LI>Reporting bias: we considered studies that had reported all outcomes as specified in a protocol, clinical trial registry, or in the methods section of the published report as having 'low risk' of reporting bias.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We resolved disagreements through discussion. We contacted the authors of included studies for additional information on issues that we categorized as 'unclear' from information available in the trial reports.

<P>Although different corticosteroids and different antibiotics were used in these four studies, all studies compared antibiotic treatment with versus without corticosteroids. Three studies performed a sample size calculation (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK> estimated that 54 participants (27 participants per arm) would provide 80% power to detect a 4 mm<SUP>2</SUP> difference in ulcer size between groups, with a standard deviation (SD) of 3.3 mm. However, the required sample size was not achieved. <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK> reported that 42 participants (21 participants per arm) would provide 80% power to detect a 0.4 logMAR (four Snellen lines) difference between the two study arms, assuming a SD of 0.4 in the three-month best corrected visual acuity (BCVA); however, due to losses to follow-up, the power was not maintained through the three-month follow-up examination. <LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK> investigators estimated that a sample size of 500 participants (250 per arm) would provide 80% power to detect a 0.20 logMAR (two lines of visual acuity) difference between groups in BCVA three months after enrollment, assuming a SD of 0.65 logMAR for three-month BCVA. The calculation assumed a 20% dropout rate by three months. Only the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) trial had a sample size large enough to detect or rule out an important between-group difference (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>). However, even SCUT was not powered to detect or rule out a difference between management approaches within causative organism-specific subgroups.</P>
<P>A summary table is shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. We also describe the details below:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes (clinical improvement and clinical cure)</HEADING>
<P>For primary outcomes of clinical improvement and clinical cure, the four studies reported data from a total of 529 eyes. Time to re-epithelialization was reported by two studies, but all other outcomes were reported in different ways that precluded quantitative synthesis of the data.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Visual acuity</HEADING>
<P>The four studies reported visual acuity at the last follow-up (ranged from 2 months to 12 months) for 486 eyes. The four studies reported visual acuity measured in different ways and at different time points. In one study, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured on a Snellen chart at different times, then converted to author-defined integer numbers ranging from 2 to 13, and fitted to a line for each participant using a linear regression model (<LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK>). In another study, baseline, three-week, and three-month logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was reported (<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>). In the third study, the investigators reported change of logMAR visual acuity (VA) from baseline to 10 weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK>). The investigators of the largest trial also reported visual acuity change using a linear regression model (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>). Therefore, we were unable to combine the visual acuity outcome data. However, none of the studies reported a significant difference in visual acuity between the treatment groups. A descriptive summary is below:</P>
<P>The original data for <LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK> could not be located by the primary investigator. <LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK> reported 28 eyes for best corrected visual acuity at two months, and that there was no significant difference between the two groups from the regression model.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK> reported logMAR BCVA in 33 eyes of 33 participants at three weeks and three months. In the placebo group, the mean BCVA at enrollment was 1.15 logMAR (SD 0.63); it improved to 0.75 logMAR (SD 0.75) at three weeks and 0.59 logMAR (SD 0.75) at three months. In the steroid-treated group, the mean enrollment visual acuity was 1.28 logMAR (SD 0.54); it improved to 0.66 logMAR (SD 0.68) at three weeks and 0.71 logMAR (SD 0.72) at three months. The baseline BCVA between the two groups was judged to be comparable by the authors of the study report (mean difference (MD) -0.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to 0.22; P value = 0.48). They concluded that, compared to placebo treatment, steroid treatment resulted in 0.19 lower (better) logMAR visual acuity (1.9 lines) at three weeks (95% CI 20.52 to 0.15, P value = 0.26) and 0.09 lower logMAR visual acuity (0.9 line) at three months (95% CI 20.41 to 0.24, P value = 0.60).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK> reported that the mean change of logMAR visual acuity in 26 eyes of 26 participants at 10 weeks was less in the antibiotic alone group than that in the steroid plus antibiotic group (MD 0.42; 95% CI not available; P value = 0.52).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK> reported results from 442 eyes of 442 participants at three months, and 399 eyes of 399 participants at 12 months. Based on a multiple linear regression analysis, the authors concluded that corticosteroids offered no significant improvement compared with placebo with respect to three-month and 12-month BCVA after controlling for enrollment BCVA: change from baseline to three-month follow-up (MD -0.009 logMAR; 95% CI -0.085 to 0.068; P value = 0.82); change from baseline to 12-month follow-up (MD -0.04 logMAR; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.05; P value = 0.39).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Healing rate/ulcer size/time to re-epithelialization</HEADING>
<P>Clinical cure of corneal ulcers was assessed either by quantification of the size of the ulcer or the scar (by the clinician at the slit lamp or by photography) and by evaluating the size of the epithelial defect in order to determine closure or healing of the corneal epithelium. Two studies reported healing rates in 52 eyes (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK> reported similar healing rates: 0.36 mm<SUP>2</SUP> per day in the corticosteroid group and 0.30 mm<SUP>2</SUP> per day in the control group; the difference was neither clinically nor statistically significant. The Kaplan&#8211;Meier analysis of time to healing used in <LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK> showed no difference in healing rates between the two groups: median healing time was eight weeks in the antibiotic-only group versus six weeks in the antibiotic&#8211;steroid group (data not available).</P>
<P>Three studies reported ulcer size at the last follow-up examination in a total of 458 eyes (<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK> measured ulcer size from photographs; the mean difference in change from baseline in the antibiotic group was less than in the steroid group (-1.919 mm<SUP>2</SUP> in the antibiotic-only group versus -4.388 mm<SUP>2</SUP> in the antibiotic-steroid group; P value = 0.56) at 10 weeks. However, mean residual ulcer size at 10 weeks estimated by the clinician at the slit lamp differed between the two groups (-0.789 mm<SUP>2</SUP> for the antibiotic-only group and -4.206 mm<SUP>2</SUP> for the antibiotic-steroid group; P value = 0.05).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK> reported that corticosteroid use was not associated with a difference in infiltrate/scar size at three weeks (MD 0.05 mm<SUP>2</SUP>; 95% CI &#8211;0.09 to 0.15, P value = 0.60), three months (MD 0.06 mm<SUP>2</SUP>; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.17, P value = 0.40), or one year (MD 0.03 mm<SUP>2</SUP>; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.18; P value = 0.69). <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK> reported that steroid treatment was associated with somewhat smaller infiltrate/scar diameter compared with the placebo group at three weeks and three months (differences not available; P value = 0.23 and P value = 0.53 for three weeks and three months respectively).</P>
<P>In two studies, clinical cure ("healing time" or "cure rate") was defined by re-epithelialization at the last follow-up examination; 432 eyes contributed to analysis of this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK> reported that the median time to re-epithelialization was 7.0 days (95% CI 5.5 to 8.5 days) in the placebo arm and 7.5 days (95% CI 5.5 to 8.5 days; P value = 0.25) in the corticosteroid arm (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; P value = 0.44). <LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK> reported that the average time to re-epithelialization was 6.3 (SD 3.1) days in the placebo group and 8.6 (SD 4.7) days in the steroid-treated patients; after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size, the hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.94, P value = 0.03). The heterogeneity was high (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50% and there was poor overlap of confidence intervals on individual estimates), therefore we present the data from the two studies in the forest plot without a pooled analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Given that these two studies have the same inclusion/exclusion criteria for participants, such a high heterogeneity might be due to the differences in baseline characteristics of the participants, such as ulcer size/location/depth (lacking these data for the pilot study), organisms distribution, and population origins (India versus India and the USA).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Four studies, including 612 eyes of 611 participants, contributed data for adverse effects (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK> reported that one eye in each group experienced perforation, corneal thinning, and epithelial breakdown (breakdown of epithelium after initial healing). Two eyes in the control group had uncontrolled infection. Recurrence of infection (recurrence of hypopyon within one week of discharge after adequate treatment of infection) occurred in one eye in the corticosteroid group and two eyes in the control group. Persistent epithelial defect was reported in four eyes in the corticosteroid group and three eyes in the control group. Though the overall number of complications was more in the control group (10/19) compared to that in the corticosteroid group (n = 8/21) (risk ratio (RR) 1.38; 95% CI 0.69 to 2.76), the small number of participants in each group and the high proportion lost to follow-up preclude reliable estimates of complication rates or differences in rates between treatment arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Blair-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Blair 2011</LINK> reported adverse events in two patients. One patient in the antibiotic-steroid group experienced a possible recurrence of the ulcer at week 10 (five weeks after stopping all medications), but repeat culture was negative. One patient in the control group experienced a second corneal ulcer that was confirmed by culture.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Srinivasan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Srinivasan 2009</LINK> found no systemic adverse events. There were four ocular adverse events and all occurred in the control group.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK> reported that there was no significant difference in the total number of adverse events (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). The study also found no cases of other serious adverse event, such as endophthalmitis, intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 35 mm Hg, and myocardial infarction or stroke. The overall RR was 1.15 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.37) for the serious adverse events and 1.18 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.79) for the non-serious adverse events.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Outcomes in the only causative organism-specific subgroup, <I>Nocardia</I> species, were reported in two articles based on the SCUT data (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>). <I>Nocardia</I> species were the third most commonly isolated organism. Lalitha et al reported that there was no difference in visual acuity, time to re-epithelialization, or perforation rates between the corticosteroid and placebo-treated groups. However, in this organism-specific subgroup, the use of corticosteroids was associated with significantly larger infiltrates or scar sizes at three months when compared to keratitis caused by other organisms, suggesting that the use of corticosteroids is not beneficial and may result in worse outcomes regarding corneal infiltrate and scarring when bacterial keratitis is caused by <I>Nocardia</I>.</P>
<P>In the one-year report of the SCUT trial, a regression analysis that used a model that included a <I>Nocardia-</I>treatment arm interaction term found corticosteroid use associated with a mean one-line improvement in BCVA at 12 months among patients with non-<I>Nocardia</I> ulcers (MD -0.10 logMAR; 95% CI -0.19 to -0.02; P value = 0.02). No significant difference was observed in 12-month BCVA for <I>Nocardia</I> ulcers (MD 0.18 logMAR; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.41; P value = 0.16). In the same article, the authors also reported that corticosteroids were associated with larger mean scar size at 12 months among <I>Nocardia</I> ulcers (MD 0.47 mm; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88; P value = 0.02), while no difference was identified for the non-<I>Nocardia</I> ulcers.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-08-22 09:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Microbial keratitis is a potentially sight-threatening condition and an important cause of corneal inflammation. It has been estimated that 500,000 persons develop ulcerative keratitis annually around the world (<LINK REF="STD-Wilhelmus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wilhelmus 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified four randomized controlled trials for inclusion in this review. Based on review of the data from 612 eyes of 611 participants enrolled in those trials, the evidence regarding use of corticosteroids as adjuncts to antibiotics is inconclusive due to the small numbers of participants enrolled in three studies and the large number of enrollees with incomplete outcome data due to losses to follow-up in all four studies.</P>
<P>The investigators of the earliest trial reported no adverse effect when using dexamethasone 0.1% four times a day in addition to topical antimicrobial therapy (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Carmichael-1990">Carmichael 1990</A>). The authors suggested that steroid treatment should be initiated 24 hours after antimicrobial therapy. Other helpful suggestions for clinicians have been proposed by <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Wilhelmus-2002">Wilhelmus 2002</A>.</P>
<P>The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) was a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial that compared prednisolone sodium phosphate (1.0%) to placebo as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of bacterial corneal ulcers (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-SCUT-2012">SCUT 2012</A>). The pilot study for this trial included 42 participants with culture-confirmed bacterial keratitis that were randomized to the same treatments used in SCUT (all participants received topical moxifloxacin 0.5%) (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Srinivasan-2009">Srinivasan 2009</A>). Although corticosteroid treatment resulted in a statistically significant delay in re-epithelialization, no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events at three months was observed.</P>
<P>Although SCUT randomized 500 participants, only 442 participants (88.4%) were evaluated three months later and 399 participants 12 months later (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>). No clinically or statistically significant differences between treatment arms were observed for any outcome in this review. However, more participants in the placebo arm developed mildly increased intraocular pressure (IOP) (&gt; 25 but &lt; 35 mmHg) when compared to the corticosteroid-treated group (P value = 0.04). Notably, subgroup analysis showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with a benefit in visual acuity compared with the placebo group in participants with the worst visual acuity and central ulcer location at baseline. In the SCUT, 56 participants (11%) presented with ulcers caused by <I>Nocardia</I> species. When this subgroup of patients was analyzed separately (Lalitha et al), the use of corticosteroids was associated with a larger infiltrate or scar size at three months and 12 months when compared to placebo.</P>
<P>In SCUT, most patients experienced the majority of BCVA improvement during the first three months after treatment was initiated, although smaller but still significant improvements were observed up to 12 months after starting treatment.</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Blair-2011">Blair 2011</A> found no significant difference between the corticosteroid and placebo groups with respect to residual ulcer size at 10 weeks compared with the baseline size, healing rate, or final BCVA. Only the clinician estimates of ulcer size at the slit lamp provided evidence of benefit of adjunctive corticosteroid.</P>
<P>In summary, the available evidence does not support a benefit of corticosteroid use as adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis. Three studies were small in sample size and possibly underpowered to detect differences. The SCUT trial was designed to detect a difference between groups but the results may have limited generalizability (<LINK REF="STD-SCUT-2012" TYPE="STUDY">SCUT 2012</LINK>). (See '<LINK TAG="AGREEMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</LINK>' section). The available data regarding safety of topical corticosteroid is inconclusive. None of the three small studies found significant differences between groups, but the SCUT trial reported more risk of IOP elevation in the control group. Although three studies were relatively well-designed and had large enough sample sizes to satisfy the power of detection, loss to follow-up was an issue for all included studies. In addition, considering subgroup analyses and the generalizability of findings, one or more well-designed and properly conducted randomized controlled trials are still desirable.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-08-22 09:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As the mainstay of treatment for bacterial keratitis, topical antibiotics are used primarily to eliminate the causative organisms. However, host corneal inflammatory response may in some cases cause more damage than the infection itself. The use of topical corticosteroids in addition to antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of bacterial keratitis has been controversial for over 50 years. Their anti-inflammatory activity may help control the host response, and reduce corneal neovascularization and scarring, thus favoring the clinical outcome. On the other hand, the immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroids may actually promote bacterial replication and slow recovery of the patient. Based on our review, the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid use in bacterial keratitis is inconclusive.</P>

<P>Based on our assessment of trial quality per pre-specified criteria, we judged the overall quality of evidence as moderate. Random sequence generation was adequately performed in all four studies. Masking of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors was achieved in three studies, with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK>. Compared with the protocol, the SCUT trial and its pilot study were consistent in reporting all pre-specified outcomes. We did not find publicly available protocols for the other two studies. Incomplete outcome data was a major issue for all these four studies in that more than 10% of the participants were lost to follow-up and not included in the final analyses, possibly biasing the findings from all four studies and, thus, of this review. The analysis of SCUT data regarding outcomes for <I>Nocardia</I> species organisms was an ancillary analysis and not based on randomization to treatment arm within that subgroup of patients.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-08-22 09:42:00 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We are unaware of any potential biases in the review process. We searched multiple databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) relevant to this review. As part of our search, we screened nearly 500 citations to identify the four RCTs included. Data extracted from reports focused on clinical and functional outcomes and were confirmed by at least two authors. Thus, our conclusion, i.e. that current evidence does not suggest a difference in the effectiveness of topical corticosteroid use adjunctive to antibacterial therapy in bacterial keratitis, is based on established, reproducible methods.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-15 15:36:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Steroids have been implicated as a risk factor for the development of corneal ulcers; however, the use of topical steroids adjunctive to antibiotics is still deliberated today.</P>
<P>Several suggestions have been proposed by authors, such as to delay the use of steroids for at least 24 hours to exclude rapidly deteriorating infections and fungal ulcers (<LINK REF="STD-Carmichael-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Carmichael 1990</LINK>). Other useful suggestions were published by <LINK REF="STD-Wilhelmus-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wilhelmus 2002</LINK>, which included certain recommendations such as to minimize corticosteroid use if inflammation is not near the visual axis and the corneal wound is healing adequately; to avoid the use of topical corticosteroid if the causative micro-organisms are unknown and effective antibacterial therapy cannot be provided; and to continue a topical corticosteroid, usually at a lower frequency or concentration, for patients already justifiably using a topical corticosteroid for another serious ocular condition or inflammatory disease. Despite the fact that all of these recommendations seem prudent and may be useful clinically, they are not supported by any evidence in this review.</P>
<P>In general, authors agree with this review, stating that there is no benefit or harm in using steroids adjunctive to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial keratitis. One publication pointed out that the SCUT may not be applicable to the US population due to several key differences, such as the reduced number of contact lens wearers and the high incidence of trauma in the SCUT patient population, compared to a higher incidence of keratitis due to contact lenses and low incidence of trauma-induced keratitis in western countries (<LINK REF="REF-Tuli-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuli 2013</LINK>).</P>

No conclusive evidence was provided as to the treatment effect of corticosteroids on clinical outcomes. However, the guideline recommended using only the minimum dose of corticosteroid required to alleviate inflammation and to avoid use of corticosteroids when the ulcer is associated with <I>Acanthamoeba, Nocardia</I>, fungus, or HSV (<LINK REF="REF-AAO-Bacterial-Keratitis-PPP-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAO Bacterial Keratitis PPP 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>The effectiveness of corticosteroids as an adjunctive treatment for bacterial keratitis remains unknown at present. The completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are either inconclusive or have limitations when applied to other populations (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-SCUT-2012">SCUT 2012</A>). Two studies reported no benefit of topical steroids in regards to visual acuity, ulcer healing, and re-epithelialization (<A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-Blair-2011">Blair 2011</A>; <A HREF="http://archie.cochrane.org/sections/documents/view?document=953305021509501283&amp;format=REVMAN#STD-SCUT-2012">SCUT 2012</A>). None of the studies reported harmful effects of adding topical steroids to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial corneal ulcers. The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) investigators reported that steroids may be beneficial in some cases, such as central ulcers with severely decreased vision, based on a post hoc subgroup analysis. They also suggested that steroids may be contraindicated in the subgroup of patients that present with <I>Nocardia</I> keratitis.</P>
<P>Although many currently recommend waiting at least 24 hours before instituting corticosteroid therapy, there is no evidence available that argues for or against immediate institution concurrent with antibiotic therapy. Identification of the bacterial pathogen is crucial for appropriate selection of antibiotics. Close observation for complications and wound healing is essential.<BR/>

</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-13 22:02:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in this review have shown neither harm nor benefit from the use of adjunctive steroids together with antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial ulcers. Further, results have not been clear when dealing with severe bacterial keratitis where corneal scarring is of great concern. In addition, a majority of studies (3/4) were inadequately powered to detect a treatment effect. To demonstrate benefits and harms of adjunctive corticosteroid use larger studies, with severe corneal ulcer subgroups, are needed. With modern clinical imaging techniques, the assessment of ulcer severity as well as treatment results should be more reliable. Furthermore, all studies began the use of topical steroids after a minimum of 24 to 48 hours of exclusive antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the early treatment of ulcers with adjunctive steroids has yet to be studied.</P>
<P>Any future trial should be designed with a target sample size calculated based on realistic assumptions regarding the effect size that could be expected based on currently available estimates of outcomes and likely follow-up rates. In addition, strategies for assuring complete or nearly complete follow-up of all randomized participants should be designed and implemented. The feasibility of such a trial requires careful evaluation. In addition, a future trial should also collect quality of life data and economic outcome data.</P>
