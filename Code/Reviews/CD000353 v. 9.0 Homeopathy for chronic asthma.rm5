Overall it looks good to me. I have only minor comments apart from the&lt;br&gt;fact that there is still old information at same places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- when importing the review there was a note that you use a different contact information for me than I do in my&lt;br&gt;current reviews. Please use this: Klaus Linde, Centre for Complementary Medicine Research, Department of Internal&lt;br&gt;Medicine II, Technical University Munich, Kaiserstr. 9, 80801 Munich, Germany, ph +49-89-726697-15, fax +49-89-393484,&lt;br&gt;email Klaus.Linde@lrz.tu-muenchen - please make sure that our old name/address Muenchener Modell is no longer used&lt;br&gt;(also in the search (abstracts and methods) when refering to our database). External funding was only used in the years&lt;br&gt;1997 to 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I am not sure whether the &amp;quot;pachakge of care&amp;quot; issue in &amp;quot;what's new&amp;quot; and the abstract are understood by readers (I was&lt;br&gt;confused).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Was data extraction really always done by two reviewers (in the trials available only in German?)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- background, last phraser para two: I would not claim that potentizing &amp;quot;maximises&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;retains&amp;quot; therapeutic activity&lt;br&gt;(a higher potency is not always considered more potent in all situations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- maybe it's too late for this update but I would recommend to only include explicitly randomized trials (to get rid of&lt;br&gt;some of the awful Matusiwicz stuff)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- selection and extraction: this still refers to the old version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- methodological qaulity: I would include a statement that the Freitas study was weak in outcome measurement. It might&lt;br&gt;also be a place to say (in addition to the statement in the table) that the White study suffers from the problem of&lt;br&gt;very healthy partcipants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- results: On one side it is great to have the details on the results in single trials, on the other sides it is very&lt;br&gt;hard for reading - but I think it is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did not go in real detail through the tables and figures but the stuff looks good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;br&gt;Klaus&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: 050903&lt;br&gt;I have now amended the review as per Klaus' comments. These were very minor in nature and I am confident that we have tackled some of the more subtle issues concerning this form of therapy in chronic asthma. Rob - please check through the review. I have highlighted the changes in red. Once you are happy, the review can go forward for further editing and external review. &lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RM: 080903&lt;br&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have looked through the review and agree with the additions you made to it and have thus changed them all to black ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say though that Klaus did make a couple of very good points (in particular, I can't believe I forgot this one, that White's paper used pretty healthy subjects: mean PEFR (% predicated) in the homeopathy and placebo groups were 100.4 and 96.9 respectively! I think that this deserves an explicit mention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have made some additions then based on Klaus' commments and have marked these in red, for you to comment on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;br&gt;Rob&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TJL: 080903&lt;br&gt;Thanks Rob - I have been through the review and I agree with the changes that you suggested.

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Homeopathy is a complementary healing system based on "curing like with like". It involves greatly diluting substances (potentising) which ordinarily may or may not cause symptoms, in order to strengthen the body's own healing response to a problem. Homeopathic remedies (potencies) aim to minimise the risk of adverse effects. There are different types that may be used for asthma, such as classical homeopathy (tailored to an individual's symptoms) or isopathy (for example using a dilution of an agent that causes an allergy, such as pollen). The review of trials found that the type of homeopathy varied between the studies, that the study designs used in the trials were varied and that no strong evidence existed that usual forms of homeopathy for asthma are effective. There has been only a limited attempt to measure a 'package of care' effect (i.e., the effect of the medication as well as the consultation, which is considered a vital part of individualised homeopathic practice). Until stronger evidence exists for the use of homeopathy in the treatment of asthma, we are unable to make recommendations about homeopathic treatment. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Homeopathy involves the use, in dilution, of substances which cause symptoms in their undiluted form. It is one of the most widespread forms of complementary medicines and is also used to treat asthma. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to assess the effects of homeopathy in people with chronic stable asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were current as of August 2007. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials of homeopathy for the treatment of stable chronic asthma, with observation periods of at least one week were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. Trial quality was assessed by the reviewers. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Six trials with a total of 556 people were included. These trials were all placebo-controlled and double-blind, but of variable quality. They used different homeopathic treatments which precluded quantitative pooling of results for the primary outcome. Standardised treatments in these trials are unlikely to represent common homeopathic practice, where treatment tends to be individualised. No trial reported a significant difference on validated symptom scales. There were conflicting results in terms of lung function between the studies. There has been only a limited attempt to measure a 'package of care' effect (i.e., the effect of the medication as well as the consultation, which is considered a vital part of individualised homeopathic practice). An update search in August 2005 did not identify any new studies. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in asthma. As well as randomised trials, there is a need for observational data to document the different methods of homeopathic prescribing and how patients respond. This will help to establish to what extent people respond to a 'package of care' rather than the homeopathic intervention alone. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-07-28 11:02:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:55:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Homeopathy is one of the most widespread and most controversial forms of complementary or alternative medicine. Although exact data on the frequency of use of homeopathy in asthma patients is not available, surveys among general practitioners, (for example <LINK REF="REF-Knipschild-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knipschild 1990</LINK>), and chest physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Querfurt-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Querfurt 1995</LINK>) indicate that a significant proportion might seek additional advice from homeopaths.</P>
<P>The fundamental concept of homeopathy is that a substance which gives rise to specific symptoms, when given in pharmacological doses to healthy individuals, can be used to treat patients presenting with these same symptoms ('simile principle'). In general, the homeopathic 'remedies' are applied as 'potencies' which are prepared by several consecutive dilutions with vigorous shaking (succussion) in between each dilution step. The resulting potency is labelled on the basis of the of the ratio of diluent and diluted agent (D = decimal dilution = 1/10 diluted agent/diluent; C = centesimal dilution = 1/100 diluted agent/diluent) and the number of dilution steps (e.g. C6 indicates 6 dilution steps 1/100). It is believed that this preparation process both minimizes the risk of side effects and retains the therapeutic potency of the remedy.</P>
<P>Consequently, many of the preparations in homeopathy would contain either very few or even no molecules of the original agents since they are diluted beyond Avogadro's number. Therefore, according to current pharmacological theory it would appear impossible that homeopathic therapy could have any effect over placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Vandenbroucke-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vandenbroucke 1997</LINK>). The available hypotheses for a possible mechanism of action, however, do not claim that homeopathic remedies act through pharmacological but through biophysical pathways and all include the idea of some form of information transfer from the diluted substance to the diluting agent (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Berezin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berezin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Anagnostatos-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anagnostatos 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-del-Giudice-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">del Giudice 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lo-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lo 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although homeopathy seems highly implausible from the current bio molecular point of view, two recent meta-analyses of placebo-controlled clinical trials have found an effect greater than placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Linde-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Linde 1997</LINK>). No systematic review has yet been done to evaluate the evidence regarding homeopathic treatment strategies in asthma.</P>
<P>Any review of homeopathic treatment strategies should take into account that homeopathy is not used uniformly. At least four basic types of homeopathy should be differentiated: classical homeopathy, clinical homeopathy, isopathy, and complex homeopathy.</P>
<P>For chronic diseases such as asthma the "classical" homeopathic approach is probably most widespread. In classical homeopathy the choice of the remedy is determined by the individual and subjective symptoms of each patient. As a consequence, different asthma patients might receive very different remedies, fitting their individual symptom patterns. Classical homeopathy involves detailed and intense history taking, which might give rise to significant non-specific effects. "Clinical" homeopathy by contrast, uses the same remedy in patients presenting with a relatively homogeneous pathology or constellation of symptoms.</P>
<P>In some conditions (e.g. allergy) the diluted causative agent (e.g. potentised pollen) may be used. This is called "isopathy". The use of fixed combinations of several homeopathic remedies (so called "complex" remedies - "complex homeopathy") for one or a limited number of conditions is popular among general practitioners or "beginners" of homeopathy and is particularly widespread in Europe, especially Germany and France.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review was to evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of homeopathic interventions for the treatment of patients with stable chronic asthma.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:57:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">

</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:57:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Quality of reporting was assessed using the scale developed and validated by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>. This involves 3 items giving a maximum score of 5 points: two points each for random allocation and blinding, one point for description of drop-outs and withdrawals. In addition, the adequacy of randomisation concealment was assessed (central randomisation = adequate, sealed envelope = partly adequate, alternation etc. = inadequate).</P>
<P>We tried to collect additional information from trialists which was successful for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> supplied an English translation of his article published in German. This was verified by one of the reviewers (TL).</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-07-28 10:58:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>For continuous variables reported as means and standard deviations (SDs), data were extracted and entered in order to calculate either a weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), depending upon whether studies measured outcome on the same or different metrics. Where the difference between the means for treatment and control groups was reported, a treatment effect estimate was calculated based upon the generic inverse variance (GIV). For dichotomous variables, data were extracted and entered in order to calculate a Relative Risk (RR).</P>
<P>Fixed Effect modelling was used in the calculation of the pooled treatment effect estimates unless significant heterogeneity was observed (P =&lt;0.1), in which case a Random Effects model was also used to calculate the effect estimate.</P>
<P>Differences in the interventions used in the trials raised many questions as to how to analyse the findings of the studies. Two reviewers (RM and TL) discussed the alternatives for combining the data and established three key characteristics:<BR/>
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Individualised and formula. It was felt that the approach to treatment differed sufficiently between these two to merit separation. One important scientific question asked of homeopathy is whether an observed effect would be non-local in origin: this division gets closer to addressing this question as the package of care associated with individualised differs greatly from that provided with formula homeopathy, which by its very nature is generic.</LI>
<LI>Adults and children. This formed the basis for the subgroup analysis.</LI>
<LI>Homeopathy and isopathy. As there does seem to be a slightly different rationale with isopathy it was decided that a sensitivity analysis would be performed on the basis of standard homeopathic or isopathic treatment.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Some concern was expressed over pooling oral and subcutaneous administration as they were considered different types of treatment. With subcutaneous administration there is potentially a greater placebo effect and also an increased possibility of (a different type of) adverse event occurring. However the amount of data did not justify such a division: making this division will be considered in updates of the review, if possible.</P>
<P>Although within homoeopathic practice treatment can be categorised as either complex or clinical, we did not feel that such a distinction was based on scientific rationale as both seem to rely on formula prescription. The amount of data in the review simply did not enable us to explore the effects of separate remedies and potencies but if possible in updates this would be considered (and of course complex and clinical homeopathy would be treated in this manner).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Active treatment was compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment to usual care in all the studies. Four studies employed homeopathic dilutions, either single remedies (<LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK>: Blatta officinalis C6); individualised remedies (classical homeopathy: <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>); or a standardised combination (<LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK>: Engystol N containing Vincetoxin D6/D10/D30 and sulfur D4/D10; and <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK>: Asthma H containing 14 different potencies of either D3, D4, D5 or D6). Two studies used isopathy, a form of homeopathy where the allergen is serially diluted to form the remedy (<LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK>, both to 30C). For the purposes of this review, isopathy is considered as formula homeopathy. This is because although the prescription is based on an <I>individual's</I> positive response to a weal test, it is standardised (for example the same potency is always used), only based on this one presenting response, rather than from a holistic realisation of the person and (if appropriate) would be unaltered for the duration of the study. By contrast the prescription in trials of individualised homeopathy (as defined by this review) is based on a holistic interpretation and may well vary throughout the course of treatment.</P>
<P>Duration of treatment in the studies ranged from 1 day (<LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK> - plus 16 week follow-up) to 1 year (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> - up to 6 consultations over 1 year).</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes<BR/>
</B>Five studies assessed lung function: <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK> (FVC, FEV1, PEF); <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK> (FVC, FEV1, PEF); <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> (FVC; FEV<SUB>1</SUB>, FEV<SUB>1 </SUB>/ FVC); <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK> (FEV1; PEF); <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> (improvement in PEF). Four studies measured symptoms: <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK> (visual analogue and digital symptom scales); <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK> (intensity and duration of exacerbations); <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK> (visual analogue scale; mood and asthma-free days); <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> (days absent from school). Medication usage was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK> (required daily dose of oral corticosteroid); <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> (required daily dose of corticosteroid); <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK> (bronchodilator usage); <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> (use of 'inhaler' - categorised as increase/no change or reduced). One study measured the frequency of exacerbations of asthma: <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK>. No other studies attempted to measure the effects of homeopathy on exacerbations. One study measured quality of life: <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> (Childhood Asthma Questionnaire - CAQ). One study measured subjective perception of global change: <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> (participants and parent/guardian - short ordinal scale 0-5). Although <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> measured the effects of homeopathy on biochemical markers, this was not deemed of clinical relevance and not used in the review.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Overall study quality was deemed as mixed. Randomisation concealment and blinding was adequately described in <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>. All studies were double-blind. Loss to follow up was described by <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>. Entry criteria, additional conventional treatment and outcome measurements were inadequately described by <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK>; furthermore outcome measurements were unusual and methodologically weak (the frequency, duration and intensity of bronchospastic episodes). <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK> was considered to have been inadequately reported; as a consequence, the assessment of the quality of this study, reported below, is problematic. </P>
<P>The high Jadad ratings for the studies represent adequate reporting of trial methodology. The low scores attributed to <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> indicate poor reporting of methods. </P>
<P>Whilst the aim of the review was to establish the efficacy of homeopathy compared with placebo, all the studies administered homeopathic treatment in addition to usual care. In most instances this was in addition to steroids or ß<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. The effects of these medications may have confounded potential benefits of homeopathy. </P>
<P>It should be noted that the patients participating in <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>seemed relatively healthy: the mean PEFR (% predicated) in the homeopathy and placebo groups were 100.4 and 96.9 respectively. The reviewers felt that the asthma severity across the other studies was largely mild to moderate. The generalisability of the evidence assembled in this review is undermined by these factors. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review identified six randomised trials comparing homeopathic remedies with placebo in the treatment of asthma in adults and children. There are several key limitations to the current evidence which should be discussed. </P>
<P>Firstly, the focus of the trials was limited to assessing homeopathy as an <I>additional </I> treatment to allopathic medications. This in itself is a crucial characteristic of the evidence available and raises questions as to whether homeopathy can ever be accepted by trialists as a treatment worthy of assessment without recourse to steroids and bronchodilators. In <LINK REF="STD-Freitas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Freitas 1995</LINK> all allopathic treatments were maintained on ethical grounds. Whilst two studies did determine an effect in terms of steroid usage (<LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK>), the findings of the studies were inadequately reported and so could not be assessed in terms of clinical relevance. This does not mean that there is no potential for homeopathy as a <I>complementary </I>treatment, but such an additional effect as an adjunct to allopathic medicine is hard to assess other than in the context of 'global assessment'. One study did not detect a difference in 'global assessment' of well-being (<LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>The package of care on offer in the studies is also worthy of discussion. In the absence of a scientific rationale for homeopathy, some would argue that any observed effect cannot be seen outside the context of the entire treatment package, which consists of one-on-one, in depth, 'holistic' consultation, administration of homeopathic treatment and follow-up. For example in <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> there was extensive telephone contact in addition to six consultations and as many changes of remedy as were deemed appropriate. It is difficult to see how this can be assessed alongside some of the less extensive 'one off' treatments offered in <LINK REF="STD-Reilly-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Reilly 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK>. Careful, systematic observational studies documenting what homeopaths do, and how asthma patients respond to homeopathic therapy are needed before practice and treatment can be evaluated, or meaningful and clinically relevant randomised trials of representative treatment strategies can be justified. If the view is maintained that all homeopathy is placebo and this continues to dominate discussions of the topic, it is questionable whether observational studies will ever be performed. However, the probability that substantial numbers of asthma sufferers will continue to seek homeopathic treatment remains high. In 1998 there were estimated to be over 470,000 regular users of homeopathy in the UK alone, with 8.6% of the population purchasing homeopathic medicines in that year, sales of homeopathic medicines are growing at around 12% annually (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2001</LINK>). This considered, it is therefore imperative that more regulation is introduced into the profession to ensure quality of care is of the highest possible standard and potential users should always seek care from registered practitioners.</P>
<P>The quality of the studies varied considerably. Many reviews of homeopathy have reported that trial findings are rarely applicable (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cucherat-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cucherat 2000</LINK>). In this review, the applicability of the findings are hampered by varying quality between the studies. The recent studies by <LINK REF="STD-Lewith-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Lewith 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> were both well reported and adequately powered trials. The methods of randomisation, concealment and blinding were appropriate and hopefully indicate a trend in improved reporting of study methods for homeopathy trials. Conversely, <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Matusiewicz-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Matusiewicz 1999</LINK> were inadequately reported and subsequent outcome reporting was also incomplete. <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK> reported a trial which assessed homeopathic treatment administered by certified homeopaths. There were also attempts to standardise a complex treatment in this study through regular case conferences amongst the homeopaths involved. This attempt to create a uniform approach to treatment is recommended for future research. </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The currently available evidence is insufficient to assess reliably the possible role of homeopathy in the treatment of asthma. Whilst the scientific rationale behind homeopathy remains unproven, non-specific benefits associated with a 'holistic' package of care may exist. The effect of homeopathy on asthma has yet to be proven in a randomised study. However, the varied quality of the studies precludes us from extrapolating any effects observed to the general population level. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>As it is likely that a proportion of asthma sufferers will continue to seek advice and additional treatment from homeopaths further research is desirable.</P>
<P>Although replications of the existing trials might be useful to further investigate the remedies tested, studies of more widely applicable and widespread treatment strategies would be more relevant, such as those used in <LINK REF="STD-White-2003" TYPE="STUDY">White 2003</LINK>. </P>
<P>Currently the major obstacle to clinically relevant research is a paucity of information, systematically acquired, on a) what homeopaths actually do, and the range of remedies used in their routine treatment of patients with asthma and b) how patients respond to homeopathic treatment. </P>
