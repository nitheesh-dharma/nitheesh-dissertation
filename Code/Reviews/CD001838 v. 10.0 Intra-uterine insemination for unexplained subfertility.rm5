<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Does intra-uterine insemination (IUI) treatment (with or without fertility drugs) lead to higher live birth rates in couples with unexplained subfertility as compared to timed intercourse or expectant management?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>IUI is a treatment often used for couples with unexplained subfertility. In an IUI cycle, the male partner's sperm is prepared and placed directly in the uterus at the time of ovulation. IUI cycles can be used in combination with fertility drugs to stimulate the ovaries and increase the number of available eggs. However, these drugs can have adverse effects and also increase the risk of multiple pregnancies. Expectant management and timed intercourse have also been shown to result in high pregnancy rates resulting in live birth. With this review we would like to enhance decision-making for starting treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>Cochrane authors included 14 randomised controlled trials (1867 women) in this review, comparing women with unexplained subfertility undergoing fertility treatment with IUI with or without ovarian stimulation drugs. Women who underwent IUI treatment were compared to women who received ovarian stimulation drugs along with timed intercourse or couples who were randomised to expectant management. The main outcome of interest was live birth rate, but pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and other adverse effects were also recorded. The evidence is current to December 2015.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between most treatment groups in cumulative live birth rates (i.e. rates at conclusion of a course of treatment), multiple pregnancy rates and other adverse effects for couples with unexplained subfertility undergoing intra-uterine insemination (IUI) when compared with timed intercourse (TI), both with and without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH).</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence was of moderate quality for live birth and low to moderate quality for multiple pregnancy. The main limitation of the evidence was lack of precision in the findings for both live birth and multiple pregnancy.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-02-05 11:47:57 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a widely used fertility treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility. Although IUI is less invasive and less expensive thAppendixan in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the safety of IUI in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is debated. The main concern about IUI treatment with OH is the increase in multiple pregnancy rate. This is an update of a Cochrane review (<A HREF="Veltman-Verhulst 2012">Veltman-Verhulst 2012</A>) originally published in 2006 and updated in 2012.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-09-09 07:15:33 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Of all couples presenting with fertility problems about 25% have no cause that can be identified (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). Couples are classified as having unexplained subfertility when they have tried to conceive for at least one year and the fertility work-up showed patent fallopian tubes, an ovulatory menstrual cycle and a normal semen analysis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-01-14 13:43:08 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a commonly-used treatment in couples with unexplained subfertility. IUI is a relatively simple procedure in which semen is 'washed' in the laboratory and inserted in the uterine cavity using a small catheter at the time of ovulation. IUI can be performed with or without drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). For correct timing of the insemination, cycle monitoring is performed. This is usually done by ultrasound assessment of follicle growth or by monitoring the preovulatory luteinizing hormone rise in blood or urine. In hyperstimulated cycles ovulation is often induced by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which improves timing possibilities. In contrast to the IUI procedure, with expectant management, couples either receive cycle monitoring for correct timing of sexual intercourse, for example timed intercourse (TI), or no intervention at all.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-01-14 08:12:07 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale for performing IUI is that the motile spermatozoa, which are morphologically normal, can be concentrated in a small volume and placed directly into the uterus close to the released oocyte. In this way the cervix, which also acts as a reservoir for sperm, is bypassed. Accurate timing of the insemination is therefore of great importance. IUI can be performed with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). The two most commonly used drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation are clomiphene citrate (CC), which is an oral treatment, and gonadotropins administered by subcutaneous injection. The aim of OH is to increase the number of oocytes available for fertilisation and to enhance accurate timing.</P>
<P>The role of IUI in fertility treatment is often debated, in particular in terms of whether or not it is superior to TI and whether or not OH should be used at the same time (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The use of OH in fertility treatment for unexplained subfertility has been both supported and criticised. When Hughes published a meta-analysis indicating that the average fecundability is approximately five-fold higher for treatment with IUI and OH (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1998</LINK>) concluded accordingly that "OH with IUI is an effective treatment for couples with unexplained infertility". However, major concerns about the incidence of multiple pregnancies were raised and OH became less popular. These concerns have resulted in an adjustment of the advice for treatment of couples with unexplained subfertility. The NICE fertility guideline states that "ovarian hyperstimulation should not be offered to women with unexplained subfertility" (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is usually difficult to target treatment especially when there is no known reason why women are not getting pregnant. The rationale for treatment with OH is to increase the number of mature follicles and trigger ovulation to facilitate optimum timing of IUI. It may also correct subtle abnormalities in follicular maturation and fertilisation and may improve the endometrial quality (<LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1998</LINK>). However, <LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK> shows that for couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis there are no large beneficial effects of treatment with IUI and OH.</P>
<P>The increase of multiple pregnancies is a logical consequence of stimulated growth of multiple follicles. The incidence of multiple pregnancies after treatment with OH and IUI varies between 10% and 40%, and the overall contribution of this treatment to multiple births is estimated to be around 30% (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>). The question is whether this multiple pregnancy rate is acceptable or whether it can be reduced to acceptable numbers. Recently, more and more evidence has been collected showing that mild ovarian hyperstimulation with strict cancellation criteria reduces the risk of achieving multiple pregnancies to approximately 10%, without compromising pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-ESHRE-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESHRE 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ragni-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rumste-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rumste 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steures-2006b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steures 2006b</LINK>). Because maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates are significantly increased in multiple pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ombelet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ombelet 2005</LINK>), caregivers should take extra care to keep the multiple pregnancy rate to a minimum. Couples should be well informed by their physicians, especially as many couples desire to conceive twins (<LINK REF="REF-Ryan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ryan 2004</LINK>) and prefer a higher pregnancy chance over safety.</P>
<P>Some authors state that treatment with OH results in an unacceptably high incidence of high-order multiple pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Gleicher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleicher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nan 1994</LINK>) and treatment with IUI in natural cycles should be preferred (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goverde-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goverde 2005</LINK>). Others say that the risk of a multiple pregnancy could be reduced with strict monitoring of the people undergoing treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Dickey-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickey 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tur-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tur 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Te-Velde-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Te Velde 1999</LINK> concluded that IUI with OH is an appropriate treatment option if done with a mild stimulation protocol, careful cycle monitoring and with strict cancellation criteria. It is, however, still not known to what extent multiple pregnancies can be avoided if these criteria are met. Besides, the use of strict cycle cancellation criteria might result in a reduced overall pregnancy rate. Several trials using mild stimulation protocols for IUI have been published, showing promising results of acceptable pregnancy rates with very low multiple pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Balasch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasch 2004</LINK>). As IVF allows better control over reducing the risk of a multiple pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Gleicher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleicher 2000</LINK>), and IVF with single embryo transfer is more and more accepted, it has been argued that IVF is a safer treatment option than IUI with OH. However a large RCT, <LINK REF="REF-Bensdorp-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bensdorp 2015</LINK>, showed low multiple pregnancy rates and comparable live birth rates in the IUI with OH group when compared to women undergoing IVF with single embryo transfer. Additionally, <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK> found IUI to be a more cost-effective treatment than IVF for couples with unexplained or male subfertility.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-01-13 15:58:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of IUI for male factor infertility was published in 1984 and reported a favourable outcome for IUI compared with TI (<LINK REF="REF-Kerin-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kerin 1984</LINK>). Since then many trials have studied the efficacy of IUI for unexplained subfertility, with variable results. Subsequent RCTs have compared IUI with TI, with or without OH, and suggested a benefit of OH in combination with IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK> reported that mild ovarian hyperstimulation of IUI cycles did not yield higher pregnancy rates, though IUI is more cost-effective compared with in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Others stated that IUI alone is not efficacious, without some form of ovarian hyperstimulation (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guzick-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guzick 1998</LINK>). Some studies suggested that both OH and IUI independently contributed to increased pregnancy rates (<LINK REF="REF-Aboulghar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboulghar 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK>). A meta-analysis of seven studies showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate for treatment with gonadotropins (28%) compared to treatment with CC (19%) when combined with IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Cantineau-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantineau 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although ovarian hyperstimulation seems to result in higher pregnancy rates it also increases the incidence of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). These pose serious risks to the health of both mother and baby (<LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gleicher-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleicher 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nan 1994</LINK>). The NICE fertility guidelines recommend IUI without OH for couples with unexplained subfertility because of the increased risk of multiple pregnancies and OHSS associated with OH (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2013</LINK>). This systematic review was therefore undertaken to assess the evidence on the benefits and side effects of IUI with or without OH, compared to timed intercourse, for couples with unexplained subfertility.</P>

<P>Only dichotomous data were reported in this review and we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR). We reversed the direction of effect of individual studies, where required, to ensure consistency across trials. We presented 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes.

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-01-08 22:12:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>We analysed data per randomised couple or woman, because per-treatment-cycle data may lead to biased results (<LINK REF="REF-Dias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias 2008</LINK>). In the case of a crossover trial, we only analysed data prior to crossover. For studies where data did not allow analysis (e.g. per-cycle data) we contacted study authors for per-woman data. Where appropriate data were not obtained after contact with authors, we excluded such data (per-cycle) from meta-analyses. Multiple live births (e.g. twins or triplets) were counted as one live birth event.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-01-08 22:15:19 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Denise M Mitchell">
<P>We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible.

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Janko-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Janko 1998</LINK>) did not report the women's age. The overall age reported in the studies was similar. The mean or median age was between 30 years to 33 years (with comparable SDs). The maximum age of the participants was stated in six studies, only one of whom was above the age of 40 years (<LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The duration of subfertility was given in 10 trials and reported as a mean duration or range. Five studies only included couples with subfertility for more than at least three years. The overall subfertility duration ranged from one year to 15 years.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Types of subfertility</HEADING>
<P>The definition of unexplained subfertility was similar between studies. Six trials enrolled participants with unexplained subfertility only. Five trials also included participants with male factor subfertility. In these studies the data for unexplained subfertility were either reported separately or obtained from the author. One study selected couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis (<LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK>). Four studies reported the inclusion of women with either surgically corrected endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK>), mild or stage II treated endometriosis (<LINK REF="STD-Guzick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Guzick 1999</LINK>) or minimal/mild endometriosis( <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>) which we considered to be unexplained subfertility. <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1995</LINK> specifically excluded participants if minor disorders such as minimal endometriosis were found in the investigation. Although our protocol stated to only include women with minimal and mild endometriosis we decided to include <LINK REF="STD-Deaton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Deaton 1990</LINK> despite the inclusion of three participants (out of 51 participants in total) with moderate endometriosis.</P>
<P>All studies reported a thorough fertility investigation, including a laparoscopy. A semen analysis was performed at least once in all studies. In nine studies the semen quality was reported according to the WHO criteria. Twostudies (<LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Janko-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Janko 1998</LINK>) did not specify the criteria for a normal semen analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1995</LINK> used a sperm count per ejaculate instead of per ml. The data of <LINK REF="STD-Guzick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Guzick 1999</LINK> were based only on a normal sperm count and a normal motility according to Kruger criteria.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary or secondary subfertility</HEADING>
<P>Nine trials contained a mixed population of couples who had never achieved a pregnancy (primary subfertility) and those who had previously been pregnant (secondary subfertility). The remaining trials did not give any description for inclusion of people with secondary subfertility.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Previous treatment</HEADING>
<P>Couples who have previously had failed fertility treatment have a lower probability of conception in subsequent treatment attempts. It is, therefore, important in fertility trials to report if couples have undergone previous treatment. Of the 14 included studies only one trial included couples who had previously had unsuccessful fertility treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Melis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1995</LINK>). Five trials did not include previously treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arici-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arici 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guzick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Guzick 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Karlstrom-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Karlstrom 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murdoch-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Murdoch 1991</LINK>) and the remaining trials did not provide information regarding previous treatment.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 1990</LINK> studied all five comparisons, however there were no pre-crossover data available for couples with unexplained subfertility.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK>, although included in the review, was excluded from the primary analysis. This Indian study had a high dropout percentage (37%) in the treatment group which caused severely unbalanced groups. The main reason for dropout was financial constraints so this introduces a considerable bias. However, we performed a sensitivity analysis including this study.</P>
<P>In the most recent included studies, <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK>, expectant management was performed instead of TI.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Treatment</HEADING>
<P>The treatment methods varied substantially between studies. Seven studies used gonadotropins for ovarian hyperstimulation. <LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK> offered both gonadotropins and clomiphene citrate, which resulted in a high dose hyperstimulation. Five studies used clomiphene only, and <LINK REF="STD-Crosignani-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Crosignani 1991</LINK> did not report the method of ovarian hyperstimulation. The different fertility centres in this multicentre trial used different treatments. More details on drug dose and method can be found in the prognostic factor table (Table 2) and 'Characteristics of included studies' table. Additional gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) was used by <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Murdoch-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Murdoch 1991</LINK>. All studies used human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (5000 to 10,000 IU) for triggering ovulation. Chung also provided hCG in the post-ovulatory phase.</P>
<P>The timing of IUI was similar among the studies. Follicle development was usually monitored by ultrasound scan (USS) and serum estradiol levels (serum-E<SUB>2</SUB>). The hCG was given when the dominant follicles reached a mean diameter of 16 mm to 18 mm. Insemination was performed 30 hours to 48 hours after hCG administration. <LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK> performed a double insemination at 24 and 48 hours, and in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Murdoch-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Murdoch 1991</LINK> insemination took place on alternate days until ovulation was confirmed. Follicular development in natural cycles was monitored by ultrasound or luteinizing hormone (LH) urine tests, and intercourse was advised at 12 hours to 40 hours after the hCG or LH surge. Couples were mostly advised to have intercourse more than once.</P>
<P>In the studies with expectant management instead of TI (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK>), couples were given general advice regarding the need for regular intercourse.</P>
<P>The number of cycles in included studies ranged from one to eight.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Cancellation criteria</HEADING>
<P>The most serious adverse effects of ovarian hyperstimulation are multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). These risks can both be reduced by the cancellation of the treatment cycle if excessive follicle stimulation occurs. It is important that fertility trials report the cancellation criteria they applied. Firstly, to ensure that participants were not exposed to a higher risk of multiple pregnancy or OHSS to increase the pregnancy rate and secondly, to reduce the bias introduced by cancellation of treatment in initially randomised groups.</P>
<P>Ten studies described criteria for cancellation of the treatment cycle. Insemination or hCG administration did not take place if the cancellation criteria were met. Five studies used serum-E<SUB>2</SUB> levels to determine over- or under-stimulation as well as a maximum of dominant follicles (four follicles of a maximum 16 mm diameter). <LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK> accepted a maximum of six dominant follicles. Four studies did not describe any cancellation criteria.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>Nine trials reported live birth, our primary outcome of interest. The other studies reported pregnancy as the main outcome. Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound in nine trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Guzick-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Guzick 1999</LINK> pregnancy was confirmed by two hCG measurements or live birth. Others did not report the method of pregnancy confirmation. The reported pregnancies were mostly clinical. The multiple pregnancy rate was mentioned in 12 trials, miscarriage in 10, ectopic pregnancy in 10, and OHSS in nine trials. These events were often reported as total numbers or as post-crossover data and therefore often could not be used in the meta-analysis.</P>

<BR/>Six trials reported pregnancy rates per couple. There were 517 women included in this analysis and 149 cumulative pregnancies were reported. The pregnancy rate was higher in the IUI group (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.53, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 8%; 7 RCTs, n = 517; low quality evidence) if all cycles were analysed. This suggested that if the chance of a pregnancy with timed intercourse was assumed to be 23%, the chance of a pregnancy in women using IUI would be between 26% and 43%. To check sensitivity to the model assumptions, the random-effects model was used and showed a similar result (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.65).</P>
<P>If the study by <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK> was included in the analysis the results change markedly. The OR becomes 1.25 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.78), crossing the line of no evidence of effect. Including this study also introduced a strong heterogeneity (P = 0.02, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 60%). This statistical heterogeneity caused by <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK> supports our concerns about the validity of this trial, both from a statistical (high probability of bias) and from a clinical point of view. On the other hand, this sensitivity analysis showed the relative weakness of the significant difference we found. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>We performed a subgroup analysis for the number of treatment cycles. When we analysed the first treatment cycle only, no significant difference in pregnancy rate was seen (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.88) and no heterogeneity detected (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). As expected, cumulative pregnancy rates increased with a rising number of treatment cycles per couple.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-02-05 12:12:17 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>The aim of this review was to analyse the effectiveness of intra-uterine insemination (IUI), with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH), by systematically evaluating the best available evidence. Because randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are still considered to provide the best assessment of the effectiveness of treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>), we included only truly randomised trials in this review. The individual trials were contradictory and often lacked sufficient power to draw firm conclusions. In spite of these shortcomings, and also some clinical heterogeneity, we were able to pool their results and draw some conclusions.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses from 14 RCTs showed no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates, multiple pregnancy rate and pregnancy rates for most of the comparisons.</P>
<P>The comparison IUI in a natural cycle with IUI in a hyperstimulated cycle revealed a more than two-fold increase in live birth rate in women treated with OH (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.82). This result could be considered robust. The analysis comprised 396 couples and included high quality trials. A study with 1500 couples showing no treatment effect is needed to reduce the lower confidence limit to one. If we use these data to calculate the numbers needed to treat, with an assumed control risk of 14%, we would find that approximately nine couples need to be treated with IUI and OH for approximately four cycles to result in one additional live birth compared to the control group. These data should be interpreted with caution because the impact of OH on multiple pregnancies and other adverse effects could not be answered by this review.</P>
<P>All the comparisons reported data on multiple pregnancy rate and there was no evidence of a difference in this outcome between the treatment groups in all the comparisons. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The four studies in our analysis comparing IUI versus IUI with OH all reported multiple pregnancy rates, but only two reported the rates for those with unexplained subfertility. A valid analysis could, therefore, not be performed. All studies using gonadotropins as the stimulation method reported cancellation criteria. However, the highest multiple pregnancy rate was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK> (29% in the OH group compared to 4% in the natural cycle group) despite the use of strict cancellation criteria. It should be noted that 95% of the participants included in this comparison received gonadotropin treatment, which could result in higher multiple pregnancy rates compared to CC treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Ombelet-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ombelet 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The comparison of IUI versus TI, or expectant management both in stimulated cycles, showed an odds ratio for pregnancy rate per couple of 1.69 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.53) in favour of IUI. It seems appropriate, therefore, to combine IUI and OH. However, the following points need to be taken into account. Firstly, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that IUI in combination with OH improved live birth rates when compared with TI in stimulated cycles. This might be the result of insufficient power, a total of 208 couples in two trials only were included (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Melis-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Melis 1995</LINK>), or the fact that Melis included a population with a poor prognosis (all participants had previously had unsuccessful treatment with IUI and OH). Because this study makes up half of the live birth analysis it could mask the promising results from <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1995</LINK>.</P>
<P>Secondly, the results varied according to whether or not one study (<LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK>) was included. In the meta-analysis six studies were included, in which a total of 517 women were randomised to either treatment with OH alone or with IUI and OH. The inclusion of <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK> (n = 140), which had been excluded due to a high risk of bias caused by losses to follow-up, in a sensitivity analysis resulted in no evidence of effect. The sensitivity of our results after inclusion of a relatively small study emphasises the fragility of our analysis. However, the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Agarwal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Agarwal 2004</LINK> showed an unexpectedly high pregnancy rate in the control group compared to the treatment group (29% higher). Because there is no reason to believe that timed intercourse would increase the pregnancy rate compared to IUI, and because of the high dropout rate, this study should not be considered representative. It would be more realistic to assume that there is no difference between IUI and TI. Our calculations indicate that it would take a trial of approximately 400 participants showing no difference between IUI and TI to reduce the lower confidence limit to one.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the pooled studies were clinically heterogeneous. There was, however, no evidence of statistically significant heterogeneity. This suggests that the different factors had little effect on the overall conclusions; the included studies differed markedly in terms of treatment methods and quality. The pooled studies also used different treatment protocols. The type of OH drug and dose, the treatment duration and cancellation criteria could have influenced the outcomes. For example, the highest pregnancy rate per couple was found in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Arcaini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Arcaini 1996</LINK>. A reason for this could be that this study used the most aggressive stimulation method, accepted a maximum of six dominant follicles and treated couples for up to five cycles. There were also variations in the patient population among the included studies that could have influenced the outcome, such as previous treatment and the inclusion of women with endometriosis. On the other hand, our results were not sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of trials on the basis of the above-mentioned parameters.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the clinical relevance of the result is questionable. The analysis shows evidence of a significant increase in pregnancy rate for cumulative cycles only. What does it clinically mean if the odds to become pregnant for a woman undergoing IUI treatment are 1.68 times higher than for a woman treated with OH alone, if the treatment duration could vary from one to up to five cycles? Stratification for treatment duration gave no evidence of an increase in pregnancy rate if only first cycle data were analysed. This implies that it takes more than one treatment cycle to significantly improve the couple's chances. However, it was not possible to give any clarity about the optimal number of treatment cycles in this review. A risk difference was calculated for the analysis of one to three treatment cycles, to extract the numbers needed to treat. Based on these results, approximately 13 couples need to be treated with one to three cycles of IUI and OH to result in one additional pregnancy.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the clinical relevance of the results is also dependent on the baseline fecundity of a couple. Unfortunately there were not enough data available in this meta-analysis to perform subgroup analyses for prognostic factors, such as age and duration of subfertility. Overall, we can conclude that an odds ratio of 1.68 for treatment over one to five cycles for couples with different prognoses and baseline fecundity is not specific enough to be helpful in a clinical setting.</P>
<P>Finally, the impact of IUI on other adverse events, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy could not be adequately estimated due to a lack of information. Adverse events were often not mentioned, or mentioned per group instead of per treatment modality. The studies mentioning 'no events' were included in the meta-analyses, which might result in underestimation of the adverse events. On the other hand, these adverse events are mostly accredited to OH and not to IUI. It seems therefore unlikely that any significant difference in adverse events would be found when OH with TI is compared to OH with IUI.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-02-05 11:47:13 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>To adequately address the question whether IUI with or without OH is an effective treatment for couples with unexplained subfertility, our aim was to analyse the following five treatment comparisons: 1. IUI versus TI or expectant management, both in a natural cycle; 2. IUI versus TI or expectant management, both in a stimulated cycle; 3. IUI in a natural cycle versus IUI in a stimulated cycle; 4. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycle; and 5. IUI in a natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle. Most of the comparisons were investigated in single trials, thereby making it difficult to combine data in meta-analyses. Where data were pooled in meta-analyses, the overall effect estimates usually had wide confidence intervals due to small sample size or inadequate power of the trials which contributed data to the pooled estimates.</P>
<P>Furthermore, we were not able to assess all desired outcomes for each comparison. There were not enough data available to retrieve adequate live birth rates, and there were even fewer data available for the adverse effects of each treatment modality. Important prognostic factors such as age, duration of subfertility and previous treatment were poorly reported, making it impossible to perform subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>The four studies in our analysis comparing IUI versus IUI with OH all reported multiple pregnancy rates, but only two reported the rates for those with unexplained subfertility. A valid analysis could not be performed. All studies using gonadotropins as the stimulation method reported cancellation criteria. However, the highest multiple pregnancy rate was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Goverde-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Goverde 2000</LINK> (29% in the OH group compared to 4% in the natural cycle group) despite the use of strict cancellation criteria. It should be noted that 95% of the participants included in this comparison received gonadotropin treatment, which could result in higher multiple pregnancy rates compared to CC treatment..</P>

<P>The overall quality of the included trials was suboptimal. This was mainly because of imprecision, with effect estimates of most of the GRADE-specific outcomes having wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>The quality of fertility trials has been criticised repeatedly. One of the areas of particular concern is what statisticians refer to as the 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). It is methodologically incorrect to report data per cycle when it is women or couples who are randomised because many of the women will have undergone more than one treatment cycle (<LINK REF="REF-Dias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). Yet pregnancy rate per cycle is a commonly reported outcome in fertility trials and reviews.</P>
<P>Another methodological difficulty in fertility trials is the use of studies with a crossover design. There have been many discussions about whether a crossover design is appropriate for fertility trials, mainly because participants drop out after treatment success, which results in a selected patient population post-crossover. For this reason, it is said that the crossover design has no place in infertility trials (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 1993</LINK>). A crossover design could result in an overestimation of the treatment effect (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 2000</LINK>). Whether this overestimation could be statistically corrected for or whether it is clinically relevant remains under debate (<LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonnell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonnell 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vail-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vail 2003</LINK>). In this systematic review we focused on live birth rates or pregnancy rates per couple. The couple being the denominator, post-crossover data could not be included because then couples would have received both treatment modalities and results per couple could not be extracted.</P>
<P>The more recent studies adopted expectant management as a control treatment for IUI instead of timed intercourse (<LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK>). Because timing of intercourse (TI) interferes with the natural coital habits of a couple, expectant management has been proposed as the more appropriate comparison treatment for IUI (<LINK REF="REF-Wilcox-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilcox 1995</LINK>). A recent meta-analysis however shows no significant difference in pregnancy rate between studies comparing IUI versus TI and studies with IUI versus expectant management (<LINK REF="REF-Snick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Snick 2008</LINK>). Whether it is appropriate to pool studies including TI and expectant management in a meta-analysis remains unclear. The data of <LINK REF="STD-Bhattacharya-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Bhattacharya 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Steures-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Steures 2006a</LINK> were not, however, pooled with data of trials applying TI because these trials comprised comparisons that were not subject to many other trials.</P>
<P>It is generally agreed that the aim of fertility treatment should be to achieve a live birth instead of inducing a pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Land-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Land 2003</LINK>). Healy and others go even further by suggesting that the 'birth emphasizing a successful singleton at term' (BESST) outcome should be the standard measure of success for fertility trials (<LINK REF="REF-Daya-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daya 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fauser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fauser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Healy-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Healy 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Min-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Min 2004</LINK>). We have tried to focus on live birth as the main outcome of interest in this analysis. Unfortunately, live birth was reported by only eight of the 14 included studies. We decided to use live birth data whenever possible for the analyses. If there were not enough live birth data available we used the more often reported pregnancy rates for the main analyses.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-01-14 15:32:35 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>To prevent selection bias, the included studies were independently selected and data extracted by two authors (Ayeleke and Verhulst for the 2015 update). Disagreements were resolved by discussion, keeping the protocol as our guideline to reduce bias. A statistician (Mr Vail) was consulted for the data extraction of complicated crossover trials. We have extracted and calculated the events per randomised couple for this meta-analysis, which resulted in the exclusion of six studies reporting only post-crossover or per-cycle data. As a consequence, the analysis is statistically less biased although a selection bias may have occurred.</P>
<P>A funnel plot was done only for the comparison with the most studies (IUI versus TI both in a stimulated cycle) (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). The funnel plot is reasonably symmetrical, suggesting that a publication bias is unlikely.</P>
<P>It should be noted that Asian countries are underrepresented in the included trials. It is not known whether Asian IUI trials have not been done or could not be found with our search.</P>

<P>Previous review articles and meta-analyses by, for example, <LINK REF="REF-Aboulghar-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aboulghar 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Balasch-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balasch 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cohlen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohlen 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Costello-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Costello 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Zeyneloglu-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zeyneloglu 1998</LINK> have all assessed the effectiveness of IUI and ovarian hyperstimulation. They have, however, all calculated pregnancy rates per cycle, which makes it difficult to compare with our per-couple data. Per-cycle data produce biased results that may exaggerate treatment results (<LINK REF="REF-Dias-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dias 2008</LINK>). This could explain why the pregnancy rates found in our meta-analysis are lower than those generally reported by the above-mentioned authors.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-10-19 14:10:51 +1300" MODIFIED_BY="Helen E Nagels">
<P>This systematic review did not find conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth or multiple pregnancy in most of the comparisons for couples with unexplained subfertility treated with IUI when compared with timed intercourse (TI), both with and without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH). There were insufficient studies to allow for pooling of data on most of the important outcome measures for each of the comparison.
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-09-09 08:06:08 +1200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need to investigate whether the risk of multiple pregnancy and other adverse events can be reduced to acceptable levels while still keeping acceptable live birth rates. Therefore a large randomised controlled trial is needed comparing IUI in natural cycles with low dose stimulated IUI.</P>
<P>Future trials are encouraged to report detailed live birth data (singleton, term) and adverse events such as multiple pregnancies, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.</P>
