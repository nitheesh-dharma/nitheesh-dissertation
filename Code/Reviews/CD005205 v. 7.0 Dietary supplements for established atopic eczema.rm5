<DESCRIPTION>
<P>A search of the GREAT (The Global Resource of Eczema Trials) database in February 2013 found just 1 study on Vitamin D supplementation, and another search of the GREAT database in May 2014 found only a few papers. Thus, this review has been marked stable because most of the papers were on probiotics and prebiotics, which are dealt with in another Cochrane review, and the paper on vitamin D is unlikely to move the existing vitamin D data in the review on in any meaningful way. An update has not been considered necessary for two successive years. Our Trials Search Co-ordinator will run a new search in 2015 to re-assess whether an update is needed.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-05-18 09:59:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen Scott">
<P>Eczema is a skin condition characterised by an itchy, red rash, which affects 5% to 20% of people worldwide. There is no cure, but many treatments can help improve the skin's condition, making life easier. In those for whom these treatments do not work well or who fear their long-term effects, there is often a belief that either something in their diet, or something missing in their diet, is making their eczema worse.</P>
<P>This review looked at the following dietary supplements (products which add ingredients to a diet): fish oil, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin E, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), sea buckthorn oil, hempseed oil, and sunflower oil. </P>
<P>Three commonly used dietary supplements (evening primrose oil, borage oil, and probiotics) are currently the subject of other Cochrane reviews (<A HREF="Boehm 2003">Boehm 2003</A>; <A HREF="Boyle 2008">Boyle 2008</A>).</P>
<P>We looked for trials comparing supplements with placebo (dummy). We included 11 randomised controlled trials (596 participants) when it was clear that the children or adults taking part had atopic eczema. In reviewing the trials, the main outcomes we looked for were evidence of improvement in the symptoms of eczema, such as itching or loss of sleep, in the short-term (i.e. six weeks). In the longer term, we wanted to see evidence of a reduced need for treatment for the eczema or a reduction in the number of flares. We also looked for evidence of any general improvement in the eczema and in individual symptoms. </P>
<P>Overall, we found no convincing evidence that taking supplements improved the eczema of those involved. In general, studies were small with low numbers of participants and of poor quality in terms of the way they were run. Two trials of fish oil did find slight improvement for the participants in terms of the degree of itchiness and quality of life. However, these trials had small numbers, which means they had little chance of finding real differences if they did exist. That is why larger trials are needed before any recommendations can be made. We found no evidence of adverse (harmful) effects in those who took part in the trials. People sometimes think that supplements can at least do no harm; however, high doses of vitamin D, for example, can cause serious medical problems, and the safety of dietary supplements should not be assumed. The cost of supplements can also mount up. </P>

<P>Many people with atopic eczema are reluctant to use the most commonly recommended treatments because they fear the long-term health effects. As a result, many turn to dietary supplements as a possible treatment approach, often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in their diet.

<P>We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced.</P>

<P>There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for clinical practice at present.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disease definition</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema (AE) is a non-infective, chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by an itchy, red rash. The terms 'atopic eczema' and 'atopic dermatitis' have been used synonymously throughout this review.</P>
<P>The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) nomenclature task force has previously defined the term 'atopy' as a personal or familial tendency, or both, usually in childhood and adolescence, to become sensitised to an allergen and to produce IgE antibodies (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Up to 40% of children with atopic eczema are not atopic when defined according to allergy tests, such as skin prick tests (<LINK REF="REF-Bohme-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bohme 2001</LINK>). Others have found that up to two thirds of people with atopic dermatitis are not atopic (<LINK REF="REF-Flohr-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flohr 2004</LINK>), implying that the continued use of the term 'atopic dermatitis' is problematic. A revised nomenclature for allergy (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2001</LINK>) has been updated by the World Allergy Organisation (<LINK REF="REF-Johansson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johansson 2004</LINK>). The new nomenclature is based on the mechanisms that initiate and mediate allergic reactions. The term 'eczema' is proposed to replace the provisional term 'atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome' (AEDS). What is generally known as 'atopic eczema/dermatitis' is probably not one single disease, but rather an aggregation of several diseases with certain characteristics in common. The term 'atopy' cannot be used until an IgE sensitisation has been documented by IgE antibodies in the blood of a person or by a positive skin prick test to common environmental allergens, such as pollen or house dust mite. The term 'eczema' can, therefore, be split into 'atopic eczema' and 'non-atopic eczema'.</P>
<P>Because most readers of this review will be used to the terms 'atopic eczema' or 'atopic dermatitis' when referring to these conditions, we will use the term 'atopic eczema' in a similar loose way throughout this review on the understanding that the use of the prefix 'atopic' does not imply IgE sensitivity. Where IgE sensitivity has been determined in the studies, we will highlight them accordingly.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology and causes</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood, affecting 15% to 20% of children in the UK at any one time (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). The cumulative prevalence of atopic dermatitis varies from up to 20% in Northern Europe and the USA, to 5% in the South Eastern Mediterranean (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thestrup-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thestrup 2002</LINK>). Prevalence data for the symptoms of atopic eczema were collected in the global ISAAC study (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood). The results of this study suggest that atopic eczema is a worldwide problem affecting 5% to 20% of children (<LINK REF="REF-Odhiambo-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odhiambo 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1999</LINK>). Only 2% of children under the age of 5 years have severe disease, and 84% have mild disease (<LINK REF="REF-Emerson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emerson 1998</LINK>). Around 2% of adults have atopic eczema, and many of these have a more chronic and severe form (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2002</LINK>). Atopic eczema is often associated with other atopic diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Beck-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beck 2000</LINK>), e.g. asthma and rhinitis, and sufferers often have a family history of the condition. The incidence of common allergic disease has increased over the last 30 years (<LINK REF="REF-Asher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Asher 2006</LINK>). The increase in prevalence of atopic disease in the past three decades appears to be a real phenomenon and has been observed in countries as far apart as Japan, USA, Finland, and Africa (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The cause of eczema is not well-understood, but it is probably due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors (<LINK REF="REF-Cookson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cookson 2002</LINK>), such as pollution (<LINK REF="REF-Polosa-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Polosa 2001</LINK>), and prenatal or early exposure to infections (<LINK REF="REF-Kalliomaki-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalliomaki 2002</LINK>). Research into filaggrin gene mutations has also highlighted the importance of a defective skin barrier as well as altered immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Oord-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Oord 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical features</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema may be acute (short and severe) with redness, scaling, oozing, and vesicles; or it may be chronic (long-term) with skin thickening, altered pigmentation, and exaggerated surface markings. The condition affects mainly the creases of the elbows and knees, and the face and neck, although it can affect any part of the body. The severity of eczema is variable, ranging from localised mild scaling to generalised involvement of the whole body, with redness, oozing, and secondary infection. Itching is the predominant symptom, which can induce a vicious cycle of scratching and, thus, skin damage that in turn leads to more itching - the so-called "itch scratch itch" cycle. There is a tendency to a dry, sensitive skin, even in those who have 'grown out' of the disease. This is thought to be due to a defect in the barrier of the epidermis (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Oord-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Oord 2009</LINK>). In adulthood, the skin (especially of the hands) may be prone to inflammation in the presence of environmental irritants, such as soaps (<LINK REF="REF-Archer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Archer 2000</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Natural history</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema usually starts within the first 6 months of life, and by 1 year, 60% of those likely to develop it will have done so. Remission occurs by the age of 15 years in 60% to 70% of cases, although some relapse later (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2000</LINK>). In the more severely affected child, development and puberty may be delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Baum-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baum 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Impact</HEADING>
<P>Atopic eczema varies in severity, often from one hour to the next. Severity can be measured in a number of ways. The itching and scratching can adversely affect quality of life through chronic sleep disturbance (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2008</LINK>). This may have an impact on family life. The disease can be associated with complications, such as bacterial and viral infections (<LINK REF="REF-McHenry-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">McHenry 1995</LINK>). The unsightly appearance of the skin and the need to apply greasy ointments can limit a child's inclination to participate in social and sporting activities and, thus, affect their confidence. Adults with atopic eczema often have low self-esteem, and relationships can be difficult to initiate and sustain. Everyday tasks, such as housework, gardening, childcare, and food preparation, present problems when the skin on the hands is cracked. Promotion at work may be blocked for people who do not 'look good'.</P>
<P>There is a substantial economic cost not only to the family of the person with atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Kemp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kemp 2003</LINK>), but also to the health services of the country as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Herd-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herd 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mancini-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mancini 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verboom-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verboom 2002</LINK>). Direct costs to the family are encountered when purchasing treatments, special clothing, and bedding; indirect costs are experienced from lost working days when parents are looking after a sick child. The wider economic implications lie in the costs of healthcare professionals, the lost opportunities of parents of sick children who do not have the option of seeking employment, and the child who, as a result of missing schooling, has limited employment prospects (<LINK REF="REF-Su-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Su 1997</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-12-05 14:07:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is currently no cure for atopic eczema. However, a wide range of treatments are employed that aim to control the symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Fennessy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fennessy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lamb-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lamb 2002</LINK>). Healthcare professionals assist people in the management of their disease using a variety of treatment methods; these include emollients, topical steroids, topical tars, topical tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus (<LINK REF="REF-NCC_x002d_WCH-_x0026_-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCC-WCH &amp; NICE 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2011</LINK>). Other treatment methods, such as wet wrap dressings, phototherapy, and complementary therapies (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2002</LINK>), are also tried. Many of the treatments are of unknown effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Hoare-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoare 2000</LINK>). Emollients and topical corticosteroids are universally recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Smethurst-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smethurst 2002</LINK>). In addition, textile (soft clothes) and ambient (dust) measures of control for atopic eczema have been used.</P>
<P>The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) systematic review of treatments for atopic eczema (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=70922839962228873942110428135704&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Hoare-2000">Hoare 2000</A>) looked at trials that had been conducted on dietary interventions including borage oil, evening primrose oil, pyridoxine, vitamin, and zinc supplementation. This review suggested that there was no clear benefit over placebo with any of these interventions, although no formal meta-analyses were performed, and the review is now out of date. We could not find any other systematic reviews on this topic.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Diet and atopic eczema</HEADING>
<P>Many people with atopic eczema are reluctant to use the most commonly recommended treatments because they fear the long-term health effects (<LINK REF="REF-Charman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charman 2002</LINK>). As a result, many turn to dietary supplementation as a possible treatment approach, often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in the diet of the affected individual. In other cases, the rationale for use of the supplements may have a sound scientific basis as illustrated below.</P>
<P>A number of dietary supplements have been tried, and these can be broadly classified into the following.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Vitamins, such as pyridoxine (vitamin B6)</HEADING>
<P>Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is an essential water-soluble vitamin and a co-factor in many of the body's chemical pathways. It has been used to treat atopic eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Mabin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mabin 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Essential fatty acids, such as evening primrose oil (EPO)</HEADING>
<P>Polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential components of all cell membranes. There are 2 families of such essential fatty acids: n-6 (e.g. linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) and n-3 (e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid). Some of these substances are precursors of a group of substances called eicosanoids, which may play an important part in the inflammatory and immunological processes of atopic eczema. Fish oils are particularly rich in n-3 fatty acids, and it has been suggested that these may compete with n-6 fatty acids in a way that reduces the inflammatory components of atopic eczema. EPO and borage oil are being covered in another Cochrane review currently in preparation (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Minerals, such as zinc</HEADING>
<P>Oral supplements of zinc salts have become popular remedies for a range of unrelated medical disorders (<LINK REF="REF-Pfeiffer-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pfeiffer 1978</LINK>). They have been specifically recommended for the treatment of atopic eczema (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Davies-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1988</LINK>), although the scientific basis for this is unclear.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) 'Others', such as trace elements (e.g. selenium)</HEADING>
<P>Reduced concentrations of selenium in whole blood, plasma, and white cells; and reduced activity of the selenium-dependent enzyme, glutathione peroxidase, in red cells have been found in atopic eczema. This has lead to the use of supplements, such as selenium and vitamin E (<LINK REF="REF-Fairris-1989a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fairris 1989a</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Probiotics (friendly gut bacteria)</HEADING>
<P>Probiotics are a treatment that may alter the intestinal microbiota of people with eczema. Probiotics are live micro-organisms (e.g. <I>Lactobacillus</I> species) that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Their precise mode of action is not well-established, but they have been shown to reduce markers of intestinal inflammation and intestinal permeability in disease states. This might change the way in which antigens that are present in the intestine are recognised by the immune system. Probiotics are dealt with in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2008</LINK>).</P>

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 1997</LINK>) did not mention loss to follow up, possibly due to a highly-selected population.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">1. Fish oil</HEADING>
<P>Two studies were in adults with moderate/severe atopic eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>). A third study was in adults with severe atopic eczema (<LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 1997</LINK>). Two of these studies were considered sufficiently similar to pool for individual signs of AE (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>) was a parallel study of 31 adults (16 to 56 years) over a 12-week period, which compared extract of fish oil (each capsule also contained an antioxidant, vitamin A, and vitamin D) to an isoenergetic (same energy value) placebo supplement containing olive oil. The main outcomes, which were symptom scores evaluated by the physician, were erythema, scale, visibility, severity, excoriation, weeping, lichenification, and the area affected. Symptom scores evaluated by participants were erythema, visibility, itch, scale, and effect on daily living.</P>
<P>The second study (<LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>) was a parallel study of 145 adults (18 to 64 years) comparing fish oil (each capsule also contained an antioxidant) to a placebo (corn oil). The main outcomes, which were total symptom scores as rated by physicians and participants at 16 weeks, were effects of daily life as rated by the participants, and changes in individual signs of AE as assessed by a physician.</P>
<P>With regard to our primary outcome (a) 'Short-term (within six weeks). Changes in participant-rated or parent-rated symptoms of atopic eczema, such as itching (pruritus) or sleep loss', no data were available for either study.</P>
<P>With regard to our primary outcome (b) 'Degree of long-term (over six months) control, such as reduction in number of flares or reduced need for other treatments', there was no significant difference in topical steroid use for the <LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK> study. Only the mean and ranges were given: fish group, 95.8 g (40 to 250 g); and placebo, 77.7 g (10 to 200 g). In the <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK> study, there was no significant difference in antihistamine or mild topical steroid use - this was only mentioned in the text.</P>
<P>With regard to our secondary outcome (a) 'Global severity as rated by the participants or their physician', analysis of total symptom score as rated by the participant in the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>) showed significantly higher overall improvement in the fish oil group, compared to the control group (one study; MD 10.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 19.86) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Analysis of total symptom score as rated by the physician showed no significant difference in overall improvement when fish oil was compared to placebo. No figures were given for this.</P>
<P>In the <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK> study, the total symptom scores rated by the physician and the participant after treatment significantly improved in both groups; no figures were given for the difference between groups - only mean values were given per group with no standard deviations (fish group, 3.1; and placebo, 3.2).</P>
<P>With regard to our secondary outcome (d) 'Quality of life', there was a significant difference in effect of daily living as evaluated by participants at the end of treatment in favour of fish oil (treatment group), compared to placebo (pooled analysis; 2 studies; MD -0.84, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.15) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>

No significant difference was found for induration (1 study; MD 0.8, 95% CI -0.03 to 1.63) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>) or pruritus (1 study; MD -0.2, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.63) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). Results for itch at the end of treatment, as rated by the participant, significantly favoured the fish oil group (1 study; MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.46 to -0.54) (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).</P>

<P>The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 1997</LINK>) was a three-armed parallel study of 48 adults, which compared linoleic acid (from sunflower) versus fish oil versus placebo (oleic acid). The main outcomes were disease severity assessed by the Rajka score and eczema extension assessed by the Rule of Nines. Only six-week data were given for all three groups due to a high dropout rate in the vegetable oil and placebo group. No numbers were given per arm.</P>
<P>With regard to our primary outcome (a) 'Short-term (within six weeks). Changes in participant-rated or parent-rated symptoms of atopic eczema', such as itching (pruritus) or sleep loss', no data were given for short-term changes in participant-rated or parent-rated symptoms.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-05 15:21:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review identified 11 randomised controlled trials of dietary supplements for the treatment of established atopic eczema. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. Oral zinc sulphate was compared to placebo in one study, and other single RCTs compared selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D and E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value).</P>
<P>Most of the studies evaluated were far too small in size to exclude even large treatment differences, so it is not surprising that most have failed to show any treatment differences. Such small studies are similarly unable to conclude that the treatments were ineffective due to the lack of precision of effects estimates inherent in such small studies.</P>
<P>Some of the interventions tested were quite complex in terms of combination of various products that might have had opposing beneficial or harmful effects. For example, the study by Bjorneboe included a combination of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids along with vitamins A, D, and E. At such an early stage of research, it is probably better to explore the effects of single compounds in placebo-controlled studies so that each can be retained or eliminated as appropriate.</P>
<P>The three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>) looking at fish oil versus placebo found no significant differences for any of the primary outcomes. However, pooled analysis of two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>) found that fish oil significantly improved the effect on daily living compared to placebo (our secondary outcome looking at quality of life). This analysis also found a significant difference in area affected at the end of treatment as assessed by the physician (one of our tertiary outcomes). One study evaluated itch at the end of the study and found that fish oil significantly improved itch compared to the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Bjorneboe-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bjorneboe 1989</LINK>). The largest of the fish oil supplementation studies did not show any benefit over placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Soyland-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Soyland 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Ewing-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ewing 1991</LINK>) of poor methodological quality failed to show the benefit of zinc supplementation in atopic eczema. The study found no significant difference between zinc sulphate and placebo in the severity of eczema at eight weeks in children. In addition, parental-rated mean itch score was significantly better in the placebo group compared to the zinc group.</P>
<P>One small study (<LINK REF="STD-Fairris-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Fairris 1989</LINK>) of poor methodological quality failed to show any benefit of selenium supplementation or selenium plus vitamin E supplementation over placebo.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Javanbakht-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Javanbakht 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sidbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sidbury 2008</LINK>) found no benefit of vitamin D over placebo. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Javanbakht-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Javanbakht 2011</LINK>) found no benefit of vitamin E over placebo, but found a significant difference in SCORAD at the end of treatment in favour of vitamin D plus E over placebo. A more recent study comparing vitamin E to placebo and the combination of vitamin E and D to placebo found no benefit of either vitamin E or D compared to placebo.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mabin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mabin 1995</LINK>) of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) provided insufficient evidence to assess pyridoxine in people with atopic eczema. The study found no significant difference between pyridoxine and placebo in the severity of eczema at four weeks.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Yang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 1999</LINK>) found no significant difference in SCORAD at four weeks in adults when sea buckthorn seed oil was compared to placebo or sea buckthorn pulp oil was compared to placebo.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Callaway-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Callaway 2005</LINK>) found no benefit of hempseed oil over placebo in adults.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Gimenez_x002d_Arnau-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gimenez-Arnau 1997</LINK>) found no benefit of sunflower oil over placebo in adults with chronic or severe atopic eczema. This study quoted a significant difference in the per cent reduction of Rajka score and Rule of Nines when sunflower oil was compared to fish oil and when sunflower oil was compared to placebo; however, we were unable to substantiate this since the number of participants in each arm was not given.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-11-20 23:37:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eleven poor quality studies were included in this review involving 596 participants: 3 fish oil supplement diets, 1 zinc supplement diet, 1 selenium supplement diet, 2 vitamin D supplement diets, 1 vitamin E supplement diet, 1 pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) supplement diet, 1 sea buckthorn oil supplement diet, 1 hempseed oil supplement diet, and 1 sunflower oil supplement diet.</P>
<P>All three of the fish oil studies in adults were of poor methodological quality; two of the studies were in adults with moderate to severe atopic eczema and the third study was in adults with severe atopic eczema. Concealment of allocation was unclear in all three studies. None of the studies looked at short-term (within six weeks) changes in participant-rated or parent-rated symptoms of atopic eczema, such as itching or sleep loss. None of the studies looked at reduction in the number of flares; however, one study reported a reduction in the use of topical steroids, and one study reported no difference in the use of topical steroids or antihistamine use.</P>
<P>Only three studies clearly demonstrated adequate concealment of allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Javanbakht-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Javanbakht 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mabin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Mabin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sidbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sidbury 2008</LINK>). Blinding was unclear in over half of the studies. Only one small study (<LINK REF="STD-Sidbury-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Sidbury 2008</LINK>) had no losses to follow up and analysed by intention-to-treat. For two studies, the number of participants in each arm was not given. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Koch-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 2008</LINK>) clearly described baseline comparability, whereas the other studies just gave comparability for participants completing the supplementation. Compliance was only clear in three studies. The severity of atopic eczema was only clear in seven of the studies; however, for most of the studies (73%) the certainly of atopic eczema was clear.</P>
<P>Whilst the promotion of various products claiming various skin benefits not supported by good evidence might be commonplace in the world of dietary supplements, we did not find any major concerns regarding conflicts of interest in the trials identified in this review. The inclusion of those studies where conflicts of interest with commercial organisations were declared did not alter our overall conclusions. The field of dietary supplements for health benefit is a large and complex one, which some have tried to summarise using "balloon race" depictions: <A HREF="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/snake-oil-supplements/">http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/snake-oil-supplements/</A>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-12-05 15:35:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Disappointingly, we have not found any convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema. It is not possible for us to claim that all of the supplements that were examined in this review are not effective, because all of the studies were of low quality and most were much too small (underpowered) to exclude even relatively moderate treatment benefits.</P>
<P>Whilst this review cannot exclude the possibility that dietary supplements may play a role in improving eczema, the absence of positive evidence means that they cannot be recommended to the public or for clinical practice at present.</P>
<P>Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored, and a convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced. In addition, one study comparing vitamin D plus E to placebo found a significant improvement of SCORAD at the end of treatment where vitamin D or vitamin E alone had not. This study was small, and a larger study is needed to confirm these results. There is also a real need to look closely at adverse events. It is unclear if these small but statistically significant differences are clinically worthwhile in the absence of better information on the scales used.</P>
<P>Whilst it is possible that some may argue that at least supplements do not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-12-05 15:36:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The grounds for recommending further clinical trial research in this field are limited. Whilst it is true that public interest in supplements of various sorts for chronic diseases is quite high, the main lack of anything positive to date may reflect poorly-designed, poorly-reported, and underpowered studies. There needs to be a stronger theoretical, biological, epidemiological, and experimental rationale before recommending further research in this area. Much attention has already been focused on evening primrose oil with no clear sign of benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>), although another Cochrane review will address this specific topic (<LINK REF="REF-Boehm-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boehm 2003</LINK>). Given the presence of at least some positive secondary/tertiary outcomes in two of the studies that have explored fish oil, and that there is at least some good theoretical basis why they might play a role in dampening down the inflammatory pathway, a much larger placebo-controlled and well-designed study might be worthwhile. Although recent evidence has suggested that increased vitamin D intake may play a role in altering immune responses (<LINK REF="REF-Schwalfenberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwalfenberg 2011</LINK>) and in protecting atopic diseases, such as asthma, we are not aware of any convincing role in eczema prevention or treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Miyake-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Miyake-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miyake 2011</LINK>). There is, however, some emerging data on the role of vitamin D in possibly modifying immune responses in eczema (the sunshine hypothesis, <LINK REF="REF-Searing-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Searing 2010</LINK>), and one recent study has shown a possible link between eczema severity and low vitamin D levels.</P>
<P>Another study has shown that vitamin D supplementation could reverse some of the defects in the innate immune system associated with atopic eczema, such as the capacity to increase the production of broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin, which may in turn decrease the risk of secondary infections (<LINK REF="REF-Hata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hata 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is also worth pointing out that many of the "placebos" used substances, such as olive oil, which might not be inert, thereby, reducing the chances of finding a true biological effect in the tested interventions. Future researchers should think carefully about the nature of placebos that are used in such studies.</P>
<P>The clinical data is not sufficiently strong to warrant a large trial in this area yet, although it is an area worth following up. As for the other dietary supplements, we are unconvinced that there is sufficient biological or clinical data to suggest that further clinical trials are needed, although we would be happy to revise such a statement in the future if a new and convincing critical mass of evidence emerges.</P>
<P>Future studies should use outcome measures that are more readily clinically interpretable and should be informed by the outcome of the Harmonizing Outcomes for Eczema (HOME) project (<LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schmitt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schmitt 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>The measurement of surface area involvement is just one example of lack of consistency that could be addressed by harmonisation of outcome measures. Some have used terms such as 'eczema extent', 'eczema extension', 'area affected', and 'affected areas' in unclear ways; and it is equally unclear how and whether extent should be combined with other signs of eczema, such as oedema, redness, and scaliness.</P>
<P>Because little is known about how these supplements could work at a biologic level in allergic disease, little is known about their duration of action. This means that they are probably unsuitable for testing in cross-over designs where each participant is given both treatments to try, because the effect of taking the first treatment may hang over into the next treatment phase.</P>

<P>A search of the GREAT (The Global Resource of Eczema Trials) database in February 2013 found just 1 study on Vitamin D supplementation, and another search of the GREAT database in May 2014 found only a few papers. Thus, this review has been marked stable because most of the papers were on probiotics and prebiotics, which are dealt with in another Cochrane review, and the paper on vitamin D is unlikely to move the existing vitamin D data in the review on in any meaningful way. An update has not been considered necessary for two successive years. Our Trials Search Co-ordinator will run a new search in 2015 to re-assess whether an update is needed.</P>
