<P>The latest literature search was completed in June 2003 and the conclusions were updated in October 2004.</P>
<P>In contrast to the previous review that concluded that the poor methodological quality of the trials did not allow any conclusions on the effectiveness of acupuncture, the current update demonstrated the effectiveness of meridian acupuncture for chronic low-back pain in some special cases:<BR/>1) compared to no treatment, acupuncture improved pain and function at short-term follow-up<BR/>2) compared to sham therapies, acupuncture improved pain at short-term follow-up, but these effects were not maintained at longer-term follow-up and they were not observed for functional outcomes<BR/>3) when acupuncture was added to other conventional therapies, there was better pain relief and improved function when compared to the conventional therapies alone.<BR/>
<BR/>Also, this updated review examined acupuncture separately from dry-needling. The authors concluded that no clear recommendations could be made about dry-needling because of the small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies, although it appeared that dry-needling was a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. Effects in all cases were only small.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Thirty-five RCTs covering 2861 patients were included in this systematic review. There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendations about acupuncture or dry-needling for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, results show that acupuncture is more effective for pain relief than no treatment or sham treatment, in measurements taken up to three months. The results also show that for chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for improving function than no treatment, in the short-term. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and "alternative" treatments. When acupuncture is added to other conventional therapies, it relieves pain and improves function better than the conventional therapies alone. However, effects are only small. Dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Although low-back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for its treatment. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We updated the searches from 1996 to February 2003 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also searched the Chinese Cochrane Centre database of clinical trials and Japanese databases to February 2003.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized trials of acupuncture (that involves needling) for adults with non-specific (sub)acute or chronic low-back pain, or dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed methodological quality (using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group) and extracted data. The trials were combined using meta-analyses methods or levels of evidence when the data reported did not allow statistical pooling.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirty-five RCTs were included; 20 were published in English, seven in Japanese, five in Chinese and one each in Norwegian, Polish and German. There were only three trials of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. They did not justify firm conclusions, because of small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies. For chronic low-back pain there is evidence of pain relief and functional improvement for acupuncture, compared to no treatment or sham therapy. These effects were only observed immediately after the end of the sessions and at short-term follow-up. There is evidence that acupuncture, added to other conventional therapies, relieves pain and improves function better than the conventional therapies alone. However, effects are only small. Dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. No clear recommendations could be made about the most effective acupuncture technique.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. For chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. Acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and "alternative" treatments. The data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. Because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-30 11:05:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-back pain is a major health problem among western industrialized countries, and a major cause of medical expenses, absenteeism and disablement (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1995</LINK>). People with acute low-back pain usually experience improvements in pain, disability, and return to work within one month, further but smaller improvements occur up to three months, after which, pain and disability levels remain almost constant and most people will have at least one recurrence within 12 months (<LINK REF="REF-Pengel-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pengel 2003</LINK>). Although low-back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease (<LINK REF="REF-Waddell-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waddell 1987</LINK>), a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available to treat it (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1997</LINK>). However, the effectiveness of most of these interventions has not been convincingly demonstrated and consequently, the therapeutic management of low-back pain varies widely.</P>
<P>Acupuncture is one of the oldest forms of therapy and has its roots in ancient Chinese philosophy. Traditional acupuncture is based on a number of philosophical concepts, one of which postulates that any manifestation of disease is considered a sign of imbalance between the Yin and Yang forces within the body. In classical acupuncture theory, it is believed that all disorders are reflected at specific points, either on the skin surface or just below it. Vital energy circulates throughout the body along the so-called meridians, which have either Yin or Yang characteristics. An appropriate choice of the 361 classical acupuncture points located on these meridians for needling is believed to restore the balance in the body. When the needles have been placed successfully, the patient is supposed to experience a sensation known as Teh Chi (in some schools of traditional acupuncture). Teh Chi has been defined as a subjective feeling of fullness, numbness, tingling, and warmth, with some local soreness and a feeling of distension around the acupuncture point. There is no consensus among acupuncturists about the necessity of reaching Teh Chi for acupuncture to be effective. </P>
<P>Since acupuncture disseminated to the west several hundred years ago, many different styles of acupuncture have developed, including Japanese Meridian Therapy, French Energetic Acupuncture, Korean Constitutional Acupuncture and Lemington 5 Element Acupuncture. While these are similar to traditional acupuncture, they each have distinct characteristics. In recent decades, new forms of acupuncture have developed, such as ear (auricular) acupuncture, head (scalp) acupuncture, hand acupuncture and foot acupuncture (<LINK REF="REF-Lao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lao 1996</LINK>). Modern acupuncturists use not only traditional meridian acupuncture points, but also non-meridian or extra-meridian acupuncture points, which are fixed points not necessarily associated with meridians. Acupuncture commonly includes manual stimulation of the needles, but various adjuncts are often used, including electrical acupuncture (in which an electrical stimulator is connected to the acupuncture needle), injection acupuncture (herbal extracts injected into acupuncture points), heat lamps, and acupuncture with moxibustion (the moxa herb, Artemisia vulgaris, is burned at the end of the needle) (<LINK REF="REF-Lao-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lao 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Dry-needling is a technique that uses needles to treat myofascial pain in any body part, including the low-back region. Myofascial pain syndrome is a disease of muscle that produces local and referred pain. It is characterized by a motor abnormality (a hard band within the muscle) and by sensory abnormalities (tenderness and referred pain). It is classified as a musculoskeletal pain syndrome that can be acute or chronic, regional or generalized. It can be a primary disorder causing local or regional pain syndromes, or a secondary disorder that occurs as a consequence of some other condition (<LINK REF="REF-Gerwin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerwin 2001</LINK>). In 1983, Travel and Simons published the book <I>Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction - the Trigger Point Manual </I>(<LINK REF="REF-Travell-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travell 1983</LINK>), which shows the pain pattern of trigger points in every muscle of the body. Myofascial trigger points, once carefully identified, can be inactivated by various methods including systemic muscle relaxants, botulinum toxin, antidepressants, deep muscle massage (for example: Shiatsu), local injection of substances such as steroids or lidocaine, and dry-needling. Dry-needling involves the insertion of a needle (it can be an acupuncture needle or any other injection needle without injecting any liquid) at these trigger points. The needles are not left in situ, they are removed once the trigger point is inactivated. The inactivation of the trigger point should be followed by exercises (usually stretching) or ergonomic adjustments with the purpose to re-establish a painless, full range of motion, and avoid recurrences. </P>
<P>It is still unclear what exact mechanisms underlying the action of acupuncture or dry-needling. Western scientific research has proposed mechanisms for the effect of acupuncture on pain relief. It has been suggested that acupuncture might act by principles of the gate control theory of pain. One type of sensory input (low-back pain) could be inhibited in the central nervous system by another type of input (needling). Another theory, the diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), implies that noxious stimulation of heterotopic body areas modulates the pain sensation originating in areas where a subject feels pain. There is also some evidence that acupuncture may stimulate the production of endorphins, serotonin and acetylcholine within the central nervous system, enhancing analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Chu-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chu 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stux-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stux 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of low-back pain has been systematically reviewed before (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999-_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999 (a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-1999-_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 1999 (b)</LINK>) with inconclusive results due to the low methodological quality of the included studies. This is an updated review of all available scientific evidence, including evidence from Chinese and Japanese trials, on the effectiveness of acupuncture for both acute and chronic low-back pain, and dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region. </P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this systematic review were to determine the effects of acupuncture for (sub)acute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, and dry-needling for myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region, compared to no treatment, sham therapies, other therapies, and the addition of acupuncture to other therapies.</P>

<P>Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no language restriction, were included in this systematic review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Adults (&gt;18 years) with non-specific low-back pain and myofascial pain syndrome in the low-back region were included. RCTs that included subjects with low-back pain caused by specific pathological entities such as infection, metastatic diseases, neoplasm, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or fractures were excluded. Low-back pain associated with sciatica as the major symptom, pregnancy and post-partum were also excluded. Although some studies did not exclusively limit the study population to patients with non-specific symptoms, studies were included if the majority of the patients had non-specific low-back pain according to the predefined criteria. Patients with (sub)acute (12 weeks or less) or chronic low-back pain (more than 12 weeks), were included. </P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Articles evaluating acupuncture or dry-needling treatments that involve needling were included in this review. Acupuncture was defined as "the diagnosis was made using traditional acupuncture theory and the needles were inserted in classical meridian points, extra points or ah-shi points (painful points)'. Dry-needling was defined as "the cause of pain was diagnosed as "Myofascial Pain Syndrome", the points were chosen by palpation in the muscle, and the needles were inserted into these myofascial trigger points'. Studies were included regardless of the source of stimulation (e.g., hand or electrical stimulation). Studies in which the acupuncture treatment did not involve needling, such as acupressure or laser acupuncture were excluded. The control interventions were no treatment, placebo/sham acupuncture or other sham procedure, and other therapeutic interventions. Trials comparing two techniques of acupuncture or dry-needling were included, but analysed separately.</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2008-05-29 15:35:41 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>RCTs were included that used at least one of the four outcome measures considered to be important in the field of low-back pain: pain intensity (e.g., visual analog scale (VAS)), a global measure (e.g., overall improvement, proportion of patients recovered, subjective improvement of symptoms), back specific functional status (e.g., Roland Disability Scale, Oswestry Scale) and return to work (e.g., return to work status, number of days off work). The primary outcomes for this review were pain and functional status. Physiological outcomes of physical examination (e.g., range of motion, spinal flexibility, degrees of straight leg raising or muscle strength), generic health status (e.g., SF-36, Nottingham Health Profile, Sickness Impact Profile) and other symptoms, such as medication use and side effects were considered secondary outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection</HEADING>
<P>For this updated review, one author (ADF) generated the electronic search strategies in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE and downloaded the citations into Reference Manager 9.0 Two authors (MvT and BK) then independently reviewed the information to identify trials that could potentially meet the inclusion criteria. Full articles describing these trials were obtained and the same two authors independently applied the selection criteria to the studies. Consensus was used to solve disagreements concerning the final inclusion of RCTs and a third author was consulted if disagreements persisted. One author (HT) searched and selected the studies from the Japanese databases. The Chinese Cochrane Centre generated the searches in their Trials Register and one author (LXL) selected the studies. The authors of recent original studies were contacted to obtain more information when needed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of each RCT was independently assessed by two authors (not always the same pair of authors). Review authors were not blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal because they were familiar with the literature. Consensus was used to resolve disagreements and a third author was consulted if disagreements persisted.<BR/>The methodological quality of the RCTs was assessed by using the criteria list recommended in the Updated Method Guidelines for systematic reviews in the Cochrane Back Review Group (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). Each item was scored as "yes", "no" or "don't know" according to the definitions of the criteria (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality assessment of the studies was used for two purposes: First, to exclude studies with fatal flaws (such as drop-out rate higher than 50%, statistically significant and clinically important baseline differences that were not accounted in the analyses). Studies that passed the first screening for fatal flaws were classified into lower or higher quality: Higher quality was defined as a trial fulfilling six or more of the 11 methodological quality criteria and not having a fatal flaw. Lower quality trials were defined as fulfilling fewer than six criteria and not having a fatal flaw. The classification into higher/lower quality was used to grade the strength of the evidence.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted the data on the study characteristics, funding, ethics, study population, interventions, analyses and outcomes. The authors of recent studies (published in the past five years) were contacted to obtain more information when needed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adequacy of treatment</HEADING>
<P>Three authors, who are experienced acupuncturists (AF, LXL and HT), judged the adequacy of treatment. The data extraction included four questions about the adequacy of treatment, which were derived from the STRICTA recommendations (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2002</LINK>): 1) Choice of acupoints, 2) Number of sessions, 3) Needling technique and 4) Acupuncturist experience. The control groups were also judged as 1) appropriateness of sham/placebo intervention and 2) adequate number of sessions/dose. In addition, a panel of experts in acupuncture treatment for low-back pain was consulted in a three-hour session in which each study was presented for discussion (only the population and interventions were presented, so the panel was blinded to authors, journal, year, country, outcomes and results). The panel consisted of six physicians trained in a variety of acupuncture methods (Traditional Chinese medicine, Ryodoraku, dry-needling, trigger point injections and scalp needling) who work at a multidisciplinary pain clinic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The panel also classified each study as acupuncture or dry-needling.</P>

<LI>acupuncture compared to another intervention</LI>
<LI>acupuncture added to an intervention compared to the intervention without acupuncture.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Any other comparisons were considered secondary analysis.</P>
<P>The results of each RCT were plotted as point estimates, i.e., relative risks (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes, mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes, or other data types as reported by the authors of the studies. When the results could not be plotted, they were described in the table of included studies or the data were entered into "other data tables". For continuous measures, preference was given to analyse the results with weighted mean differences (WMD) because these results are easier to interpret for clinicians and other readers. If this was not possible, then standardized mean differences (SMD) or effect sizes were used. The studies were first assessed for clinical homogeneity with respect to the duration of the disorder, types of acupuncture, control group and the outcomes. Clinically heterogeneous studies were not combined in the analysis, but separately described. For studies judged as clinically homogeneous, statistical heterogeneity was tested by Q test (chi-square) and I<SUP>2</SUP>. Clinically and statistically homogeneous studies were pooled using the fixed effect model. Clinically homogeneous and statistically heterogeneous studies were pooled using the random effects model. Funnel plots were constructed when at least 10 studies were available for the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Sutton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutton 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>When the data could not be entered in the meta-analysis because of the way the authors of the trials reported the results (for example: no information about standard deviation of the means) we performed a qualitative analysis by attributing various levels of evidence to the effectiveness of acupuncture, taking into account the methodological quality and the outcome of the original studies (<LINK REF="REF-van-Tulder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Tulder 2003</LINK>):<BR/>

The majority of the population included in these trials had chronic low-back pain (24 studies, 1718 patients). The control groups were the following: no treatment, sham acupuncture, sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), Chinese herbal medicine, education, exercise, massage, moxibustion, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, spinal manipulation, TENS, trigger point injections, and usual treatment by a general practitioner. Six studies compared the effectiveness of two different acupuncture techniques.</P>

In none of the 35 trials was the care provider blinded; in 28 trials, the timing of the outcome assessment was similar in all groups. The biggest problem was the quality of reporting, which did not allow us to judge the following items: method of randomisation (15 trials), concealment of allocation (16 trials), baseline differences (18 trials), co-interventions (18 trials) and compliance (17 trials). Of the seven trials published in Japanese, four were of higher (<LINK REF="STD-Araki-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Araki 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Inoue-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Inoue 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sakai 2001</LINK>) and three were of lower methodological quality.

<P>Our searches resulted in the identification of 68 in CENTRAL, 49 reports in MEDLINE, and 85 in EMBASE. We obtained hard copies of 40 articles, but excluded 17 because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. In addition, we retrieved 16 hard copies of studies published in Japanese and 11 published in Chinese, but excluded nine and six respectively, because they did not meet our inclusion criteria. Reasons for the exclusion of these studies are explained in the Table of Excluded Studies. We contacted the primary authors of eight trials to obtain additional information that was not reported in the published study.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Clinical Relevance</HEADING>
<P>The results of the clinical relevance assessment of each included study are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. It should be noted that there was an enormous variance in the way the authors judged the five items of clinical relevance. This occurred because different pairs of authors assessed the 35 trials and each author has a different background and training. In addition, there were no clear instructions of what should constitute a "yes" or "no" response for each question. As a consequence, the assessment of clinical relevance of each individual trial is subjective and difficult to analyse in the context of this systematic review. Additional <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> shows the improvement in pain for each treatment group and for each duration of low-back pain. The average improvement in pain with acupuncture for acute low-back pain was 52% (based on two studies), 32% for chronic (16 studies) and 51% for unknown or mixed durations of pains (eight studies). The average improvement of pain with no treatment was 6% (six studies). The average improvement of pain with sham or placebo therapies was 22% for acute (one study), 23% for chronic (six studies) and 25% for unknown or mixed durations of pain (three studies).</P>

Of five trials that measured pain immediately after the end of the sessions, four trials could be pooled (<LINK REF="STD-Mendelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelson 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leibing-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leibing 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molsberger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molsberger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kerr-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kerr 2003</LINK>). The pooled analysis (two higher and two lower quality RCTs, 314 people) shows that acupuncture is more effective than sham therapy with a WMD of -10.21 (95% CI -14.99 to -5.44) (comparison 5.1). The trial not included in the meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>) included 36 people and found a trend that acupuncture was better than sham therapy, but failed to reach statistical significance. This trial could not be pooled with the other studies because of the scale they used to measure pain and the way they analysed the results. For short-term measures of pain, there is strong evidence (two higher quality trials, 138 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molsberger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molsberger 2002</LINK>) that acupuncture is more effective than sham therapy for patients with chronic low-back pain, with a WMD of -17.79 (95% CI -25.5 to -10.07) (See comparison 5.1 and other data table 5.9). There are three trials (two higher and one lower quality, 255 people) that assessed intermediate-term pain (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leibing-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leibing 2002</LINK>). All three trials found a trend that acupuncture was better than sham therapy, but without statistical significance. It was possible to pool two of these studies, showing a WMD of -5.74 (95% CI -14.72 to 3.25) (See comparison 5.1). The only exception was the analysis adjusted for baseline values conducted by Carlsson and Sjolund (See other data table 06.09.03) that showed a statistically significant effect (p=0.007) in favour of acupuncture over sham therapy. For long-term measures of pain, there is moderate evidence (one higher quality trial, 51 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Carlsson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Carlsson 2001</LINK>) that there is no difference between acupuncture and sham therapy for chronic low-back pain. For measures of function taken immediately after the end of the sessions, there is moderate evidence (one higher and two lower quality trials, 316 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leibing-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leibing 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mendelson-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mendelson 1983</LINK>) that there is no difference between acupuncture and sham therapy.

<P>Compared to spinal manipulation, there is limited evidence (one lower quality trial, 68 people) (Giles &amp; Muller 2003) that acupuncture is less effective for measures of pain and function immediately after the end of the sessions. Compared to massage, there is moderate evidence (one higher quality trial, 172 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin 2001</LINK>) that there is no difference immediately after the sessions in pain between acupuncture and massage, but there is a statistically significant difference in favour of massage at the long-term follow-up. For measures of function, massage was statistically significantly more effective than acupuncture immediately after the end of the sessions, but there was only a marginally statistically significant difference in favour of massage at the long-term follow-up. However, differences in effect were only small (moderate evidence). Compared to celecoxib, rofecoxib or paracetamol, there is limited evidence (one lower quality trial, 72 people) (Giles &amp; Muller 2003) that there is no difference immediately after the end of the sessions in measures of pain and function. There is conflicting evidence (two trials, 56 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Tsukayama-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsukayama 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>) on the effectiveness of acupuncture compared to TENS for patients with chronic low-back pain for pain measured immediately after the end of the sessions: one higher quality trial with a small sample size (<LINK REF="STD-Tsukayama-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Tsukayama 2002</LINK>) found a statistically significant difference in favour of acupuncture over TENS, while one lower quality trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>) found no difference. There is limited evidence (one lower quality trial, 36 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Lehmann--1986" TYPE="STUDY">Lehmann 1986</LINK>) that there is no difference at the intermediate-term follow-up in pain between acupuncture and TENS for patients with chronic low-back pain.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">3b. Addition of acupuncture to other interventions for chronic low-back pain:</HEADING>
<P>There are four higher-quality trials that assessed the effects of acupuncture added to other therapies and compared it to the other therapy alone (289 people) (<LINK REF="STD-Leibing-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Leibing 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meng-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meng 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Molsberger-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Molsberger 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yeung-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Yeung 2003</LINK>). The other therapies included: exercises, NSAIDs, aspirin, non-narcotic analgesic, mud packs, infrared heat therapy, back care education, ergonomics or behavioural modification. The pooled analysis (comparison 12.1) shows that the addition of acupuncture to other interventions is more effective than the other intervention alone for pain, measured immediately after the end of the sessions (four higher quality trials, 289 people) with a SMD of -0.76 (95% CI -1.02 to-0.5), at the short-term follow-up (three higher quality trials, 182 people) with a SMD of -1.1 (95% CI -1.62 to-0.58), and at the intermediate-term follow-up (two higher quality trials, 115 people) with a SMD of -0.76 (95% CI-1.14 to-0.38). These effects were also observed for functional outcomes (comparison 12.7) immediately after the end of the sessions (three higher quality trials, 173 people) with a SMD of -0.95 (95% CI -1.27 to-0.63), at the short-term follow-up with a SMD of -0.95 (95% CI -1.37 to-0.54), and at the intermediate-term follow-up with a SMD of -0.55 (95% CI-0.92 to-0.18).</P>

<P>Measures of global improvement included multiple-choice categorical scales (e.g., improved - same - worse) or dichotomous options (e.g., improved - not improved). In the case of multiple-choice categorical scales, we dichotomized the categories according to the principle of "improved" and "not improved". The number of patients improved was divided by the total number of patients in that group (comparison 2.2, 4.2, and 5.2).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-30 11:02:48 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty-five RCTs covering 2861 patients were included in this systematic review. There were only three trials of acupuncture for acute low-back pain that do not justify firm conclusions, because of small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies. There is some evidence that acupuncture may be better than no treatment or sham treatment for chronic low-back pain. However, most studies have not found acupuncture to be more effective than other conventional treatments (e.g., analgesics, NSAIDs, TENS and self-care education) or "alternative" treatments (e.g., massage or spinal manipulation). The data suggest that both acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain.</P>
<P>Although the conclusions showed some positive results of acupuncture, the magnitude of the effects were generally small. The average pain reduction (measured by continuous scales such as the VAS) in the group that received acupuncture for chronic low-back pain was 32% compared to 23% in those who received sham therapies and 6% in those who received no treatment. Furthermore, the terms used to express the strength of the evidence (strong, moderate and limited), as is standard in many systematic reviews, might be misinterpreted. These are relative terms and are often used to apply to a small number of "higher" quality studies. This may give the false impression that "strong" evidence means "definite" evidence, but this may not be the case.</P>
<P>Although efforts were made to find all published RCTs, some relevant trials might have been missed. Twenty of the 35 included RCTs were published in English, seven in Japanese, five in Chinese and one each in Norwegian, Polish and German. Although no languages were excluded, the number of non-English journals indexed in electronic databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE is limited. If additional trials are found, this review will be updated.</P>
<P>The methodologic quality of the included RCTs, although improving over the past several years, was poor. There were two studies with fatal flaws, and 14 studies with higher and 19 studies with lower methodological quality. The methodologic quality in the current review was defined by the internal validity criteria, which referred to characteristics of the study that might be related to selection, performance, attrition, and detection bias. It seems reasonable that in the authors' qualitative synthesis, the best evidence would be provided by the higher quality studies, which are less likely to have biased results. Although the levels of evidence in this review may be considered arbitrary, it seems unlikely that a different rating system would have resulted in different conclusions.</P>
<P>The included studies were very heterogeneous in terms of population included, type of acupuncture administered, control groups, outcome measures, timing of follow-up, and presentation of data. Therefore, very few meaningful meta-analyses could be performed and it was difficult to reach conclusions for most types of treatments.</P>
<P>The experience and training of the acupuncturists who gave the treatments were mentioned in a few studies. Some studies used a protocol of a fixed set of points for all patients while others used a flexible protocol where the points were selected for each individual. Both methods are considered to be valid and were analysed together in this systematic review.</P>
<P>No serious adverse events were reported in the trials included in this review. The incidence of minor adverse events was 5% in the patients submitted to acupuncture. In the literature, most of the reports of serious adverse events related to acupuncture are described as case reports. In the past years, various prospective studies were conducted, enabling the estimation of the true incidence of minor and major adverse events.</P>
<P>Melchart and colleagues reported the biggest prospective study, covering over 760,000 treatments delivered by 7,050 German physicians over a 10-month period. They observed 6,936 minor (incidence of 91 per 10,000 treatments) and five major adverse reactions (6 per 1,000,000 treatments), which included: exacerbation of depression (one case), acute hypertensive crisis (one case), vasovagal reaction (one case), asthma attack with hypertension and angina (one case) and two cases of pneumothorax (<LINK REF="REF-Melchart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melchart 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other prospective studies did not observe any major adverse reactions. Yamashita and colleagues observed 65,482 treatments delivered by 84 therapists over a six-year period in Japan. There were 94 cases of minor adverse events, with an incidence of 14 per 10,000 treatments, but this incidence was estimated using data from spontaneous reports of adverse event by the practitioner (<LINK REF="REF-Yamashita-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamashita 1999</LINK>). In another similar study by Yamashita and colleagues, they forced practitioners to detect and report every acupuncture session, whether there were adverse reactions or not. Then, different incident rates of adverse reaction were obtained. A total of 391 patients were treated in 1,441 sessions, involving a total of 30,338 needle insertions. The incidence of recorded systemic reactions in individual patients was: tiredness (8.2%); drowsiness (2.8%); aggravation of pre-existing symptoms (2.8%); itching in the punctured regions (1.0%); dizziness or vertigo (0.8%); feeling of faintness or nausea during treatment (0.8%); headache (0.5%); and chest pain (0.3%) (<LINK REF="REF-Yamashita-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamashita 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>MacPherson and colleagues observed 34,407 treatments delivered by 574 Traditional Chinese Acupuncturists in the UK, over a four-week period. There were 43 minor adverse events (incidence of 12.5 per 10,000 treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2001</LINK>). White and colleagues observed 31,822 treatments delivered by 78 acupuncturists (physicians and physiotherapists) in the UK, over a 21-month period. There were 43 minor adverse reactions (incidence of 13.5 per 10,000 treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-White-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2001</LINK>). Odsberg and colleagues observed 9,277 treatments delivered by 187 physiotherapists in Sweden over a four-week period, and recorded 2,108 minor adverse reactions (incidence of 2,272 per 10,000 treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-Odsberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Odsberg 2001</LINK>). Ernst and colleagues observed 3,535 treatments delivered by 29 acupuncturists in Germany over a 13-month period, and recorded 402 minor adverse reactions (incidence of 1,100 per 10,000 treatments) (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The great variation in incidence of minor adverse events is probably due to different definitions of adverse reaction, research designs, or styles of acupuncture in the various studies.</P>
<P>Because serious adverse events are rare, they continue to be reported in the form of case reports. Recently published systematic reviews of case reports showed that these serious complications may include infections (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, bacterial endocarditis) caused by non sterile needles, and fatal tissue trauma (pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, spinal cord injury) (<LINK REF="STD-Cherkin" TYPE="STUDY">Cherkin</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamashita-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamashita 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, we have little information about the safety of acupuncture specifically for low-back pain. We need more information about the safety of acupuncture that focuses on specific conditions.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-05-29 15:37:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There were only three heterogeneous trials of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. Therefore we could not reach convincing conclusion and there is a need for future studies to make recommendation in this area. </P>
<P>There is some evidence of the effects of acupuncture for chronic low-back pain. Compared to no treatment, there is evidence for pain relief and functional improvement for acupuncture at shorter-term follow-ups. Compared to sham therapies, there is evidence for pain relief at shorter-term follow-up, but these effects were not maintained at the longer-term follow-ups, nor were they observed for functional outcomes. Compared to other conventional or "alternative" treatments, acupuncture is no better for measures of pain and function. There is evidence that acupuncture, added to other conventional therapies, relieves pain and improves function better than conventional therapies alone. According to these results, acupuncture may be useful as either a unique therapy for chronic low-back pain or as an adjunct therapy to other conventional therapies. Although the conclusions show some positive results of acupuncture, the magnitude of the effects were generally small. </P>
<P>Although dry-needling appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain, no clear recommendations can be made because of small sample sizes and low methodological quality of the studies. </P>
<P>With respect to the different techniques of acupuncture, most studies were either small, of lower methodological quality, or both, therefore, no clear recommendation could be made. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-05-29 15:37:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because most of the studies were of poor methodological quality, there certainly is a need for future higher-quality RCTs. Also, because many trials were poorly reported, we recommend that authors use the CONSORT statement as a model for reporting RCTs (www.consort-statement.org) and use the STRICTA criteria (<LINK REF="REF-MacPherson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacPherson 2002</LINK>) to report the interventions. Many trials could not be included in the meta-analyses because of the way the authors reported the results, therefore we suggest that publications of future trials report means with standard deviations for continuous measures, or number of events and total patients analysed for dichotomous measures. Future research should focus on areas where there are few or no trials, for example, acupuncture compared to no treatment, placebo or sham for acute low-back pain. Future studies should also have larger sample sizes, use a valid acupuncture treatment, and have both a short-term and a long-term follow-up (for chronic pain). From the available high quality trials included in this review, deep stimulation seems to be the most promising acupuncture treatment. Future studies are needed that evaluate superior features of acupuncture. We suggest that publications of future trials report the proportion of subjects who obtain a clinically important improvement in the groups being compared to facilitate a judgment about clinically important differences between the groups. Although an evaluation of costs was not the objective of this review, we suggest that future research assesses cost-effectiveness of acupuncture compared to other treatments.</P>

<P>- Randomized by computer generated list. A secretarial assistant who was not involved in the study performed the assignments.<BR/>- Patients and outcome assessors were blinded.<BR/>- Funding: One author is supported by Swedish Medical Research Council.<BR/>- Setting: Pain clinic (outpatients) in Malmo General Hospital affiliated with University in Sweden.<BR/>- Informed consent: yes<BR/>- Ethics approval: yes<BR/>- Follow-up: 100% at one month, 62% at three months, and 53% at six months.<BR/>- Analysis: used "last observation carried forward" for missing values. <BR/>Baseline differences in pain (VAS) were resolved by analysing percent changes at follow-ups. However, for this analysis they used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. <BR/>There is no information about which test they used to analyse the global assessments. But, when we replicate the analysis using RevMan, we get different results from the authors if we use relative risks, but not if we use odds ratios.<BR/>For sick leave they used Wilcoxon signed ranks test.</P>

<P>1) Manual acupuncture: local points (BL24, BL25, BL26, Ex Jiaji) and distal points (LI11, LI4, BL40, BL57 and BL60). "Teh-Chi" feeling was sought in all instances, mostly at a needle-tip depth of 2 to 3 cm. The needles were stimulated three times during the 20-minute treatment sessions to restore Teh Chi feelings. The needles were disposable, stainless steel, with a diameter between 0.3 and 0.32 mm and a length between 30 and 70 mm.<BR/>Frequency: once per week for eight weeks; two further treatments were given during the follow-up assessments period of six months or longer.<BR/>Randomized to this group:16<BR/>Acupuncturist' experience: board certified anaesthesiologist with more than 10,000 acupuncture treatments.</P>
<P>2) In addition to the needles as in the manual acupuncture group, they performed electrical stimulation of four needles (one pair per side in the low back). Frequency: 2 Hz every 2.5 seconds, interrupted by a 15 Hz train for 2.5 seconds.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 18</P>
<P>3) Mock transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) given by an impressive, stationary, but disconnected GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state) stimulator attached to two large TENS electrodes. The electrodes were placed on the skin over the most intensely painful area in the low back. During stimulation, flashing lamps were displayed and visible to the patient. This group was seen once per week for 8 weeks.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 16</P>

<P>1) The treating clinician decided which form of acupuncture to use.<BR/>One of four experienced medical acupuncturists using sterile HWATO Chinese disposable acupuncture guide tube needles 50 mm long with a gauge of 0.25 mm for 20 minutes. An average number of 8 to 10 needles were placed in local tender points and in distant acupuncture points according to the "near and far" technique, depending on the condition being treated. Once patients could satisfactorily tolerate the needles for 20 minutes, low-volt electrical stimulation was applied to the needles. Six treatments were applied in a 3 to to 4-week.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 46<BR/>Drop-outs: 26 (52%). Reasons: unrelated to the outcome</P>
<P>2) Spinal manipulation was performed as judged to be safe and appropriate by the treating chiropractor for the spinal level of involvement only.

Reasons: same as in the acupuncture group</P>
<P>3) Medication: tenoxican (20 mg/d) and ranitidine (50 mg x 2/ day). Medication was given to the patients for the defined 3 to 4-week treatment period. Treatment times were standardized by arranging 15 to 20-minute appointments for all visits to eliminate a potential placebo effect originating from different lengths of exposure to the clinician<BR/>Randomized to this group: 31<BR/>Drop-outs: 10 (33%).

<P>1) The clinician determined the form of acupuncture technique. The Near and Far technique consists of: needling the trigger point and distal analgesia producing sympatholytic acupuncture points below the elbow or knee.<BR/>Acupuncture was performed by one of two experienced acupuncturists using sterile disposable acupuncture guide tube needles (length 50 mm, gauge 0.25 mm) during 20-minute appointments.<BR/>For each patient, 8 to 10 needles were placed in local paraspinal intramuscular maximum pain areas and approximately 5 needles were placed in distal acupuncture point meridians depending on the spinal pain syndrome being treated. Once patients could tolerate the needles, needle agitation was performed by turning or "flicking" the needles at approximately 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes. The needles were inserted to a length of 20 to 50 mm, in the maximum pain area, and up to approximately 5 mm in the distal points.<BR/>Two treatments per week up to the defined maximum of 9 weeks of treatment.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 36. Two were lost before treatment, 2 during treatment and 10 changed treatment because of no effect.</P>
<P>2) Spinal manipulation. 20-minute appointment. High-velocity, low-amplitude thrust spinal manipulation to a joint was performed as judged to be safe and usual treatment by the treating chiropractor for the spinal level of involvement to mobilize the spinal joints. Two treatments per week up to a maximum of 9 weeks.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 36. One was lost before treatment, 1 during treatment and 8 changed treatments because of "no effect".</P>
<P>3) A medication could be selected that had not already been tried by a patient randomised into the mediation arm of the study. The patients normally were given Celecoxib (200 to 400 mg/day) unless it had previously been tried. The next drug of choice was Rofecoxib (12.5 to 25 mg/day) followed by paracetamol (up to 4 g/day). Doses, left to the sports physician's discretion, were related particularly to the patient's weight, with the severity of symptoms playing a minor role. The treating sports physician also was allocated 20 minutes for follow-up visits.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 43.

She/he was also seen for 20 minutes, twice weekly, by the physiotherapist, ensuring the same contact with him. At each visit, symptoms were reviewed, treatment discussed and the optimum use of the TENS machine ensured.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 28. One dropped out due to acute depression.</P>

<P>The two groups appear different at baseline with respect to the four outcome measures. Patients in the acupuncture group have higher VAS and NHP pain scores, reduced spinal flexion and lower tablet consumption compared to the TENS group.</P>

<P>Conclusions: "A 4-week course of either acupuncture or TENS had demonstrable benefits on subjective measures of pain (VAS and NHP score) and allowed them to reduce their consumption of analgesic tablets. The benefits of both treatments remained significant 3 months after completion, with a trend towards further improvement in the acupuncture patients."</P>

<P>1) Same set of acupoints for everyone, regardless of the distribution of their symptoms: Bl23, Bl25, GB 30, Bl40, Ki3 (all bilateral) and GV4. Eleven needles were used in each session (Seirin acupuncture needles N8, 0.30 x 50 mm, c-type needle). The needles were inserted until Teh Chi was produced. Position: prone. Duration: 30 minutes. Needles were manually rotated to produce Teh Chi initially and at 10 to 20 minute intervals. Sessions: 6 sessions, over a 6-week period. <BR/>Patients were also given a leaflet regarding their low-back pain that included standardized advice and exercises.<BR/>A Chartered Physiotherapist trained in acupuncture carried out all treatments.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 30</P>
<P>2) Placebo-TENS: Patients were advised that the treatment was relatively novel and that they should not feel any discomfort with the procedure and, in fact, should not be aware of any sensation at all. They were advised that the treatment had an effect on the nerve-endings and that it should relieve their symptoms. Patient lying in the prone position for 30 minutes. A non-functioning TENS machine was attached to 4 electrodes placed over the lumbar spine and the unit was placed in a position to make it difficult to interfere with the apparatus. The investigator monitored the patient's condition after 10 and 20 minutes.

<P>1) All patients received standardized active physiotherapy of 26 sessions (each 30 minutes) over 12 weeks. It was performed by trained physiotherapists according to the Bruegger-concept.

In the first 2 weeks, acupuncture was done 5/week, and in the next 10 weeks, 1/week.<BR/>Combined traditional body and ear acupuncture. Twenty fixed body acupoints (9 bilateral, two single points) and six on the ear (alternately on one ear) were selected according to their function in TCM and were needled in every patient. No diagnostic procedure was done to determine individual acupoints. <BR/>Body points were manually stimulated until Teh Chi and left in place for 30 minutes: GV3, GV4, BL23, BL25, BL31, BL32, BL40, BL60, GB34, SP6, Yautungdien (extra meridian, at the back of the hand). <BR/>Ear points (left in for one week): 38, 51, 52, 54, 55, 95<BR/>Randomized to this group: 50, but only 40 initiated treatment.

<P>1) Acupuncture: Points selected by tenderness and palpable muscle bands detected on the lower back and the buttock. Four points bilaterally (8 in total) were used for each treatment. Points most frequently used were BL23 and BL26. Two types of disposable stainless steel needles were used, depending on stature and fat: 0.20 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length and 0.24 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length. Needles were inserted into the muscles. The average insertion depth was approximately 20 mm. Electrostimulation was applied to the inserted needles with an electronic stimulator with a frequency of 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Press tack needles were inserted after EA at four of the 8 chosen points and left in situ for several days, they are 1.3 mm long projecting from the sticky side of a small round adhesive dressing.<BR/>Patients were treated twice a week for 2 weeks, for 4 sessions in total.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 10. Drop-outs: 1<BR/>Experience: unknown</P>
<P>2) TENS: Gel type disposable electrodes of 20x30 mm were used for 8 points. Electro-stimulation was applied in the same manner as in the acupuncture group. The intensity was adjusted to the maximum comfortable level, and muscle contraction was observed. After each session, a poultice containing methyl salicylic acid, menthol and antihistamine was prescribed to be applied to the low-back region, at home, in-between treatments. <BR/>Patients were treated twice a week for two weeks, in total 4 sessions.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 10.

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>1) Electro-acupuncture: 3/week for 4 weeks by a physiotherapist certificated in acupuncture. Points were chosen according to the literature: BL23, BL25, BL40 and SP6. Acupuncture was applied to the side on which patients reported pain. If the reported pain was bilateral, EA was applied to the more painful side. Sterilised disposable needles, number 30 (0.3 mm) 40-mm long needles were inserted and manipulated until Teh Chi was obtained. Electrical stimulation on needles at a frequency of 2 Hz for 30 minutes. The intensity of the stimulation was set at the level that the patient could tolerate and often with evoked visible muscle contractions. The current had biphasic waveform to the four selected acupoints in two pairs. In addition, all patients also received exercise therapy, the same as in the control group.<BR/>Randomized to this group: 26. Lost to follow-up: 1</P>
<P>2) Standard group exercise program led by the same physiotherapist. <BR/>The program consisted of an hourly session each week for 4 consecutive weeks, and comprised back strengthening and stretching exercises<BR/>In addition, patients were advised on spinal anatomy and body mechanics, back care and postural correction, lifting and ergonomic advice, and behavioural modification, as well as a series of home exercises (15 min/day). <BR/>Randomized to this group: 26. Lost to follow-up: 2</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>1) Pain: Numerical rating scale for "average" and for "worst" pain intensity during the last week, by asking the patient to rate perceived level of pain on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain and 10 represents pain as bad as it could be. <BR/>2) Disability: The Aberdeen LBP scale (19-item) was used to measure low-back pain disability, because it is the only LBP-specific functional disability scale validated for Chinese subjects. Responses to the questions were summed and converted to a score percentage between 0 and 100, with 0 representing the least disabled and 100 the most severely disabled.</P>
<P>These outcomes were measured immediately after, 1 month and 3 months after. </P>
<P>Costs: not reported</P>
<P>Complications: no adverse reaction or complication.</P>

<P>Source: www.controlled-trials.com<BR/>This is a 4-arm multi-site randomised controlled trial to clarify the extent to which various types of acupuncture needling can diminish the effect of chronic low back pain on patient functioning and symptoms. Reviews have noted the poor quality of research in this area and urged that scientifically rigorous studies be conducted. Recent higher quality trials suggest acupuncture is a promising treatment for back pain. This study directly addresses methodological shortcomings that have plagued previous studies. A total of 640 subjects (160 per arm) with low back pain lasting at least 3 months will be recruited from group model HMOs in Seattle, WA and Oakland, CA. They will be randomised to one of three different methods of stimulation of acupuncture or to continue usual medical care. Ten treatments will be provided over 7 weeks. The primary outcomes, dysfunction and bothersomeness of low back pain, will be measured at baseline, and after 8, 26, and 52 weeks by telephone interviewers masked to treatment. Analysis of covariance within an intention-to-treat context will be used to analyse the data. Because chronic back pain is a major public health problem and the top reason patients seek acupuncture treatment, a clear, unambiguous assessment is critical for making informed decisions about whether acupuncture should be included as part of conventional care for back pain or covered by insurance. Results of this study will provide the clearest evidence to date about the value of acupuncture needling as a treatment for chronic low back pain.</P>

<P>Source: www.controlled-trials.com<BR/>This study compares two approaches to the management of acute low back pain: usual care (standard benefit) vs. the choice of: usual care, chiropractic, acupuncture or massage therapy (expanded benefit). 480 subjects with uncomplicated, acute low back pain will be recruited from a health maintenance organization, and randomised to either usual care (n=160) or choice of expanded benefits (n=320). Patients' preferences for individual therapies and expectations of improvement will be measured at baseline and throughout the study. Subjects randomised to the expanded benefits arm who choose chiropractic, acupuncture or massage will receive up to 10 treatments over a five-week period. Additional treatments will be available after the fifth week but will require a copayment. Treatments will be provided by licensed providers who have met strict credentialing criteria. Chiropractic, acupuncture or massage treatments will begin within 48 hours. Chiropractic, acupuncture and massage therapy scope of practice guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain have been developed as have detailed data tracking procedures to be used at each patient visit. Symptom relief, functional status, restricted activity days, use of health care, and patient and provider satisfaction will be assessed at 2, 5,12, 26 and 52 weeks after initiation of treatment. Primary outcomes will include: 1) change in symptoms; 2) change in functional status; 3) patient satisfaction; and 4) total utilization of services associated with care for low back pain. Medical records and the HMO's cost management information system will identify use of services. It is hypothesized that patients offered their choice of expanded benefits will experience a more rapid improvement in symptoms, a faster return to baseline functional status, a decrease in utilization of conventional medical services, and will be more satisfied with their care. The study is a direct examination of the effectiveness of an insurance eligibility intervention, not a test of the efficacy of specific, non-allopathic treatment regimens. The results of this study will provide valuable information to clinicians, patients and third party payers on the relative benefits and costs of an "expanded benefits" treatment option which incorporates chiropractic, acupuncture and massage services for low back</P>

<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Source: www.controlled-trials.com<BR/>Deep Intra-Muscular Stimulation is a technique that consists of needling the body of contracted or shortened muscles, and it is claimed to relieve muscle spasm more effectively than other treatments, but no randomised controlled trials have been performed, especially to compare its effects with the effects of other needling techniques such as acupuncture or trigger point needling. As the Pain Clinic is at present able to make use of the services of a highly experienced practitioner of this technique, we are planning to conduct a randomised, controlled, single-blinded trial comparing the benefits of deep Intra-Muscular stimulation with superficial needling of subcutaneous tissues in patients with chronic mechanical low back pain. We wish to asses if the needling of deep muscles specifically produces pain relief over and above that produced by needling of more superficial structures. We plan to treat two groups of 25 patients each, or a total of 50 patients, administering four treatment episodes to each patient. Patients will be asked to turn up for four treatment episodes, and to fill in two self-reporting questionnaires (SCL-90 and Pain VAS) before and at 2, 6 and 26 weeks after treatment.</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>A. Was the method of randomization adequate?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A. A random (unpredictable) assignment sequence. Examples of adequate methods are computer generated random number table and use of sealed opaque envelopes. Methods of allocation using date of birth, date of admission, hospital numbers, or alternation should not be regarded as appropriate.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>B. Was the treatment allocation concealed?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>B. Assignment generated by an independent person not responsible for determining the eligibility of the patients. This person has no information about the persons included in the trial and has no influence on the assignment sequence or on the decision about eligibility of the patient.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>C. Were the groups similar at baseline regarding the most important prognostic indicators?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>C. In order to receive a "yes," groups have to be similar at baseline regarding demographic factors, duration and severity of complaints, percentage of patients with neurologic symptoms, and value of main outcome measure(s).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>D. Was the patient blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>D. The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>E. Was the care provider blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>E. The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>F. Was the outcome assessor blinded to the intervention?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>F. The reviewer determines if enough information about the blinding is given in order to score a "yes."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>G. Were cointerventions avoided or similar?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>G. Cointerventions should either be avoided in the trial design or similar between the index and control groups.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>H. Was the compliance acceptable in all groups?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>H. The reviewer determines if the compliance to the interventions is acceptable, based on the reported intensity, duration, number and frequency of sessions for both the index intervention and control intervention(s).</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>I. Was the drop-out rate described and acceptable?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>I. The number of participants who were included in the study but did not complete the observation period or were not included in the analysis must be described and reasons given. If the percentage of withdrawals and drop-outs does not exceed 20% for immediate and short-term follow-ups, 30% for intermediate and long-term follow-ups and does not lead to substantial bias a "yes" is scored.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>J. Was the timing of the outcome assessment in all groups similar?</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>J. Timing of outcome assessment should be identical for all intervention groups and for all important outcome assessments.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P>K. Did the analysis include an intention-to-treat analysis? <BR/>
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>K. All randomized patients are reported/analyzed in the group they were allocated to by randomization for the most important moments of effect measurement (minus missing values) irrespective of noncompliance and cointerventions.</P>

<P>Feedback 1: When assessing the outcome of acupuncture therapy for the low back, what points were used? What I have observed is there is an immediate proprioceptive effect with the patients following the therapy. Where there is a mild paresis on clinical examination, what I think acupuncture does is to establish a recruitment of those muscle fibres that are paretic due to whatever cause. Possible Type II fibres are activated. Therefore, any post assessment should not necessarily just assess pain but should include proprioceptive assessments, motor function and coordinative activities.</P>
<P>Feedback 2: Which acupoints were used? What were the classical symptoms of pain being modified? My understanding is that whilst acupuncture modifies pain, in doing so the manifestations of pain are being treated. In the outcome of the study you mention function as one of those outcomes. What were the functional factors and how were they measured?<BR/>I am interested in the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants in the study, were there any controls, that is, participants without low back pain?</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Response 1: The outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of treatment, and at short, intermediate and long-term follow-ups. Definitions of these time-lines are given in the review. The outcomes of interest were patient-reported pain and function. The authors of the systematic review did not include neurological outcomes and neither did the trials. We don't know if data were collected on these items in the original studies and not included in the published reports.</P>
<P>Response 2: I think some of the details you are looking for can be found in the 'Table of Included Studies'. If they are not listed, its because they were not included in the published report of the primary study, but to be sure, you may wish to refer to some of the primary studies if you had particular questions. The full text outlines which studies were included in these comparisons: [i] Acupuncture compared to no treatment, placebo or sham therapy [ii] Acupuncture compared to another intervention [iii] Acupuncture added to an intervention compared to the intervention without acupuncture. The authors also outline other outcomes and comparisons in the results section. The inclusion criteria only included Individuals with back pain.</P>
<P>Different aspects of pain and the tool used to measure them would have been addressed in different studies ... this will be in the Table of Included Studies; ditto for functional outcomes and measurement tools and participants of each study.</P>
