<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-28 13:22:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Research question</B>
</P>
<P>What are the effects of mind and body therapy for fibromyalgia on pain, physical function, mood and side effects?</P>
<P>
<B>What problems does fibromyalgia cause?</B>
<BR/>People with fibromyalgia have chronic, widespread body pain, and often have fatigue (feeling tired), stiffness, depression and problems sleeping.</P>
<P>
<B>What are mind-body interventions?</B>
</P>
<P>Mind-body interventions include treatments such as biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies, psychological therapy and relaxation therapies. Biofeedback is when you are connected to electrical sensors that help you receive information about your body to make subtle changes in your body, such as relaxing. Mindfulness means having awareness of thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. All mind-body therapies make the link between thoughts, behaviour and feelings to help people to cope with their symptoms.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We conducted a review of the effect of mind-body therapies for adults with fibromyalgia. After searching for all relevant studies until October 2013, we found 61 studies including 4234 adults.</P>
<P>- Many studies only included female participants, but some males were included in a few studies.<BR/>- Participants had mild to severe fibromyalgia.<BR/>- Mind-body interventions were compared to 'usual care', such as medication use. Secondary analysis also compared findings in comparison to an 'attention control therapy' which involved receiving information for the same amount of time as the mind-body therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results at the end of treatment</B>
</P>
<P>- Low quality evidence revealed that psychological therapies improved physical functioning, pain, mood and side effects compared to usual care. More people withdrew from the psychological therapy group compared to usual care.</P>
<P>- There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain and mood between people receiving biofeedback and usual care but this may have happened by chance. More people withdrew from the biofeedback than the usual care group. No studies reported any side effects.</P>
<P>- There was little or no difference in physical functioning, pain, mood and the number of withdrawals between people receiving mindfulness therapy and usual care. No studies reported any adverse events.</P>
<P>- We are uncertain whether movement therapies improve physical functioning, pain, mood, side effects or the number of people who withdrew from the treatment. There were improvements in pain and mood for people receiving movement therapies but the quality of the evidence was very low. More people withdrew and two participants reported experiencing increased pain in the intervention group.</P>
<P>- We are uncertain whether relaxation therapies improve physical functioning and pain compared to usual care because the quality of evidence was very low. There was little or no difference in mood and withdrawal from treatment between people receiving relaxation therapies and those receiving usual care. No adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Best estimates of what happens at the end of treatment in people with fibromyalgia when they use mind-body therapies</B>
</P>
<P>The main findings on the use of psychological therapies are summarised below.</P>
<P>
<B>- Physical functioning after 1 to 25 weeks (higher scores mean greater limitations) </B>
</P>
<P>People who used psychological therapies rated their physical functioning as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (7.5% absolute improvement).</P>
<P>
<B>- Pain after 3 to 14 weeks (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) </B>
</P>
<P>People who used psychological therapies rated their pain as 2 points lower on a scale of 0 to 100 compared to those who received usual care (3.5% absolute improvement).</P>
<P>
<B>- Mood (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain) </B>
</P>
<P>People who used psychological therapies rated their mood as 3 points lower on a scale of 20 to 80 compared to those who received usual care (4.8% absolute improvement).</P>
<P>
<B>- Withdrawing from the treatment for any reason</B>
</P>
<P>A total of 204 out of 1000 people withdrew from psychological therapies compared with 148 out of 1000 from usual care (6% absolute improvement).</P>
<P>
<B>- Side effects</B>
</P>
<P>Nineteen people out of 1000 who received psychological therapies experienced a side effect compared with 51 out of 1000 who had usual care (4% absolute improvement). This may have happened by chance.</P>
<P>We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of mind-body therapies. Rare adverse events may include worsening of pain.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-25 04:02:36 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mind-body interventions are based on the holistic principle that mind, body and behaviour are all interconnected. Mind-body interventions incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well-being, aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment, and promote people's ability to cope. Mind-body interventions are widely used by people with fibromyalgia to help manage their symptoms and improve well-being. Examples of mind-body therapies include psychological therapies, biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation strategies.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2015-01-26 05:42:26 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To review the benefits and harms of mind-body therapies in comparison to standard care and attention placebo control groups for adults with fibromyalgia, post-intervention and at three and six month follow-up.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-25 04:05:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), AMED (EBSCO) and CINAHL (Ovid) were conducted up to 30 October 2013. Searches of reference lists were conducted and authors in the field were contacted to identify additional relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-12-08 14:26:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions for adults with fibromyalgia were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-01-25 04:10:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently selected studies, extracted the data and assessed trials for low, unclear or high risk of bias. Any discrepancy was resolved through discussion and consensus. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mean difference (MD) where the same outcome measure and scoring method was used and standardised mean difference (SMD) where different outcome measures were used. For binary data standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was used.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-27 22:08:15 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Seventy-four papers describing 61 trials were identified, with 4234 predominantly female participants. The nature of fibromyalgia varied from mild to severe across the study populations. Twenty-six studies were classified as having a low risk of bias for all domains assessed. The findings of mind-body therapies compared with usual care were prioritised.</P>
<P>There is low quality evidence that in comparison to usual care controls psychological therapies have favourable effects on physical functioning (SMD -0.4, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3, -7.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD -0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2, -3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale) and mood (SMD -0.5, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.3, -4.8% absolute change, 3 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale). There is very low quality evidence of more withdrawals in the psychological therapy group in comparison to usual care controls (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, 6% absolute risk difference). There is lack of evidence of a difference between the number of adverse events in the psychological therapy and control groups (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.50, 4% absolute risk difference).</P>
<P>There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback in comparison to usual care controls had an effect on physical functioning (SMD -0.1, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.3, -1.2% absolute change, 1 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), pain (SMD -2.6, 95% CI -91.3 to 86.1, -2.6% absolute change) and mood (SMD 0.1, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5, 1.9% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 90 scale) post-intervention. In view of the quality of evidence we cannot be certain that biofeedback has a little or no effect on these outcomes. There was very low quality evidence that biofeedback led to more withdrawals from the study (RR 4.08, 95% CI 1.43 to 11.62, 20% absolute risk difference). No adverse events were reported.</P>
<P>There was no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison to usual care for physical functioning (SMD -0.3, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.1, -4.8% absolute change, 4 point shift on a scale 0 to 100), pain (SMD -0.1, CI -0.4 to 0.3, -1.3% absolute change, less than 1 point shift on a 0 to 10 scale), mood (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.0, -3.7% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 20 to 80 scale) or withdrawals (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.72, 2% absolute risk difference) between the two groups post-intervention. However, the quality of the evidence was very low for pain and moderate for mood and number of withdrawals. No studies reported any adverse events.</P>
<P>Very low quality evidence revealed that movement therapies in comparison to usual care controls improved pain (MD -2.3, CI -4.2 to -0.4, -23% absolute change) and mood (MD -9.8, 95% CI -18.5 to -1.2, -16.4% absolute change) post-intervention. There was no advantage for physical functioning (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.2, -3.4% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 100 scale), participant withdrawals (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.38, 11% absolute difference) or adverse events (RR 4.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 93.92, 4% absolute risk difference) between the two groups, however rare adverse events may include worsening of pain.</P>
<P>Low quality evidence revealed that relaxation based therapies in comparison to usual care controls showed an advantage for physical functioning (MD -8.3, 95% CI -10.1 to -6.5, -10.4% absolute change) and pain (SMD -1.0, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.5, -3.5% absolute change, 2 point shift on a 0 to 78 scale) but not for mood (SMD -4.4, CI -14.5 to 5.6, -7.4% absolute change) post-intervention. There was no difference between the groups for number of withdrawals (RR 4.40, 95% CI 0.59 to 33.07, 31% absolute risk difference) and no adverse events were reported.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-10 10:01:58 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychological interventions therapies may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison to usual care controls but the quality of the evidence is low. Further research on the outcomes of therapies is needed to determine if positive effects identified post-intervention are sustained. The effectiveness of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies and relaxation based therapies remains unclear as the quality of the evidence was very low or low. The small number of trials and inconsistency in the use of outcome measures across the trials restricted the analysis.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-02-06 14:27:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-02-06 14:27:56 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex, chronic condition, which is characterised by widespread persistent pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment and sleep disturbances that make it difficult for people to engage in everyday activities (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1990</LINK>). Fibromyalgia has been associated with high individual and societal healthcare costs (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sicras_x002d_Mainar-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sicras-Mainar 2009</LINK>) with many patients reporting reduced physical functioning and poor quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Burckhardt-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burckhardt 1991</LINK>). The term fibromyalgia (FM) is used in this review in accordance with Cochrane convention.</P>
<P>Estimates suggest that FM affects between 2% to 5% of the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Branco-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Branco 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1995</LINK>). There is a higher prevalence in females (female:male ratio of 9 to 10:1) (<LINK REF="REF-MacFarlane-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacFarlane 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yunus-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yunus 2001</LINK>), with prevalence rising to 8% in women between 55 and 64 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-White-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 1999</LINK>). Emerging evidence suggests that the condition is linked to dysregulation of the central and sympathetic nervous systems (<LINK REF="REF-Mease-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mease 2005</LINK>) that results from neurochemical imbalances leading to both an amplification of pain signals and reduced ability to inhibit the pain response (<LINK REF="REF-Ceko-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceko 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clauw-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clauw 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>A diagnosis of fibromyalgia is usually based on the exclusion of other potential causes of symptoms and through clinical evaluation. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria stipulate that pain must be distributed across the four quadrants of the body (that is pain above the waist, below the waist, on the left and right sides of the body) and in the axial skeleton, with tenderness in 11 or more of the 18 specific sites known as tender points during digital palpation (using 4 kg pressure) or dolorimetry (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 1990</LINK>). There has been considerable debate regarding the diagnostic accuracy of FM as the ACR criteria have proven problematic, with no objective standardised test. Changes to the criteria have recently been proposed that do not require tender point examination and include a severity rating scale for fibromyalgia symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2011</LINK>). The revised criteria show potential in refining the diagnostic criteria for FM; however, as the criteria remain preliminary and further evidence of the validity, acceptance reliability and consistent implementation of the new criteria is required, this review classified FM based on the ACR criteria that have been widely implemented since 1990 (<LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolfe-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolfe 2011b</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-01-27 22:34:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Non-pharmacological interventions have received increasing attention for helping patients to manage the demands of complex conditions such as FM. Indeed, it has been revealed that people with neurological conditions use complementary therapies more than other therapeutic approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Wells-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wells 2010</LINK>). Mind-body therapies have been defined as focusing on the interactions among the brain, mind, body and behaviour. The aim of mind-body therapy is to enhance the capacity for self-knowledge, self-care and to provide tools that can improve coping, mood and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2005</LINK> <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wahbeh-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wahbeh 2008</LINK>). Mind-body interventions are considered to be a type of approach that falls under the umbrella of complimentary and alternative medicine, which also includes manipulative therapies and herbal products. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2005</LINK>) describes mind-body interventions as treatment approaches that are based on the holistic principle that mind, body and behaviour are all interconnected, incorporate strategies that are thought to improve psychological and physical well-being, and aim to allow patients to take an active role in their treatment and to promote people's ability to cope. Mind and body interventions include a range of treatments (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2012</LINK>). Examples of mind and body therapies include biofeedback (use of technology to give audio or visual feedback on physiological processes such as heart rate to assist people in being able to gain more control over their bodies); mindfulness (a way of looking at the world in a non-judgemental manner); movement therapies (use of physical movement to stimulate mental clarity, such as yoga, tai chi, qi-gong); psychological therapies (use of techniques to help people become aware of their own thoughts and behaviours, such as written emotional disclosure and cognitive behaviour therapy); and relaxation strategies (techniques to help calm the mind and relax the body, such as breathing techniques, visual imagery, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-01-27 22:35:13 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>FM is a complex condition and psychological, social and lifestyle factors have all been found to play an important role in the symptom experience (<LINK REF="REF-Bergman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bergman 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicassio-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicassio 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Theadom-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Theadom 2008</LINK>). Interventions that aim to improve well-being, self esteem, coping ability and reduce stress may therefore improve physical symptoms and quality of life for people with FM. The relevance of mind-body interventions to FM is also supported by emerging evidence of the interactions between the central nervous, endocrine, immune, and peripheral autonomic nervous systems, suggesting "a mechanism by which mind&#8211;body medicine could influence physical health" (<LINK REF="REF-Vitetta-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vitetta 2005</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-01-27 23:21:43 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Symptom-specific medication has been the primary method of treatment for FM with many patients prescribed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), simple analgesics and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which have demonstrated efficacy for reducing pain (<LINK REF="REF-Dworkin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dworkin 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hauser-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>). Medications previously used in the treatment of epilepsy such as gabapentin and pregabalin are now more widely used for FM, however many people report side effects and continue to experience symptoms despite using the medication (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>). Additionally, a recent review of guidelines on the management of FM (<LINK REF="REF-Hauser-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hauser 2010</LINK>) highlights the need for a multidimensional approach including a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies.</P>
<P>A review on psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain (excluding headache) in adults revealed that psychological therapies had weak effects in improving pain but that cognitive behaviour therapy and behaviour therapy improved low mood with some evidence of improvements being maintained at six months, in comparison to usual care and attention controls. Whilst this review included participants with FM, the impact of interventions may vary between different pain populations. Previous Cochrane reviews have explored the evidence for the use of exercise and resistance training for FM and found that supervised aerobic exercise and resistance training have beneficial effects on pain and physical functioning (<LINK REF="REF-Busch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busch 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Busch-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busch 2013</LINK>). A recent review has also found that cognitive behaviour therapy shows a small benefit in comparison to control in reducing pain, negative mood and disability in people with FM (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>There is evidence that mind-body therapies are more effective in comparison to waiting list or placebo control groups on self efficacy and quality of life outcomes for FM (<LINK REF="REF-Hadhazy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadhazy 2000</LINK>). Since the publication of Hadhazy's review in 2000, a wealth of studies have since been published in this area. The present review aims to provide evidence of the efficacy of mind-body therapies for adults with FM.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2015-02-06 14:07:20 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interventions incorporating at least one type of mind-body therapy were included. Based on the definition of mind-body interventions proposed by the Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (<LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2005</LINK>), six criteria were established to determine whether an intervention met the definition of a mind and body intervention for this review.</P>
<P>The criteria specified that the intervention must: 1) be based on the principle that the mind and body are interconnected; 2) aim to increase self knowledge; 3) aim to increase people&#8217;s ability to self-manage their health and consequences of ill-health; 4) actively engage and involve the participant in the intervention delivery; and 5) provide tools to improve coping and self-management of the condition. As mind and body interventions are often incorporated with other techniques the sixth criterion, that 6) at least 80% of the total intervention delivery must include components meeting the aforementioned five principles, was added to prevent the findings from trials including only a small mind-body component influencing the results.</P>
<P>Due to the wide diversity of available mind-body therapies, interventions were categorised into broad groups to enable comparison.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Psychological therapies (including cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), psychoanalytic and humanistic approaches).</LI>
<LI>Biofeedback (providing immediate feedback on bodily functions, such as muscle tension, to raise the patient's awareness and enable the possibility of conscious control of those functions.</LI>
<LI>Mindfulness meditation therapies (being aware of the present moment in a non-judgemental and accepting way).</LI>
<LI>Movement therapies (e.g. yoga, tai chi, qi-gong).</LI>
<LI>Relaxation based therapies (e.g. breathing techniques, visual imagery, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Interventions delivered in all settings including community, primary care or hospital were included in the review to facilitate the generalisability of the review findings. Exercise based interventions for FM have been subject to their own Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Busch-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Busch 2007</LINK>) and were therefore not included. Only movement therapies that met the definition of a mind-body therapy were included in the review. Interventions delivered to a participant manually by a therapist (such as massage, acupuncture, physiotherapy) were not included within the review as participants are not actively engaged in the treatment, a key criterion of mind-body interventions according to the <LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2005</LINK> definition of mind-body therapy.</P>
<P>Eligible comparative interventions included both usual care, which involved the treatment that people would usually receive (such as medication), or wait-list conditions or attention control interventions involving participants receiving similar levels of contact with researchers or therapists in a similar format as the experimental intervention (such as sham therapy or peer group support).</P>

<P>Three review authors (AT, AK, SM) independently assessed all citations and identified abstracts of relevance to the review against the core inclusion criteria using a pre-designed study selection form.

The results were compared between the review authors and any disagreement resolved through discussion and consensus.

<P>Three review authors (AT, AK, SM) were involved in extracting data from the included trials, with two review authors allocated to each trial to independently extract the data. Any disputes were resolved through discussion. The data were extracted using a hard copy data extraction standard form designed specifically for this review. The data extraction form recorded information on the type of intervention (such as length of programme, therapeutic components and therapist details), setting, study procedures (such as blinding of outcome assessors and treatment allocation), details of participants and outcome measure data.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-27 23:58:32 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The studies included in the review were assessed for possible risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The methods of each study were assessed independently by two review authors (AT and MC) to ascertain if the procedures applied in the study were adequate. Any disagreement identified between the review authors was resolved through discussion or through the involvement of a third review author.</P>
<P>These components of trials forming the risk of bias assessment included:</P>
<P>1) sequence generation (e.g. was the sequence generation process truly random);</P>
<P>2) concealment of treatment allocation;</P>
<P>3) blinding of the outcome assessor;</P>
<P>4) completeness of outcome data (e.g. participant attrition rates post-intervention and withdrawal rates between groups);</P>
<P>5) selective reporting bias (e.g. were all pre-specified outcomes reported).</P>
<P>Other risks of bias such as design-specific risks were not considered in this review, which only included randomised controlled trials. No studies reported early stopping. For each component the trials were classified as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear (if there was insufficient information provided in the article to make a decision). If information on the procedures used within the trial were unclear, the authors of the article were contacted to yield the necessary information. If the necessary information could not be retrieved, the potential risk was classified as unclear. To assess the direction and magnitude of the risk of bias and the possible impact this may have on the findings, sensitivity analysis was conducted. The &#8217;blinding of participants&#8217; was not applied in this review as it would be extremely difficult to blind people delivering the intervention or participants in accordance with other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012</LINK>). As mind-body interventions require the participant to actively participate in the treatment, it was considered that it was not possible to blind the participant to their treatment allocation. However, it was considered to be both feasible and desirable to randomise participants to their treatment condition, so evidence of randomisation was an important criterion for inclusion in this review. Blinding of the outcome assessors was considered as part of the risk of bias assessment of the included studies.</P>

<P>For continuous data, the weighted mean difference in endpoint scores between groups (using the same version and scoring method for outcome measure on each of the outcome domains) was calculated with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Standardised mean differences (SMD) were used for continuous outcome data measuring the same outcome variable but using different: 1) scales or subscales; 2) versions published in different languages; or 3) scored using a different approach, due to the likelihood that there would be differences in measurement between the outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Puhan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puhan 2006</LINK>). For binary data, standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% CI were used. The P &lt; 0.05 significance level and 95% CIs were used as the conventional significance level (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). All outcome data were transformed, if necessary, before analysis to ensure that high scores on each measure reflected poorer health outcomes (by subtracting the mean from the maximum score on the measure).

<P>The overall length of treatment ranged between 1 day to 25 weeks. The average treatment duration was 17 hours. Mind-body interventions were implemented in a range of settings, with over half of the studies (34 studies, 55.7%) conducted in a healthcare setting such as in a hospital or primary care clinic. Thirteen studies (21.3%) were conducted in a community setting such as in the person's home, with 7 studies (11.5%) conducted in a university or academic research centre. For 7 studies the type of setting where the intervention was delivered was not clear.</P>
<P>Most interventions (44.3%) were facilitated by a healthcare professional and 27.9% by a trained specialist in the particular therapy. Just over half (54.1%) of the studies included in this review involved only female participants. The mode of delivery of the intervention varied between trials with 54.1% of interventions delivered within a group based format, 37.7% delivered on an individual basis, and 6.6% using both a group and individual format for different elements of the intervention. For 1.6% of the interventions the mode of administration was unable to be clearly determined from the intervention description.</P>
<P>One study reported findings on multiple treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Thieme-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Thieme 2006</LINK>) which included both a cognitive behaviour therapy intervention group and an operant behavioural therapy experimental group. Given there were no other studies in the review which also looked at the effectiveness of operant behavioural therapy and because both experimental groups would be in the same analysis (psychological therapies), and only one control group was available, only the cognitive behavioural group and control group (attention placebo) were included in the analyses.</P>

<P>The primary outcome assessment time point was post-intervention (up to one month following intervention delivery). This would provide the greatest opportunity to determine if any treatment effect was evident as any effects were most likely to be at their strongest immediately following a mind-body intervention.

Due to the low number of studies that could be analysed for each outcome domain, it was not possible to complete a sensitivity analyses with and without these data, as planned. As skewed data were less likely to be problematic if the data set was large, and the study had a sample size of less than 100 participants, it was decided to exclude the data from the analyses for variables where the standard deviation was more than half the mean (but the data from the trial were included in the analyses for variables where this was not the case).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:23:21 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Moderate, low or very low quality of evidence from 61 trials (including a total of 4234 participants) was analysed. Mind-body interventions were analysed based on the type of intervention including biofeedback, movement therapies, psychological therapies, relaxation based therapies and mindfulness.</P>
<P>There was no advantage observed for biofeedback in comparison to usual care controls and no studies reported any adverse events, however the quality of the evidence was very low so we cannot be certain if there is any effect or not. There was also no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison with usual care, There was no difference in withdrawals between groups. Adverse events were not reported.</P>
<P>There was no advantage observed for mindfulness in comparison to usual care for physical functioning, pain or mood post-intervention. However the quality of the evidence was very low. There was uncertainty as to whether there were statistical differences in withdrawals between the two groups. No studies reported any adverse events.</P>
<P>There were improved outcomes for movement therapies over usual care and attention controls for physical functioning, pain and mood post-intervention. However the risk of increased pain reported by one trial suggests caution is needed in interpreting the results and we cannot be certain of any effect due to the very low quality of evidence.</P>
<P>Results for the main analyses on the use of psychological therapies in comparison to usual care controls revealed low quality evidence from 10 trials (733 participants) suggesting that psychological therapies provide a small improvement in physical functioning, pain and mood at the end of treatment. Low quality evidence revealed that improvements in physical functioning and mood were sustained at three month follow-up and at six month follow up for physical functioning. There was very low quality evidence for the secondary outcomes resulting from psychological therapies.</P>
<P>Relaxation based therapies showed an advantage over usual care for physical functioning and pain outcomes post-intervention; for pain however the quality of the evidence was very low. No differences in withdrawals or adverse events were reported for relaxation based therapies.</P>
<P>The small number of studies that provided short to medium-term (three to six month follow-up) data in this review is a concern and limited evidence was available to determine the short to medium-term impact of mind-body interventions for adults with FM.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:28:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall completeness</HEADING>
<P>In the search strategy we included efforts to identify and include unpublished data to reduce the possible impact of publication bias. Whilst some unpublished data have been included in the review, we cannot rule out the possibility that negative study results may not have been published or identified for inclusion by this review. </P>
<P>The applicability of the evidence included in this review is considered to be strong for a number of reasons. Firstly, the review includes a number of mind-body interventions delivered across a range of contexts including hospital settings, primary care centres and in the community. Secondly, many samples included both male as well as female adults with FM, which is important as although FM predominantly affects women it can affect men; however, due to the low numbers no study performed a subgroup analysis for male participants. Thirdly, many trials included participants with additional co-morbidities (not serious or life-threatening), such as depression, which commonly occur in adults with FM.</P>
<P>Due to the diversity of symptoms experienced by people with FM, this review analysed the evidence on a wide range of outcomes including the major outcomes of self-reported physical functioning, pain, withdrawals and adverse events, and minor outcomes such as fatigue and self efficacy. Outcomes such as walk time, self confidence, use of medication and healthcare visits may be important but we were not able to incorporate them within the scope of this review as there is a limit to the number of outcomes that can reliably be studied within the context of a Cochrane review.</P>
<P>This review aimed to quantitatively summarise the effects of mind-body interventions for FM. Whilst this review was targeted at one specific population (adults with FM), the findings may have relevance to other populations where complex symptomology presents. Within the context of current practice, many chronic pain programmes already implement components of mind-body therapies, such as the use of guided imagery. Mind-body interventions that require specialist expertise to deliver, such as tai chi or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), may be more challenging to incorporate into practice without additional resources.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:31:50 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence presented in this review was extracted from trials published in academic journals and was requested from the trial authors. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate, low or very low (see summary of findings tables). Trial quality was reduced by unclear details or high risk of allocation concealment, non-blinding of outcome assessors or risk of bias from selective reporting; however, sensitivity analyses revealed that the findings were not influenced by the removal of studies with a high risk of bias from the analyses. The sample size of the included trials was often small and even in the meta-analyses participant numbers were as low as N = 19, increasing to N = 733. Few studies reported information on any adverse events arising from the interventions. It is important to record any instances where there is a decrease in health or well-being, such as increased levels of pain or fatigue, that may have been exacerbated by the intervention.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:35:16 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite efforts to reduce the impact of publication bias in the review, the possibility remains that some studies (with positive or negative findings) may not have been identified by the search. Where further clarification of study methodology could not be obtained from the authors, there is the possibility that the risk of bias for the studies may have been overestimated. Whilst contacting authors for additional information assisted in the accuracy of the information reported in most cases, this may have introduced a 'response bias' into the risk of bias assessment. Some values needed to be imputed for missing data (such as variability estimates when the lower confidence interval was used) using the Revman calculator. Data were unable to be extracted accurately for several trials that presented their findings graphically, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings. The small number of trials included in some analyses further reduces the robustness of these findings.</P>
<P>In many cases determining the assessment time point was difficult, as it was not always clear if the timeframe was post-randomisation or intervention delivery and the window within which assessments were completed was rarely documented.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:47:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One previous systematic review of mind-body therapies for adults with FM was found (<LINK REF="REF-Hadhazy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadhazy 2000</LINK>). The review included 13 trials of 802 participants and searched the literature until 1999. The findings of the review support the findings of this current review suggesting that there is some limited evidence of the effectiveness of mind-body therapies in comparison to placebo or attention control for self-reported pain and physical functioning.</P>
<P>Reviews examining different types of mind-body interventions include a Cochrane review of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for adults and children with FM, conducted until August 2013 (<LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2013</LINK>). The results from this current review were more negative than for the review conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2013</LINK>, which revealed small effects for pain, mood and disability that were sustained at follow-up. By including CBTs in comparisons of treatment effect with other psychological therapies may have obscured unique effects of different types of interventions. The inclusion of children in the other review may also have increased the observed treatment effect.</P>
<P>Another systematic review explored the effectiveness of qi-gong interventions for adults and children with FM (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2012</LINK>). The review completed a search of studies until February 2011 and revealed that it was too early to draw conclusions as to the efficacy of qi-gong and that further robust RCTs were warranted. The current review supports these findings that there is currently insufficient evidence on movement therapies to draw any firm conclusions.</P>
<P>The authors of a Cochrane review on psychological therapies for chronic pain (excluding headache) searched the literature until September 2011 (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2012</LINK>). This review revealed that people receiving psychological therapies experienced small improvements in functioning, pain and mood when compared to usual care but not when compared to attention control participants. These findings are comparable to the findings in the current review.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews in this field have been published outside of <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. Findings revealed some inconsistencies which may be due to differences in the inclusion criteria set and outcomes domains explored. In a review of mindfulness based relaxation studies for FM (<LINK REF="REF-Lauche-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauche 2013</LINK>) the authors revealed that mindfulness group participants showed reductions in pain and improved quality of life post-intervention in comparison to controls. In contrast, this review found no difference between the experimental and control groups on any of the major outcomes including pain and quality of life. This disparity in the findings may reflect the inclusion of non-randomised trials in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Lauche-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauche 2013</LINK>. A review of guided imagery for FM that was conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2011</LINK> revealed similar findings to the relaxation analysis conducted as part of this Cochrane review, where both studies included in the relaxation analysis used a guided imagery intervention. Both reviews revealed that participants receiving guided imagery showed reductions in pain but not quality of life post-intervention. This Cochrane review also identified that participants receiving biofeedback demonstrated improved physical functioning post-intervention compared to controls. In a review of biofeedback for people with FM conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Glombiewski-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glombiewski 2013</LINK>, it was revealed that participants receiving biofeedback reported reductions in pain post-intervention in comparison to controls. This Cochrane review was unable to detect a difference between participants receiving biofeedback and controls. This may be due to the inclusion of trials using additional interventions such as cognitive strategies or exercise. In contrast, for inclusion in this review biofeedback needed to be the primary focus of the intervention (constituting at least 80% of the intervention) to ensure any effects detected were due to the biofeedback rather than inclusion of other treatments. A consistent finding between these three reviews published outside of Cochrane and the current review is that the quality of the available evidence in this area is poor.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:51:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Mind-body interventions are becoming increasingly incorporated into treatment programmes for fibromyalgia (FM). The findings of this review indicate that psychological therapies may improve physical functioning, pain and mood following treatment but highlight that the quality of evidence is low. The observed effects were not sustained at six months follow-up. There was wide variation in intervention mode of delivery and there were an insufficient number of trials to enable calculation of the effect of different modes of delivery on outcomes. Psychological therapies were delivered over a period of between one and 25 weeks (mean 11 weeks), with greater effects observed with longer duration. There was low reporting on the presence or absence of adverse events, however equivalent rates of dropout between the treatment and control groups indicate that the risks to people receiving psychological interventions are low.</P>
<P>There is insufficient evidence to determine the use of biofeedback, mindfulness, movement therapies or relaxation based therapies for adults with FM.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-01-28 08:58:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Evidence</HEADING>
<P>The evidence for outcomes in this review was limited by the low or very low quality of the trials identified. To enable recommendations on the use of mind-body therapies for adults with fibromyalgia to be determined, robust randomised controlled trials are needed. Following the findings of this review, trials should take into account the need to accurately report on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment processes and to clearly report data including measures of variance for all outcomes at all time points assessed. There is no need for further low quality trials (trials with high risk of bias) in this area.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Population</HEADING>
<P>As fibromyalgia predominantly affects females, many studies only included female participants in order to reduce heterogeneity, however this limits the applicability of the findings for males with fibromyalgia. Subgroup analyses could help explore the impact of gender on treatment effect and future studies should consider inclusion of male and female participants. This study only presents data for adults over 18 years and future reviews are needed to review the evidence of mind-body therapies for children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>There was wide heterogeneity in the interventions delivered within the groups specified, this was particularly evident within the sensitivity analyses of the data. For example, psychological therapies encompassed written therapies, educational based approaches as well as specific therapeutic techniques such as the Resseguier approach. There was also variability in the mode of intervention delivery with therapies being self-administered or delivered by a therapists on an individual basis or within a group. Future reviews would benefit from having a narrower focus to ensure that the effective elements of the specific components of mind-body therapies can be identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Comparison</HEADING>
<P>Trials used a combination of usual care and attention control groups for comparison. Greater differences between groups were observed when the intervention was compared to usual care, suggesting that therapeutic attention or a placebo effect may have been observed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>It was often difficult to determine why participants withdrew from the included trials and at which time point. Higher numbers of withdrawals from the intervention group can indicate difficulties with the feasibility of the intervention or mode of delivery and should be reported; although this was not found to be the case for studies in our analyses where this information could be determined. CONSORT diagrams outlining reasons for withdrawal between groups over time are a useful way of presenting this information for future studies.</P>
<P>Few studies described any adverse events experienced by participants and this information is critical for ensuring the safety and feasibility of interventions in clinical practice, and should be reported. Declarations that no adverse events were experienced, if this was the case, would also facilitate interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>A wide range of outcomes and outcome measures were reported between trials. As recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Choy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Bernardy-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernardy 2013</LINK>, a core set of outcome measures that should be assessed and reported across clinical trials needs to be established by consensus to facilitate pooling of trial data and the comparison of study findings. As recommended by <LINK REF="REF-Choy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Choy 2009</LINK>, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire should be considered to be the primary outcome measures for all fibromyalgia randomised controlled trials, with secondary outcomes of self-reported pain, fatigue and sleep.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Time</HEADING>
<P>This review presents data identified up to October 2013, and further updates will be required as new evidence emerges. More trials with follow-up at three and six months are needed to determine if the effects of mind-body interventions are sustained.</P>

<P>Why would you discriminate between standard care and attention control as comparators, ie separate out sham therapy since this halves the number of eligible studies, to just a few in many cases?<BR/>Why is Toussaint awaiting assessment - it appears it should be ruled out due to dropouts ?<BR/>I'd also expect Ide &amp; Tanaka et al to appear as a movement therapy (Effect of aquatic respiratory exercise-based program in patients with fibromyalgia, APLAR '08)<BR/>

<P>Many thanks for your contribution. External feedback helps to improve review, and we appreciate your continuous attention to our reviews.<BR/>
<BR/>&#8220;Why would you discriminate between standard care and attention control as comparators, ie separate out sham therapy since this halves the number of eligible studies, to just a few in many cases?&#8221;<BR/>We usually separate the two, as one is a no treatment control group (usual care), and attention control is more akin to a sham-intervention, thus the comparators are heterogeneous. Attention control is considered more rigorous than no treatment, and at least allows the possibility of blinding the participant, and thus allows for a lower risk of both performance bias and detection bias for self-reported subjective outcomes.<BR/>
<BR/>&#8220;Why is Toussaint awaiting assessment - it appears it should be ruled out due to dropouts?&#8221;<BR/>Awaiting assessment is used when the author team have not yet been able to determine eligibility for the review. It is a useful interim service for the reader because it indicates that there are possibly studies that might influence the results of the review. In this case, Toussaint 2012 (as well as Thorsell 2011 and Wang 2012) are awaiting assessment as it was not possible to ascertain if the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was done according to the ACR criteria (one of the inclusion criteria). This information is available on the table of studies awaiting assessment. We do not exclude studies on the basis of numbers of dropouts.<BR/>
<BR/>&#8220;I'd also expect Ide &amp; Tanaka et al to appear as a movement therapy (Effect of aquatic respiratory exercise-based program in patients with fibromyalgia, APLAR '08)&#8221;<BR/>We assume that you refer to IDE, M. R., LAURINDO, I. M. M., RODRIGUES-JNIOR, A. L. and TANAKA, C. (2008), Effect of aquatic respiratory exercise-based program in patients with fibromyalgia. International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 11: 131&#8211;140. doi: 10.1111/j.1756-185X.2008.00348.x<BR/>The inclusion criteria of the reviews specifies that the intervention needs to follow the following principles:<BR/>1) be based on the principle that the mind and body are interconnected; 2) aim to increase self knowledge; 3) aim to increase people&#8217;s ability to self-manage their health and consequences of ill-health; 4) actively engage and involve the participant in the intervention delivery; and 5) provide tools to improve coping and self-management of the condition, 6) at least 80% of the total intervention delivery must include components meeting the aforementioned five principles.<BR/>
<BR/>This study did not seem to fit with any of the pre-specified inclusion criteria.Although the study mentions yoga as the rationale for the inclusion of the breathing techniques, it does not reflect on the principle that mind and body are interconnected.<BR/>

<P>The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Overview Statement on mind-body medicine that "mind-body medicine focuses on interactions among the brain, mind, body and behavior, and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social and spiritual and behavioral factors can directly affect health. It regards as fundamental an approach that respects and enhances each person's capacity for self-knowledge and self-care, and it emphasizes techniques that are grounded in this approach. Mind-body medicine typically focuses on intervention strategies that are thought to promote health, such as relaxation, yoga, biofeedback, tai chi, qi gong and cognitive behavioral therapies. <LINK REF="REF-NCCAM-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCCAM 2005</LINK> page 1.</P>
