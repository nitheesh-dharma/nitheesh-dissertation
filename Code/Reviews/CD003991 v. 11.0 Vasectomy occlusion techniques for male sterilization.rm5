<TITLE>Vasectomy methods for birth control in men</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-03-03 20:17:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vasectomy is a surgical method used in men to cut or tie the vas deferens. The vas is a tube that delivers sperm from the testicles. The purpose of vasectomy is to provide permanent birth control. Vasectomy methods include different ways to close the vas. Variations to a vasectomy may be irrigation (flushing fluid through the vas) and fascial interposition (placing a layer of body tissue between the cut ends of the vas). Ideally, the choice of vasectomy method should be based on the best evidence from controlled trials. This review looked at how well the vasectomy methods work, how safe they were, the costs, and whether the men liked the method.</P>
<P>In February 2014, we updated the computer searches for studies of vasectomy methods. For the initial review, we also looked at reference lists of articles and book chapters. We included randomized controlled trials in any language.</P>
<P>We found six studies. One trial compared closing the vas with clips versus the usual cutting of the vas. The groups did not differ in reaching a low sperm count or in side effects. Three trials looked at flushing fluids through the vas: two compared vasectomy with water flushing versus vasectomy alone, and one compared using water versus euflavine (which kills sperm). None found a difference between the groups in time to low sperm count. However, one trial found that the usual number of ejaculations before low sperm count was lower with euflavine than with water. One trial that compared vasectomy with and without fascial interposition was a high-quality large study. The fascial interposition group was less likely to have vasectomy failure. However, the surgery was more difficult. Side effects were about the same in the two groups. Lastly, one trial looked at a device placed into the vas versus vasectomy without a scalpel. The intra-vas device did not work as well for reaching a low sperm count but more men liked the method.</P>
<P>Most of the studies that looked at vasectomy methods were small, not done well, or had poor reports. Therefore, we cannot say if the methods work well, are safe or are liked by men. Vasectomy with fascial interposition worked better than simply cutting and tying the vas, but the surgery was more difficult. More and better research is needed on vasectomy methods.</P>

<P>Vasectomy is an increasingly popular and effective family planning method. A variety of vasectomy techniques are used worldwide, including vas occlusion techniques (excision and ligation, thermal or electrocautery, and mechanical and chemical occlusion methods), as well as vasectomy with vas irrigation or with fascial interposition.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-03-03 20:17:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In February 2014, we updated the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, POPLINE and LILACS. We looked for recent clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Previous searches also included EMBASE. For the initial review, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and book chapters.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2011-10-17 18:59:14 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We included RCTs comparing vasectomy techniques, which could include suture ligature, surgical clips, thermal or electrocautery, chemical occlusion, vas plugs, vas excision, open-ended vas, fascial interposition, or vas irrigation.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-10-13 17:21:55 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>We assessed all titles and abstracts located in the literature searches. Two reviewers independently extracted data from articles identified for inclusion. Outcome measures include contraceptive efficacy, safety, discontinuation, and acceptability. Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used for dichotomous outcomes, such as azoospermia. The mean difference (MD) was used for the continuous variable of operating time.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-10-17 17:57:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Six studies met the inclusion criteria. One trial compared vas occlusion with clips versus a conventional vasectomy technique. No difference was found in failure to reach azoospermia (no sperm detected). Three trials examined vasectomy with vas irrigation. Two studies looked at irrigation with water versus no irrigation, while one examined irrigation with water versus the spermicide euflavine. None found a difference between the groups for time to azoospermia. However, one trial reported that the median number of ejaculations to azoospermia was lower in the euflavine group compared to the water irrigation group. One high-quality trial compared vasectomy with fascial interposition versus vasectomy without fascial interposition. The fascial interposition group was less likely to have vasectomy failure. Fascial interposition had more surgical difficulties, but the groups were similar in side effects. Lastly, one trial found that an intra-vas was less likely to produce azoospermia than was no-scalpel vasectomy. More men were satisfied with the intra-vas device, however.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-03-05 20:58:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>For vas occlusion with clips or vasectomy with vas irrigation, no conclusions can be made as those studies were of low quality and underpowered. Fascial interposition reduced vasectomy failure. An intra-vas device was less effective in reducing sperm count than was no-scalpel vasectomy. RCTs examining other vasectomy techniques were not available. More and better quality research is needed to examine vasectomy techniques.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-10-17 19:10:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Vasectomy is a popular, highly effective, and relatively low-cost permanent family planning method (<LINK REF="REF-PIP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIP 1992</LINK>). From the health payer perspective, vasectomy is one of the three least expensive methods of contraception in the US (<LINK REF="REF-Trussell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trussell 2009</LINK>). The proportion of vasectomies that fail (defined as lack of azoospermia on semen analysis or presence of pregnancy) is generally considered to be between zero and 2%, with most studies reporting a failure rate of less than 1% (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2008</LINK>). The three main causes of failure are operative failure, unprotected intercourse before the semen is cleared of sperm, and spontaneous early or late recanalization of the vas. Failure rates are generally lower when vasectomy is performed by more experienced surgeons (<LINK REF="REF-Schwingl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingl 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Complications following vasectomy are relatively uncommon with fewer than 3% of cases requiring medical attention (<LINK REF="REF-PIP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIP 1992</LINK>). Most common complications are hematoma, bleeding, infection, acute and chronic pain, and congestive epididymitis (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>). Despite concern over the long-term health risks associated with vasectomy, such as an increased risk of prostate cancer, long-term adverse consequences have not been established (<LINK REF="REF-Bernal_x002d_Delgado-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernal-Delgado 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cox-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cox 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Page-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2008</LINK>).</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-10-17 19:10:40 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>A range of techniques to occlude the vas deferens, including excision and ligation, surgical clips, thermal or electrocautery, and chemical occlusion, have been developed in an attempt to reduce complications and failure rates of the vasectomy procedure. Although the method employed varies considerably between providers and regions, excision and ligation remains the most common method of vasectomy worldwide. The occlusion techniques usually involve excision of a short length of the vas to reduce the chances of two ends of the vas rejoining (recanalization). Fascial interposition, in which one end of the vas is covered by either the sheath tissues of the vas itself or with adjacent connective tissue, is also widely used in conjunction with occlusion techniques to reduce the risk of recanalization. A controversial and less widespread practice involves leaving the testicular end of the vas unsealed to allow sperm to flow out of the vas in order to minimize pressure on and damage to the epididymis (<LINK REF="REF-Errey-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Errey 1986</LINK>). Finally, some surgeons have proposed irrigation of the distal vas deferens with sterile water or a spermicidal solution at the time of vasectomy to hasten the clearance of lingering sperm (<LINK REF="STD-Gandrup-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gandrup 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two main methods are used to approach the vas for vasectomy: the traditional incisional method and the no-scalpel technique (<LINK REF="REF-Li-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Li 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-PIP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">PIP 1992</LINK>). These methods can be combined with any of the vas occlusion techniques already mentioned, and are the subject of a review titled 'Scalpel versus no-scalpel incision for vasectomy' (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2007</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-03-10 16:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Information concerning the relative effectiveness, safety, acceptability, and costs of these different vasectomy techniques is vital for decision making by both health service providers and clients. However, the majority of studies to date are retrospective case series conducted by a single surgeon. These studies are problematic as they may underestimate failure rates for a number of reasons, including lower failure rates observed in experienced surgeons, high rates for losses to follow up, short-term follow up, rates calculated using all men (rather than those who return for follow up) as the denominator, and suspected underreporting of pregnancy by couples. In addition, comparisons between studies are difficult due to variability in the surgical techniques and follow-up protocols used as well as different definitions of failure (<LINK REF="REF-Schwingl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingl 2000</LINK>). In addition, most studies do not describe the semen analysis methods they used. Ideally, the choice of vasectomy techniques should be based on the best available evidence from randomized controlled trials.</P>

<P>Before examining the identified trials for possible inclusion, we developed and field tested a data collection form, as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook 4.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2003</LINK>); similar methods can now be found in <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>. Two reviewers independently collected the data on the extraction forms. We extracted the data under unblinded conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Berlin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berlin 1997</LINK>). In addition to the outcomes measures, we systematically extracted data on the following variables: lost to follow-up rates, type and location of health care setting (e.g., mobile or static unit and time available for the operation), surgeon experience level, age of the men, total number of men included and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. When necessary we contacted the authors of the trials to seek additional information. Correct entry of the data was verified by one other reviewer.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1977</LINK> compared vas occlusion with two tantalum clips (no transection of the vas) versus vasectomy (transection of the vas with both ends of the vas ligated and looped back). Initially, one clip was used in the vas occlusion arm, but because leakage was noted on a vasogram, the intervention was changed to two clips being applied to each vas. This change in the intervention occurred at an unspecified point during the study. The primary outcome measure was failure to achieve azoospermia. Semen was examined at one, two and three months after vasectomy. A participant was defined as free of sperm if one specimen revealed azoospermia. The methods used for semen analysis were not described. Follow up was reported to continue for one year after vasectomy, but the nature of this follow up was not reported. Other outcome measures were adverse events and consumer acceptability. Participants in this study received antibiotics as a prophylactic measure.

<LINK REF="STD-Berthelsen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berthelsen 1975</LINK> compared vasectomy (vas excision with both ends tied combined with fascial interposition) with irrigation of the distal vas with sterile water versus vasectomy without irrigation. In the vas irrigation group a plastic cannula was inserted in the distal vas before resection of the vas and irrigated with 40 ml of sterile water. The primary outcome measure was number of ejaculations to azoospermia, which was defined as two consecutive specimens free of sperm. Participants were requested to send in every fourth ejaculate until two consecutive samples were free of sperm. The preparation was stained with a Papanicolau stain and viewed under 40x magnification. If no spermatozoa were seen under 50 fields of vision, the sample was classified as free of sperm. Other outcome measures were time to azoospermia, adverse events and procedure time.</LI>

In the vas irrigation group, a blunt cannula was inserted in the distal vas after resection of the vas and irrigated with 10 ml of sterile water. The primary outcome measure was time to azoospermia defined by two consecutive semen specimens. Participants provided semen for analysis at 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively and thereafter every 4 weeks, until two consecutive specimens were free of sperm. Specimens were returned by mail, centrifuged and stained with a Papanicolau stain. Fresh semen analyses were requested if there was suspicion of recanalization, but the basis for suspicion was not described.

In both groups, a blunt injection needle was inserted in the distal vas and irrigated before resection. The primary outcome measure was time to azoospermia. Every two weeks, beginning one week post-operatively, the participants mailed smears from semen samples after having performed a vital staining of the spermatozoa. Under 1000x magnification, 200 fields of vision were viewed. Completely stained spermatozoa were considered to be infertile, while partially stained or unstained spermatozoa were regarded as potentially fertile. When two consecutive samples showed azoospermia, the men were declared sterile and ceased to submit specimens. Other outcome measures were number of ejaculations until azoospermia, adverse events, and incidence of recanalization.</LI>

Surgeons involved in the study were all experienced in performing vasectomies. The results of the interim analysis were partially reported earlier in Chen-Mok 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK>). We contacted the authors to obtain supplemental information. The primary outcome measure was time to azoospermia (two consecutive semen specimens that were free of sperm and at least two weeks apart). Two weeks after surgery, each participant underwent a physical examination. Follow-up visits, during which semen was collected and analyzed by technicians blinded to technique group, were scheduled every 4 weeks through week 34 or until vasectomy success. Semen analysis was performed according to the Semen Analysis Guidelines, which are based on <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>. Other outcome measures were time to azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (defined as 1 to &lt; 100,000 sperm / ml semen) in two consecutive specimens at least two weeks apart and vasectomy failure based on semen analysis. Early vasectomy failure was defined as more than five million motile sperm per ml at 14 weeks or later. Late failure was more than 100,000 sperm / mL with any motility.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Song-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2006</LINK> compared an intra-vas device versus no-scalpel vasectomy. The shell of the intra-vas device (IVD) was mainly urethane, and it was filled with medical grade nylon thread. The IVD measured 1 mm in outer diameter, 0.6 mm in inner diameter, and 17 mm in length. The IVD was inserted into the vasal lumen via a small incision. Two grooves near the head and tail were intended to fix the device within the vas and to prevent sperm transport between the device and the vas wall. Contraceptive success was defined as azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (&lt; 3 million / mL) without motile sperm. Operating time was assessed. Follow up involved visits at the 3rd and 12th months postoperatively. Participant satisfaction was assessed by questionnaire at the 12th-month follow up.</P>

<P>Overall, the description of study methods was poor. Only <LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK> reported the methods of generating the allocation sequence and of concealing the allocation sequence.

However, only <LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK> clearly described whether participants and outcome assessors were blinded and <LINK REF="STD-Song-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2006</LINK> stated that it was open. Most did not report information to judge the adequacy of the blinding methods (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>). Many trials did not report details concerning number and reasons for exclusions after randomization and loss to follow up for each group. More information was obtained on the interim analysis for fascial interposition study (Chen-Mok 2003 of <LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK>) by contacting the authors.

Loss to follow up rates greater than 20 percent may threaten the validity of trials (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>). The a priori hypothesis stated that irrigation should reduce the number of postoperative ejaculations before azoospermia by 10 in order for the procedure to have any clinical value.

<LINK REF="STD-Berthelsen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berthelsen 1975</LINK> enrolled 59 participants: 29 in the water irrigation group and 30 in the no irrigation group. A large number of exclusions (36%) followed randomization: one exclusion following randomization in each group, as the participant had a general anesthetic rather than local; 8 participants in the water irrigation group and 11 in the no irrigation group because they did not follow the instructions. Medians and interquartile ranges were reported, so no data were available for analysis with RevMan. For the primary outcome, the number of ejaculations to azoospermia, participants were paired chronologically by the time of operation, and the differences between the numbers of ejaculation were compared. This type of analysis seems incompatible with a randomized study and calls into question the methods employed. The median number of days to azoospermia was 53 (interquartile range 36.5 to 90) for the water irrigation group compared 65.5 (interquartile range 55 to 96.5) for the no irrigation group. The incidence of recanalization was zero in both groups. Adverse events were reported to have included secretion around the skin sutures, pain, bleeding, and bruising. No difference was reported in frequency of complications between the two groups, but no details of these were reported. Operation time was 10 minutes longer in the water irrigation group.</P>

This left 163 of the 200 included in the analysis: 76 in water irrigation group and 87 in no irrigation group. The groups did not differ in the proportions that reached azoospermia at 16 weeks or in those with lingering sperm at 40 weeks. The groups were similar in the mean number of days to azoospermia: 28.6 (range 11.7 to 85.5) for the water irrigation group and 26.4 (range 12.5 to 79.7) for the no irrigation group. No variance data were reported so the means could not be analyzed in this review. Six of the water irrigation group and seven of the no irrigation group did not achieve azoospermia with a mean time from vasectomy of 595 and 535 days, respectively. No adverse events were reported.

<LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK> enrolled 841 men with 419 assigned to fascial interposition and 422 to no fascial interposition. The plan was to recruit 1200 participants, but enrollment was halted after the first 400 men had completed at least 10 weeks of follow up. The interim analysis indicated a difference by age group, as discussed in the earlier report of Chen-Mok 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK>). Follow up continued for the planned 34 weeks for those men already enrolled in the study. Using Cox's proportional hazards regression, the authors reported the hazard ratio (HR) of successful vasectomy was greater for the fascial interposition group than the no fascial interposition group (controlling for participant age and surgeon experience). For azoospermia, the HR was 1.35, and for severe oligozoospermia the HR was 1.32 (P &lt; 0.001 reported for both). For men less than 30 years, the fascial interposition group was reportedly much more likely to achieve azoospermia (HR 2.3) (P &lt; 0.001 from paper). Vasectomy success did not differ between the two groups, but vasectomy failure was less likely at 34 weeks in the fascial interposition group (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70). Results were indeterminate for some men. The groups did not differ in the reported adverse events at six weeks (sperm granuloma, epididymitis or orchitis, scrotal pain or swelling, hematomas, or infection). For the men with vasectomy success, no difference was noted in scrotal pain within 3 months of the 12-month follow up. These reports were for mild or moderate pain; none reported severe pain. <LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK> reported the surgery took 2 to 3 minutes longer for the fascial interposition than for non-fascial interposition; mean times were 14.3 minutes and 11.7 minutes, respectively. In 14% of 419 cases, the fascial interposition posed some difficulty for the surgeons, but in only 2% of cases were the surgeons unable to perform the fascial interposition on one or both vas.</P>

For pain, the reporting was not clear: for the intra-vas group, 17 had pain after surgery while 10 reportedly had pain by the 12th-month follow up (only 4 were lost to follow up). Consequently, the meaning of the OR for the later pain assessment is not clear (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96) although it appears to favor the intra-vas group. Time for the surgical procedure was longer for the intra-vas group than for the no-scalpel group (WMD 4.90; 95% CI 0.59 to 9.21).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-03-10 16:37:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>Few controlled clinical trials examining vasectomy techniques have been conducted. Of the trials conducted, the interventions examined were vas irrigation, vas occlusion with clips, fascial interposition, and an intra-vas device. No trials were identified that examined thermal or electrocautery, chemical occlusions, or open-ended vas.</P>
<P>Vas occlusion with clips is not a widespread vasectomy technique (<LINK REF="REF-Schwingl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingl 2000</LINK>). Enhancing the potential for reversal is the main rationale for the use of this technique (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwingl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingl 2000</LINK>). The trials that compared vas occlusion with clips versus a conventional vasectomy technique did not find a difference between the two groups with regard to the primary outcome of failure to reach azoospermia (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1977</LINK>). Adverse events were similar for the two groups by 12 months as was dissatisfaction with the procedure. The risk of bias is high since the study was of poor quality (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002a</LINK>), and it was also small and therefore underpowered. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 1977</LINK> changed the intervention partway through the study. Consequently, determining whether vas occlusion with clips is a more effective method than conventional vasectomy is not possible.</P>
<P>Similarly, vas irrigation is not widely used with vasectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Schwingl-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwingl 2000</LINK>). Hastening the clearance of sperm from the vas deferens and reducing time to azoospermia is the rationale for this technique. None of the three trials that examined vas irrigation found a difference between the groups in the primary outcome of time to azoospermia. <LINK REF="STD-Gandrup-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gandrup 1981</LINK>, though, reported that the median number of ejaculations to azoospermia was lower in the euflavine group compared to the water irrigation group. Adverse events were uncommon and similar in both arms (<LINK REF="STD-Berthelsen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berthelsen 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gandrup-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Gandrup 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Berthelsen-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Berthelsen 1975</LINK> found that the operating time was 10 minutes longer in the irrigation group. As with the vas occlusion studies, these trials were all of poor quality. In addition to this, the studies were relatively small and therefore underpowered. Therefore, it is unknown whether vas irrigation hastens the onset of azoospermia.</P>
<P>Regarding vas irrigation, some experts believe that the presence of motile sperm in semen after four to six weeks is more likely to be the result of transient early recanalization rather than residual sperm in the distal vas (D Sokal, personal communication). Thus, the success of vas irrigation based on azoospermia would be difficult to assess without an attempt to assess whether early recanalization had occurred. The occurrence of transient early recanalization appears to be relatively common with some methods of vas occlusion and would complicate the assessment of vas irrigation.</P>
<P>Fascial interposition is an increasingly widespread vasectomy technique and is used to separate the ends of the vas to reduce the chances of recanalization. One trial that compared vasectomy with fascial interposition versus vasectomy without fascial interposition was a high quality, large study with a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK>). The trial was halted early due to the results of the interim analysis as reported earlier in Chen-Mok 2003 (<LINK REF="STD-Sokal-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sokal 2004</LINK>). The fascial interposition group was more likely to have vasectomy success. Adverse events did not differ between the groups. Yet fascial interposition was also associated with more surgical difficulties. Fascial interposition likely improves the effectiveness of vasectomy.</P>
<P>An intra-vas device was less likely to achieve azoospermia than the no-scalpel method (<LINK REF="STD-Song-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2006</LINK>). However, the intra-vas device was also associated with fewer adverse events.</P>
<P>None of the trials could be combined due to differences in the types of interventions. Variability in the nature of vasectomy interventions between trials is to be expected, as there is potential for variation not only in the techniques, but also in the comparison of types of techniques.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-10-17 18:22:10 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Laureen M Lopez">
<P>The methods of determining the primary outcomes differed between studies (e.g., the timing and duration of follow up and the methods of semen analysis) or were inadequately described. Methods for semen analysis have been largely standardized (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>), but the need remains for standardization of follow-up protocols, evaluation of success and failure, recanalization and statistical analysis.</P>
<P>The quality and adequacy of reporting was low for many trials, making the risk of bias high (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Three trials were conducted over two decades ago when trial methods were often described inadequately and were of poorer quality. However, despite the introduction of the CONSORT guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>), <LINK REF="STD-Mason-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Mason 2002</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Song-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Song 2006</LINK> reported the study methods inadequately. The CONSORT guidelines have since been updated (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, most studies did not have all of the relevant outcomes, such as operating time and acceptability measures. None of the trials conducted cost analysis.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Fascial interposition appears to improve effectiveness. High quality trials regarding other vasectomy techniques are unavailable. Practitioners should bear in mind that greater experience in a vasectomy technique is associated with higher rates of vasectomy success. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>High quality, adequately reported randomized controlled trials are required to compare the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of all vasectomy techniques. In addition, work is needed in the standardization of follow-up protocols, evaluation of vasectomy success and failure, recanalization and statistical analysis. </P>

<P>841 men in an outpatient setting in eight centers (Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico (2) Nepal, Panama, Sri Lanka, and the US). The inclusion criteria were to satisfy local clinic's criteria for vasectomy and to be willing to provide prevasectomy semen sample as well as semen samples during the planned follow up.
