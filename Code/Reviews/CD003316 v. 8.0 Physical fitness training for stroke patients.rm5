<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence that examines whether physical fitness training is beneficial for a range of health and function outcomes in people with stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Physical fitness is important to allow people to carry out everyday activities such as walking and climbing stairs. Physical fitness varies among everyone. For example, fitness in men tends to be a little higher than in women and everyone's fitness becomes reduced as we get older and if we become less physically active. Physical fitness is often particularly low in stroke survivors. It may limit their ability to perform everyday activities and also worsen any stroke-related disability. For this reason fitness training has been proposed as a beneficial approach for people with stroke. However, taking part in fitness training could have a range of other benefits important to people with stroke such as improving cognitive function (thinking skills), improving mood, and quality of life, and it could reduce the chance of having another stroke.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>By February 2015 we identified 58 trials for inclusion in the review. The trials involved at total of 2797 participants at all stages of care including being in hospital or back living at home. Most of the people who took part were able to walk on their own. The trials tested different forms of fitness training; these included 1) cardiorespiratory or 'endurance' training, 2) resistance or 'strength' training, or 3) mixed training, which is a combination of cardiorespiratory plus resistance training.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found that cardiorespiratory fitness training, particularly involving walking, can improve exercise ability and walking after stroke. Mixed training improves walking ability and improves balance. However, there was not enough information to draw reliable conclusions about the impact of fitness training on other areas such as quality of life, mood, or cognitive function. Cognitive function is under-investigated despite being a key outcome of interest for stroke survivors. There was no evidence that any of the different types of fitness training caused injuries or other health problems; exercise appears to be a safe intervention. We need more studies to examine the benefits that are important to stroke survivors, in particular for those with more severe stroke who are unable to walk.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Studies of fitness training can be difficult to carry out. This means most of the studies were small and of moderate quality. However, some consistent findings did emerge with different studies all tending to show the same effect.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-07-08 10:27:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Levels of physical fitness are low after stroke. It is unknown whether improving physical fitness after stroke reduces disability.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, dependence, and disability and to assess the effects of training with regard to adverse events, risk factors, physical fitness, mobility, physical function, quality of life, mood, and cognitive function. Interventions to improve cognitive function have attracted increased attention after being identified as the highest rated research priority for life after stroke. Therefore we have added this class of outcomes to this updated review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:38:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched February 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 1: searched February 2015), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2015), EMBASE (1980 to February 2015), CINAHL (1982 to February 2015), SPORTDiscus (1949 to February 2015), and five additional databases (February 2015). We also searched ongoing trials registers, handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-13 17:05:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised trials comparing either cardiorespiratory training or resistance training, or both (mixed training), with usual care, no intervention, or a non-exercise intervention in stroke survivors.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:38:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed data using random-effects meta-analyses. Diverse outcome measures limited the intended analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-03-14 12:01:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 58 trials, involving 2797 participants, which comprised cardiorespiratory interventions (28 trials, 1408 participants), resistance interventions (13 trials, 432 participants), and mixed training interventions (17 trials, 957 participants). Thirteen deaths occurred before the end of the intervention and a further nine before the end of follow-up. No dependence data were reported. Diverse outcome measures restricted pooling of data. Global indices of disability show moderate improvement after cardiorespiratory training (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.84; P value = 0.002) and by a small amount after mixed training (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.49; P value = 0.02); benefits at follow-up (i.e. after training had stopped) were unclear. There were too few data to assess the effects of resistance training.</P>
<P>Cardiorespiratory training involving walking improved maximum walking speed (mean difference (MD) 6.71 metres per minute, 95% CI 2.73 to 10.69), preferred gait speed (MD 4.28 metres per minute, 95% CI 1.71 to 6.84), and walking capacity (MD 30.29 metres in six minutes, 95% CI 16.19 to 44.39) at the end of the intervention. Mixed training, involving walking, increased preferred walking speed (MD 4.54 metres per minute, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.14), and walking capacity (MD 41.60 metres per six minutes, 95% CI 25.25 to 57.95). Balance scores improved slightly after mixed training (SMD 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.47). Some mobility benefits also persisted at the end of follow-up. The variability, quality of the included trials, and lack of data prevents conclusions about other outcomes and limits generalisability of the observed results.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-02-25 13:42:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Cardiorespiratory training and, to a lesser extent, mixed training reduce disability during or after usual stroke care; this could be mediated by improved mobility and balance. There is sufficient evidence to incorporate cardiorespiratory and mixed training, involving walking, within post-stroke rehabilitation programmes to improve the speed and tolerance of walking; some improvement in balance could also occur. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of resistance training. The effects of training on death and dependence after stroke are still unclear but these outcomes are rarely observed in physical fitness training trials. Cognitive function is under-investigated despite being a key outcome of interest for patients. Further well-designed randomised trials are needed to determine the optimal exercise prescription and identify long-term benefits.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:13:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Physical activity and exercise recommendations exist for a wide range of healthy, older, and patient populations (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Donovan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Donovan 2010</LINK>), including those with specific health problems such as stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Billinger-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billinger 2014</LINK>). Although exercise and physical activity are promoted positively the evidence is still incomplete.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is physical fitness training?</HEADING>
<P>Exercise refers to a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and deliberately performed to train (improve) one or more components of physical fitness (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2008</LINK>). Since the term 'exercise' is used more generically within stroke care we will refer to exercise as 'physical fitness training'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">What is physical fitness?</HEADING>
<P>Physical fitness describes a set of physiological attributes that a person has or achieves, which confers the ability to perform physical activities without undue fatigue. Activities can range from day-to-day tasks to leisure activities (<LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2008</LINK>). The most important components of physical fitness are those responsible for muscular work, as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Cardiorespiratory fitness is the ability to transport and use oxygen and is usually expressed as maximal oxygen uptake (VO<SUB>2</SUB> max). Cardiorespiratory fitness confers 'endurance', that is the ability to perform physical activity for an extended period.</LI>
<LI>Muscle strength refers to the ability of a specific muscle or muscle group to exert force. Strength is associated with the ability to perform forceful movements such as pushing or lifting.</LI>
<LI>Muscle power refers to the rate at which muscular work can be performed during a single explosive contraction. Power is associated with the ability to carry out forceful movements, in particular those that are dynamic.</LI>
</OL>
<P>In addition, other components of fitness can influence the ability to perform physical activities, including flexibility (range of motion about a specific joint), balance (ability to maintain stability and posture), and body composition (for example relative amounts of fat and fat-free mass).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Determinants of fitness</HEADING>
<P>Physical fitness is lower in women compared with men and it deteriorates due to increasing age (1% to 4% in one year) (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>), physical inactivity (12% to 14% in 10 days) (<LINK REF="REF-Kortebein-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kortebein 2008</LINK>), and other secondary consequences of chronic disease such as inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Degens-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Degens 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Functional importance of fitness</HEADING>
<P>When the level of fitness is low (regardless of the reason) physical activities may either become limited by fatigue or impossible to perform (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>). Levels of fitness below a threshold needed to perform instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) may mean loss of independence, for example cardiorespiratory fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Shephard-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shephard 2009</LINK>) and muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Hasegawa-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hasegawa 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-06 09:02:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A common neurological consequence of stroke is unilateral loss or limitation of muscle function; the direct consequence can be limitation or loss of movement, mobility, and functional ability. In addition, a whole range of indirect complications occur after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Indredavik-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Indredavik 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2000</LINK>). Low levels of physical activity are therefore common soon after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Bernhardt-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhardt 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bernhardt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernhardt 2007</LINK>). In community-dwelling stroke patients cardiorespiratory fitness ranges from 26% to 87% of the value expected in age and gender-matched healthy people (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2012</LINK>). Muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Gerrits-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gerrits 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horstman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horstman 2008</LINK>) and muscle power (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2008</LINK>) are also impaired with bilateral deficits, which suggest the influence of physical inactivity. The level of post-stoke fitness may be low due to a range of factors directly and indirectly connected to stroke.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Pre-stroke fitness levels may already be low since physical inactivity (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2002</LINK>) and low levels of fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Kurl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurl 2003</LINK>) are both risk factors for stroke. In addition, most stroke patients are elderly (more than 70 years of age) so levels of fitness will be low due to the effects of age (<LINK REF="REF-Malbut-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malbut 2002</LINK>) and the presence of comorbid diseases.</LI>
<LI>Direct neurological effects of stroke reduce the muscle mass available for activation (e.g. hemiparesis).</LI>
<LI>Post-stroke physical inactivity (for whatever reason) will cause a longitudinal loss of fitness alongside the effects of comorbid diseases and increasing age. Limitation or loss of functional abilities after stroke (e.g. walking, stair climbing, chair rising) are associated with low cardiorespiratory fitness levels, muscle strength, and muscle power (<LINK REF="REF-Flansbjer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flansbjer 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2008</LINK>).</LI>

<P>Therefore, inactivity, which commonly occurs after stroke, may result in low levels of physical fitness; this may exacerbate or cause some common post-stroke physical limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2013a</LINK>). Restoration of motor function in order to improve functional ability is a key focus within stroke rehabilitation and a number of interventions have been investigated that involve physical activities and physical fitness training (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2009</LINK>).  </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Although the design of physical fitness training interventions varies across healthy people, older people, and patient groups, the structure and content remains guided by a common set of well-established principles (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2011</LINK>).  </P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of training</HEADING>
<P>Most physical fitness training programmes are classified as either: 1) cardiorespiratory training (to improve cardiorespiratory fitness), 2) resistance training (to improve muscular strength and muscle power), or 3) mixed training, which combines cardiorespiratory and resistance training. With regard to other aspects of fitness, all types of training programme have the potential to influence body composition (increase lean mass and reduce adiposity) and some may also incorporate elements that improve flexibility (stretching exercises) and balance.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mode of training</HEADING>
<P>The type of fitness training influences the mode(s) of exercise. For example, cardiorespiratory training commonly employs walking and cycling, whilst resistance training employs activities involving muscle contractions resisted by weights, body mass, or elastic devices.  </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose of training</HEADING>
<P>The dose of training is controlled by influencing: 1) the amount of training (for example programme length (weeks, months), frequency (days/week), and duration (minutes) of sessions), and 2) the intensity of training (amount of work or effort).  </P>
<P>It is the manipulation of type, mode, and dose that defines an exercise prescription; however, the effectiveness is also influenced by some other critically important principles of training (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2011</LINK>), including progression of training, whether training is task-related (specific), and the fact that training effects are reversible if training is reduced or stopped.  </P>
<P>Physical fitness training is, therefore, very much a complex intervention with numerous component parts and this can give rise to variation in plausible benefits. <BR/>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-02-25 14:19:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Regular physical activity is currently recommended where possible to people of all ages, including those with disabilities, in order to promote and maintain health (<LINK REF="REF-Haskell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haskell 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USDHHS-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">USDHHS 2008</LINK>). The dose-response relationship means additional benefits exist if physical fitness training is employed, in particular with regard to physical function. Physical fitness training interventions improve physical function in healthy elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Chodzko_x002d_Zajko-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chodzko-Zajko 2009</LINK>). </P>
<P>Post-stroke physical activity and fitness levels are low, and these low levels are associated with common post-stroke functional limitations. Increased fitness and physical function could benefit a range of other common post-stroke problems, for example by reducing fatigue, reducing the incidence of falls and fractures, compensating for the increased energetic cost of a hemiparetic gait, reducing disability and improving independence, and improving quality of life and mood.</P>
<P>Physical therapies are known to promote structural brain remodelling (<LINK REF="REF-Gauthier-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gauthier 2008</LINK>) and this can influence post-stroke motor deficits. There is systematic review evidence that repetitive practice of some common day-to-day activities produces some modest improvements in mobility and ADL in stroke patients (<LINK REF="REF-French-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">French 2008</LINK>). Therefore, participation in repetitive, task-related fitness training may have functional benefits even if fitness is not improved.</P>
<P>Engagement with group training activities may have some psychosocial benefits in people with stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Carin_x002d_Levy-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carin-Levy 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mead-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2009</LINK>). Therefore, simply participating in physical fitness training may be beneficial, particularly where group activities are involved.</P>
<P>Cognitive function impairments are common after stroke and are predicted by low indices of physical fitness (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2014</LINK>). In older adults (&gt; 65 years) with cognitive impairment exercise interventions have been shown to improve cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Heyn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyn 2004</LINK>). Therefore, there is some rationale that fitness training interventions could benefit cognition in people with stroke.</P>
<P>Physical fitness training is known to be beneficial for people with a number of conditions that are comorbid conditions or risk factors for stroke. Systematic review evidence shows that exercise interventions can reduce blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 2013</LINK>), improve vascular risk factors in obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Shaw-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shaw 2006</LINK>) and type II diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2006</LINK>), reduce mortality in people with coronary heart disease (CHD) (<LINK REF="REF-Heran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2011</LINK>), and improve depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with depression (<LINK REF="REF-Rimer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rimer 2012</LINK>). Therefore, post-stroke cardiorespiratory training, in particular, could reduce morbidity and mortality through secondary prevention of stroke and comorbid disease.  </P>
<P>In summary, physical fitness training does not simply provide a mechanism to increase fitness, it has multiple mechanisms of action and has a spectrum of plausible benefits that are relevant to many people with stroke. However, there may also be risks, such as training-induced soft tissue injuries, altered muscle tone, falls, and vascular events. </P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Physical fitness training for stroke survivors remains under-investigated in two key areas.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly, the range of possible benefits is not fully explored. The top 10 most important research priorities for 'life after stroke' have recently been defined by a partnership of patients, carers, and clinicians (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>); exercise interventions may have a beneficial role in at least five of the top 10 research priorities (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2014a</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Secondly, although enough evidence is available to implement fitness training for stroke, the optimal exercise prescription has yet to be defined (<LINK REF="REF-Mead-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mead 2011</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>There has been sustained interest in physical fitness interventions for stroke evidenced by the trials included in previous updates of this review: <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2004a</LINK> (12 trials), <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2009</LINK> (24 trials), <LINK REF="REF-Brazzelli-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazzelli 2011</LINK> (32 trials), and <LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2013</LINK> (45 trials). The previous version of this Cochrane Review was the sixth most accessed Cochrane review (3276 full-text accesses during 2014) about stroke as a whole (source: <I>The Cochrane Library</I> Impact Factor and Usage Report, 2014). Considering the degree of incomplete knowledge, the high level of interest, and the clinical relevance of this review for improving patient care, we believe it is essential to continue updating this review.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, dependence, and disability. The secondary aims were to determine the effects of training on adverse events, risk factors, physical fitness, mobility, physical function, health status and quality of life, mood, and cognitive function.</P>
<P>Interventions to improve cognitive function have attracted increased attention after being identified as the highest-rated research priority for life after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>). Therefore, we have added this class of outcomes to this updated review.</P>

<P>All trials described as randomised controlled trials (RCTs), single-blinded or open, which examined the effects of cardiorespiratory, resistance, or mixed training using any of the following six comparisons.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cardiorespiratory training versus control: 1) at the end of intervention, 2) at the end of follow-up.</LI>
<LI>Resistance training versus control: 3) at the end of intervention, 4) at the end of follow-up.</LI>
<LI>Mixed training (cardiorespiratory plus resistance training) versus control: 5) at the end of intervention, 6) at the end of follow-up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this review 'end of intervention' refers to the time point when a training programme finishes; 'end of follow-up' refers to any time point occurring after the end of the intervention. Measures at the end of follow-up allow us to examine whether training effects (if any) are retained after training is completed. For trials with multiple follow-up phases we analysed data from the longest follow-up period.</P>
<P>We included studies in which controls were exposed to either physical activity occurring during usual care or no training after usual care. By 'no training' we meant either no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (for example cognitive tasks or sham training). Therefore, we deemed the following comparisons suitable for inclusion where 'usual care' refers to inpatient hospital care or other standard rehabilitation given to all stroke patients delivered as a normal part of stroke care in the region in which the trials were performed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>training plus usual care versus usual care (during usual care);</LI>
<LI>training versus no training (after usual care).</LI>
</UL>
<P>We included only full-text reports of published and unpublished trials. We did not include conference proceedings alone (that is abstract and poster presentations) because usually they provide only limited data and do not allow full assessment of study quality. We did not exclude trials on the basis of their sample size. We included studies published in languages other than English only when a translation could be arranged. Where investigators published several reports based on data from a single study population, we selected the most recent or most complete report for data extraction and we listed the other reports as duplicate publications.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:03:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We assessed the following interventions.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cardiorespiratory training</HEADING>
<P>The aim of this type of training is to improve the cardiorespiratory component of physical fitness. It is typically performed for extended periods of time on devices or ergometers (for example treadmill, cycling, rowing) or by utilising modes of activity such as walking or climbing stairs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Resistance training</HEADING>
<P>This type of training is performed primarily to improve muscle strength and muscular endurance or muscle power output, or both. It is typically carried out by making repeated muscle contractions resisted by body weight, elastic devices, masses, free weights or specialised machine weights, and isokinetic devices.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Mixed training</HEADING>
<P>This describes training interventions that comprise different activity components, some intended to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and others to improve strength, power or muscular endurance; for example, a training programme comprising both cycling and weight training.</P>
<P>We only included trials that aimed at training stroke survivors. We defined 'training' as a systematic, progressive increase in the intensity or resistance, frequency, or duration of the physical activity throughout a scheduled programme. We categorised the 'dose' of the cardiorespiratory or resistance training components of a training programme as falling within or below the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria for developing and maintaining fitness (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>). Although a more recent update of this is available (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 2011</LINK>), the recommendations are more difficult to apply as criteria; therefore for consistency with previous versions of this review we have retained the <LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK> criteria in this update. This decision makes no difference to whether studies are included or not. We sought measures of adherence to training since this can modify the dose of training received by trial participants. For the purposes of this review, adherence included both: 1) attendance at training sessions, and 2) compliance with exercise instructions during training sessions.</P>
<P>We excluded trials that focused on different types of standard rehabilitation techniques but did not include a physical fitness component. We also excluded trials that combined fitness training with assistive technologies, such as robotic and electromechanical-assisted gait training devices during body weight-supported locomotor training, as well as trials investigating virtual reality approaches.</P>
<P>We excluded studies that compared upper and lower body training if an additional non-exercise control group was not considered.</P>
<P>If any description of a training regimen was unclear, we contacted the authors for further information.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:04:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We anticipated that existing trials in the literature would use different measures to assess outcomes relevant to this review; in particular they would use a variety of rating scales.

We presented relevant outcomes for the main comparisons of interest in 'Summary of findings' tables.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Continuous and dichotomous data</HEADING>
<P>The data required for meta-analyses of continuous data in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> were mean and standard deviation (SD). When collecting continuous data we took some precautions to check whether standard error (SE) was mistakenly reported as SD. We used SE or 95% confidence interval (CI) to compute SD when missing. The included studies presented results for continuous data either as mean and SD of final measurement values or as mean and SD of change from baseline for each intervention group, or both. We extracted final measurement values or change from baseline scores instead of final measurement values if required. In our analyses we combined final measurement values with any change from baselines scores using the mean difference (MD) method as we assumed that MDs based on changes from baseline scores addressed the same underlying treatment effects as MDs based on final measurements.</P>
<P>The data required for meta-analyses of dichotomous data in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK> were number of events in each intervention group and total number of participants in each intervention group.</P>
<P>In the case of missing outcome data, we attempted to analyse data according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. When individual patient data were available we used the 'last observation carried forward' (LOCF) approach (that is the most recently reported outcome was assumed to hold for all subsequent outcome assessments).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of effect</HEADING>
<P>For continuous data we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs if the studies used the same instrument to measure the same outcome (for example disability). However, if studies used a variety of instruments (for example rating scales), we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI.</P>
<P>For dichotomous data we calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs.</P>
<P>We assessed statistical homogeneity between trial results by means of the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test for heterogeneity, which is included in the forest plots in RevMan 5. The Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test has notoriously low power in meta-analyses when studies have small sample size, or when the number of events is small, therefore we decided: 1) to set the significance level at 0.10 rather than at the conventional level of 0.05, and 2) to analyse data using a random-effects model (a fixed-effect model would have given the same quantitative conclusions but with narrower CIs).</P>
<P>To quantify inconsistency across studies we used the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic, which is included in the meta-analysis graphs in <LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>.</P>
<P>Where possible, we investigated publication bias by entering data from studies included in the relevant meta-analyses in funnel plots (treatment effect versus trial size).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Comparisons</HEADING>
<P>Training interventions were compared with control interventions in different ways in the included studies. We identified seven different types of comparison, which has implications for establishing the effects of fitness training.</P>
<P>
<I>Balanced comparisons</I> - The nature of some of these comparisons allows intervention and control groups to be comparable in terms of exposure time (both groups are exposed to an intervention, the frequency and duration of which is similar between groups) and the 'attention' received by the therapists. Therefore, these comparisons allow one to separate the specific effects of fitness training from those of usual rehabilitation interventions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Training plus a proportion of usual care versus usual care.</LI>
<LI>Training plus usual care versus non-exercise intervention plus usual care.</LI>
<LI>Training versus non-exercise intervention - after usual care.</LI>
<LI>Training versus usual outpatient care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Confounded comparisons </I>- Other comparisons make it impossible to have a comparable intervention and control group exposure time (for example the 'training versus no intervention' comparison). We will describe these comparisons in the review as 'confounded by additional training time'. With regard to interventions involving physical exercise, a greater exposure to the intervention has a known effect on rehabilitation outcomes ('augmented therapy time') (<LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2004</LINK>). Therefore, although these comparisons allow comment on the overall effect of training programmes, they make it difficult to attribute any benefits to the content of the exercise prescription itself.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Outcome measures were recorded at the end of the training period (end of intervention), or at any other defined point either within the trial duration or after completion of the training programme, or both (scheduled end of follow-up).</P>
<P>A variety of outcome measures were used in the included studies; some trials shared the same outcome measures. This limited the opportunity to combine outcome measures in the meta-analyses.</P>
<P>Some outcome measures involved continuous data (for example assessment scales) with skewed distributions. Due to time and resource constraints we did not attempt to transform these data. We therefore combined continuous skewed data and continuous normal-distributed data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Randomisation</HEADING>
<P>We assessed less than half (24/58, 41%) of the included studies as having a low risk of selection bias. All studies did identify that randomisation had occurred but many did not describe the actual mechanism of how this was achieved. Therefore, uncertainties remain among a number of trials. Most trials of fitness training are small; therefore, the use of techniques to balance participant numbers (e.g. block randomisation) and participant characteristics (e.g. stratification or minimisation based on age, gender, or outcomes of interest recorded at baseline) is quite common.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>Mechanisms of allocation concealment were poorly reported; we considered nine of the included trials low risk of bias (15%). There are instances when centralised assignment mechanisms are used where allocation concealment is automatic (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Mead-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mead 2007</LINK>), in which case the risk of bias is rated as low. In other trials where allocation concealment mechanisms are needed envelopes were frequently used. Numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2010a" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2010a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2009</LINK>) are appropriate. However, 14/19 (74%) of trials reporting the use of 'sealed envelopes' did not specify whether they were sequentially numbered or opaque therefore we were unable to exclude potential selection bias with certainty.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participant blinding</HEADING>
<P>Participants cannot be blinded to physical interventions like fitness training; therefore, we judged no trials to be at low risk of bias. However, some trials utilised an attention control where the trialists attempted to blind participants to the 'true nature' of the comparison. In three trials, the participants were informed that they would receive one of two different, potentially beneficial interventions (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MacKay_x002d_Lyons-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay-Lyons 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mead-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mead 2007</LINK>), without being given information on the types of interventions. Similarly, in another trial participants allocated to the experimental group were advised that they were to be offered extra therapy but were not told which type of therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Donaldson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Donaldson 2009</LINK>). In these 4/58 (7%) instances we reported the judgement as 'unclear' risk of bias; the remaining 54/58 trials (93%) trials were all at 'high' risk of bias.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigator blinding</HEADING>
<P>We considered the outcome assessment to be at low risk of detection bias in 25/58 (43%) of the included trials.

Another possible explanation could be that five of the seven trials included in these analyses were confounded by increased training time (amount of contact with therapists in the experimental groups was greater than in the control groups) (<LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Galvin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Galvin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Letombe-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Letombe 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-de-Port-2012" TYPE="STUDY">van de Port 2012</LINK>).

<P>Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed in nine trials (425 participants) using measures of peak VO<SUB>2 </SUB>(ml/kg/minute) at the end of the intervention. Most of the studies took place after usual care and there was a consistent pattern of improvement in measures of peak VO<SUB>2</SUB> showing that cardiorespiratory fitness increased significantly in the training groups (MD 2.86 ml/kg/minute, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.96; P value = 0.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>). Doses of training varied between four weeks and six months among the trials. Heterogeneity arose from a single study with a small effect (<LINK REF="STD-Lennon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lennon 2008</LINK>); exclusion of these data resulted in no heterogeneity and a stronger effect (MD 3.48 ml/kg/minute, 95% CI 3.05 to 3.92; P value = 0.00001).</P>
<P>A single study suggests that training-induced benefit to peak VO<SUB>2</SUB> remained after a 12-month follow-up (MD 2.90 ml/kg/minute, 95% CI 0.56 to 5.24; P value = 0.02) (<LINK REF="STD-MacKay_x002d_Lyons-2013" TYPE="STUDY">MacKay-Lyons 2013</LINK>).

<LINK REF="STD-Ouellette-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ouellette 2004</LINK> examined strength bilaterally in the lower limb extensors and unilaterally in the knee extensors and the ankle flexors (plantar and dorsi).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:08:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The included trials encompassed a variety of outcome measures. This has been a typical drawback of stroke rehabilitation trials for some time (<LINK REF="REF-Greener-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greener 2002</LINK>), and continues to be a problem when summarising and analysing data in a systematic review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of training on primary outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Case fatality</HEADING>
<P>Death, from any cause, was not a common event among the participants of the trials included in this review. Only 13 out of the total 2797 participants died before the end of the intervention period and nine out of 1256 died before the end of follow-up.</P>
<P>Where deaths did occur there may be a tendency toward these being more common among the control groups than among the intervention groups of mixed training trials. However, there are still too few data to draw any conclusions about the effect of fitness training on case fatality.</P>
<P>The observed numbers of deaths in this review may be low because the included participants were at lower risk of death compared with the wider stroke population. This may occur firstly because the inclusion criteria of the trials of exercise select participants with milder strokes (most were ambulatory) and reduced risk factors (such as blood pressure ceiling criteria). Secondly, there may be self selection by participants who are physically active with increased fitness. Higher physical activity is known to be associated with reduced risk of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wendel_x002d_Vos-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wendel-Vos 2004</LINK>), and higher VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak is associated with reduced risk of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Kurl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurl 2003</LINK>) and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2002</LINK>). In addition, the majority of the training programmes in this review were of short duration (12 weeks or less). A Cochrane Review of the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation showed reduced mortality in people with coronary heart disease in the longer term (12 months follow-up and more; <LINK REF="REF-Heran-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heran 2011</LINK>); the training programmes tended to be much longer than those in this review. Since many stroke patients have coexisting heart disease, training might influence post-stroke mortality provided it comprises cardiorespiratory training delivered over long periods of time. This requires investigation.</P>
<P>Although higher physical activity and higher cardiorespiratory fitness are linked to the primary prevention of stroke, there is a lack of data on the role of fitness training interventions in the secondary prevention of stroke. This gap in knowledge is currently a research priority and requires investigation (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Death or dependence</HEADING>
<P>There were no data available to allow us to draw conclusions about the influence of training on the composite outcome of death or dependence after stroke. Death is infrequent and measures of dependency such as those based on simple questions, a Barthel Index score of less than 20, or a modified Rankin Scale score of 3, 4, or 5, are lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Lindley-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindley 1994</LINK>). Both elements of this composite outcome are likely to be rare in stroke survivors who are eligible for physical fitness training.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Disability</HEADING>
<P>We assessed a number of different global indices of disability. Data using the same scales were limited and this restricted the meta-analyses, and a number of methodological issues weakened and biased the available data.</P>
<P>After cardiorespiratory training there was no improvement in Functional Independence Instrument scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), Barthel Index scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), or other individually reported outcomes. However, there was an improvement in Rivermead Mobility Index scores (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Pooling all available disability scale data from different scales showed a small beneficial effect (SMD; <LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). This pattern of findings could occur because training influences the physical/mobility items of these various scales; such items dominate the scoring in tools like the Rivermead Mobility Index (eight out of 15 items) whereas they are less influential in more 'global' tools like the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (two out of 18 items). Since walking is a common mode of cardiorespiratory exercise these findings could be precipitated by improvements in walking and mobility rather than more 'global' effects on disability.</P>
<P>In trials of mixed training various disability measurement instruments were used. Among these the only significant improvements were in Rivermead Mobility Index scores, both at the end of training (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>) and retained after a period of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-006.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.5</LINK>). Pooling all available data from different scales shows a hint of benefit at the end of intervention (<LINK REF="CMP-005.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.9</LINK>). Like cardiorespiratory training these significant effects could be driven principally by changes in mobility. The study designs of several of the mixed training trials were confounded by additional training time; when these were excluded the benefits vanish. This means that participation in mixed training appeared effective but it is impossible to attribute any benefits to the actual content of the mixed training programmes.</P>
<P>The effects of cardiorespiratory training and mixed training at the end of intervention are similar in magnitude (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). Overall, the findings show that interventions containing cardiorespiratory training, either alone or combined with resistance training, improve global measures of disability after stroke.</P>
<P>There are too few data to allow for any comment on the effect of resistance training.</P>
<P>Lack of benefits among many of the disability tools may arise from a lack of sensitivity due to the recruitment of people typically presenting with milder strokes. There was evidence of ceiling effects in the Barthel Index data from two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 1998</LINK>). Similarly, the Functional Independence Instrument, which was assessed in some of the included studies, is known to be prone to ceiling effects, particularly in community-living patients (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1996</LINK>). Thirdly, a lack of effect on disability measures despite functional benefits has been reported in trials of exercise for healthy elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Keysor-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keysor 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is worth pointing out that a lack of an immediate effect does not necessarily preclude longer-term benefits. Increased fitness may provide some 'reserve capacity' to cope with the deterioration of function that will occur with increasing age and thus postpone crossing 'thresholds of independence' (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>). Therefore, indicators of pre-clinical disability (<LINK REF="REF-Fried-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 1996</LINK>), coupled with long-term follow-up, may be a more useful approach for assessing outcomes in trials of fitness training after stroke.</P>
<P>Overall, the benefits after cardiorespiratory and mixed training detected using scale-based measures of disability may be driven by improvements in mobility rather than being indicative of a change in more 'global' disability status. This would agree with the findings among the secondary outcomes (mobility).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of training on secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>There was no evidence of any serious adverse events arising from training in people who participated in physical fitness training programmes. However, this finding cannot be generalisable to the wider stroke population as only a few trials specifically recorded or reported adverse events. There is a clear need to improve the reporting of adverse events in physical fitness training trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Vascular risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Few trials reported vascular risk factors. There was no effect on blood pressure but there was an increase in peak VO<SUB>2</SUB>. As well as indicating poor cardiorespiratory fitness, low values of peak VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak are associated with an increased risk of stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Kurl-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurl 2003</LINK>) and stroke mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2002</LINK>). Limited data meant that no conclusions could be drawn. Blood pressure is still rarely reported among trials of fitness training and yet it could be an important, plausible benefit.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physical fitness</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cardiorespiratory fitness</HEADING>
<P>Cardiorespiratory training, and to a smaller degree mixed training, significantly improved VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak and exercise tolerance during continuous exercise. This improvement may be beneficial because a low VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak is associated with functional limitation in elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>). In people with stroke the functional benefits are, however, less clear (see for example the contradictory data by <LINK REF="REF-Patterson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patterson 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Michael-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Michael 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Gait economy may improve in response to training that contains walking activity. A limited 'fitness reserve' caused by a low VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak coupled with poor walking economy is a common post-stroke problem (<LINK REF="REF-Macko-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macko 2001</LINK>). Therefore, training to improve walking economy and increase the peak may be beneficial for walking performance and exercise tolerance after stroke. Only few, inconsistent data were available for the assessment of gait economy. Data from one individual trial suggested that mixed training may improve gait economy at the end of the training period even though this training effect appeared to disappear at follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Mead-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mead 2007</LINK>). On the whole, the data were insufficient to draw reliable conclusions on the effect of training on gait economy as well as on the post-training retention of cardiorespiratory fitness.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Musculoskeletal fitness</HEADING>
<P>The few trials that assessed whether resistance training or mixed training improved muscle strength after stroke show inconsistent results. Most of the trials that showed positive training effects were either methodologically biased or confounded by additional training time.</P>
<P>One individual trial measured explosive lower limb extensor power but showed no immediate or retained effect of mixed training (<LINK REF="STD-Mead-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mead 2007</LINK>). Non-response could be due to a lack of explosive, fast movements during resistance training. In people with stroke, explosive power is associated with function and disability after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2008</LINK>), and in elderly people explosive power output may be more important than strength for function and disability (<LINK REF="REF-Puthoff-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puthoff 2007</LINK>). Interventions to improve explosive power after stroke remain under-investigated; however, one ongoing trial does include training with fast movements (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01573585" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01573585</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mobility</HEADING>
<P>All the meta-analyses of walking performance outcomes are summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK> and this shows a clear pattern of findings.</P>
<P>Cardiorespiratory training increased preferred and maximal walking speed and walking capacity (6-MWT) at the end of the training period (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). Benefits were retained after follow-up in both maximum walking speed (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>) and 6-MWT (<LINK REF="CMP-002.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.11</LINK>). Benefits to walking performance also emerge when walking in a community setting outside the research environment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.21" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.21</LINK>). Gait improvements in stroke survivors after cardiorespiratory training may occur due to an increased fitness reserve (arising from an increased VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak or improved gait economy, or both). Cardiorespiratory walking training is, however, also task-related and repetitive in nature. These elements by themselves may facilitate motor learning and benefit gait performance even in the absence of an obvious improvement in physical fitness parameters. There is evidence that suggests cardiorespiratory training, as well as improving walking speed, may reduce the reliance of stroke survivors on other people to assist with ambulation (Functional Ambulation Categories score; <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>
<P>Mixed training increased preferred walking speed and walking capacity at the end of the training period (<LINK REF="CMP-005.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.23</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.25</LINK>). Benefits were retained only in the 6-MWT performance (<LINK REF="CMP-006.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.14</LINK>). These findings were based, however, on trials that were heterogeneous and potentially confounded by additional training time. When we looked only at the results of the 'unconfounded' trials, we did not find any significant training effect (<LINK REF="CMP-005.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.24</LINK>). Moreover, all trials except <LINK REF="STD-Yang-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Yang 2006</LINK> included specific walking training. Therefore, benefits may be explained by the additional walking practice and treatment 'attention'.</P>
<P>Meta-analyses revealed no significant effects of resistance training on walking outcomes. It is worth noting that most of the resistance training interventions did not incorporate walking as a mode of exercise. Improvements in muscle strength may not necessarily produce functional benefits (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2001</LINK>), which translate into a better walking performance. The relationships between 'fitness' and 'function' is indeed very complex and may arise from factors such as non-linear associations (<LINK REF="REF-Buchner-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchner 1991</LINK>) or the interaction of 'co-impairments' such as lack of balance and low muscle strength (<LINK REF="REF-Rantanen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rantanen 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, on the whole, there is consistent evidence that measures of walking performance improve after both cardiorespiratory training and mixed training but not after resistance training. Although the improvements are clear one could still question whether they are clinically important. For example <LINK REF="REF-Fulk-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fulk 2011</LINK> concluded that a clinically important increase in preferred walking speed after stroke would be 10.5 m/minute; this is greater than the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) margin of the effect sizes for preferred walking speed in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Physical function</HEADING>
<P>A variety of measures to assess functional limitations were used in the included trials. A number of balance outcomes were reported, which enabled data to be pooled.</P>
<P>Berg Balance scores did not improve after cardiorespiratory training but there were some hints of benefit among mixed and resistance training (<LINK REF="CMP-007.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.5</LINK>). When balance data using other measurement tools were also combined (SMD; <LINK REF="CMP-005.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.31</LINK>) a stronger beneficial effect was shown for mixed training. All of the mixed training interventions involved weight bearing and walking and some specifically included balance training; these components of the training could improve balance. However, this overall effect is difficult to attribute to the content of the mixed training because many of the studies were confounded by increased training time. A sensitivity analysis showed the benefit disappeared when confounded studies were excluded. Overall there is some uncertainty over whether balance can be improved.</P>
<P>Other systematic reviews have examined cardiorespiratory training effects (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 2013</LINK>) and trunk training effects (<LINK REF="REF-Cabanas_x002d_Vald_x00e9_s-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cabanas-Valdés 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sorinola-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorinola 2014</LINK>) on balance after stroke. Although <LINK REF="REF-Sorinola-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sorinola 2014</LINK> reported a significant effect of trunk exercise on standing balance (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.72, 95% CI -0.01 to 1.45; P value = 0.05) the balance data as a whole are not convincing and these reviews have different eligibility criteria to the current review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Health status and quality of life</HEADING>
<P>Only a limited number of trials, with inconsistent results, included relevant quality of life measures. Therefore, few conclusions can be drawn on whether training can improve self perceived health status and quality of life after stroke.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Aidar-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Aidar 2007</LINK>, a small trial, showed that both the physical functioning and the emotional role functioning of the SF-36 survey were significantly better after cardiorespiratory training.</P>
<P>Two trials, confounded by additional training time, showed better results on the physical functioning but not the social role functioning of the SF-36 survey after mixed training. Similarly, three trials demonstrated both immediate and long-term benefits of mixed training on the 'physical role functioning' of the SF-36 survey. The scoring of this domain is, however, problematic in people - such as stroke survivors - who are not engaged in employment (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1999</LINK>). Furthermore, various elements of the SF-36 survey are prone to ceiling effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hobart-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hobart 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>A small individual trial did not show any significant effect on the physical functioning and mental health components of the SF-36 health survey after resistance training.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review of exercise after stroke included quality of life outcomes and also concluded there was no consistent effect (<LINK REF="REF-Pang-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pang 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Mood</HEADING>
<P>Few trials of variable methodological quality were available to assess the effects of training on mood. Results were not consistent amongst trials and few conclusions can be drawn. Data could be pooled from different depression scales in all types of training with small benefits only after cardiorespiratory training follow-up and at the end of resistance training interventions. There is no consistent pattern and the pool of studies are at risk of bias due to attrition and confounding due to imbalanced exposures.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review of exercise for depressive symptoms after stroke combined data from 13 studies, with a total of 1022 participants, and showed a small effect at the end of exercise (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.01; P value = 0.03) but not follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Eng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 2014</LINK>). These findings may differ to the current review since <LINK REF="REF-Eng-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eng 2014</LINK> pooled different exercise types, only 5/13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) meet our eligibility criteria, and we made a methodological decision not to pool the data from <LINK REF="STD-Lennon-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Lennon 2008</LINK> in our meta-analyses (as this would involve estimating mean and standard deviation from median and range).</P>
<P>In both reviews small benefits could be exaggerated due to confounded exposure. Also, any lack of effect could arise from the fact that the symptoms of depression are relatively mild; this could be due to confounding by antidepressant medications, which were not reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Cognitive function</HEADING>
<P>There are only three included trials that have examined the effect of fitness training interventions on cognitive function; currently no conclusions can be drawn. There are two other systematic reviews that have examined the effects of exercise on cognitive function (<LINK REF="REF-Cumming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Soto-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Soto 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cumming-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumming 2012</LINK> showed that physical activity and exercise interventions produced significant improvements in cognitive function (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.36; P value = 0.015; nine trials; 716 participants) at the end of the intervention. Although 6/13 of the studies involved exercise interventions only 3/13 included studies meet our inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duncan-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Duncan 2003</LINK> (cited as Studentski); <LINK REF="STD-Mead-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mead 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Soto-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Soto 2013</LINK> reviewed the effects of cardiorespiratory and resistance training interventions on cognitive function after stroke. None of the five included studies met our criteria for inclusion.</P>
<P>Inclusion of cognitive function outcomes is a protocol change in this review update. This change is justified because there is a rationale as to why cognitive function may be improved by fitness training (<LINK REF="REF-Heyn-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heyn 2004</LINK>), and interventions to improve cognitive function have recently emerged as the highest rated research priority with regard to life after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>); there is a clear and important knowledge gap here.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Factors influencing primary and secondary outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Performing subgroup analyses is problematic when the number of trials is small; the consequences are reduced power and the influence of characteristics unrelated to the grouping factors.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose of training</HEADING>
<P>All the training interventions occurred regularly and were progressive in nature. The interventions differed in the dose of training, quantified in terms of 1) overall volume of training time, and 2) the intensity of the exercise used.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK> criteria were used to define an effective overall 'dose' of fitness training as defined by the parameters of intensity, duration, and frequency. Some study interventions may have provided a sufficient dose of training but failure to record or report intensity meant they could not be assigned to a category. Conversely, interventions meeting the criteria may have provided a low dose of training because they were of short duration (for example <LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Underestimation of benefits may arise if interventions are poorly attended or complied with. Full attendance was found in few included trials, where interventions occurred partly or completely during inpatient care, were home-based, or were of very short duration (four weeks).</P>
<P>Overestimation of benefits may arise in trials where the intervention group is potentially confounded by increased training time compared with the control group. In these trials with no attention control additional benefits could arise from non-specific effects of therapist input, psychosocial effects of contact with other participants and factors such as travel to and from a training location that could amount to a substantial dose of physical activity from which a real training effect could arise.</P>
<P>A further exaggeration of this simple 'dose' effect in confounded trials would also be expected for trials with a long duration or large volumes of training, or both. In most confounded trials the total volume of training was 20 hours or more, whilst only few unconfounded trials exceeded 20 hours of training. Published meta-analyses have shown that augmented stroke rehabilitation may result in improvements in activities of daily living (<LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2004</LINK>). This source of confounding may influence the outcome in trials of physical fitness training. For example, in a number of instances when we excluded confounded trials in sensitivity analyses, the effect sizes became smaller. The data from <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1993</LINK> supported these observations, showing that longer gait training was associated with improved mobility outcomes (this may also be indicative of a dose-response effect).</P>
<P>Exercise programme intensity is one of the most important fitness training variables. <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2002</LINK> demonstrated that higher intensity walking increased maximal walking speed compared with lower intensity walking. However, the training programme in <LINK REF="STD-Pohl-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Pohl 2002</LINK> was also the most rapidly progressing, so it is somewhat difficult to disentangle the effect derived from an increase in progression from the effect due to the intensity of the intervention.</P>
<P>The findings of this review indicate that stroke survivors may successfully complete a variety of short-term training interventions. However, the optimal dose of training for people with stroke has yet to be established.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Type of training</HEADING>
<P>None of the included trials directly compared cardiorespiratory, resistance, and mixed training. We were able to compare the effects of the different types of training on gait speed. Walking speed increased significantly after cardiorespiratory training and mixed training, but not after resistance training. Both cardiorespiratory interventions and mixed interventions comprised specific gait-related training, which resulted in positive training effects.</P>
<P>Overall, the findings of this review show that benefits reflect the concept of the specificity of the training response. In particular, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO<SUB>2 </SUB>peak) improved after cardiorespiratory training; muscle strength improved after resistance training; walking performance improved after training interventions based on walking or walking-like modes of exercise; walking did not improve after resistance training interventions, probably because functionally relevant movements are difficult to incorporate into resistance training interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Timing of training</HEADING>
<P>All our meta-analyses were divided into 'during usual care' and 'after usual care' subgroups. However, this still does not have much value for a subgroup analysis since there are generally too few trials and too many other influential confounding factors. For instance, trial design tends to differ among these groups, interventions tend to be longer after usual care, etc.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Retention of benefits</HEADING>
<P>Functional advantages observed at the end of rehabilitation interventions are known to be transient, disappearing at a later stage (<LINK REF="STD-Kwakkel-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kwakkel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kwakkel-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kwakkel 2002</LINK>). This is probably due to continued improvements in the control group rather than deterioration in function (<LINK REF="REF-Langhorne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langhorne 2002</LINK>). Fitness improvements observed at the end of training interventions are also known to deteriorate.</P>
<P>Few trials included in this review assessed possible retention of benefits over time. Those that did were at increased risk of attrition bias. Most of the functional improvements observed at the end of the training period were not sustained at later assessments. We found, however, that cardiorespiratory and mixed training effects on some measures of walking performance were retained at the end of the follow-up period. This retention effect could have arisen from an increase in habitual levels of physical activity (including walking) facilitated by participation in a training intervention. The extent to which short-term fitness training influences longer-term habitual physical activity after stroke is still unknown. Currently, there are no data examining either long-term fitness training interventions or interventions to facilitate continued exercise after the training intervention is completed. Long-term assessments should be incorporated into future trials of physical fitness training.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of physical activity performed by control groups</HEADING>
<P>Training effects arising from physical activity in the control group could partly explain the lack of effect observed in some of the included trials.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>There are insufficient data to reliably examine the effects of risk of bias on estimates of effect. Overall, the methodological quality of most of the 58 included trials was limited. Only 4/58 trials enrolled more than 100 participants. Only 24/58 trials reported adequate methods of sequence generation and 25/58 trials had blinded outcome assessors (but some degree of unmasking occurred in three of these trials). The rate of attendance could only be determined in half of the included trials.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary of review findings</HEADING>
<UL>
<LI>Most available data relate to ambulatory people in the chronic phase (more than one month) post-stroke.</LI>
<LI>It is feasible for stroke survivors to participate in a variety of short-term fitness training regimens presented in a range of settings, either during usual stroke care or after hospital discharge.</LI>
<LI>There were insufficient data to assess death and dependence outcomes reliably.     </LI>
<LI>From the limited data reported in the included trials, there is an indication that participation in fitness training programmes is safe and does not result in serious adverse events.</LI>
<LI>There is some evidence that global indices of disability are reduced after training; this may be mediated largely by mobility improvements.</LI>
<LI>There is some evidence that cardiorespiratory training may improve cardiorespiratory fitness.</LI>
<LI>There is clear evidence that cardiorespiratory training improves measures of walking performance (e.g. walking speed and walking capacity) and reduces dependence on others for ambulation during usual care. Some training effects were retained at follow-up.</LI>
<LI>There is some evidence that mixed training may improve measures of walking performance. Some training effects were retained at follow-up.</LI>
<LI>There are insufficient data to assess reliably the effects of resistance training.</LI>
<LI>There is an indication that the training effect may be greater when fitness training is specific or 'task-related'.</LI>
<LI>There is some evidence that balance improves after fitness training; the benefits are within mixed and resistance training.</LI>
<LI>There are few data relating to quality of life, mood, or cognitive function outcomes.</LI>
<LI>There are insufficient data to conduct meaningful subgroup analyses to explore the effects of the type, 'dose', and timing of training on outcome measures.</LI>
<LI>Limited methodological quality of included trials and relatively small sample sizes hamper the generalisability of findings.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The main findings are presented are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables for cardiorespiratory training (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and for mixed training (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Issues for research</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Control groups</HEADING>
<P>In terms of trial design, there should be a concerted effort to balance total contact time across all arms in order to avoid confounded results. Preferably, the control intervention should be a non-exercise intervention to avoid training effects. In reality this may be difficult to achieve since even performing activities of daily living may be sufficient to cause training effects in elderly people (<LINK REF="REF-Young-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 2001</LINK>). However, a comparison of two different doses of training would be a robust way of clarifying whether the content of the training itself is beneficial.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Currently there are few well-controlled trials examining interventions to improve muscle force production. Trials of resistance training often focus on pre-specified movements that bear little resemblance to those relevant to everyday life and, even though muscle strength may improve, no functional benefits arise. The nature of the association between physical fitness and functional benefits is complex, and this suggests that training interventions should also address other co-impairments such as balance.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>To measure disability and dependence in stroke is problematic. A variety of disability and assessment scales are usually reported in trials of physical rehabilitation and fitness training. These scales do not always assess the same functional domain and therefore pose the problem of the validity and reliability of combining their results in a meta-analysis. Furthermore, some of these scales are not validated in stroke survivors and, therefore, may lack specificity. Rating scales are also prone to a 'ceiling effect' and to skewed distributions. It would be useful if only well-known, validated scales are used in future trials for the assessment of participants' functional performance and if trial investigators would clearly address the problems related to the use of these assessment scales.</P>
<P>Stroke survivors who are eligible for fitness training have typically mild levels of disability. Mild impairments may be difficult to assess and many of the existing disability scales may fail to detect them. However, functional decline over time that is simply due to increasing age and inactivity could mean that mild disability may progress quickly to more serious levels. Therefore, it would be useful to assess long-term outcomes in mild stroke survivors using pre-clinical disability measures (for example <LINK REF="REF-Fried-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fried 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>A priority setting exercise undertaken in 2012 identified the top 10 research priorities for life after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-Pollock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pollock 2012</LINK>). Among the priorities identified by stroke patients and carers are a substantial proportion of areas for which fitness training could be beneficial: 1) cognitive function; 2) upper limb function; 3) mobility, balance and gait; and 4) the role of exercise in physical function, quality of life, and secondary stroke prevention (<LINK REF="REF-Saunders-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saunders 2014a</LINK>). Apart from mobility there is little evidence relating to the other areas important to patients. In particular cognitive function lacks investigation despite being the ranked the most important research priority.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Long-term studies</HEADING>
<P>Both improvements in physical fitness after training and improvements in physical function after rehabilitation are transient. Since physical fitness may be linked to functional status, the long-term retention of benefit should be routinely examined in trials of fitness training. Fitness and function parameters are known to deteriorate with physical inactivity and to decrease with increasing age. Therefore, it is plausible that short-term effects of training only emerge as being beneficial after a period of functional decline.</P>
<P>There is a need to examine strategies aimed at promoting physical activity and maintaining physical fitness in the long term after stroke.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is a clear need for larger well-designed trials of physical fitness training. Future trials should include participants with a greater spectrum of stroke severity that includes non-ambulatory patients, have adequate control interventions, and use relevant outcome measures.</P>

<P>Cardiorespiratory training and mixed training during or after usual stroke care is effective in increasing walking speed and walking capacity in stroke survivors. It is likely that improvements in fitness, mobility, and physical function outcomes are associated with 'task-related' training. Guidance and services for exercise after stroke are developing worldwide, including:</P>

<LI>USA (APA Physical Activity and Exercise Recommendations for Stroke Survivors; <LINK REF="REF-Billinger-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billinger 2014</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>These initiatives are based on existing evidence about the benefits of exercise after stroke and the needs of stroke survivors to have ongoing access to rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. The findings of this review will inform the content of such services.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-03-14 15:08:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Larger, well-designed clinical trials are needed to assess the effects of physical fitness training after stroke and to determine the optimal regimen for improving fitness.</P>
<P>Future trials should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>comply with the current CONSORT guidelines for reporting of randomised clinical trials (<LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT 2010</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>report exercise and control interventions more clearly; intervention reporting guidelines do exist (TIDiER; <LINK REF="REF-Hoffmann-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffmann 2014</LINK>), and new exercise-specific guidance is emerging (CERT Consensus Exercise Reporting Template; <LINK REF="REF-Slade-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slade 2014</LINK>);</LI>
<LI>include a broader population of stroke survivors (including non-ambulatory stroke survivors) to allow stratification by gender, level of impairment, and functional ability;</LI>
<LI>assess the effects of physical fitness training in people with specific post-stroke problems, for example people with depression or post-stroke fatigue;</LI>
<LI>be of longer duration (12 weeks or longer);</LI>
<LI>have a long-term follow-up.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The training intervention and the control intervention should be comparable in terms of duration to prevent overestimation of training effects. The content of an attention control intervention should be chosen carefully to prevent underestimation of treatment effects caused by confounded physical activity in the control group.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Implications for future updates</HEADING>
<P>The literature on physical fitness training interventions is constantly growing. Complex reviews such as this do attract suggestions to 'split' findings in some way. However, for ease of updating and to allow direct comparison of a range of different fitness interventions the current architecture should remain. It may be desirable to revise some of the inclusion criteria to allow more potentially relevant comparisons to be assessed especially where these are not covered by existing Cochrane Reviews.</P>

<P>Intervention: participants in the intervention group attended 12 group circuit sessions 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Groups were led by 1 of the principal investigators assisted by 2 physiotherapist students. There were 15 stations in the circuit that were graded to each participant's ability and progressed as tolerated. Each station contained either a task-oriented gait or standing balance activity (e.g. step-ups, balance beam, marching in place) or strengthening of a lower extremity muscle with the purpose to improve gait (e.g. lunges, Swiss ball squats, side leg lifts). Total exercise time was 30 minutes including stretching. Measurements performed post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up</P>
<P>Control: participants in the control group attended 8 sessions - 4 social and 4 educational sessions (e.g. provide participants with relevant and useful information for everyday activities; provide intellectual stimulation and enjoyment sessions; play a game; cafe outing). Each session lasted 90 minutes. The control group was led by an occupational therapist. Measurements performed post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up</P>
