<TITLE>Epidurals for pain relief in labour</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-11-03 16:30:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pain relief is important for women in labour. Pharmacological methods of pain relief include inhalation of nitrous oxide, injection of opioids and regional analgesia with an epidural for a central nerve block. Epidurals are widely used for pain relief in labour and involve an injection of a local anaesthetic into the lower region of the spine close to the nerves that transmit pain. Epidural solutions are given by bolus injection, continuous infusion or using a patient-controlled pump. Lower concentrations of local anaesthetic are needed when they are given together with an opiate, allowing women to maintain the ability to move around during labour and to bear down. Epidural analgesia may sometimes give inadequate analgesia, which may be due to non-uniform spread of local anaesthetic. Combined spinal-epidural involves a single injection of local anaesthetic or opiate into the cerebral spinal fluid for fast onset of pain relief as well as insertion of the epidural catheter for continuing pain relief. Side effects such as itchiness, drowsiness, shivering and fever have been reported and rare but potentially severe adverse effects of epidural analgesia do occur.</P>
<P>The review identified 38 randomised controlled studies involving 9658 women. All but five studies compared epidural analgesia with opiates. Epidurals relieved labour pain better than other types of pain medication but led to more use of instruments to assist with the birth. Caesarean delivery rates did not differ overall and nor were there effects of the epidural on the baby soon after birth; fewer babies needed a drug (naloxone) to counter opiate use by the mother for pain relief. The risk of caesarean section for fetal distress was increased. Women who used epidurals were more likely to have a longer delivery (second stage of labour), needed their labour contractions stimulated with oxytocin, experienced very low blood pressure, were unable to move for a period of time after the birth (motor blockage), had problems passing urine (fluid retention) and suffered fever. Long-term backache was no different. Further research on reducing the adverse outcomes with epidurals would be helpful.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-11-03 16:27:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 38 studies involving 9658 women; all but five studies compared epidural analgesia with opiates. Epidural analgesia was found to offer better pain relief (mean difference (MD) -3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.31, three trials, 1166 women); a reduction in the need for additional pain relief (risk ratio (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.17, 15 trials, 6019 women); a reduced risk of acidosis (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94, seven trials, 3643 women); and a reduced risk of naloxone administration (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.23, 10 trials, 2645 women). However, epidural analgesia was associated with an increased risk of assisted vaginal birth (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.57, 23 trials, 7935 women), maternal hypotension (RR 18.23, 95% CI 5.09 to 65.35, eight trials, 2789 women), motor-blockade (RR 31.67, 95% CI 4.33 to 231.51, three trials, 322 women), maternal fever (RR 3.34, 95% CI 2.63 to 4.23, six trials, 2741 women), urinary retention (RR 17.05, 95% CI 4.82 to 60.39, three trials, 283 women), longer second stage of labour (MD 13.66 minutes, 95% CI 6.67 to 20.66, 13 trials, 4233 women), oxytocin administration (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.39, 13 trials, 5815 women) and an increased risk of caesarean section for fetal distress (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.97, 11 trials, 4816 women). There was no evidence of a significant difference in the risk of caesarean section overall (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.25, 27 trials, 8417 women), long-term backache (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07, three trials, 1806 women), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.20, 18 trials, 6898 women), and maternal satisfaction with pain relief (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.05, seven trials, 2929 women). We found substantial heterogeneity for the following outcomes: pain relief; maternal satisfaction; need for additional means of pain relief; length of second stage of labour; and oxytocin augmentation. This could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses, where data allowed analysis. No studies reported on rare but potentially serious adverse effects of epidural analgesia.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-05-10 11:51:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural analgesia appears to be effective in reducing pain during labour. However, women who use this form of pain relief are at increased risk of having an instrumental delivery. Epidural analgesia had no statistically significant impact on the risk of caesarean section, maternal satisfaction with pain relief and long-term backache and did not appear to have an immediate effect on neonatal status as determined by Apgar scores. Further research may be helpful to evaluate rare but potentially severe adverse effects of epidural analgesia on women in labour and long-term neonatal outcomes.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-11-03 16:36:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>This review is one in a series of Cochrane reviews examining pain management in labour. These reviews contribute to an overview of systematic reviews of pain management for women in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Neilson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neilson 2011</LINK>), and share a generic protocol (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain relief is an important issue for women in labour. The level of pain experienced and the effectiveness of pain relief may influence a woman's satisfaction with labour and delivery and may have immediate and long-term emotional and psychological effects (<LINK REF="REF-Christiansen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christiansen 2002</LINK>). The type of pain relief used in labour may impact on breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Women experience varying degrees of pain in labour and exhibit an equally varying range of responses to it. An individual's reaction to the pain of labour may be influenced by the circumstances of her labour, the environment, her cultural background, preparation towards her labour and the support available to her (<LINK REF="REF-Brownridge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McCrea-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCrea 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rowlands-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rowlands 1998</LINK>). Need for pain relief in labour is also influenced by the type of onset of labour (spontaneous or induced) and medical interventions such as instrumental vaginal delivery and episiotomy. Several methods of relieving pain in labour and various coping strategies have been advocated, ranging from limited intervention such as breathing exercises to medical techniques like epidural analgesia. Regardless of the intensity of the pain experienced and response generated, it is important that whatever method is used to ameliorate maternal discomfort, it is both effective and safe for the mother and baby.</P>
<P>Relaxation therapies, distraction techniques and continuous support are believed to help women in labour to use their own resources to cope with pain. Other non-pharmacological methods used for relieving pain include acupressure, acupuncture, reflexology, aromatherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and intradermal injection of sterile water (<LINK REF="REF-Martensson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martensson 1999</LINK>). Reported effectiveness of these methods vary (<LINK REF="REF-Dowswell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dowswell 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ranta-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ranta 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smith-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2011b</LINK>). There are data to show that women who have continuous intrapartum support are less likely to have pain relief in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hodnett-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hodnett 2011</LINK>) and measures, such as labouring in water, massage, acupuncture and hypnosis may be helpful therapies for pain management in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cyna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cyna 2004</LINK>). Efficacy of other methods such as audioanalgesia and music therapy remains to be assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Cluett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cluett 2009</LINK>). Pharmacological methods like inhalation of nitrous oxide, parenteral injection of opioids and regional analgesia in the form of epidural and combined spinal epidural are also commonly used to relieve pain in labour.</P>
<P>Epidural analgesia was first used in obstetric practice in 1946 and its use in labour has steadily increased until the last decade (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2005</LINK>). Approximately 20% of women in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Khor-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khor 2000</LINK>) and 58% of women in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Declercq-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Declercq 2002</LINK>) use this form of pain relief. However, there is considerable variation in the availability and use of epidural analgesia between hospitals in the same country (<LINK REF="REF-DOH-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">DOH 2005</LINK>). Epidural analgesia is a central nerve blockade technique, which involves the injection of a local anaesthetic into the lower region of the spine close to the nerves that transmit painful stimuli from the contracting uterus and birth canal. The anaesthetic inhibits nerve conduction by blocking sodium channels in nerve membranes, thereby preventing the propagation of nerve impulses along these fibres. Blocking of painful impulses from the nerves as they cross the epidural space results in analgesia which should be apparent within 10 to 20 minutes of administration. The anaesthetic placed in the epidural space exerts a concentration specific effect, affecting all the modalities of sensation of the blocked nerves to varying degrees, such that administration of a lower-dose anaesthetic (e.g. 0.125% bupivacaine) partially selectively blocks painful stimuli while preserving motor function, whereas higher doses of anaesthetic afford complete sensory and motor blockade limiting mobility in labour. Blocking of sympathetic nerves occurs at varying concentrations and manifests as vasodilatation and hypotension.</P>
<P>Epidural analgesia is considered to be effective for reducing pain in labour (<LINK REF="REF-Brownridge-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brownridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Howell-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Howell 2001</LINK>). The choice of drugs and dosage varies from institution to institution. Protocols regarding the care of women using epidural analgesia also vary among hospitals. Epidural solutions are administered either by bolus, continuous infusion or patient-controlled pump. An intermittent technique involves injections of local anaesthetic through a catheter positioned in the epidural space. Boluses of higher concentrations, as used in the earlier years, have been associated with a dense motor block resulting in reduced mobility, decreased pelvic tone and impairment of the bearing down effort in the second stage of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Thornton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornton 2001</LINK>). More recently there has been a trend to use a lower concentration of local anaesthetic in combination with a variety of opiates; these combinations provide analgesic effect while allowing the woman to maintain some motor function, such as the ability to move during her labour and retain her ability to bear down (<LINK REF="REF-COMET-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMET 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Russell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russell 2000</LINK>). Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) involves a single injection of local anaesthetic and/or opiate into the cerebral spinal fluid as well as insertion of the epidural catheter. CSE combines the advantages of spinal analgesia (faster onset of pain relief, more reliable analgesia) with the advantages of epidural analgesia such as continuing pain relief, potentially maintained throughout the entire duration of labour (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2003</LINK>). Epidural analgesia allows the woman to remain alert during labour. The regional administration of epidural drugs may help avoid some systemic side effects of analgesic medication on the baby, such as opioid-induced neonatal respiratory depression. A functioning epidural allows the option of regional anaesthesia for interventions such as caesarean section or manual removal of retained placenta, thereby avoiding the risks associated with general anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-Hibbard-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hibbard 1996</LINK>). However, spinal anaesthesia can also be used for this purpose.</P>
<P>Although epidural analgesia may provide effective pain relief in labour, it may sometimes give inadequate analgesia which may be due to non-uniform spread of local anaesthetic. Reported maternal complications include hypotension - a reduction in maternal blood pressure (BP). Severe sudden hypotension (more than 20% decrease in baseline BP) may result in a clinically significant decrease in utero-placental blood flow, which could potentially affect delivery of oxygen to the baby. This may especially compromise a baby with inadequate reserves (<LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1998</LINK>). For this reason intravenous fluids may be given before administering the epidural drugs (fluid preload) to attenuate the decrease in maternal BP. Side effects such as itchiness, drowsiness, shivering and fever have also been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Buggy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buggy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eberle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eberle 1996</LINK>). Women may develop urinary retention while using epidural analgesia. This may necessitate the insertion of a catheter to drain the bladder. Urinary retention in the postpartum period has been attributed to long labours in women using epidural analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Liang-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liang 2002</LINK>). Less common side effects reported are accidental puncture of the dura, which can sometimes cause severe headache - post-dural puncture headache (1%) (<LINK REF="REF-Stride-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stride 1993</LINK>). This resolves spontaneously in some women; however, a blood patch may be needed when the headache is persistent. This involves a sterile injection of 15 ml to 20 ml of the woman's fresh blood into the epidural space (<LINK REF="REF-Bromage-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bromage 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vincent-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vincent 1998</LINK>). This resolves the headache for 60% of women.</P>
<P>Epidural analgesia may influence the course of labour. There have been suggested associations with malpositions of the fetal head, prolonged labour, increased use of oxytocin and of instrumental deliveries (<LINK REF="REF-Eberle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eberle 1996</LINK>); possible effects on the risk of caesarean section continue to be debated (<LINK REF="REF-Lieberman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lieberman 2002</LINK>). Effects of epidural analgesia on the neonate may be mixed. Higher cord pH values and less naloxone use at birth have been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Halpern-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halpern 1998</LINK>), as has a greater need for neonatal resuscitation (<LINK REF="REF-COMET-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">COMET 2001</LINK>). It has been suggested that babies of women who use epidural analgesia may be more prone to low blood sugar in the first hours after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Swanstrom-1981b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swanstrom 1981b</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of analgesia and benefits afforded by epidural, and the risk of potential adverse effects when compared with non-epidural methods of relieving pain in labour or no pain relief.</P>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>).

If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. We treated the random-effects summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-11-03 17:37:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Thirty-eight trials involving 9658 women were randomised into trials comparing epidural analgesia with alternative forms of pain relief or no pain relief in labour. Evidence from this review demonstrates that epidural analgesia offers better pain relief in labour. However, women who use this form of pain relief have an increased risk of instrumental delivery when compared with women who use non-epidural forms of analgesia or no analgesia at all. There was no statistically significant evidence of a difference in maternal satisfaction with pain relief, the risk of caesarean section, long-term backache (up to 26 months) or immediate adverse effects on the infant between the epidural and control groups. For the outcome caesarean section the risk ratio was 1.10, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.25. Although this finding remains statistically non-significant, a small increase in the risk of caesarean section cannot be excluded.<BR/>
<BR/>Some limitations of our analysis should be noted. Eleven studies reported women's perception of pain as an outcome but we could not extract the data from these studies for meta-analysis, because trials measured this outcome differently and reported the data in a format not compatible with the software used. These studies used various forms of visual analogue scores as a way of measuring women's perception of pain but it was not possible to extract the data presented. In three of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bofill-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bofill 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sharma-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sharma 2002</LINK>), data were presented as graphical representation only. For two of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dickinson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dickinson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muir-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Muir 1996</LINK>), it was unclear as to whether the data presented were means or medians. The trial by <LINK REF="STD-Philipsen-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Philipsen 1989</LINK> used medians; <LINK REF="STD-Gambling-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Gambling 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nikkola-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Nikkola 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thorp-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thorp 1993</LINK> measured this outcome at different time intervals and therefore the data could not be combined. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Jain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loughnan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Loughnan 2000</LINK>) presented their data as the number of women experiencing different levels of pain.<BR/>
<BR/>Trials varied in the characteristics of participants, labour management protocols and epidural regimen. These factors may influence the course of labour, pain relief requirements and outcomes such as duration of labour, oxytocin augmentation and instrumental delivery. Combining studies using a high concentration of a local anaesthetic agent for epidural analgesia with low concentration techniques, and studies maintaining a block in the second stage of labour to those discontinuing may influence some outcomes, in particular the duration of labour and instrumental delivery rates.<BR/>
<BR/>We planned a subgroup analysis based on parity, spontaneous labour versus induced labour, term versus preterm, continuous support in labour versus no continuous support in an attempt to explore if these variations had any effect on the results. However data on the separate subgroups was rarely provided and so it was not possible to conduct any subgroup analysis.<BR/>
</P>
<P>We detected substantial heterogeneity for maternal satisfaction with pain relief, women's perception of pain relief in labour, need for additional means of pain relief, maternal hypotension, length of first and second stages of labour and oxytocin augmentation, surgical amniotomy, maternal hypotension, drowsiness and nausea and vomiting. Exploration of heterogeneity was not possible using subgroup analysis, but we investigated the effect of trial quality using prespecified sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity could not be explained by sensitivity analyses. There was considerable variation in outcome measures in trials reporting women's satisfaction with pain relief as previously discussed. None of the trials reporting maternal hypotension gave their definitions for this outcome; therefore, there may be substantial differences here. Heterogeneity for the outcomes regarding length of labour and use of oxytocin augmentation may be explained by variations in clinical practice as to when labour begins and when oxytocin is required.<BR/>
<BR/>Most women in the control group were randomised to opioids and, therefore, the effect on some outcomes may be applicable to the use of opioids in labour rather than all other non-epidural forms of analgesia or no pain relief. Some women randomised to non-epidural analgesia received epidural as well. To a lesser extent, some women in the epidural arm did not receive the intervention due to rapid labour. We included only data based on an intention-to-treat analysis. However, this approach may make the results difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>The evidence presented in this review needs to be interpreted taking these limitations into account.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-11-03 17:37:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epidural analgesia affords more effective pain relief than non-epidural forms of analgesia. However, women randomised to epidural had an increase in the length of the second stage of labour and the need for oxytocin, with an increase in the risk of instrumental vaginal delivery. The length of the first stage of labour was longer in the epidural group, but did not reach statistical significance. The relative increase in the length of labour did not appear to affect the infants adversely for the outcomes measured in this review. The finding that epidural analgesia appears to alter the dynamics of labour necessitating the use of oxytocin needs to be applied in practice. Whether an increase in the duration of second stage of labour constitutes prolongation necessitating instrumental delivery should be a clinical decision. The evidence presented in this review should be made available to women considering pain relief in labour. The decision about whether to have an epidural should then be made in consultation between the woman and her carer.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-06-22 12:11:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite a large number of randomised trials including many women, none of the included studies reported on rare but serious adverse effects. Some of these data may be better obtained from large case series. There was no evidence of immediate effects on the baby; however, long-term consequences are still not known.</P>
<P>Further research is needed to minimise the adverse effects of epidural analgesia in women who choose epidural as their method of pain relief.</P>

<P>Abstract:<BR/>The section main results should use consistent terminology. The effect on pain relief was only reported in one small trial, and this should be referred to in the same way as for the adverse effects.</P>
<P>The conclusion is also inconsistent. A suggestion for the first sentence: 'Epidural analgesia is an effective method of pain relief during labour, but is associated with longer first and second stages of labour, increased oxytocin use, malrotation, instrumental delivery and Caesarean section; women should be counselled about these risks before labor.' The more rare maternal side effects could also be mentioned.</P>
<P>Background:<BR/>The statements about epidural as effective form of pain relief are not justified or referenced. It is unclear whether more evidence to support this effect is necessary.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>Pain relief has now been reported in four studies, all of which showed epidural to be better than non-epidural analgesia. The review has been amended to take account of this, and the other comments.</P>

<P>Results and discussion:<BR/>The interpretation of the summary statistic for Caesarean section is misleading. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is just below one (relative risk 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.74), and so does not achieve statistical significance. The authors conclude 'there is no significant increase in the Caesarean section rate', but this under rates the clinical importance of these data. It is not usual to demand statistically significant differences between groups before considering it worth mentioning a possible adverse event to a patient. The most likely effect is an increase of 25%, but this may be as much as 75% and a small, 10%, decrease in the risk of Caesarean section is also possible.</P>
<P>Women considering their choice of pain relief should be warned that epidural analgesia probably increases their risk of having a Caesarean section.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>This broader interpretation of the confidence intervals has been incorporated.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>Update on previous comment</P>
<P>The reviewer stated in February 2000 that "This broader interpretation of the confidence intervals will be incorporated into the next update of the review." In April 2001 this has yet to be done. The review continues to be misleading in stating that epidurals do not increase rates of caesarean section.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The review has now been updated. With addition of new trials, the overall relative risk of caesarean section for women allocated epidural rather than other forms of analgesia was 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.23. The implications are discussed in the review. </P>
