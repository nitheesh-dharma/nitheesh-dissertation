<P>Dietary protein is needed for normal growth and development. The protein intake required for growth of the low birth weight infant has been estimated by the growth rate of the fetus to be 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg/d. Controlling the amount of protein given to low birth weight babies (less than 2.5 kg) fed with formula is important. Too much protein can raise blood urea and amino acid (phenylalanine) levels, and this may harm neurodevelopment. Too low protein intake may limit the growth of these infants. The review authors searched the medical literature to identify studies that compared protein intake as follows: between 3 and 4 g of protein per kg of infant body weight each day versus less than 3.0 g/kg/d or greater than 4.0 g/kg/d by low birth weight infants fed formula during their initial hospital stay. Increased protein intake resulted in greater weight gain of around 2.0 g/kg/d. Based on increased body incorporation of nitrogen, this was associated with increased lean body mass. The present conclusion was based on six studies that changed only the protein content of the formula and was supported by three additional studies that made changes in other nutrients as well. No significant difference in the concentration of plasma phenylalanine was noted between infants fed high or low protein content formula. The review was limited in the conclusions made because differences in protein content among comparison groups in some of the individual trials were small and formulas differed substantially across studies; some studies included healthier and more mature premature infants. Study periods varied from eight days to two years, so information on long-term outcomes was limited. Existing research is not adequate to allow specific recommendations regarding formula with protein content that provides more than 4.0 g/kg/d.</P>

<P>To determine whether higher (&#8805; 3.0 g/kg/d) versus lower (&lt; 3.0 g/kg/d) protein intake during the initial hospital stay of formula-fed preterm infants or low birth weight infants (&lt; 2.5 kilograms) results in improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without evidence of short- and long-term morbidity.</P>
<P>To examine the following distinctions in protein intake.</P>
<P> 1. Low protein intake if the amount was less than 3.0 g/kg/d.</P>
<P> 2. High protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than 3.0 g/kg/d but less than 4.0 g/kg/d.</P>
<P> 3. Very high protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than 4.0 g/kg/d.</P>
<P>If the reviewed studies combined alterations of protein and energy, subgroup analyses were to be carried out for the planned categories of protein intake according to the following predefined energy intake categories.</P>
<P> 1. Low energy intake: less than 105 kcal/kg/d.</P>
<P> 2. Medium energy intake: greater than or equal to 105 kcal/kg/d and less than or equal to 135 kcal/kg/d.</P>
<P> 3. High energy intake: greater than 135 kcal/kg/d.</P>

<P>Five studies compared low versus high protein intake.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-26 20:25:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Good nutrition is essential for optimal growth and development of the preterm infant (<LINK REF="REF-Raiha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiha 2001</LINK>). Protein is an important component of adequate nutrition, as it provides essential amino acids required for protein synthesis, which is necessary for growth. Hence, the quantity of protein consumed is an important consideration (<LINK REF="REF-Raiha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiha 2001</LINK>). The protein requirement for preterm infants can be estimated in two ways: estimates based on the protein intake of breast-fed infants or estimates based on theoretical calculations (the factorial approach). A preterm infant fed own mother's milk receives approximately 1.4 g/100 mL (<LINK REF="REF-Gomella-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomella 1999</LINK>) or about 2.5 g/kg/d of protein (<LINK REF="REF-Carlson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carlson 1998</LINK>). The factorial approach is a theory-based calculation that sums the requirements for growth and those for replacement of inevitable losses in urine, feces, and skin (<LINK REF="REF-Fomon-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fomon 1991</LINK>). It is difficult to estimate requirements for protein intake in premature infants because they may have a high rate of protein turnover and breakdown (<LINK REF="REF-Pencharz-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pencharz 1981</LINK>) as a result of immaturity or illness (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalhan 2000</LINK>). Preterm infants have a very rapid rate of growth and protein accretion. Based on the factorial approach using the "reference fetus," Ziegler and Fomon estimated the protein intake required for preterm infant growth and nitrogen accretion (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 1981</LINK>) to be 4 g/kg/d of enteral protein for infants with a birth weight of less than 1200 grams, and 3.5 g/kg/d for infants with a birth weight of 1200 to 1800 grams (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>). Formulas currently available for preterm infants in North America contain 3 g of protein per 100 kcal. If energy intakes are maintained at the recommended range (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 1995</LINK>), formula-fed infants would receive about 3.2 to 4.2 g/kg/d of protein. A disparity is evident between what is provided in own mother's milk versus estimated protein intake based on the factorial approach using the Ziegler-Fomon reference and what is contained in preterm formula.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-26 20:27:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Putative risks of higher protein intake include increased concentrations of amino acids, hydrogen ions, and urea as a result of immaturity of amino acid metabolic pathways in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Senterre-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senterre 1983</LINK>). Premature infants may not be able to handle higher protein intake efficiently; hence metabolic acidosis and higher plasma levels of amino acids such as tyrosine and phenylalanine concentrations may result (<LINK REF="REF-Micheli-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Micheli 1999</LINK>). Theoretically, these metabolic changes could lead to mental retardation. Additionally, adaptive responses of endocrine and metabolic homeostasis resulting from early nutrition may lead to "metabolic programming," which alters long-term outcomes of chronic diseases. Renal hypertrophy accompanied by a significant rise in kidney tissue and circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 has been reported secondary to high protein intake (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1993</LINK>). High protein intake in early life may increase risks later in life of obesity (<LINK REF="REF-Rolland_x002d_Cachera-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland-Cachera 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Scaglioni-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scaglioni 2000</LINK>) and other pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Rolland_x002d_Cachera-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolland-Cachera 1995</LINK>) such as diabetes mellitus (<LINK REF="REF-Raiha-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raiha 2001</LINK>). Therefore, long-term consequences of early nutrition need to be considered.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-04-17 12:03:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Putative benefits of higher protein intake include adequacy of protein for growth of lean tissue, growth of bone and blood constituents, turnover of tissues, synthesis of hormones and enzymes, and maintenance of oncotic pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Fomon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fomon 1993</LINK>). In an animal study, higher protein intake was shown to accelerate maturation of the renal tubules (<LINK REF="REF-Jakobsson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jakobsson 1990</LINK>). Deficiency of protein in infants leads to growth failure and, when extreme, can result in edema and lower resistance to infection (<LINK REF="REF-Nayak-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nayak 1989</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-03-26 21:05:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sufficient energy and other nutrients are needed to allow protein to be used for anabolism (<LINK REF="REF-Kashyap-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashyap 1994</LINK>) rather than as a fuel source. When energy availability is limited, nitrogen balance and protein utilization for tissue synthesis are limited. When protein is used for energy, the amino groups are cleaved and are converted primarily to urea, which is excreted, while the carbon skeleton enters the citric acid cycle to be used as the energy source. When protein is used as an energy source, optimal protein synthesis cannot occur (<LINK REF="REF-Kashyap-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kashyap 1994</LINK>). Consequently, protein intake needs to be evaluated in relation to energy intake for a direct comparison of alleged benefits and risks of higher protein intake.</P>
<P>Protein intake also needs to be evaluated in relation to that of other nutrients, as differences in intake of other nutrients may influence infant growth rates (<LINK REF="REF-Castillo_x002d_Duran-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Castillo-Duran 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musoke-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musoke 2001</LINK>). If studies provide variable amounts of protein and other nutrients at the same time, it is not possible to attribute study findings solely to the difference in protein intake. If formulas vary by more than 10% in any constituent other than protein, a direct comparison of outcomes may not be valid.</P>
<P>A related Cochrane review by Kuschel and Harding (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2000</LINK>) concluded that protein supplementation of human milk in relatively well preterm infants offers certain short-term benefits, including increases in weight gain, linear growth, and head growth. Although urea levels were higher in patients receiving protein supplementation, this was thought to reflect adequate rather than excessive dietary protein intake. Long-term effects and adverse effects of protein supplementation of human milk could not be evaluated in Kuschel and Harding's systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Kuschel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuschel 2000</LINK>) because of an absence of relevant data.<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wauben-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wauben 1995</LINK> reported no incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in high or low protein intake groups. However, it is uncertain what criteria were used to define necrotizing enterocolitis in these studies. For the purpose of this systematic review, necrotizing enterocolitis was defined as Bell's stage II or greater. The overall analysis showed no significant effect of protein intake on necrotizing enterocolitis (typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12).<BR/>

<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK> reported albumin as approximately 3 g/dL, and <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK> reported albumin as 3 mg/dL and 30 g/mL, respectively. We attempted to clarify the units with the latter two study authors without success. <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1994</LINK> measured albumin values at four and six weeks of age. <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK> measured albumin levels at approximately zero, two, and four weeks of the study. The values reported for each time period were not significantly different between low and high protein formula groups. <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK> reported prealbumin (mg/dL) (ie, transthyretin) levels and found a significant difference between low and high protein formula groups, favoring the high protein formula group.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-04-17 12:04:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although a large number of studies (n = 41) were identified, upon close inspection only six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Embleton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Embleton 2005</LINK>
<B> </B>(partial data); <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wauben-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wauben 1995</LINK>) were found to be suitable for inclusion in this systematic review. Most studies were excluded because they did not compare sufficiently different protein intakes, or they examined a different intervention (eg, studies examining quality of protein). Methodological limitations of the included trials that may have introduced bias and therefore pose a threat to the validity of the analysis are as follows.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hillman-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Hillman 1994</LINK>) had adequately concealed allocation.</LI>
<LI>Differences in protein content among comparison groups in some of the individual trials may be too small (range 0.56 to 1.36 g/kg/d) to illustrate the potential effects of changes in protein intake.</LI>
<LI>Formulas differed substantially across studies.</LI>
<LI>The duration of the interventions and/or study periods varied from eight days (<LINK REF="STD-Wauben-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Wauben 1995</LINK>) to two years (<LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK>).</LI>
<LI>Characteristics of participants varied across studies, with some studies including healthier and more mature premature infants.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These limitations may explain some of the differences in treatment effects and the statistical heterogeneity evident in measures of weight gain and nitrogen accretion.</P>
<P>For this review to be comprehensive and more clinically relevant, studies that varied in nutrient content other than protein were included only in a post-facto analysis. Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK>) were considered, although only two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK>) could be included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Weight gain (g/kg/d) was the most commonly reported outcome. An overall increase in weight gain was reported in infants randomly assigned to the high protein intake group compared with those in the low protein intake group (WMD 2.36 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.40 for the overall analysis; WMD 2.53 g/kg/d, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.45 for the post-facto analysis). The most desirable level of protein intake is that which contributes to infant growth at the infant's predetermined genetic potential without negative consequences. The ideal composition of weight gain for the preterm infant is not known. It is generally considered that the lower lean tissue and higher fat gain of these infants relative to the fetus may not be desirable (<LINK REF="REF-Schulze-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulze 1987</LINK>). Significantly greater nitrogen accretion (WMD 143.7 mg/kg/d, 95% CI 128.7 to 158.8 for the overall analysis; WMD 112.6 mg/kg/d, 95% CI 101.4 to 123.8 for the post-facto analysis) was observed in infants randomly assigned to the high protein intake groups. This greater nitrogen accretion suggests that some or all of the increment in weight is due to gains in lean body mass. These findings indicate that higher protein intake may help correct the non-optimal body composition seen in preterm infants at term adjusted age (<LINK REF="REF-Atkinson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atkinson 2000</LINK>). Statistical heterogeneity was noted in nitrogen accretion; hence the data should be interpreted cautiously. Potential sources of heterogeneity might include clinical diversity (eg, variability in participants, interventions, and outcomes) and methodological variability (eg, differences in trial design).</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK>) attempted to determine whether utilization of protein was enhanced by higher energy intake. These studies compared medium energy intake (120 kcal/kg/d) versus high energy intake (142 kcal/kg/d). <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK> found that higher energy intake did not enhance protein utilization. This was evident in the similarities noted between groups in quantities of nitrogen retention, albumin, and prealbumin, as well as concentrations of blood urea nitrogen and most plasma amino acids. In contrast, in a later study, <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK> reported improvements in nitrogen retention and blood urea nitrogen levels with higher energy intake.</P>
<P>Three studies reported that blood urea nitrogen levels were higher among infants fed high protein intake compared with those fed low protein intake (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK>). Although detectable, some of these differences may not be clinically significant. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK>) reported no significant differences in phenylalanine levels between low and high protein intake groups. Inclusion of the two Kashyap studies in the post-facto meta-analysis resulted in no significant difference (WMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.75) in concentrations of plasma phenylalanine between high and low protein intake groups.</P>
<P>Although the Kashyap studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kashyap-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kashyap 1988</LINK>) reported acid-base status within normal limits, other trials raised concerns regarding metabolic acidosis among infants receiving high protein intake (<LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK> noted that infants receiving very high protein intake (4.5 g/kg/d) developed metabolic acidosis that resolved once the infants were removed from the study and fed breast milk. In the <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK> study, late metabolic acidosis occurred in 25% and 7%, respectively, of infants in high and low protein intake groups. It is possible that the supplement "protinpur" that they added to their low protein formula to prepare the high protein formula had a poor biological value.</P>
<P>Very high protein intake may be poorly tolerated in infants with very low birth weight and extreme prematurity. Studies have not adequately evaluated short- and long-term adverse sequelae of very high protein intake. The maximal utilizable protein limits for infants in different weight and gestational age categories are unknown. In recent years, preterm infant formulas used in North America have changed such that if infants are fed at energy intake that exceeds 133 kcal/kg/d, protein intake will exceed 4 g/kg/d. In this systematic review, only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Embleton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Embleton 2005</LINK>) compared high (&#8805; 3.0 g/kg/d but &lt; 4.0 g/kg/d) versus very high protein intake (&#8805; 4.0 g/kg/d) both during and after initial hospital stay. Very high protein intake promoted significantly improved gain in length (cm/wk) at term, but differences did not remain significant at 12 weeks corrected age. Three of the 24 infants receiving very high protein intake developed uremia, which was associated with the level of protein intake and normalized without intervention within two to three days in two infants and within 10 days in another infant. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK>) in the post-facto analysis assessed protein intake above 4.0 g/kg/d. The quantity of protein intake in these studies was 4.6 g/kg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>), 6 to 7.2 g/kg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>), and 4.5 g/kg/d (<LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK>). The findings of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Raiha-1976" TYPE="STUDY">Raiha 1976</LINK>) could not be included in the meta-analysis, as comparisons made within these studies were unique. A post-facto meta-analysis of two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cooke-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Cooke 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Embleton-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Embleton 2005</LINK>) demonstrated significantly greater weight gain in the very high protein group compared with the high protein group (WMD 3.9 g/d, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.77).</P>
<P>Other potential adverse effects of high protein intake were assessed by reporting neurodevelopmental outcomes, days to full feedings, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and diarrhea. However, limited information could be obtained regarding these potential risks. Although a meta-analysis was carried out for necrotizing enterocolitis, the findings presented should be interpreted cautiously because (1) uncertainty about the definition of necrotizing enterocolitis used by some studies continues, and (2) small numbers of infants were included in the two groups (N = 49 receiving high protein intake and N = 38 receiving low protein intake).</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental outcomes of early nutrition were evaluated by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK>) included in this systematic review. <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1982</LINK> did not report the tool used. <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK> used the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, which has known psychometric properties but has been validated for use only in term infants up to two months of age (<LINK REF="REF-Brazelton-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brazelton 1995</LINK>). Results of <LINK REF="STD-Bhatia-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bhatia 1991</LINK> suggest improvement in some of the parameters of neurodevelopmental outcome with high protein intake compared with low intake. <LINK REF="STD-Goldman-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Goldman 1969</LINK>, who administered the Stanford-Binet test at three and five to seven years of age, noted a significant increase in the incidence of low IQ among infants with birth weight &lt; 1300 g fed very high protein intake of 6 to 7.2 g/kg/d during their initial hospitalization.</P>

<P>This systematic review suggests that weight gain and nitrogen accretion can be promoted by regulating protein intake in "healthy" formula-fed preterm infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1998</LINK>) and the Canadian Pediatric Society (<LINK REF="REF-CPS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">CPS 1995</LINK>) recommend 3 to 4 g/kg/d of protein for preterm infants. Increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and metabolic acidosis may occur in some infants who receive protein intake above 3 g/kg/d but less than 4 g/kg/d. This review revealed benefits in weight gain and nitrogen accretion and no clear risks associated with this intake. Growth advantages of protein intake greater than 4 g/kg/d remain uncertain and require careful monitoring for protein overload (ie, serum urea nitrogen levels). The exact protein intake that safely promotes optimal growth and development of low birth weight infants remains uncertain.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-03-27 00:03:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future research should determine the precise protein requirements of preterm infants according to birth weight and gestational age. Moreover, unanswered research questions remain regarding protein requirements according to postnatal age and the presence of short-term and long-term growth and neurodevelopmental morbidities. The question of whether clinically significant risks are associated with moderately elevated blood urea nitrogen and metabolic acidosis warrants study. Given the current state of evidence, protein intake above 4 g/kg/d should be considered experimental.</P>
