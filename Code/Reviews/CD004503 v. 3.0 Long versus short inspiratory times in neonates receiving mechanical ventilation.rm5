<P>Endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation of newborn infants with respiratory failure has revolutionised neonatal intensive care. The majority of infants are ventilated because of lung immaturity and hyaline membrane disease, respiratory difficulties that resolve for most of these infants. Use of ventilators can cause lung inflammation and ventilator-induced lung injury, particularly in the neonate with compliant chest walls, highlighting the importance of protective ventilation strategies. In addition, an infant's own breathing efforts, when combined with ventilator inflations, can exacerbate lung injury. Managing the mean airway pressure is important to improve oxygenation and not cause excessive airway pressures that can damage the lungs and impede venous return (a factor implied in spontaneous intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants). Clinicians still need to set an inspiratory time on the ventilator, making it important to determine whether the use of a long rather than a short inspiratory time reduces the rates of death, air leak and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD, requiring supplemental oxygen at 28 days) in mechanically ventilated newborn infants (term and preterm). The review authors identified five randomised studies reported from 1980 to 1992. These trials recruited a total of 694 newborn infants with acute respiratory failure mainly caused by hyaline membrane disease. A long inspiratory time was associated with a significant increase in air leak from the lungs (NNT 8). There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD but an increase in mortality before hospital discharge reached borderline statistical significance. Caution should be exercised in applying these results to modern neonatal intensive care because these studies were conducted before the introduction of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support. Whilst there is increasing use of non-invasive ventilation such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure to avoid ventilator-induced lung injury, mechanical ventilation will continue to have a role in extremely immature infants and those with hyaline membrane disease complicated by apnea.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>When intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was introduced in newborn infants with hypoxic respiratory failure from hyaline membrane disease (HMD), mortality was high and air leaks problematic. This barotrauma was caused by the high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) required to oxygenate stiff lungs. The primary determinants of mean airway pressure (and thus oxygenation) on a conventional ventilator are the inspiratory time (IT), PIP, positive end expiratory pressure and gas flow rates. In the 1970s uncontrolled studies on a small number of infants demonstrated a benefit in reducing barotrauma using a long IT and slow rates. This strategy was subsequently widely adopted. Current neonatal ventilators have been designed to minimise lung injury but rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remain high. It is therefore important that the inspiratory time causing least harm is used.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine in mechanically ventilated newborn infants whether the use of a long rather than a short IT reduces the rates of death, air leak and BPD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) was used. Searches of electronic and other databases were performed. These included MEDLINE (1966 - April 2004) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003). In order to detect trials that may not have been published, the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research, and the European Society for Pediatric Research were searched from 1998 - 2003.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials enrolling mechanically ventilated infants with or without respiratory pathology evaluating the use of long versus short IT (including randomised crossover studies with outcomes restricted to differences in oxygenation).<BR/> </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, and the methodological quality of each trial, and extracted the data. The data were analysed using relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) and their 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effect model was used for meta-analyses.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In five studies, recruiting a total of 694 infants, a long IT was associated with a significant increase in air leak [typical RR 1.56 (1.25, 1.94), RD 0.13 (0.07, 0.20), NNT 8 (5, 14)]. There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD. Long IT was associated with an increase in mortality before hospital discharge that reached borderline statistical significance [typical RR 1.26 (1.00, 1.59), RD 0.07 (0.00, 0.13)].<BR/> </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Caution should be exercised in applying these results to modern neonatal intensive care, because the studies included in this review were conducted prior to the introduction of antenatal steroids, post natal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support. Most of the participants had single pathology (HMD) and no studies examined the effects of IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons such as meconium aspiration and congenital heart disease (lungs with normal compliance). However, the increased rates of air leaks and deaths using long ITs are clinically important; thus, infants with poorly compliant lungs should be ventilated with a short IT. <BR/> </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The application of techniques of endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) for newborns with respiratory failure revolutionised neonatal intensive care. Prior to the introduction of IPPV, the mainstay of early management was supportive care, including the delivery of supplemental oxygen, maintenance of normoglycaemia and correction of metabolic acidosis. These measures had been recognised to reduce morbidity compared to controls (<LINK REF="REF-Usher-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Usher 1963</LINK>). IPPV was introduced as rescue therapy to treat apnea or correct hypoxaemia and respiratory acidosis in infants likely to die, often after bag and mask ventilation had failed. The techniques applied were initially adapted from those used in adult ventilation and met with limited success when first introduced (<LINK REF="REF-D_x002d_Papadopoulos-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">D-Papadopoulos 1965</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Murdock-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murdock 1970</LINK>). The short inspiratory times used in adults to avoid impaired venous return and the fast rates to avoid asynchrony in newborns were not as effective in preterm infants with atelectatic and poorly compliant lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Adamson-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adamson 1968</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Gregory-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gregory 1971</LINK> observed dramatic improvements over earlier approaches in neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was applied through an endotracheal tube. Ventilators were introduced in the early 1970s which used circuits with continuous gas flow and a timing device to close the expiratory valve allowing the infant to breathe spontaneously and receive intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). <LINK REF="REF-Cumarasamy-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cumarasamy 1973</LINK> reported improved survival when IMV was combined with the application of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), although early experiences in this era document the use of high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) to achieve adequate oxygenation. The high PIPs which were used reflected the poor compliance of the lung and were associated with high rates of mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (<LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK>). </P>
<P>Alternative strategies were sought to treat infants with HMD using lower inflating pressures. <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1971</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Herman-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herman 1973</LINK> noted that alveolar recruitment and hence oxygenation could be improved by using low rates (30 - 40 breaths per minute) and long inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratios. In some infants, improvements in oxygenation were seen when inspiratory times exceeded the expiratory times (inversed I:E ratios). In inverse- ratio ventilation the IT is prolonged, thereby increasing mean airway pressures and allowing the use of lower PIP. As neonatal ventilation became more widely used in nurseries in the late 1970s/early 1980s, this strategy was often adopted even though the evidence of efficacy was based on small numbers (less than ten in both studies) with only improved arterial blood gases and indices of oxygenation reported as the primary outcomes.</P>
<P>In assisted ventilation, the ventilator maintains oxygenation by providing an effective mean airway pressure (MAP) exceeding atmospheric pressure and a suitable inspired oxygen concentration. It removes carbon dioxide by passively removing the delivered tidal volume. The tidal volume is the volume of gas moving in and out of the lung in a respiratory cycle. The minute ventilation is the product of tidal volume and respiratory frequency. The alveolar ventilation (minute ventilation minus dead space ventilation) determines the amount of carbon dioxide removed. Ventilator "cycling" refers to the change from inspiration to expiration and may be initiated by time (a pre-determined duration of inspiration), pressure (when a preset pressure is reached) or volume (expiration starts after a preset tidal volume is delivered).<BR/> <BR/>Early pressure limited time cycled (PLTC) ventilators produced a square wave when pressure (on the y axis) was plotted against time (on the x axis). MAP is equal to the integration of the area under the pressure-time curve during a single respiratory cycle. The square wave is dependent on the pre-set inspiratory time, gas flow rate and ventilator frequency. <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1971</LINK> used square wave analysis to hypothesise that prolonging inspiratory time and using slower rates would improve oxygenation by increasing MAP. The longer the IT, the longer the lungs are held distended at the set PIP. Sustained inspiratory pressures may have their greatest incremental effect on non-functioning lung units, thereby improving distribution of the delivered tidal volume. With high frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV; rates &gt;60) changes in the pressure waveform are seen with a shortening of the inspiratory plateau such that the square wave is replaced by a sine wave. Thus any change in IT that accompanies frequency adjustments will change pressure waveforms, thereby altering MAP and oxygenation. Increasing MAP has been shown to improve oxygenation in RDS (<LINK REF="REF-Boros-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boros 1979</LINK>). In contrast to early work by <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1971</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1981</LINK> found that increasing PEEP had the greatest effect on MAP. Whilst a high MAP may be useful in acute RDS, excessive airway pressures in the recovering lung may impede venous return and cause overdistension. </P>
<P>The time required for the lungs to inflate and deflate is determined by the compliance and resistance of the respiratory system which includes the ventilator circuit, endotracheal tube and the patient's lung. The product of resistance and compliance, the time constant, is a measure of how long it takes for alveolar and proximal airway pressures to equilibrate. It provides a theoretical basis on how best to divide the respiratory cycle into inspiratory and expiratory times. The inspiratory time constant is typically short (approximately 0.05 seconds) in RDS and relatively long (0.25 seconds) in infants with normal lungs. For practical purposes, an expiratory time equivalent to three time constants must be provided to allow 95% of inspired tidal volume to be expelled (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 1996</LINK>). Thus if the expiratory times are absolutely or relatively short (as seen in inversed I:E ratios) there is the potential for gas trapping to occur and the build up of pressure known as inadvertent PEEP (<LINK REF="REF-Weigl-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weigl 1973</LINK>). Potential complications of inadvertent PEEP include gas trapping, reduced compliance and air leak. This can lead to reduced pulmonary blood flow and central venous return, a factor implied in spontaneous intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Rennie-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rennie 1987</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Ahluwalia-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahluwalia 1994</LINK> measured spontaneous inspiratory and expiratory times in newborns ventilated for RDS at a median of 0.3 (range 0.26- 0.34) and 0.46 (0.34-0.66) seconds respectively. RDS, characterised by markedly reduced compliance with very short time constants, can theoretically be managed by using either rapid rates (&gt;60) or slow rates with long inspiratory times providing there is sufficient time for passive exhalation. With HFPPV, the expiratory time may be insufficient to allow for deflation and lung units can become overdistended and further reduce the compliance of the lung. </P>
<P>Meconium aspiration affects mature infants and is characterised by both parenchymal and airway disease. Inhalation of meconium or congenital pneumonias can present as non homogenous lung disease typified by adjacent areas of atelectasis and hyperinflation. Setting ventilator parameters for non homogenous lung disease with different time constants is challenging with the aim being to provide sufficient alveolar ventilation without the development of inadvertent PEEP. The measurement of compliance and resistance in these circumstances is then dependent on the frequency of ventilation. With the limitations of PLTC ventilators, it has been observed that tidal volumes decrease as inspiratory times are reduced beyond a critical point (less than the time constant of the respiratory system) and that above a certain rate (&gt;75), dead space ventilation increases and minute ventilation is not a linear function of frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Boros-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boros 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recent advances in neonatal intensive care may influence the optimal inspiratory time. These include the availability of exogenous surfactant therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yost-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yost 2003</LINK>) and the advances in ventilator technology that allow synchronisation of ventilator breaths with an infant's spontaneous breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2004</LINK>). Surfactant improves oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity. By stabilising patent airways and with the gradual recruitment of atelectatic regions of the lung, surfactant improves respiratory system compliance and may alter the optimal inspiratory time (<LINK REF="REF-Goldsmith-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldsmith 1996</LINK>). Attempts to achieve synchrony have included the use of muscle relaxation (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1986</LINK>) and rapid rates to avoid active expiration against positive pressure inflation (<LINK REF="REF-Greenough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 2004</LINK>). Modern neonatal ventilators achieve synchronisation by assisting each spontaneous breath or providing synchronised intermittent mandatory breaths. In addition, new generation neonatal ventilators with the addition of flow sensors allow continuous respiratory function and lung volume measurements. By measuring lung volumes, tidal volumes, resistance, dynamic and static lung compliance, much of the guesswork of setting ventilator parameters has been eliminated. However, despite these advances in ventilator technology, clinicians still need to set an inspiratory time.</P>
<P>The many variables involved in conventional mechanical ventilation (PIP, PEEP, IT, rate, flow rates) are interdependent making it difficult to assess the effects of changing one variable (IT) whilst holding the others constant. By using stated subgroup analyses (see objectives), the aim of this review is to identify the optimal inspiratory time (or range of times) in newborn infants needing respiratory support on conventional mechanical ventilation.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to evaluate whether, in mechanically ventilated neonates, the use of long inspiratory times compared with short inspiratory times improved short and long term outcomes. These include mortality and the rate of acute lung injury (air leak) and/or chronic lung injury (BPD). For the initial analysis, any definitions of short and long used by the authors of studies were used. </P>
<P>Planned sub-group analyses included:<BR/>1. A subgroup of studies defining short IT as less than or equal to 0.5 seconds<BR/>2. Subgroup analysis based on the overall ventilator strategy i.e. <BR/>a. Absolute IT set at different (long and short) levels and maintained constant through the infant's treatment<BR/>b. I:E ratios set at different levels and maintained constant so that when rate was altered the IT and expiratory time were adjusted to maintain the I:E ratio<BR/>c. Trials where IT or I:E ratio form only part of the ventilator strategy e.g. when absolute IT and I:E ratios were not prescribed. In these trials an acceptable range of ITs and I:E ratios as defined by the authors would have been used in each arm <BR/>3. Underlying pathology (RDS vs other causes)<BR/>4.

<P>Five published trials (<LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK>, Greenough 1981, <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK>) recruiting a total of 694 infants were identified. All trials were performed in the pre-surfactant era and when antenatal steroids were not widely used. Three (<LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK>) were single centre studies whilst <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> involved 6 and 7 centres respectively.</P>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Nilmeier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilmeier 1995</LINK>) was excluded. This was a randomised controlled trial in infants with ventilator dependent HMD recruited at two weeks of age, comparing two ITs of 1.0 and 0.4 seconds over a period of seven days. Oxygenation and respiratory mechanics were measured prior to randomisation and compared after a week of the intervention. The results, however were only published in part and were descriptive in nature. Improvements in oxygenation were described as indicated by FiO2 requirement rather than our prespecified indices (AaDO2, PF ratios), and these were only presented for infants randomized to a long IT.</P>
<P>
<I>Study Population</I>
<BR/>The inclusion criteria varied slightly between studies. All the studies except <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> recruited infants with acute respiratory failure. <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> compared different ITs when weaning infants recovering from HMD. Only <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> had specific gestational age criteria for inclusion, recruiting infants less than or equal to 32 weeks gestation at birth. <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> recruited ventilated infants with a birth weight of greater than 750g. In the study of OCTAVE all ventilated infants less than 72 hours of age were eligible whilst <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> recruited all ventilated newborns over a 12 month period. The age at recruitment was not stated in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>. The differences in underlying respiratory pathology between the studies were small. Most infants had HMD although some cases of pneumonia were included. Only <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> specifically excluded infants with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) but no data specific to MAS were provided by any of the included studies. </P>

<I>Interventions</I>
<BR/>The ventilator strategies and types of ventilator used (see table of included studies) varied with each study.<BR/>Once randomised to a long IT or short IT, all infants were ventilated to meet therapeutic range of oxygenation and eucapnia as defined by the authors. All studies allowed adjustments in PIP to correct hypoxia. Ventilation was weaned by decreasing PIP. Where the IT was held constant, weaning of the ventilator rate was achieved by lengthening the expiratory time. All studies had <I>a priori</I> failure criteria (see table).<BR/>Inspiratory times as defined by the authors were as follows;<BR/>

<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> 2.0 vs 1.0 seconds. Both groups were ventilated at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (bpm). This allowed a comparison of I:E ratios (2:1 vs 1:2). IT ratios were held constant throughout whilst rates were allowed to be increased to 40 bpm to correct acidosis and hypercarbia. The range of ITs compared in this study were thus 2.0 - 1.0 (long) vs 1.0 - 0.5 (short) seconds. </LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> 1.0 vs 0.5 seconds. The ITs were held constant throughout the study period. The long IT group were ventilated at a rate of 20 - 40bpm and an IT of 1.0 seconds. The rate was increased to correct hypercarbia by reducing expiratory time. The short IT group were ventilated at a rate of 60 bpm and an IT of 0.33 seconds. Both groups were weaned by decreasing PIP and rate by increasing the expiratory time only. I:E ratios were thus not held constant.</LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> 1.0 - 0.75 vs 0.33 seconds. For the long IT group, starting rate was 30 (range 20-40) bpm using an I:E of 1:1 and IT of 1.0 seconds. Whilst weaning the IT was reduced to 0.75 seconds. Thus in the long IT group neither IT or I:E ratio were held constant. The short IT group had an IT of 0.33 seconds, starting rate of 60 bpm, fixing the I:E at 1:2. The IT and I:E ratio was constant throughout in this arm in uncomplicated cases. In the presence of severe hypoxia as defined by the authors, IT could have been increased to 0.5 seconds with the rate unchanged giving an I:E of 1:1 in the short IT group. </LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> 1.0 - 0.66 vs 0.33 seconds. For the long IT group, the starting rate was 30 bpm, an IT of 1 second with I:E of 1:1. The IT was reduced to 0.66 seconds when weaning and rate decreased by increasing expiratory time. Thus in the long IT group neither IT or I:E ratio were held constant. Infants in the short IT group were ventilated with an IT of 0.3 seconds at a rate of 60bpm, fixing the I:E at 1:2. Infants in this group were weaned by reducing PIP and PEEP until the infant was receiving endotracheal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). </LI>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> 0.7 -1.0 vs 0.5 seconds. Infants with HMD were recruited if treated with HFPPV and rate had been reduced to 60 bpm. IT for both groups was 0.5 seconds at recruitment. The long IT group were weaned (reduction of respiratory rate) by adjusting both IT and expiratory time and keeping I:E constant at 1:1.2. The IT was increased incrementally to 1.0 seconds. In the short IT group IT was held constant at 0.5 seconds and I:E was variable. Rate was gradually reduced to zero (endotracheal CPAP). A crossover to the other arm was permitted for 30 minutes when rates were weaned to 40 and 20 bpm, allowing a comparison of arterial blood gases at a given rate and I:E ratio using long and short ITs.</LI>

<I>Major Outcomes</I> The major and secondary outcomes as stated by the authors were as follows.<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> - mortality and morbidity (air leak and BPD) and the effect of two different ITs on ventilator settings (MAP, PIP, PEEP and rate compared to baseline). <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> - mortality and morbidity (air leak and BPD). This study also followed up surviving premature infants (&lt;33 weeks) recruited to assess the effect of treatment allocation on long term neurodevelopmental outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK>- the incidence of air leak following randomisation. Mortality and the incidence of BPD were recorded as secondary outcomes. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> the primary outcome was duration of weaning. Secondary outcomes included rates of air leak, death and the need for re-ventilation.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of each trial was assessed using the criteria of the Neonatal Review Group. For each trial the following were assessed: concealment of allocation schedule, inclusion in the analysis of all randomised participants and blinding of intervention and outcome measurement.</P>
<P>1. Concealment of allocation schedule<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> was a multi-centre trial in which the randomisation was adequately concealed by the use of sealed opaque envelopes held at the co-coordinating centre. Participating centres made a telephone call to the co-ordinating centre when an infant was enrolled and the next sealed envelope opened. Methods of concealing the allocation schedule were not used in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>. Lists were constructed in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> such that the numbers treated with either a long or short IT were equal after every second infant enrolled for a particular gestation. These lists were not concealed. The method used in randomising enrolled infants was not described by <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> and thus concealment of allocation was unknown.</P>
<P>Generation of allocation sequence -<BR/>This was not stated for <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> used randomisation tables divided into blocks of two for each intervention arm for each of the intended target population (under 28 weeks, 28-30 and 31-32 weeks). <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> used a coin toss to determine the treatment allocation sequence. <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> quasi-randomised enrolled infants using alternate selection for long and short ITs. The generation of allocation sequence was not stated in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK>.<BR/> <BR/>2. Inclusion in the analysis of all randomised participants<BR/>All participants were accounted for in the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> used an unusual recruitment and randomisation procedure. Consent was not obtained and all preterm infants less than 32 weeks needing mechanical ventilation were provisionally enrolled and randomised. Infants not meeting secondary enrolment criteria (FiO2 &gt; 0.4) were excluded and replaced by the next preterm infant in the same gestational age category (37 of 181 initially randomised). An additional seven infants were excluded after randomisation because they received the alternate form of therapy during transport. <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> excluded five (of 74) patients post randomisation either because of air leaks (one before randomisation, two post PDA ligation), one because of sepsis and one because of use of a muscle relaxant. The remaining three studies had no post randomisation exclusions. <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> followed a subgroup of enrolled patients (&lt;33 weeks gestation at birth) at a median age of 18 months. Of the 183 surviving eligible infants, 175 (96%) were seen. </P>
<P>3. Blinding of intervention<BR/>It was not possible to blind the caregivers in any of the studies.</P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessments<BR/>All the primary outcome assessments were unblinded in the five included studies with one exception (<LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK>), where physicians and radiologists blinded to treatment allocation diagnosed air leak and BPD. In the <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> study 98% of the long term neurodevelopmental assessments were blinded.</P>

<I>Comparison 01: Long versus short IT as defined by investigators (all trials)<BR/>
</I>
</B>
<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<I>Mortality</I> <BR/>Mortality before hospital discharge was reported in all included studies (Table 1). <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> was the only study to report mortality after hospital discharge. In this study mortality at latest follow up was 30/126 (24%) in the long IT group compared to 36/125 (29%) in the short IT group. In a pooled analysis, there was a trend toward an increased rate of mortality before hospital discharge in newborns ventilated with a long IT that reached borderline statistical significance [typical RR 1.26 (1.00, 1.59), typical RD 0.07 (0.00, 0.13)]. </P>
<P>
<I>Air Leak <BR/>
</I>The rates of air leak (acute lung injury) were reported in all included studies (table 2). The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> demonstrated statistically significant differences in this outcome disfavouring the use of a long IT. There were no significant differences in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK>, the largest individual study in this meta-analysis, reported no overall difference in the rates of air leak but when this outcome was compared within a subgroup of infants with HMD, there was a statistically significant difference favouring the use of a short IT (p= 0.013). In a pooled analysis, the use of a long IT was associated with a significantly increased rate of air leak [typical RR 1.56 (1.25, 1.94), typical RD 0.13 (0.07, 0.20), NNT 8 (5, 14)].</P>
<P>
<I>BPD (Chronic lung injury)</I>
<BR/>The rates of BPD in all included studies (Table 3) was defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 28 post natal days. None of the studies reported on this outcome at 36 weeks post conceptual age. No individual study found a significant difference in this outcome and in a pooled analysis, there was no significant difference in the rates of BPD [typical RR 0.91 (0.66, 1.24), RD -0.02 (-0.08, 0.04)]. The trend towards lower rates of BPD using a longer IT in the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> is offset by their higher rate of death. </P>
<P>For all primary outcomes there was no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0 for all outcomes)</P>
<P>
<B>Secondary Outcomes</B>
</P>
<P>
<I>Oxygenation<BR/>
</I>Improvements in oxygenation using our pre-defined criteria (AaDO2, OI, P/F ratios) were not reported when comparing IT greater than O.5 seconds with shorter IT. <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> provides data for the mean AaDO2 (SD) after 6 hours following the intervention (Table 4). At this early time point, no statistically significant differences were noted. Analysing survivors only, the AaDO2 was significantly lower at 24 and 48 hours in infants ventilated using an IT of 2 seconds versus 1 second. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy<BR/>
</I>Data on duration of ventilation in the included studies were either incomplete or presented in a format not permitting a pooled analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Pohlandt-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Pohlandt 1992</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Greenough-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Greenough 1989</LINK> did not publish sufficient data to allow a comparison between groups with respect to duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> presented data only from survivors in the first week of life and <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> excluded more than 10% of babies from the analysis of these outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> reported no significant difference between groups with respect to median age of extubation and median age at weaning from supplemental oxygen. <BR/>
<I>
<BR/>Neurological injury</I>
<BR/>No individual study reported the outcomes of IVH or PVL based on ultrasound findings. <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> reported the incidence of IVH through examination at autopsy in those who died and using computed tomography in two survivors. <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> described large IVH diagnosed at autopsy but rates of IVH in survivors was not reported. It was the intention of the <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> group to report on rates of IVH but difficulty was found in retrieving images from all the participating centres and this was replaced by long term neurodevelopmental follow up. In the available data from two trials, no significant effect on this outcome was shown (Table 6). </P>
<P>
<I>Patent ductus arteriosus<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring treatment was reported in the studies of Spahr and Pohlandt. There was a considerable difference in the rates of PDA, with Spahr (conducted in 1978) reporting an incidence of 9% in all recruited infants and Pohlandt (conducted between 1983 and 1985) reporting an incidence of 35% of all recruited infants. This probably reflects the improvements in echocardiography in the intervening period. In a pooled analysis of these two trials, no significant effect on this outcome was shown (Table 6)</P>
<P>
<I>Developmental delay</I>
<BR/>No individual study used formal psychometric testing to assess long term developmental status. The single study reporting long term outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK>) followed up surviving infants under 33 weeks gestation to a median age of 18 months. The tools used for these assessments were not stated. The outcomes reported were cerebral palsy (Table 7), sensory deficits (impaired hearing or vision; Tables 8 and 9) or global developmental delay. There was an increased rate of cerebral palsy with small numbers (12 versus 4 cases) in infants treated with long IT but this was of borderline statistical significance [RR 2.90 (0.97, 8.65), RD 0.09 (0.00, 0.17).<BR/> <BR/>

<BR/>This subgroup analysis involved all the included studies except for <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> and resulted in findings similar to the overall analysis. In a pooled analysis of four trials involving 625 infants, mortality before hospital discharge showed a trend disfavouring a long IT which did not reach statistical significance [typical RR 1.24 (0.96, -1.60), typical RD 0.06 (-0.01, 0.13)]. A long IT was associated with a significant increase in the number of air leaks [typical RR 1.56 (1.24, 1.97), typical RD 0.13 (0.07,0.20), NNT 8 (5,14)]. There was no significant difference in rates of BPD [typical RR 0.92 (0.66, 1.28)].</P>

<I>Analysis based on the overall ventilator strategy </I>
<BR/>
<I>a</I>. constant IT - only <LINK REF="STD-Heicher-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heicher 1981</LINK> maintained IT at 1.0 vs 0.5 seconds in the acute and weaning period. <BR/>

It should be noted that the ITs in these two studies are vastly different with the duration of inspiration set in the "short IT" arm of <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> equal to that set in the "long IT" arm of <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK>. With the vastly different ITs and ventilator rates and thus very different absolute ratios, a subgroup analysis of these two studies was not performed based on ventilator strategy. These two trials were combined using all enrolled infants in <LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK> and those with HMD in <LINK REF="STD-OCTAVE-1991" TYPE="STUDY">OCTAVE 1991</LINK> in a pooled analysis of infants with HMD (see below).<BR/>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The goals of mechanical ventilation are to achieve and maintain oxygenation and remove carbon dioxide whilst minimizing the risk of lung injury. These studies were performed at a time when mortality rates for ventilated infants with hypoxic respiratory failure were considerably higher than current rates (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 1999</LINK>). Major changes since their publication may reduce the applicability of the results of these meta- analyses. These changes include the routine use of antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant. The major complications of HMD seen at the time of these studies (namely hypoxia and air leak despite intervening with IPPV) have been significantly reduced by surfactant replacement therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Soll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2004</LINK>). Although both these interventions have significantly altered the treatment of HMD, the risk of mortality has been markedly reduced but has not been removed. Morbidities such as air leak and BPD continue to occur. The classical definition of BPD by <LINK REF="REF-Northway-1967" TYPE="REFERENCE">Northway 1967</LINK> was based on larger and more mature (&gt;30 weeks) newborns and has been replaced by oxygen and/or ventilator dependency at 36 weeks post conceptual age to reflect the present population of newborn infants with HMD. These extremely low birth weight, extremely premature infants continue to have significantly high rates of BPD. None of the studies in this systematic review looked at ventilatory or oxygen requirements at 36 weeks. </P>
<P>The use of long vs short ITs has not been well studied in subjects with established BPD or evolving BPD. The one study excluded from this meta- analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Nilmeier-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Nilmeier 1995</LINK>) investigated the effects of a long or short IT on subjects with BPD (more than one month of age and ventilated) and looked at pulmonary mechanics and oxygenation before and after one week of the intervention. Although a long IT improved delivered tidal volumes, no significant differences were seen in duration of ventilation or hospital stay. </P>
<P>The IT set by the attending clinician is a single parameter that can influence oxygenation. Other manipulations include providing sufficient PEEP, so that positive pressure delivered throughout the respiratory cycle is above the critical opening pressure of the lung, thus avoiding repeated inflation deflation cycles which are injurious to the lung. Gas flow rates are usually held constant and the effects of varying gas flow rates on oxygenation and BPD have yet to be investigated. Of all the included studies, only one (<LINK REF="STD-Spahr-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Spahr 1980</LINK>) provided data on the effects of IT on oxygenation in the acute phase of HMD. Whilst the study used ITs in both arms that would be considered "long", this was a study primarily comparing two I:E ratios. The improvements in oxygenation seen in inverse ratio ventilation can be attained (using the same physiological principles of alveolar recruitment and maintenance of lung volumes) if appropriate PEEP is applied throughout the respiratory cycle. The optimum level of PEEP will vary according to the underlying pulmonary pathophysiology and is yet to be evaluated in a formal clinical trial. </P>
<P>The range of ITs used in the long IT groups in this systematic review was 0.66 to 2.0 seconds. In acute HMD, where the median IT is 0.3 seconds (<LINK REF="REF-Ahluwalia-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahluwalia 1994</LINK>), these ITs are likely to cause asynchrony and patient discomfort. If these long ITs were used in surfactant treated infants, the combination of improved compliance and greater likelihood of active expiration against a positive pressure inflation may increase the risk of air leak. Thus using a long IT in acute HMD following surfactant replacement may be an unnecessary strategy unless faced with continuing severe hypoxia. In these situations there are current alternative modes of therapy to improve oxygenation if conventional ventilation is failing, including rescue high frequency ventilation and the use of inhaled nitric oxide in mature infants. Perinatal units are now widely using ventilators that synchronise with the infant's breathing and target tidal volumes. With synchronised ventilation, square wave ventilation has been replaced by sinusoidal waves so that mean airway pressures are less influenced by the length of the IT. </P>
<P>This review has shown no advantage in using long IT over short IT in the treatment of acute respiratory failure (mainly HMD). Whilst there is increasing use of non invasive ventilation such as nasal continuous positive airway pressure to avoid ventilator induced lung injury in the acute management of HMD, mechanical ventilation will continue to have a role in extremely immature infants and those with HMD complicated by apnea. In institutions where surfactant is unavailable, lengthening the IT may improve oxygenation in the acute phase. However, as compliance improves, the IT should be reviewed regularly as this review demonstrates a significant risk of lung injury (airway leak) with a long IT. The use of a long IT where time constants are longer than acute HMD such as premature infants with BPD, meconium aspiration syndrome and newborns in cardiac failure may be appropriate and is yet to be investigated. </P>
<P>Whilst neonatal respiratory failure is not a single disease entity, relatively recent advances in technology have allowed the bedside display of real time inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes. Clinicians therefore have the ability to adjust the IT as pulmonary mechanics change during the course of an infant's illness. These strategies will need to be evaluated in future clinical trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Long inspiratory times when used in acute HMD in a population not exposed to antenatal steroids and postnatal surfactant are associated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity. Stiff lungs with HMD have very short time constants. Mechanically ventilated infants with HMD and especially those treated in institutions where these adjunctive therapies are not available should be ventilated using a short IT.<BR/> </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>The availability of real time, continuous measurements of pulmonary mechanics may enhance clinicians' ability to detect the optimal IT for infants with different underlying pathologies and at different time points in their illness. Future research should examine whether new monitoring equipment and ventilator strategies, including adjusting ITs to match underlying compliance, can further reduce the harmful effects of neonatal mechanical ventilation. </P>
