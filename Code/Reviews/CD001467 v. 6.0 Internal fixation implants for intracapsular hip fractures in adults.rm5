<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-12 15:32:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many different types of implants are used to fix fractures of the hip, which are close to the hip joint (intracapsular fractures). Implants are used to stabilise the bone during healing thereby reducing the chance of the bones slipping out of line. They consist of either screws or pins and may have an additional side plate attached, which is fixed to the bone. </P>
<P>This review of randomised controlled trials included 30 studies involving more than 6000 participants. Most of the trials were poorly reported and had flaws in their methods that could have affected their results. Few trials tested the same comparison. Most of the results for the 25 separate comparisons, frequently tested within one trial only, failed to show that one implant was better than the other under comparison. There was a consistent finding of one serious complication (avascular necrosis) with the sliding hip screw in comparison with five different types of cancellous screws. However, this was not reflected in a decrease in re-operations for this group. Additionally, the sliding hip screw was found to take longer to insert and to have an increased operative blood loss compared with multiple screws or pins.</P>
<P>This review found no evidence from trials undertaken so far that there were any major differences between different implants in patient survival or complications related to the operation.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial quality, by use of an 11 item scale, risk of bias relating to sequence generation and allocation concealment, and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by implant type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped and where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed-effect model or, where there was significant heterogeneity, the random-effects model.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-13 11:34:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>There are now 30 studies involving 6334 participants (6339 fractures) included in this review, which was published in 2011. There was considerable variation in the quality of trial methodology and generally inadequate reporting of methods and trial findings. Allocation concealment was confirmed in one trial only. The main outcome measures reported were fracture healing complications, re-operations and mortality. The reporting of functional outcomes was particularly poor.</P>
<P>Few trials tested the same comparison. Most of the results for the 25 separate comparisons, frequently tested within one trial only, showed no statistically significant differences between the two implants under test. It was noted that the more rare findings of favourable results were often for implants developed within the same institutions as the trial. There was a consistent finding of less avascular necrosis with the sliding hip screw in comparison with five different types of cancellous screws but there was no significant difference found for re-operations. Additionally, the sliding hip screw was found to take longer to insert and to have an increased operative blood loss compared with multiple screws or pins.</P>

<P>No clear conclusions can be made on the choice of implant for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures from the available evidence within randomised trials.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2011-01-18 15:34:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-18 15:32:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Proximal femoral fractures or, as they are more generally termed, 'hip fractures', can be subdivided into intracapsular fractures (those occurring proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur) and extracapsular (those occurring distal to the hip joint capsule). Intracapsular fractures can be further subdivided into those which are displaced and those which are essentially undisplaced. Undisplaced fractures include those termed impacted or adduction fractures. Many other subdivisions and classification methods exist for intracapsular fractures but these have not been shown to be of reliable clinical usefulness (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Intracapsular hip fractures are generally managed surgically, either by fixing the fracture using various implants and thereby retaining the femoral head, or by replacing the femoral head with a prosthesis. The latter option is not considered in this review. The rationale for operative treatment of intracapsular fractures is to reduce the risk of the fracture displacing, for undisplaced fractures, and to maintain fracture reduction for displaced fractures. Surgery entails passing single or multiple screws or pins across the fracture site. For displaced fractures the fracture must first be reduced, which may be achieved either by an open or closed reduction.</P>
<P>Numerous implants have been developed over time for the internal fixation of the fracture. Tronzo identified over 100 in 1974 (<LINK REF="REF-Tronzo-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tronzo 1974</LINK>). These implants are inserted under X-ray guidance using either an open or percutaneous procedure. Implants may be divided into those which are smooth (pins) and those which are threaded (screws). The type of threads used on screws may vary from narrow to wide and deep. In addition, the proportion of the screw which is threaded may vary from the tip only to the entire length. The number of pins or screws inserted across the fracture can vary from one to in excess of 10, depending on the size of the implant used. Screws or pins may also be connected to a side plate which is then fixed with screws to the side of the femur. Another variation on implant design is a small metal 'tongue' which is pushed out of the tip of a nail into the subchondral bone of the femur.</P>
<P>Examples of single nails are the Smith-Petersen nail, Thornton nail and Rydell four-flanged nail. Examples of a single nail with a side plate are the Holt, Jewett nail plate, Massie nail, McLaughlin nail plate, Pugh nail and Thornton nail plate. Of these implants, the Massie and Pugh nails have the capacity for sliding at the nail/plate junction, allowing for collapse at the fracture site. Examples of a single screw with a side plate are the sliding hip screw (SHS) and equivalent models such as the Ambi, Dynamic, or Richards' screws. These implants all have the capacity for sliding at the screw/plate junction.</P>
<P>Examples of implants with a 'tongue', which can be extruded from its tip, are the Rydell four-flanged nail and Hansson pins. Examples of implants that are normally used in pairs are Garden screws, Hansson pins, Richards' screws, Tronzo (VLF) screws, Uppsala/Olmed screws, von Bahr screws, and Ullevaal screws. Examples of implants for which three are normally inserted are AO screws, Gouffon screws, Hessel pins, Mecron screws, Nystrom nails, Ullevaal screws and Scand screws.</P>
<P>The main fracture healing complication after internal fixation of an intracapsular fracture is the failure of the fracture to heal. This may lead to fracture displacement and is termed either 'early fracture displacement' or 'non-union' if it occurs in the first few weeks after operation. The term 'non-union' is also used for those fractures which fail to heal in later weeks. This normally results in the fracture displacing with loss of position of the fixation device. For this review the term non-union refers to both those fractures which show early displacement plus those which later fail to heal. An incidence of non-union of five to ten per cent can be expected following an undisplaced intracapsular fracture; this rises to about 20 to 40 per cent for displaced intracapsular fractures (<LINK REF="REF-Lu_x002d_Yao-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu-Yao 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The other main fracture healing complication is avascular necrosis (also termed segmental collapse or femoral head necrosis). This is seen as collapse of the femoral head and subsequent destruction of the hip joint. It occurs secondary to disruption of the blood supply to the femoral head. An incidence of 16 per cent for displaced intracapsular fractures has been reported (<LINK REF="REF-Lu_x002d_Yao-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lu-Yao 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other fracture healing complications that may occur are backing out of the implant as the fracture collapses, fracture below or around the implant and breakage of the implant.</P>

<P>Exploratory analysis was undertaken to combine all studies which compared three screws with two screws (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(b)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_c_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(c)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lagerby-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerby 1998</LINK>). Results as indicated in the analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-013.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.8</LINK>) show no significant difference between three or two screws except for re-operation for arthroplasty. For this outcome there was a significant reduction for the three screws (32/302 versus 52/305: RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, <LINK REF="CMP-013.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.4</LINK>). However, when those cases of non-union in <LINK REF="STD-Lagerby-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerby 1998</LINK> are considered as well, the difference in major fracture healing complications between three and two screws becomes statistically insignificant (<LINK REF="CMP-013.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.7</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Holmberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holmberg 1990</LINK> reported that a similar number of patients in each group (27/110 and 26/110) failed to return to the same residential status. <LINK REF="STD-Sernbo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sernbo 1990</LINK> also gave figures for the mean length of surgery, radiographic screening time, length of hospital stay and numbers going back to the same residential state.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Two Hansson pins versus two Uppsala screws</HEADING>
<P>Three studies compared these implants: <LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK> (179 patients, 180 fractures), <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK> (115 patients) and <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK> (100 patients). Pooled results using the random-effects model for non-union, avascular necrosis and all fracture healing complications show no significant differences between the two implants. Notably, <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK> reported a significant reduction in the incidence of non-union for those treated with the Uppsala screws (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.51 to 9.53), while the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>) found no difference between implants for the incidence of fracture healing complications. <LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK> also reported three cases of trochanteric fracture of the same hip in those treated with the Hansson pins and one case with Uppsala screws. Pooled data for mortality from two trials showed trend to lower mortality in the Hansson pin group.</P>
<P>Length of surgery reported by <LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK> was a mean of 33 minutes for the Hansson pins and 38 minutes for the Uppsala screws.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK> also reported, without figures, that at the four and 12 month follow-up there was a statistically significant increased incidence of pain (P = 0.0007 at 4 months, P = 0.007 at 12 months), failure to regain residential status (P = 0.028 at 4 months, P = 0.03 at 12 months) and reduction in mobility (P = 0.008 at 4 months, P = 0.097 at 12 months) for those treated by the Hansson pins.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK> noted there was local discomfort to lateral protrusion of the implant in six out of 96 Uppsala screw cases but in no patients of the Hansson group.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Two Hansson hook pins versus two AO screws</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Stromquist-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stromquist 1988</LINK> studied 110 cases. Follow-up of patients was for only four months and the trial methodology was poor.

However, it was reported that more patients in the Hansson pin group were scheduled for arthroplasty, such that the difference between groups for those who had re-operations and needed re-operation was not significantly different (Analysis 19.5).

<LINK REF="STD-Mjorud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mjorud 2006</LINK> studied 199 cases. Follow-up of patients was for two years. Outcomes reported and detailed in the analyses were fracture healing complications and re-operations. None of these outcomes showed any difference between groups. Mean length of surgery was 36 minutes for the Hansson pins and 40 minutes for the AO screws, a difference that was reported as not statistically significant.

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lykke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lykke 2003</LINK> compared two Hansson pins with three Ullevaal screws in 278 fractures. Results as indicated in the analyses show no significant difference in non-union, fracture healing complications, re-operations, wound infections or mortality between treatment groups. There appeared, however, a potential trend to a lower rate of avascular necrosis in the Hansson pin group. In addition the study reported there was no differences in the degree of residual pain at follow-up between groups (31% versus 23%), mean or median length of hospital stay (12 versus 10 days, 8 versus 8 days), or proportion of patients discharged to rehabilitation homes (47% versus 49%). The complication of deep vein thrombosis was similar between groups (one in each) as was that from pneumonia (one in the Hansson pin group versus three in the Ullevaal group). Fracture healing complications were more common in those cases in which drill penetration into the hip joint occurred during surgery. Drill penetration was more common in the Ullevaal screw group (7 versus 16 cases).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-12 14:52:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Thirty studies using a wide variety of orthopaedic implants were identified and included within the analysis. The methodology of the studies varied considerably and most trials scored poorly, although in some of these cases the low score may reflect a poor reporting of trial methods rather than poor trial methodology. Additionally, risk of bias assessment relating to sequence generation and allocation concealment found only six trials were at low risk of bias for the first item and only one trial at low risk of bias for the second. The main outcome measures reported were fracture healing complications, re-operations and mortality. The reporting of functional outcomes was poor and only documented in a small number of studies. The few significant differences observed after multiple analyses may have arisen by chance. Taken in conjunction with the generally low methodological quality of the studies as reported, caution needs to be adopted in drawing any definite conclusions. Most of the reported trials enrolled less than 300 participants. Thus, they were likely to be underpowered to provide evidence of significant difference between devices unless these differences had been expected to be large. Biologically or mechanically plausible differences between devices compared, and thus the hypotheses apparently being tested in the trials, were often unclear.</P>
<P>A significant potential for bias within the studies may have occurred in those centres which were evaluating an implant that was developed in their own institution, or by one of the authors of the study. The studies concerned were for Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK>), Uppsala screws (<LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehnberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rehnberg 1989</LINK>), sliding compression screw plate (<LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1984</LINK>) and Ullevaal screws (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_c_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(c)</LINK>). All these reported better outcomes for their own implants. The problems are highlighted in <LINK REF="REF-Alho-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alho 1998</LINK> who recommends that evaluation of implants by centres with a particular interest or expertise in one of the implants, is strongly prone to biases even within the context of a randomised trial. The cause for these biases is difficult to explain.</P>
<P>The conclusions for the different implants are summarised in the following.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Double divergent pins; fixed (static) nail plate; sliding compression screw plate; Hessel pins and Nystrom nails</HEADING>
<P>For all these implants, only one randomised trial was found evaluating each implant (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1989</LINK>: Nystrom nails; <LINK REF="STD-Christie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Christie 1988</LINK>: double divergent pins; <LINK REF="STD-Lindequist-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lindequist 1989</LINK>: Hessel pins; <LINK REF="STD-Svenningsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Svenningsen 1984</LINK>: fixed nail plate and sliding compression screw plate). None of these studies showed a clear difference between the implants under investigation. Therefore, no conclusions can be made for the use of these implants from the randomised trials undertaken to date.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Single Thornton nail</HEADING>
<P>This implant was found to have been evaluated in two randomised studies; one against three cancellous screws (<LINK REF="STD-Dalen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dalen 1985</LINK>) and another against a sliding nail plate (<LINK REF="STD-Frandsen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Frandsen 1981</LINK>). Both studies reported a tendency to a lower risk of fracture healing complications with the comparison implant. While there are limited data on the use of this implant, its use cannot be recommended given the tendency to inferior results in both comparisons.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sliding nail plate</HEADING>
<P>This implant has been evaluated in two randomised studies, one against a single Thornton nail (<LINK REF="STD-Frandsen-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Frandsen 1981</LINK>), where a lower rate of non-union was found for the nail plate, and the other against an SHS (<LINK REF="STD-Nordkild-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nordkild 1985</LINK>), where more patients had residual pain in the nail plate group. However, the small number of patients evaluated within these two trials means that no definite conclusions can be made regarding the use of a sliding nail plate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Rydell four-flanged nail</HEADING>
<P>This implant was found to have been evaluated in five randomised studies, two comparing against Gouffon pins (<LINK REF="STD-Elmerson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Elmerson 1988;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Wihlborg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wihlborg 1990</LINK>) and three studies comparing against Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Holmberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holmberg 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Sernbo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sernbo 1990;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK>). No difference for the incidence of fracture healing complications or mortality between groups was found. As exception was found for <LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK>, where the results favoured the Hansson pin but, as stated already, this trial is potentially biased given the implant had been developed in the same institution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Hansson hook (LIH) pins</HEADING>
<P>This implant has been evaluated in 10 randomised trials. Bias may have occurred in these studies, possibly due to greater experience with one of the implants under investigation. A strong trend to improved outcomes with the Hansson pins was found in the study from Lund, Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK>), where the pins were developed by one of the paper's authors. The study from Uppsala, Sweden (<LINK REF="STD-Holmberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holmberg 1990</LINK>) was from a unit where the Rydell nail was the implant used before the start of the study. This study showed a tendency to lower complications with the Rydell nail. A study from Uppsala (<LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK>) compared Hansson pins with Uppsala screws and found better outcomes with the latter group. The difference in results between studies may therefore be due to familiarity or special expertise with the use of one of the implants under investigation.</P>
<P>Three studies compared Hansson pins with the Rydell nail (<LINK REF="STD-Holmberg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Holmberg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sernbo-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sernbo 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK>). Although, as described above, <LINK REF="STD-Stromqvist-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Stromqvist 1984</LINK> showed better outcomes after the Hansson pins, overall there were no notable differences between implants. Three studies compared Hansson pins with Uppsala screws (<LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>), two with two AO screws (<LINK REF="STD-Mjorud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mjorud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stromquist-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stromquist 1988</LINK>), one with Ullevaal screws (<LINK REF="STD-Lykke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lykke 2003</LINK>) and two with the SHS (<LINK REF="STD-Elmerson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Elmerson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>). Overall there were no notable differences in fracture healing complications between implants.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Sliding hip screw (SHS)</HEADING>
<P>This implant has been evaluated more extensively within 11 randomised studies. <LINK REF="STD-Christie-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Christie 1988</LINK> compared the SHS with double divergent pins. There was a tendency to lower fracture healing complications after double divergent pins, but due to the low numbers of patients reported, no definite conclusions can be made about the comparison of these two implants. <LINK REF="STD-Nordkild-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nordkild 1985</LINK> compared the SHS with the sliding nail plate. Results indicated no difference in the incidence of fracture healing complications, but more patients had residual pain in the nail plate group. Two studies compared the SHS with Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Elmerson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Elmerson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>). Neither study found any significant difference in the incidence of fracture healing complications.</P>
<P>Eight studies compared the SHS with different types of cancellous bone screws (<LINK REF="STD-Benterud-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Benterud 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuokkanen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kuokkanen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ovesen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ovesen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paus-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Paus 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>). Summation of results showed an increased incidence of avascular necrosis and also a tendency to a higher fixation failure rate with the cancellous screws, although the overall re-operation rate for fixation failure did not differ between implants. Those studies that reported on operative blood loss and operative time noted an increase for the SHS. The findings of a significantly higher mortality in the SHS group of <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1992</LINK> were not found in the other five trials providing data for this outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Multiple screws</HEADING>
<P>Implants consisting of multiple screws were the most prevalent type of implant studied. Eighteen studies compared a multiple parallel screw technique against an alternative type of implant. As summarised above, for those studies that compared multiple screws against the SHS (<LINK REF="STD-Benterud-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Benterud 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuokkanen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Kuokkanen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ovesen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Ovesen 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Paus-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Paus 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>), there was no overall difference in the number of fracture healing complications between implants aside from an increased incidence of avascular necrosis for the screws, but some studies noted that the SHS fixation took longer and had an increased blood loss. For those studies, which compared parallel screws with another type of implant, no study demonstrated notable differences for these comparisons. These studies were those comparing Gouffon screws with the Rydell nail (<LINK REF="STD-Elmerson-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Elmerson 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wihlborg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Wihlborg 1990</LINK>), Uppsala/Olmed screws with Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Olerud-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Olerud 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sorensen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Sorensen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Herngren-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Herngren 1992</LINK>), AO screws with Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Mjorud-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Mjorud 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stromquist-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Stromquist 1988</LINK>), Ullevaal screws with Hansson pins (<LINK REF="STD-Lykke-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Lykke 2003</LINK>), Scand hip pins with the Thornton nail (<LINK REF="STD-Dalen-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Dalen 1985</LINK>), Scand hip pins with Nystrom nails (<LINK REF="STD-Alberts-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Alberts 1989</LINK>) and von Bahr screws with Hessel pins (<LINK REF="STD-Lindequist-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lindequist 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further five studies compared different screw types (<LINK REF="REF-Alho-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alho 1998</LINK> (<LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_a_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(a)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_b_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(b)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Alho-1998_x0028_c_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">Alho 1998(c)</LINK>); <LINK REF="STD-Lagerby-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lagerby 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lindequist-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Lindequist 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rehnberg-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Rehnberg 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Parker-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Parker 2010</LINK>). For these studies it was not possible to make any notable conclusions between the different screw types affecting the incidence of fracture healing complications. This included those studies which compared two versus three screws.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-18 11:30:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further studies are required to determine the choice of implant for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures. Future studies should be adequately powered to detect any clinically important difference between implant types; in the light of the evidence from this review, they may require recruiting thousands rather than hundreds of participants, and to be multi-centre in order to increase generalisability and avoid biases which may have arisen in the past from single centre studies. These trials should have appropriate methodology with a minimum of one year follow-up of cases and always report the results in full, even if the difference between implants is not significant. The current ongoing multi-centre FAITH trial (FAITH) does address these issues and is comparing the two most commonly used implants of the SHS and multiple screws. <BR/>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This prospective randomised trial was reported only as a conference abstract. The study compared 100 patients treated with either two Olmed screws or two Richards screws. Twenty-six patients were subsequently excluded for the operation being the wrong indication (9), died (12) or lost to follow-up (5). Follow-up was for only three months (range two to six months). No loss of fixation was reported in the undisplaced fractures. For the displaced fracture 're-dislocation' was reported in 14/29 of the Olmed screws and 23/31 of the Richard screws. The study was excluded as there was only a limited follow-up and inadequate reporting of results.</P>

<CHAR_REASON_FOR_EXCLUSION>
<P>This was a comparative study of 40 patients in which their intracapsular fracture was fixed with metallic screws and 40 patients who had their fracture fixed with three bioabsorbable screws. For undisplaced fracture non-union occurred in 5/29 and 8/29 for the bioabsorbable screws versus the metal screws. For displaced fractures non-union occurred in 6/11 cases for both groups. Walking ability and range of movement were reported to be better after the bioabsorbable fixation.<BR/>The study was excluded as there was no randomisation of patients.</P>

<P>This randomised trial reported only as a conference abstract involved 300 patients with an intracapsular fracture randomised to either the Rydell nail or three cannulated screws. After one and two years there was 'no significant difference' in the mortality, walking capacity or social rehabilitation between the two groups. Complications of displacement, avascular necrosis and pseudarthrosis occurred in 36% of the Rydell group and 30% of the cannulated screw group, with re-operations in 20% of the Rydell group and 16% of the screw group.<BR/>The study was excluded as because there was inadequate reporting of results within the conference abstract and no mention of the number of patients in each group.<BR/>
