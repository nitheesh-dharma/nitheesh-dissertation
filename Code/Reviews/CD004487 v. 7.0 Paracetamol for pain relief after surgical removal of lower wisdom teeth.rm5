<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>The surgical removal of wisdom teeth (third molars) is the most commonly performed surgical procedure undertaken in oral surgery practice. Postoperative complications may include swelling, bruising and limited mouth opening but patients are most often concerned about postoperative pain, which may be severe. Paracetamol is effective in relieving pain with a low incidence of adverse effects. It is one of the most commonly used analgesics and is widely available without prescription around the world. In this review we investigated the optimal dose of paracetamol and the optimal time for drug administration to provide pain relief after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth. The side effects of different doses of the drug were also explored. </P>
<P>Twenty-one trials (with over 2000 participants) were included. Paracetamol provided a statistically significant benefit when compared with placebo for pain relief at both 4 and 6 hours after taking the drug. It is most effective at 1000 mg dose, and can be taken at six hourly intervals without compromising safety. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group. It should be noted that most of the studies were found to have some limitations mainly due to poor reporting of information. However the review concludes that paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Paracetamol has been commonly used for the relief of postoperative pain following oral surgery. In this review we investigated the optimal dose of paracetamol and the optimal time for drug administration to provide pain relief, taking into account the side effects of different doses of the drug. This will inform dentists and their patients of the best strategy for pain relief after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of paracetamol for pain relief after surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth, compared to placebo, at different doses and administered postoperatively.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group's Trials Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE and the Current Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), to manufacturers of analgesic pharmaceuticals, we searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 24th August 2006.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised, parallel group, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trials of paracetamol for acute pain, following third molar surgery.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors, any disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary a third review author was consulted. The proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief was calculated for both paracetamol and placebo. The number of patients experiencing adverse events, and/or the total number of adverse events reported were analysed. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Twenty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2048 patients were initially enrolled in the trials (1148 received paracetamol, and 892 the placebo) and of these 1968 (96%) were included in the meta-analysis (1133 received paracetamol, and 835 the placebo). Paracetamol provided a statistically significant benefit when compared with placebo for pain relief and pain intensity at both 4 and 6 hours. Most studies were found to have moderate risk of bias, with poorly reported allocation concealment being the main problem. Risk ratio values for pain relief at 4 hours 2.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89 to 4.29), and at 6 hours 3.32 (95% CI 1.88 to 5.87). A statistically significant benefit was also found between up to 1000 mg and 1000 mg doses, the higher the dose giving greater benefit for each measure at both time points. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.</P>

<BACKGROUND>
<P>The surgical removal of wisdom teeth is the most commonly performed surgical procedure undertaken in oral surgery practice. Postoperative complications may include swelling, bruising and limited mouth opening but patients are most often concerned about postoperative pain, which may be severe. The pain experienced after oral surgery is a validated and widely used pain model for the clinical evaluation of analgesic efficacy (<LINK REF="REF-Cooper-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooper 1976</LINK>). Tissue damage produced during surgery releases chemicals that initiate inflammatory pain by activating and sensitising nerve fibre receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Loeser-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Loeser 1999</LINK>). Chemicals include bradykinin, prostaglandins, serotonin and histamine (<LINK REF="REF-Dray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dray 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a nonopioid analgesic possessing antipyretic activity and is effective in relieving pain with a low incidence of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1998</LINK>). It is one of the most commonly used analgesics and is widely available without prescription around the world. Paracetamol is often grouped with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) family, however, it is considered only to have relatively weak anti-inflammatory activity (<LINK REF="REF-Rang-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rang 2003</LINK>). NSAIDs are assumed largely to produce their analgesia as a result of the inhibition of prostaglandin production by the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (<LINK REF="REF-Malmberg-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmberg 1992</LINK>). The mechanism of action has not been fully understood. Among several theories it has been suggested that paracetamol is a selective inhibitor of the newly described COX-3 enzyme, a cyclo-oxygenase-1 variant, in the central nervous system. This inhibition could represent a primary central mechanism by which paracetamol decreases pain and possibly fever (<LINK REF="REF-Chandrasekharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chandrasekharan 2002</LINK>). Major evidence has been accumulated showing that paracetamol inhibits cyclo-oxygenase by reducing the higher oxidative state of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme, by reducing oxygen radical co-substrates (<LINK REF="REF-Aronoff-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aronoff 2006</LINK>). Paracetamol has been shown to be an effective analgesic in the control of postoperative dental pain in a number of clinical trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bentley-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Bentley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kiersch-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Kiersch 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mehlisch-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Mehlisch 1990</LINK>). Pain intensity following third molar surgery has been suggested to reach its maximum between 3 to 5 hours following surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Fisher-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fisher 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seymour-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seymour 1985</LINK>) and therefore this pain model is used to test the efficacy of a single analgesic dose.</P>
<P>A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Barden-J-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barden J 2004</LINK>) has looked at the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for postoperative pain management and has included the findings of studies involving a wide variety of types of surgery such as gynaecology surgery, abdominal surgery, orthopaedic surgery amongst others including the removal of wisdom teeth. There is some debate as to whether dental pain is different from other pain. It has been suggested that the effect of some analgesics including tramadol were worse for dental pain than for other types of postsurgical pain (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>In this review we investigated the optimal dose of paracetamol and the optimal time for drug administration to provide pain relief, taking into account the side effects of different doses of the drug. This will inform dentists and their patients of the best strategy for best pain relief after the surgical removal of wisdom teeth.</P>

<P>The titles and abstracts (when available) of all reports identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors. For studies appearing to meet the inclusion criteria, or for which there were insufficient data in the title and abstract to make a clear decision, the full report was obtained and assessed independently and in duplicate by two review authors to establish whether the studies met the inclusion criteria or not. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Where resolution was not possible, a third review author was consulted. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria then underwent quality assessment and data extracted. Studies rejected at this or subsequent stages were recorded in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table, and reasons for exclusion were recorded.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The quality assessment of the included trials was undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors based on what is written in the articles.<BR/>Only double blind trials were included in the review so blinding was not included in the quality assessment.</P>
<P>Two main quality criteria were examined.<BR/>(1) Allocation concealment, recorded as:<BR/>(A) Adequate -2 points<BR/>(B) Unclear - 1 point<BR/>(C) Inadequate - 0 points.</P>
<P>(2) Completeness of follow up (is there a clear explanation for withdrawals and drop outs in each treatment group?) assessed as:<BR/>(A) Yes - 1 point<BR/>(B) No - 0 points.</P>
<P>The agreement for the quality criteria between assessors was determined by Kappa statistics.<BR/>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories.<BR/>(A) Low risk of bias - 3 points (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) if all criteria were met.<BR/>(B) Moderate or high risk of bias - 0 to 2 points. Moderate risk of bias - plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results if one or more criteria are partly met (for example, when authors responded that they had made some attempts to conceal the allocation of patients, to give an explanation for withdrawals, but these attempts were not judged to be ideal, these criteria were categorised as 'partly'). High risk of bias - plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results if one or more criteria were not met as described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 4.2.6.</P>
<P>We also reported whether the authors of included trials have conducted a sample size calculation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>From the mean total pain relief (TOTPAR) or summed pain intensity difference (SPID) pain indices reported we computed a dichotomous outcome variable for the number of patients with at least 50% pain relief according to the methods outlined in a Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1999</LINK>). For each of the three objectives we examined the appropriateness of different continuous outcome measurements, and these were meta-analysed and reported in the final review.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, the estimate of an intervention was expressed as risk ratios together with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous outcomes, mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were used to summarise the data for each trial.</P>
<P>Clinical heterogeneity was assessed by examining the types of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study. Meta-analyses were conducted only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. Risk ratios were used to combine dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, using random-effects models. The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials was assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and any heterogeneity investigated.<BR/>Where both visual analogue scale (VAS) and categorical scales were used to measure pain intensity or pain relief or both, the categorical data were used in the meta-analysis as this was the most frequently used scale.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>For all trials it was possible to calculate the number of patients with at least 50% total pain relief (TOTPAR) at either 4 hours, 6 hours or both. Pain intensity was measured in all but one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kubitzek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubitzek 2003</LINK>), pain relief was measured in all but two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Kubitzek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubitzek 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2003</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Kubitzek-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kubitzek 2003</LINK> gave a figure for TOTPAR at six hours, and <LINK REF="STD-Seymour-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Seymour 2003</LINK> measured pain intensity only. Fifteen trials measured pain intensity at 4 hours using a 4-point categorical scale of 0 to 3, where 0 was no pain at all and 3 was severe pain. Five trials measured pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 to 100 mm where 0 was no pain and 100 was the worst pain imaginable. Twelve trials measured pain intensity at 6 hours using a 4-point categorical scale, where 0 was no pain and 3 was severe pain, and three trials measured pain intensity at 6 hours using a VAS of 0 to 100 mm, where 0 was no pain and 100 mm was the worst pain imaginable. Sixteen trials measured pain relief at 4 hours using a 5-point categorical scale of 0 to 4, where 0 was none and 4 was complete pain relief, two trials measured pain relief at 4 hours using a VAS of 0 to 100 mm, in one trial 0 was none and 100 was complete relief, and in the other trial 0 was complete relief and 100 was no relief (these data were reversed for statistical purposes). Twelve trials measured pain relief at 6 hours using a 5-point categorical scale of 0 to 4, where 0 was none and 4 was complete pain relief, two trials measured pain relief at 6 hours using a VAS of 0 to 100 mm, in one trial 0 was none and 100 was complete relief, and in the other trial 0 was complete relief and 100 was no relief (these data were reversed for statistical purposes).<BR/>Adverse events and global assessments were recorded in most of the trials. Nineteen trials reported the number of patients with side effects, eight for doses of 1000 mg or more, and 15 for doses of less than 1000 mg. Fifteen trials reported the number of adverse events, seven for doses of 1000 mg or more, and eight for doses of less than 1000 mg. Fourteen trials recorded global assessment using a 5-point categorical scale of either 0 to 4, or 1 to 5, where 0 or 1 was poor and 4 or 5 was excellent, and four trials used a 4-point categorical scale of 0 to 3, where 0 was poor and 3 was excellent.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-07-31 11:34:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results show paracetamol to be an effective analgesia for use following third molar surgery. The number needed to treat (to benefit) (NNTs) and number needed to treat to harm (NNTHs) support the use of 1000 mg as an optimal dose. It is effective over both 4 and 6 hours. In considering the use of pain relief, or pain intensity difference as a measure of efficacy it was of interest that metaregression showed that pain relief scales showed a statistically significant difference for increased dose, and pain intensity did not. It is acknowledged that this review only considered single dose studies when considering efficacy, multidosed studies may be considered when updating the review. The NNTs and NNTHs found in this review are similar to those recorded by a systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Barden-J-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Barden J 2004</LINK>) where they investigated paracetamol for pain involving various types of surgery. This would confirm yet again the value of the third molar pain model, showing that dental pain is comparable with pain from other sources. The implementation of NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) Guidelines for removal of third molars has led to a decrease in the performance of this surgery, which may have an adverse effect on the number of trials able to use the third molar model. In the United States of America such guidelines have not yet been adopted. It is of interest that in striving to provide evidence based treatment the opportunity for research using the third molar pain model may be adversely affected.</P>
<P>The data available for adverse events show that NNTH for &lt; 1000 mg of paracetamol is 33 (14.3 to infinity), for 1000 mg of paracetamol is 33 (12.5 to infinity) and for all doses 33 (14.3 to infinity), suggesting it is an extremely safe drug. Only one severe adverse event was recorded by any researchers, and that was a severe headache (<LINK REF="STD-Olson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Olson 2001</LINK>), two other participants stopped taking paracetamol because of vomiting. However there was a high degree of inconsistency across the trials in the way that adverse events were recorded, raising the concern that only adverse events considered by the researchers to be attributable to paracetamol were recorded, with some trials recording many AEs and some reporting none. The diverse way in which adverse events were recorded led to there being over 20 categories of adverse events. The main categories are shown in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-21" TYPE="TABLE">Table 21</LINK>. Of interest are adverse events where placebo scored more highly than paracetamol, which could suggest that paracetamol may possibly have a beneficial effect eg dry socket, but this would require further investigation. As all patients had surgery, and various combinations of local anaesthesia, general anaesthesia, and sedation making it difficult to ascertain which effects are directly related to the intervention. However the results strongly support the use of paracetamol in doses up to 1000 mg as a safe effective analgesia.</P>
<P>The efficacy of paracetamol decreases with times, and the recommended interval between doses is 8 hours, which would suggest there may be some benefit in a slow release formulation. None of the studies in this trial used a slow release formulation, but a trial (<LINK REF="REF-Coulthard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coulthard 2001</LINK>) compared sustained release and standard release formulations of paracetamol and found that the sustained release was statistically significantly more effective at 6 and 8 hours, with no loss of efficacy at 4 hours. Safety for both formulations was comparable, making sustained release paracetamol a safe and effective choice.<BR/>
<BR/>The methodology used in the included trials was generally good. This resulted in a large number of participants being included in this meta-analysis, while using only<I> </I>double blind randomised trials. The included trials gave a strong, consistent result. Many of the trials were done by researchers with extensive experience in the field of pain research, whose methods have been refined with experience. A large proportion of the trials were done in the United States, and were mostly funded by pharmaceutical companies. This seems to be reflected in the methodology. However, quality assessment showed, there were only three trials with a low risk of bias, and 18 with moderate/high risk. This was mainly the result of unreported allocation concealment methods. In speaking to some of the authors it is highly likely that the allocation concealment was good in all the trials, but that the details were not well reported. Most trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies who supplied paracetamol and placebo in identical appearance. The reporting of withdrawals and drop outs was sporadic, and even when numbers were cited it was not always clear to which treatment group the participant had been originally allocated.</P>
<P>Mean global assessments (Additional <LINK REF="TBL-13" TYPE="TABLE">Table 13</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-14" TYPE="TABLE">Table 14</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-15" TYPE="TABLE">Table 15</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-16" TYPE="TABLE">Table 16</LINK>) all showed higher scores for paracetamol than placebo. It is of interest that despite achieving 50% pain relief participants did not record 50% on a global assessment scale. This again raises the question of the value of the instruments used to measure the efficacy of an intervention. None of the trials relied on global assessments as their only measure of efficacy, but this information could be of value to other researchers. It raises interesting questions concerning patient's expectations and the difficulties associated with quantifying such a subjective experience.</P>
<P>A lot of valuable information was gathered, incidental to the main findings, in most of the trials. So though the topic was concerned with the use of paracetamol for pain, information collected in many of the trials shed valuable light on subjects such as side effects, measuring instruments, and methodology. Further appraisal of the multidisciplinary approach to research, a broader view of data collection, and a more accurate reporting of data already collected could be extremely valuable in the future. It would allow research to be more widely used in various meta-analyses. Data from areas seemingly unrelated to the original null hypothesis, eg comparison of pain relief and pain intensity as a measuring tool, adverse event reporting, the significance of global assessments etc. could be more readily available. If the third molar trial population does decrease it would be advantageous to collect as much data as possible from any trial being undertaken.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an effective drug to use for postoperative pain following oral surgery, and the reporting of adverse events shows it to be a safe drug (number needed to treat (to benefit) (NNT) is 3 for 1000 mg of paracetamol at 6 hours, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33). It is most effective at 1000 mg dose, and can be taken at six hourly intervals without compromising safety. It could be considered more readily by dentist and patients both as a first choice analgesic, or to be taken alternately with doses of other analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a large body of research in this area, and further research, other than as a comparison seems unnecessary. However, in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Moller-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Moller 2000</LINK>) it was found that an effervescent formulation appeared to have a faster onset of pain relief, which would be beneficial to patients who are looking for a rapid onset of relief. It may be helpful to undertake some research to confirm these findings. The use of pain relief and pain intensity difference as a measure of pain relief may be another area for further investigation. It is valuable to have NNT/NNTH as a baseline for comparison with other analgesics. Maximizing the third molar pain model population by multidisciplinary research is another area of interest highlighted by this review. <BR/> </P>
