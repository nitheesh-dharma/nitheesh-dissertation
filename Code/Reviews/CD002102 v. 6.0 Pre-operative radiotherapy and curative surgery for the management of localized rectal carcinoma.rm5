<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Optimal preoperative radiotherapi for localized rectal cancer provide a modest improvement in overall survival, definite improvement in local recurrences, modest increase in the proportion of patients undergoing curative surgery, but is also accompanied by an increase in acute and late rectal and sexual function compared with surgery alone. A combination chemoradiotherapy provides further improvement in local recurrence.<BR/>Surgery (i.e. mesorectal excision) is the mainstay of therapy for resectable rectal cancers. This review examines the value of preoperative radiotherapy, and include nineteen randomized trials comparing preoperative radiotherapy with surgery alone. <BR/>Preoperative radiotherapy is effective in improving local control. It provides only a marginal benefit in cure rate, and does not improve the likelihood of avoiding a permanent colostomy. It is associated with an increase risk of wound infections following surgery, and long term effect on rectal and sexual function. <BR/>Nine trials compared preoperative radiotherapy with other strategies. The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy provides even better local control but did not increase the likelihood of cure or the ability to avoiding a permanent colostomy. </P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) has become part of standard practice offered to improve treatment outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine if PRT improves outcome for patients with localized resectable rectal cancer and how it compared with other adjuvant or neoadjuvant strategies.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>A computerized search was performed December 2006 on MEDLINE (from 1966 to December 2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), conference proceedings, using MeSH and textwords where appropriate to identify randomized trials in PRT and rectal cancer. In addition, MetaRegister of Clinical Trials was searched for ongoing trials. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomized trials with a PRT arm versus surgery alone, or other neoadjuvant or adjuvant (NA/A) strategies, targeted patients with localized rectal cancer planned for radical surgery were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Trials were selected, data extracted and quality assessed by 2 authors. Quality was assessed using a 14 point checklist. Summary statistics included Hazard ratios and variances (for the outcomes: overall (OA) mortality, cause specific (CS) mortality, any recurrence and local recurrences (LR)) and Odds Ratio (OR) for other outcomes. Potential sources of heterogeneity hypothesized a priori included study quality, biological effective dose (BED), radiotherapy RT technique, and total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nineteen trials compared PRT versus surgery alone. Overall (OA) mortality was marginally improved HR 0.93 [95% CI -0.87-1](absolute difference is 2% if the expected survival rate is 60%). Local recurrence (LR) was improved but the magnitude of benefit was heterogeneous across trials. Sensitivity analyses suggested greater benefits in patients treated with BED&gt;30Gy<SUP>10</SUP> and multiple field RT techniques. There was significantly more pelvic or perineal wound infection, late rectal and sexual dysfunction.</P>
<P>Nine trials compared PRT vs. other NA/A. Available evidence did not support an OA mortality or sphincter preserving benefit with the use of combined chemoradiotherapy (CRT) or selective postoperative RT. CRT provides incremental benefit for local control compared with PRT, which was independent of the timing of the CT. There was no significant difference in outcome for different intervals between RT and surgery (2 vs. 8 wk). Dose escalation with endocavitary boost showed significant effect on sphincter preservation. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Optimal PRT improves LR, OA mortality, but no increase in sphincter sparing procedure. CRT further increases local control. If the objective is to increase the incidence of sphincter sparing surgery, endocavitary boost showed the most promise. Strategies with the potential to improve outcomes, especially OAS and spincter sparing while reducing acute and late toxicities (rectal and sexual function) are needed to guide future strategy designs. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Carcinoma of the rectum is a common malignancy, especially in developed countries. Together with malignant tumors affecting the colon, colorectal cancer rank as the third most common cancer in the world. With the exception of very early tumors that can be managed by local excision alone, the main stay of therapy for rectal cancer is radical surgery. Total mesorectal excision has emerged as the surgical technique that can substantially reduce local recurrences. However, the risk of distant and local recurrences continue to threaten patients with rectal cancer. </P>
<P>Radiotherapy (RT) alone is capable of eradicating some localized rectal tumors while its effect on larger tumors is limited by normal tissue tolerance, tumor sensitivity and microscopic spread beyond the primary site (<LINK REF="REF-Cummings-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cummings 1982</LINK>). The addition of radiation to surgery has been successfully used in many disease sites, including breast and lung (<LINK REF="REF-EBCTCG-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">EBCTCG 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ragaz-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ragaz 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weisenburger-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weisenburger 1986</LINK>). Preoperative radiotherapy has potential advantages over postoperative radiotherapy. It can potentially downstage tumors to facilitate surgery, reduce the risk of tumor seeding, problems with hypoxia which is increased postoperatively, allowing more optimal tumor cell kill for equivalent doses compared to postoperative radiotherapy. (<LINK REF="REF-Perez-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perez 1992</LINK>). Preoperative radiotherapy and radical surgery have been explored by many investigators through randomized clinical trials in patients with resectable localized rectal carcinoma. The current review will provide an ongoing summary, periodically updated, on the role of preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer, including comparisons with other neoadjuvant or adjuvant approaches through a systematic review of all relevant randomized trials.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to determine if preoperative radiotherapy when added to surgery improves the outcome of patients with localized resectable carcinoma of the rectum when compared with surgery alone. The secondary objectives were to determine which treatment characteristics are associated with the most significant benefit, and how preoperative radiotherapy compares with other adjuvant or neoadjuvant strategies.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Study selection was based on the need to identify studies that compared the intervention of interest, i.e. 1). Preoperative radiotherapy and surgery versus surgery alone, and 2). Preoperative radiotherapy versus other neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with surgery. The use of other modalities, such as chemotherapy, was permitted if this was employed uniformly across both arms. If the chemotherapy was employed only in the study arm, the study was excluded.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies designed for patients of any age with a localized resectable carcinoma of the rectum were included. The accuracy in metastatic disease was excluded preoperatively was dependent on the staging workup specified within the protocol. This varied with the era in which the study was being conducted. CT scans became part of routine clinical practice only in more recent studies. The types of staging work up that were used by individual studies, and the proportion of patients found intraoperatively to have metastastic disease were examined. Studies that included both colon and rectal cancer, with no subgroup results for the rectal cancer subgroup only were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Radiotherapy<BR/>Radiotherapy has evolved over the years, with refinements of radiotherapy techniques (multiple beam arrangement targeting posterior pelvis, versus 2 field arrangements to pelvis +/- paraaortics), and variations on dose fractionations. The effect of these factors were explored through subgroup /sensitivity analysis.</P>
<P>Surgery<BR/>Only studies where the intended surgery was radical (e.g. Hartmann procedure, anterior resection or abdominal perineal resection) were included. Total mesorectal excision (TME) has been increasingly incorporated into clinical practice and trials with expected reduction in local recurrence rates, but potentially greater risk of anastomotic leaks (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wiig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiig 1998</LINK>). Subgroup analyses to examine the impact of TME were performed. Studies where the intended surgery was local resection were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome of interest was overall mortality. A total of 13 secondary outcomes were examined. These included cause specific mortality, any recurrence, local recurrence, probability of downstaging (pathological stage distribution), overall resectability, curative resectability, sphincter sparing resections, acute radiotherapy toxicities, operative morbidity and perioperative mortality (90 day mortality rate), late toxicities, functional outcome, quality of life, compliance to the assigned therapy. No attempt was made to obtain individual patient data (IPD) from the primary authors. IPD was published by the CCCG (<LINK REF="STD-CCCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CCCG 2001</LINK>) for overall mortality, providing a more accurate and longer term data than available through the published literature. A separate analysis as discussed under statistical considerations was included. </P>
</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P> Reports were identified by several methods. A computerized search, utilizing a combination of MeSH headings, subject headings and textwords was employed (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1993</LINK>). This would be performed on MEDLINE and CANCERLIT (OVID) databases, from 1966 to Dec 2006 with the following search strategy:<BR/>1. exp clinical trials/<BR/>2. random allocation/<BR/>3. double -blind method/<BR/>4. single blind method/<BR/>5.

<P>We also searched the conference proceedings from ASCO, ESTRO, ASTRO, ECCO (where this was available electronically) and the Cochrane Central Database of of Controlled Trials. Additional reports were identified through references cited in relevant reviews, trial reports, and personal files. An additional search for ongoing trials was performed using MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com).</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<U>Article selection, data extraction and quality assessment</U>
<BR/>Eligibility of the retrieved articles was assessed through the title and abstracts. Where there was insufficient information for assessment, the full articles were reviewed. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. There was no blinding of the reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus. </P>
<P>
<U>Special consideration for radiotherapy dose fractionation</U>
<BR/>The concept of biological effective dose (BED) (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>) was used to facilitate comparison between regimen. BED was calculated using the following equation:</P>
<P>BED = nd (1+d/a/b) - &#947;/&#945; (T-T<SUB>k</SUB>)</P>
<P>Where BED = biological effective dose (in Gy10)<BR/>n = number of fractions<BR/>d = dose per fraction (in Gy)<BR/>a/b = 10 for tumour and acute reacting tissues, and 3 for late reacting tissues<BR/>&#947;/&#945; = repair rate, set at 0.6Gy/d<BR/>T = Total treatment time (in days)<BR/>T<SUB>k </SUB>= Delay time (in days), = 7 </P>
<P>While this measure was a continuous variable, the classification of dose fractionation regimen into higher versus lower doses was used for our analyses. Duncan et al (<LINK REF="REF-Duncan-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duncan 1987</LINK>) cited 34.5Gy in 15fr as the cut off point in this review. (BED= 42.4 Gy <SUP>10</SUP>). Bosset et al (<LINK REF="REF-Bosset-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bosset 1993</LINK>) found a total dose of 25Gy as the optimal cut off point in this review. (BED =37 Gy <SUP>10</SUP>).Glimelius et al (<LINK REF="STD-Glimelius-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Glimelius 1997</LINK>) found a clear effect for dose fractionations with a BED 30, and 37.5Gy<SUP>10</SUP>. Given these considerations, we used BED =30 Gy <SUP>10</SUP> to divide studies into lower versus higher doses for subgroup /sensitivity anlayses. </P>

</U>
<I>
<U>Preoperative RT versus surgical studies</U>
</I>
<U>
<BR/>
</U>For quantitative analyses to be undertaken, the data across trials has to be considered homogeneous (asking the same question within a similar population). This was evaluated through standard methods . Homogeneity of the results for the various endpoints of interest was explored using L'Abbe's (<LINK REF="REF-L_x0027_Abb_x00e9_-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">L'Abbé 1987</LINK>) visual plot and through formal statistical testing. The most significant factors contributing to heterogeneity were postulated a priori as follows. <BR/>1. Quality of studies<BR/>2. Radiotherapy biological effective dose (BED) (less than 30Gy<SUP>10</SUP> versus equal to or greater than 30 Gy<SUP>10</SUP>)<BR/>3. Contemporary radiotherapy treatment volume (&gt;2 field beam arrangement and confined to the pelvis) <BR/>4. Type of surgery (Total mesorectal excision versus others)</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses were conducted for two reasons. First, if heterogeneity was observed. Sensitivity analysis explores whether any of the above factors can account for heterogeneity in outcome across the studies, and identify subgroups where the data is more homogeneous. Second, it serves to examine how robust the results were to changes in the review methods. (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>). Where there was heterogeneity in the data, the degree of interaction between the factors explore using the sensitivity analyses and the outcomes were calculated (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Third, no individual patient data was obtained directly for this review. The Colorectal Cancer Collaborative Group (<LINK REF="STD-CCCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CCCG 2001</LINK>) reported Hazard ratio and variance obtained through individual patient data obtained from the primary investigators. These results provided a more accurate measure of treatment effect when compared with published data since the former was centrally audited and updated to the latest available follow up. A second analysis was therefore performed using the CCCG reported Hazard ratio and variance, for the included studies where data was available, to examine the effect on the results. </P>
<P>Subgroup analyses refer to planned analyses by different patient subgroups. In our review, we hypothesized there was a strong likelihood that different radiotherapy dose fractionation, volume of radiotherapy ("contemporary RT volume" versus others) and type of surgery (mesorectal excisions vs. no TME) have different effect and toxicity outcomes. Subgroup analyses for these factors were planned to provide an estimate of treatment effect for different subgroups. (<LINK REF="REF-Oxman-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxman 1992</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<I>
<U>Preoperative RT vs other studies</U>
</I>
<BR/>Due to the fact that several different trial designs, asking different questions on the application of preoperative radiotherapy, and the small number of trials within each category of studies, no attempt to quantitatively summarize results across these trials were made within this version of the review. It is noted that a separate Cochrane review is under preparation comparing preoperative XRT with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Ceelen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceelen 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<U>Statistical considerations</U>
<BR/>Outcomes including overall mortality, cause specific mortality, any recurrence, and local recurrence were compared using reported, or estimated hazard ratio and its variance (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>For each outcome of interest, where appropriate, pooled data was presented with an assessment of the chi square test for homogeneity, how many studies had data available followed by the summary statistic with 95%CI. If the difference was statistically significant, for Hazard Ratios, an estimate of the effect of the event rates for selected time points (e.g. 1, 5, 10 years) were calculated to provide estimates of the magnitude of effect where appropriate. To do this, a representative control outcome event rate over time need to be selected. The largest study with long term follow up for the outcome in question was used. The absolute benefit is calculated by: </P>
<P>Absolute difference = Exp [ln (% survival, time t) x HR] (% survival, time t).</P>
<P>The Hazard Ratio and variance corresponding to the published survival data was used. Where this was not directly available from the paper, it was estimated using log rank p value , number randomized, events, or survival curves where available. An excel spreadsheet developed by Matthew Sydes (Cancer Division) in collaboration with the Meta-analysis Group of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit, London was used to faciliate this. The individual patient data outcome in RevMan was used to handle the Hazard Ratio. The number of events (n) entered into the metaview tables were the number surviving at the end of the follow up period as published. The Hazard ratios appear under "Peto OR (IPD)", the default label applied by the Review Manager analyses software.</P>
<P>For other outcomes, odds ratio (with 95% confidence interval), pooled using the random effects model (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1996</LINK>) was used for the analyses. Where appropriate, the "number needed to treat" (NNT) and "number needed to harm" (NNH) was calculated to represent the effectiveness of this strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McQuay-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">McQuay 1997</LINK>). In other words, the number of patients who need to be treated with the study intervention (preoperative radiotherapy and surgery) for 1 patient to experience benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) when compared to the control arm (surgery alone). This was only appropriate for the outcome 'acute postoperative morbidity' (see Comparison 01:16). <BR/>

<U>SEARCH RESULTS</U>
<BR/>Between 1966 and December 2006, six systematic reviews (<LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Camma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camma 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CCCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CCCG 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Glimelius-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glimelius 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ooi-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ooi 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Twomey-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Twomey 1989</LINK>) and one treatment guideline based on a systematic review (<LINK REF="STD-Figueredo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Figueredo 2003</LINK>) were identified. The studies included in these reviews varied as a result of the focus of the review, the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, search strategy, time frame the search was conducted, and in some cases, the interpretation of the authors as to how well the study design corresponded to their preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> outline a comparison of all the articles included in each of these reviews.Twomey et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Twomey-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Twomey 1989</LINK>) concluded that adjuvant radiotherapy dose not improve survival, but can provide a reduction of up to 40% in local recurrence rates with doses of 30Gy or more. Ooi et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Ooi-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Ooi 1999a</LINK>) concluded that the morbidity and mortality of preoperative radiotherapy was higher in the elderly and with older radiotherapy techniques (2 portals rather than 3 or 4). Camma et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Camma-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Camma 2000</LINK>) concluded that preoperative radiotherapy significantly improved overall and cancer-specific survival compared with surgery alone. However, the magnitude of benefit is relatively small and criteria are needed to identify patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. The Colorectal Cancer Collaborative Group (<LINK REF="STD-CCCG-2001" TYPE="STUDY">CCCG 2001</LINK>) concluded preoperative radiotherapy, at biologically effective doses &#8805;30Gy, reduced the risk of local recurrence and death from rectal cancer. Short preoperative RT schedules seem to be at least as effective as longer (including postoperative schedules). Figueredo et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Figueredo-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Figueredo 2003</LINK>) concluded that preoperative radiotherapy is an acceptable alternative to the standard practice of postoperative radiotherapy for patients with stage II and III respectable rectal cancer. Both preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy decreased local recurrence but neither improves survival as much as postoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Therefore, if preoperative radiotherapy is used, chemotherapy should be added postoperatively, at least for patients with stage III disease. Glimelius et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Glimelius-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glimelius 2003</LINK>) provided a summary of the conclusions after updating the data that was originally included in the report by the Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care. The conclusions included that 1. There was a strong evidence that preoperative radiotherapy can improve survival (by about 10%) and is more effective than postoperative; 2. At biologically effective doses of &gt;30Gy, it reduces the relative risk of a local failure by 50-70%; 3. This effect is preserved even in patients receiving TME (decreased from 8% to 2% after 2 years); 4.The literature is inconclusive as to its effect on increasing sphincter preserving surgery in low-lying tumors. Bujko et al. (<LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2006b</LINK>) concluded there is no evidence that preoperative RT+/-CT increases the likelihood of shincter sparing procedures. </P>
<P>1753 citations were identified through our electronic search (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Initial screening of the titles and abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 1619 citations. A further 134 citations were excluded after detailed screening of full articles. These included six systematic reviews described above, 52 secondary references to included primary references and 76 non RCTs or RCTs not relevant to the current review (See characteristics of excluded studies). Ninety citations reporting on 28 unique studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria and formed the basis of this review. </P>
<P>Nineteen studies (67 citations; 19 primary and 48 secondary citations) addressed preoperative radiotherapy versus surgery alone, and nine studies (23 citations; i.e. 9 primary and 4 secondary citations) compared preoperative radiotherapy with surgery with other neoadjuvant or adjuvant strategies formed the basis of this review. Of the 9 studies comparing preoperative XRT and surgery and other neoadjuvant or adjuvant strategies, these can be broadly classified into 4 different groups.

<U>STAGING WORK UP</U>
<BR/>Of the 19 preoperative RT vs. S studies, only 1 study described the use of abdominal ultrasound in some patients (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1990</LINK>), while none of the remaining studies provided any specifications as to how intra-abdominal metastatic disease was to be identified prior to study enrolment. In terms of chest imaging, only 2/19 preoperative RT vs. S included chest XR as part of the staging workup (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1990</LINK>). Ten studies provided data on the proportion of patients with metastatic disease at the time of laparotomy (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Illenyi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Illenyi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kligerman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kligerman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Reis-Neto-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reis Neto 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rider-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rider 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>). This ranged from 1% (<LINK REF="STD-Illenyi-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Illenyi 1994</LINK>) to 38% (<LINK REF="STD-Kligerman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kligerman 1972</LINK>) in the control arms. With the exception of one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Kligerman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kligerman 1972</LINK> )(6/16 (38%) RT arm and 1/15 (7%) S alone arm), this was generally well balanced between the study arms.</P>
<P>Of the 9 other neoadjuvant vs. preoperative RT studies, details around the 3 studies presented in abstract form were not available. Four studies used CXR, and either ultrasound and or computerized tomography as part of the staging workup.

<P>
<U>CRITERIA USED TO DEFINE RECTAL CANCER</U>
<BR/>The definition used to define rectal cancer is important to confirm the included patients share a similar pattern of recurrence. For the preoperative RT versus surgical studies, three studies used below the sacral promontory (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>), 1 used below the pelvic brim (<LINK REF="STD-Rider-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rider 1977</LINK>), 3 stated rectal cancer but provided no additional criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Kligerman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kligerman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-You-1993" TYPE="STUDY">You 1993</LINK>), 1 used the requirement of abdominal perineal resection (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 1986</LINK>), while the others used used a defined distance from the anal verge ranging from 12cm (<LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1994b</LINK>), 13cm (<LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1994</LINK>), 14cm (<LINK REF="STD-Reis-Neto-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Reis Neto 1989</LINK>) and 15cm (<LINK REF="STD-Boulis-Wassif-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Boulis Wassif 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>), within 16cm (llenyi 1994). In 2 studies no details were provided (<LINK REF="STD-Kimura-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Kimura 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>For the preoperative RT versus neoadjuvant/adjuvant studies, a criterion for the inferior edge of tumor was used. Palpable on digital examination (<LINK REF="STD-Glehen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glehen 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2005</LINK>) within 6cm (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2004</LINK>), 15cm (<LINK REF="STD-Boulis_x002d_Wassif-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Boulis-Wassif 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CR07-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CR07 2006</LINK>), no additional criteria in one (<LINK REF="STD-Frykholm-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Frykholm 1993</LINK>). In the study specifically examining the effect of neoadjuvant therapy and sphincter sparing procedure for "ultra-low rectal carcinomas", the criterion of &lt;2cm from the levator ani was used( <LINK REF="STD-Rouanet-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouanet 2006</LINK>), where the standard surgery of AP resection is expected. </P>
<P>
<U>TOTAL MESORECTUM EXCISION AS PART OF THE STUDY REQUIREMENT</U>
<BR/>In the preoperative RT versus surgical studies, only 1 study specifically required total mesorectal excision (<LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>) although it was possible that TME were included as part of the standard practice within these trials. In contrast, for the preoperative RT versus other neo-ajduvant studies, four studies required total mesorectal excision (<LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CR07-2006" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CR07 2006</LINK>), and recommended in one (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2005</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rouanet-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouanet 2006</LINK> recommended interspincteric resections to preserve anal sphincter where possible, in addition to resection of the mesorectum. </P>
<P>
<U>STAGE DISTRIBUTION</U>
<BR/>The distribution of disease across the stage would have an impact on the magnitude of benefit from the study, especially in local recurrence rate and mortality, when earlier stage disease is expected to have less likely to have an adverse outcome. In the preoperative RT versus surgical studies, generally any patients with resectable disease were eligible. The average proportion of patients with stage A (Dukes' A) disease in the control arm was 17% with a range of 0.7% (<LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1990</LINK>) to 37% (<LINK REF="STD-Rider-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Rider 1977</LINK>). In the preoperative RT versus other neo-adjuvant studies, three studies ( <LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2005</LINK>) patients were limited to T3-4, and in one ( <LINK REF="STD-Rouanet-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouanet 2006</LINK> ) to ultrasound defined T2-3 disease only. The proportion of patients with stage A disease in the control arm were similar ranging from 7% in <LINK REF="STD-Frykholm-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Frykholm 1993</LINK> to 23% <LINK REF="STD-Boulis_x002d_Wassif-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Boulis-Wassif 1984</LINK> in the studies where all resectable disease were permitted.</P>

<I>Preoperative RT versus other neoadjuvant studies<BR/>
</I>For the 9 preoperative RT vs. other neoadjuvant studies, the studies each asked a different type of question to address:</P>
<P>For the group of studies comparing Preoperative RT versus Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy studies, similar, if not identical biological doses were compared with or without chemotherapy preoperatively. Boulis Wassif (<LINK REF="STD-Boulis_x002d_Wassif-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Boulis-Wassif 1984</LINK>) compared 34.5 Gy in 15 fr (BED 32.9Gy ) with the same RT with 5FU Dy 1-4. Bosset (<LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>) compared 45Gy in 25 fr (BED 32.5Gy<SUP>10</SUP>) with various strategies of adding 5FU. Arm A was preoperative RT alone. Arm B included preoperative 5FU LV, Arm C post op 5FU LV, Arm D included concurrent CT plus post op 5FU LV. Bujko (<LINK REF="STD-Bujko-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bujko 2004</LINK>)compared 25 Gy in 5 fraction ( BED 39.1Gy) versus 50.4Gy in 28 fractions (40.9Gy) with 5FU leucovorin weeks 1 &amp; 5. Gerard ( <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2005</LINK>) compared the same preoperative regimen of 45Gy in 25 fr with 5FU chemotherapy wks 1 and 5, GRECCARI ( <LINK REF="STD-Rouanet-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rouanet 2006</LINK>) compared 45Gy plus 18 Gy with 45Gy plus 5FU continuous infusion. </P>

<P>For the one study that compared Preoperative RT (short interval) versus Preoperative RT (long interval) 39Gy in 13 fr was delivered followed by surgery either within 2 weeks or 6-8 weeks thereafter (<LINK REF="STD-Glehen-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Glehen 2003</LINK>). </P>
<P>For the study comparing lower versus higher preoperative doses, Gerard (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2004</LINK>) compared 39Gy in 13 fr against the same radiotherapy with endocavitary boost of 35-20-20 Gy on Days 1-8-21, plus an optional brachytherapy boost of 25 Gy in 24-36 hours. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Each report was scored for quality by two of the authors using a 14 point checklist by <LINK REF="REF-Detsky-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Detsky 1992</LINK>. Where discrepancy occured, this was resolved by consensus. The quality scores generated were used for sensitivity analysis only but not to weight the results in generating summary statistics. The range of quality score was 0.29 to 0.88 (max 1). The effect of quality was examined through sensitivity analysis using overall mortality (Comparison 11, Outcome 05). Quality score was entered into "order". When the data was sorted by order, there were no obvious relationship between the Hazard ratio and the quality score. </P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The reader is reminded that the MRC 1984a study (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984a</LINK>) was a three arm study comparing a surgery only control arm, single fraction preoperative radiotherapy and surgery, versus multi-fraction preoperative radiotherapy and surgery. In presenting the results in the Tables for comparison, the control arm was entered for each of these labelled as MRC 1984a for the single arm study, and MRC 1984 (Multi frc) (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984-_x0028_Multi-frc_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984 (Multi frc)</LINK>) for the multifraction regimen. The Swedish RCT 1997 (<LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>) incorporated part (316) of the patients that were previously included in Stockholm II (<LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>). By including both studies in our analysis, these 316 patients would have been accounted for twice in our analysis. In addition, in the preoperative versus other neoadjuvant comparisons, Bosset et al employed a 4-arm 2x2 factorial design, although the data was not involved in the quantiative analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>The results are presented separately for the group of studies comparing preoperative radiotherapy with surgery alone, and preoperative radiotherapy versus surgery with other adjuvant or neoadjuvant approaches.</P>

<U>OVERALL MORTALITY</U>
<BR/>The pooled data reached borderline significance in support for survival advantage in favor of preop RT. with a HR 0.93 [95% 0.87-1] (Homogeneity Chi sq. p = 0.15)(14 studies) (Comparison 01: 01). When using the CCCG data from individual patient data analysis, the pooled HR was not statistically significant 0.95 [95% 0.89-1.02](Comparison 01: 02). The magnitude of survival benefit was modest. Using the overall mortality curve from the single largest study in our analysis with 8 year long term follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>) to calculate the magnitude of benefit, this will translate into a 2% survival improvement (from 75% to 77%) at 5 years and a 2% survival improvement (from 60% to 62%) at 8 years. Subgroup analysis would suggest non TME studies HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.86-0.99), higher BED HR 0.91 (90% CI 0.84-0.98), and treatment fields focused to the posterior pelvis HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.95), showed a significant benefit (Comparison 11:02-03).</P>

<BR/>The pooled Hazard Ratio (5 studies) (<LINK REF="STD-Marsh-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marsh 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984-_x0028_Multi-frc_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984 (Multi frc)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>) was significant in favour of preoperative radiotherapy 0.87 (95% CI 0.78-0.98) (Comparison 01: 03). However, the small number of studies and the borderline homogeneity (p=0.07) would suggest the data should be examined cautiously. Unfortunately, sensitivity analysis cannot be performed given the small number of studies available. Swedish RCT reported cause specific data for curatively resected patients only, which were not included in the analysis. (<LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>). </P>

<U>ANY RECURRENCE</U> <BR/>The pooled Hazard Ratio was 0.89 (0.82-0.97) (8 comparisons) (Homogeneity Chi sq. p = 0.44) suggesting an overall reduction of recurrences in favour of preoperative radiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerard-1988a" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 1988a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1994b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kligerman-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kligerman 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984-_x0028_Multi-frc_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984 (Multi frc)</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984a</LINK>) (Comparison 01, Outcome 04). Using the recurrence free data from Cedemark (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>) (the largest study with available data), this will translate into a modest improvement of 2% in recurrence free survival (75% to 77%) at 2 years, and 4% (60% to 64%) at 5 years. </P>
<P>
<U>LOCAL RECURRENCE </U>
<BR/>There were obvious differences in the recurrence rates in the control arms, ranging from 11% (<LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>) to 54% (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-1996" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1996</LINK>). All but one study (MRC 1984 multi frc, <LINK REF="STD-MRC-1984a" TYPE="STUDY">MRC 1984a</LINK>) showed a benefit in local recurrence in favor of preoperative radiotherapy. Data was heterogeneous across the available studies (p&lt;0.05) indicating differences in the magnitude of effect across the studies. The absolute rate of local recurrence in the control group was variable across the studies. The pooled Hazard ratio was 0.71 (95% CI 0.64- 0.78) (Comparison 01:04).</P>
<P>When the data was explored based on potential factors that may be sources of heterogeneity, all the radiotherapy characteristics showed an interaction with local recurrence (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Patients on studies using RT volume (&gt;2 field confined to the pelvis) (HR 0.49 [95% 0.41-0.58], 5 studies, test for heterogeneity p = 0.03) (Comparison 12: 03) have a greater effect than those using parallel pair arrangement (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.75-0.96], 8 comparisons). Studies using a higher biological effective dose (BED &gt;30Gy<SUP>10</SUP>) has greater benefit (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0.44-0.57](8 studies) then those using doses &lt;30Gy<SUP>10</SUP> (HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.89-1.18], 4 comparisons) (Comparison 12:02). Whether the surgery include TME or not did not demonstrate an interaction although there was only 1 study specified the use of a TME technique ( <LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>) (Comparison 12:01). Despite accounting for these factors, significant heterogeneity still remained within each of the subgroups. This would mean a single HR is inappropriate. While clinically the studies uniformly support there was benefit in local recurrence, the magnitude of benefit was heterogeneous, and cannot be explained by the factors hypothesized a priori. It is most likely that the difference in baseline risk of recurrence was in part responsible for this variability. </P>
<P>
<U>CURATIVE &amp; OVERALL RESECTABILITY </U>
<BR/>The data for curative resectability was homogeneous (p=0.38) across the studies. The pooled OR was 1.02 (95% CI 1-1.05)(15 studies) in favour of preoperative radiotherapy but not significantly different (Comparison 01: 06). The data for overall resectability was heterogeneous across the studies precluding pooling of the data (Comparison 01:07).</P>
<P>
<U>SPHINCTER SPARING SURGERY</U> <BR/>Pooled data was in favour, but not statistically significant, for preoperative radiotherapy, 0.94 [95% CI 0.88-1.04) (Comparison 01:09). The data was borderline in homogeneity (p = 0.05), suggesting there were variations in the magnitude of effect across the studies. When sensitivity analyses were performed using BED and interval between surgery and radiotherapy, (the later a factor included after the data has been compiled). The OR remained not significant for BED &#8805;30Gy<SUP>10</SUP>(OR 0.96 [95%CI 0.86-1.04] ;9 studies; Comparison 14:01), and an interval of &gt;10days between RT and surgery (OR 0.99 [95%CI 0.93-1.05], 3 studies; Comparison 14: 02). None of the factors hypothesized a priori could explain the heterogeneity observed. Neither factors interacted with this outcome (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<U>ACUTE RADIOTHERAPY SIDE EFFECTS</U> <BR/>This was reported both in terms of the most severe toxicity grade experienced per patient within the studies (4 studies), and the toxicity types (5 studies). This outcome was poorly reported across the studies. Kapeitijn provided detailed reporting of radiotherapy side effects in the subgroup of Dutch patients only (<LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>). This was included as it represented one of the most detailed reporting of side effects available, and the Dutch subgroup represented 1530/1861 (82%) patients enrolled in this study. The proportion of patients experiencing no toxicities ranged from 20% (<LINK REF="STD-Higgins-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Higgins 1986</LINK>) to 84% (<LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The most commonly reported side effect was diarrhea 20% (256/1254) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<U>ACUTE TOXICITIES POST SURGERY</U> <BR/>Acute toxicities post surgery was not graded but were listed by type. Proportion of patients with no toxicities post operatively favored the surgery alone group with a RR of 0.88 [95% CI 0.82-0.94], NNH = 14 {95% CI 10-25](6 studies)(Comparison 01:16). Between the included studies, there was an extensive list of different types or groupings of toxicities. These include anastomotic leak, bowel obstruction, GI not specified, small bowel not specified, perineal sinus, wound dehesicence, pulmonary, sepsis, thrombosis, urinary, cardiac, hematological, psychological, renal, wound infection not specified, delayed wound healing, multiorgan failure, perforation, intestinal fistula and intestinal necrosis. The incidence were equivalent between the two study arms. Postoperative mortality was heterogeneous (p=0.003) across the studies (16 comparisons). There was no significant difference in this outcome for 14/16 comparisons (Except <LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Goldberg-1994b" TYPE="STUDY">Goldberg 1994b</LINK>) (Comparison 01:17). There were no significant interactions between any of the radiotherapy factors or TME surgery and postoperative mortality (Comparison 13: 01-03). </P>
<P>
<U>LATE TOXICITIES</U>
<BR/>Long term outcome was available from 4 studies only (<LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK>) reporting on different aspects of long term outcome. No quantitative analyses across studies was possible. Pollack et al. ( <LINK REF="STD-Pollack-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pollack 2006</LINK>) reported on the long term effects on anorectal function, in patients who underwent anterior resection, at a mean follow up of 14 years post treatment who were enrolled in either <LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK> (n=64 consenting patients, of the 119 patients who are still alive in this subgroup). Quality of life comparison (as measured by American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons QoL Questionnaire) showed a non-significant trend for worse outcome in irradiated patients. There were more scarring of the anal sphincters (as documented by endoanal ultrasound) in the irradiated group than the non irradiated (33 versus 13 percent). This radiological observation was closely related to functional outcome with 11/12 patients have some degree of incontinence symptoms. Maximum resting pressure and maximum squeezing pressure were additional objective outcomes reported, these were significantly lower in the irradiated group. <LINK REF="STD-Swedish-RCT-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Swedish RCT 1997</LINK> provided data on long-term rectal function. There were more patients with increased stool frequency (20% versus 8%), continence problems (50% versus 24%). The randomized trial by Kapiteijn et al (<LINK REF="STD-Kapiteijn-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kapiteijn 1999</LINK>) (n=1530) compared health related quality of life and sexual function between the treatment arms (<LINK REF="STD-Marijnen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Marijnen 2005</LINK>). Analysis was based on 990 eligible patients. Health related quality of life (as measured by the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist) improved over time but did not differ significantly between the treatment arms except for on the activity scale. Similarly, there was no treatment effect in the defecation scale. However, on sexual function, was significantly worse for both males and females. Economic impact of rectal cancer and the effect of preoperative radiotherapy was reported for the same study (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Brink-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Brink 2005</LINK>). Of the 292 eligible patients who had paid labor before treatment (total study sample 1530), only 61% resumed work at 24 months. Irradiated patients tended to resume work later than non irradiated patients between 6-12 months, although there was non difference after 18 months (<LINK REF="STD-van-den-Brink-2005" TYPE="STUDY">van den Brink 2005</LINK>). </P>

The incidence of venous thromboembolism (RR 2 [95% CI 1.2-3.4]), femoral neck and pelvic fractures (RR 2[95% CI 1.1-3.7), intestinal obstruction (RR1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]), postoperative fistula (RR2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), and cardiovascular deaths (RR 4.4 [95% CI 2.1-9.5] for <LINK REF="STD-Cedermark-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cedermark 1995</LINK>, and RR 3.9 [95% CI 1.1-11.9] for <LINK REF="STD-Stockholm-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Stockholm 1996</LINK>, was significantly increased for patients in the preoperative radiotherapy group. </P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Preoperative radiotherapy trials have been conducted over many years while significant improvements in staging, radiotherapy, surgical techniques and sophistication in trial design has been occuring since the earliest studies. Previous meta-analysis have highlighted differences in biological effect expected from shorter lower dose versus longer higher dose radiotherapy regimen. Our review confirmed that improvement in overall mortality is borderline in significance with preoperative radiotherapy (HR 0.93 [95% 0.87-1]. This conclusion is generally unchanged during exploratory analysis. The benefits of preoperative radiotherapy were most striking for improving local recurrence (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.64-0.78]) although the data was quite heterogeneous (significance differences in the treatment effect across trials). This heterogeneity is in part, but not entirely accounted for by the differences in radiotherapy technique, radiotherapy dose and fraction size. The proportion of patients undergoing a sphincter sparing procedure was not significant increased ( OR 0.94 [95% CI 0.85-1.04]. </P>
<P>The wide range of radiotherapy regimen employed in these studies make it difficult to conclude with strong evidence the optimal radiotherapy dose fractionation and strategy to use. However, sensitivity analyses could provide some suggestions. Local control benefits were greater when using BED 30Gy<SUP>10</SUP>, and when contemporary radiotherapy fields are used (multiple field to posterior pelvis).The benefit for overall survival were borderline for all studies but significant for these subgroups. There was a slightly higher likelihood of being able to conduct a curative resection. Existing data cannot support the notion that preoperative radiotherapy (as used within these studies), can provide an increase in the proportion of patients having sphincter sparing surgery. More evidence on how best to employ preoperative radiotherapy can be derived from the preoperative RT vs. other neoadjuvant/ adjuvant strategies. When using moderate doses (39Gy in 13 fr, BED 50.7), a shorter (2 weeks) versus a longer (6-8 weeks) interval between surgery and radiotherapy did not translate into significant differences in proportion of patients experiencing postoperative morbidity or anastomotic complications. If the objective is to increase the incidence of sphincter sparing surgery, the use of endocavitary boost +/-Brachytherapy shows promise (<LINK REF="STD-Gerard-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Gerard 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>How does preoperative radiotherapy alone compare with other neoadjuvant strategies? Even though it was beyond the scope of this review to provide a quantitative assessment of preoperative radiotherapy versus other neoadjuvant/adjuvant strategies, some qualitative comments can be made. First, combination chemoradiotherapy have not provide incremental survival advantage compared with radiotherapy alone, and did not translate into benefits in increasing proportion of sphincter sparing surgery. A detailed analysis of preoperative CRT versus RT alone is underway in another systematic review by Ceelen et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Ceelen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ceelen 2006</LINK>). Second, when chemotherapy is indicated, the benefits of chemotherapy appear to be independent on the timing of when it was given (<LINK REF="STD-Bosset-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bosset 2004</LINK>). Third, selective postoperative (with or without chemotherapy) strategy did not appear to be as effective as a preoperative approach in improving local control although much information on the effect of a close resection margin and the associated risk of local recurrence with or without radiotherapy were made available through these trials, and would likely be crucial to guiding strategy designs. Studies directly comparing the best preoperative strategy and postoperative strategy is required to provide the evidence that is needed to evaluate the relative merit of preoperative versus postoperative strategy. The accrual into these studies were obviously challenging. Two similarly designed trials in the United States by the GI intergroup (INT 0147) and NSABP R03 (<LINK REF="STD-Roh_x0028_NSABP-R0_x002d_3_x0029_-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Roh(NSABP R0-3) 2001</LINK>) both closed prematurely due to inadequate accrual. Sauer et al. compared preoperative chemoradiotherapy versus postoperative chemoradiotherapy in T3,4 patients where total mesorectal excision was the surgical technique employed (<LINK REF="STD-Sauer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sauer 2004</LINK>). In this study, the authors found no difference in overall survival but local recurrence rates and acute toxic effects favoring preoperative chemoradiotherapy. </P>
<P>Generally in the acute setting, treatment was well tolerated. Postoperatively, perineal/pelvic infection was the only surgical morbidity that was increased with preoperative radiotherapy based on the current analysis. None of the other outcomes, including surgical mortality was increased. Long term including venous thrombosis, femoral or pelvic fractures, intestinal obstruction, postoperative fistula, and cardiovascular deaths; rectal function including increase stool frequency, continence problems and sexual function were increased with preoperative radiotherapy. Future refinements of radiotherapy techniques to protect the anal sphincters may provide some of the answers toward reducing the late toxicities secondary to radiotherapy. </P>
<P>Future generation of trials would likely share new standards in surgery, radiotherapy and staging techniques while targeting higher risk groups as identified using contemporary staging techniques. Strategies that have the greatest potential of improving overall and cause specific survival while reducing of treatment related morbidities will need to be the focus of the next generation of trials.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer using BED &#8805;30Gy<SUP>10 </SUP>and multifield techniques can provide a modest improvement in overall survival, definite improvement in local recurrences, modest increase in the proportion of patients undergoing curative surgery but is accompanied by an increase in acute and late rectal and sexual function compared with surgery alone. Combination chemoradiotherapy provides further improvement in local recurrence. The interval between surgery and radiotherapy, and the timing of chemotherapy does not appear to have a significant impact on outcome. If the goal is the increase the likelihood of sphincter preserving surgery, brachytherapy boost to external beam, RT provides the most promise. The data does not support the expectation that preoperative radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy is effective in improving the likelihood of accomplishing sphincter sparing surgery. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Better definition of the role of preoperative radiotherapy would likely hinge on focusing trials (and future systematic reviews) in four major ways. First, targeting higher risk populations through the use of contemporary staging techniques need to be the cornerstone of the next generation of trials. Second, more trials designed to directly compare preoperative radiotherapy with other neoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches would provide more robust evidence to define the optimal way of using preoperative radiotherapy in rectal cancer. Third, the variations in dose fractionations may in part hinder progress unless there is explicit rationale to examine the effect of different dose regimen. Consensus among investigators over representative regimen would facilitate interpretation and application of trial results to guide evidence based practice. Finally strategies that would incorporate novel systemic agents, radiotherapeutic, and surgical strategies in the context of preoperative radiotherapy, that has the potential to reduce local as well as distant recurrences, reduce treatment related morbidity should be the focus for the next generation of trials in rectal cancer.</P>
