<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 09:19:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Injuring your front teeth during childhood is common. One of the most severe injuries occurs when the tooth is knocked totally out of the mouth (avulsed). Often the best option is to replant the tooth as quickly as possible. This is true only for permanent teeth. Once replanted the tooth can heal in two ways if managed correctly. Ideally the ligament around the root reforms and the tooth can be expected to last as long as any other tooth, this is known as 'periodontal healing'. When there is too much damage to the ligament, healing occurs by bony replacement and the tooth is replaced by bone and lost over a few years. This is called 'bony healing'.</P>
<P>Bony healing causes significant problems in the medium term for children and treatments for this are the subject of a different Cochrane review. A missing front upper tooth or teeth, as a result of not replanting an avulsed tooth or as a treatment for bony healing, can have a major effect on dental and facial 'good looks'. This can affect the individual's self esteem and general social interaction, as well as how others think and see them.</P>
<P>This Cochrane review investigated what treatments encourage the tooth to repair by periodontal healing. Three studies were found. The benefits of these treatments require further investigation before specific medicaments can be advised. This is because the studies had weakness in their design which may have influenced the benefits they found. The following general treatment principle can be concluded which reinforces current treatment guidelines: For teeth with little chance of periodontal healing, a root canal treatment can be carried out before the tooth is replanted without further detrimental effects.</P>

<P>Three studies, involving a total of 162 patients and 231 teeth were identified. Study one (with a high risk of bias) investigated the effect of extra-oral endodontics. This showed no significant difference in radiographic resorption compared with intra-oral endodontics provided at week 1 for teeth avulsed for longer than 60 minutes dry time. Study two (which had a moderate risk of bias) investigated a 10-minute soaking in thymosin alpha 1 prior to replantation and then its further use as a daily gingival injection for the first 7 days. They reported a strong benefit at 48 months (14% with periodontal healing in the control group versus 77% for the experimental group). Study three (with a high risk of bias) investigated a 20-minute soaking with gentamycin sulphate (4x10<SUP>7</SUP> U/L) for both groups prior to replantation and then the use of hyperbaric oxygen daily in the experimental group for 80 minutes for the first 10 days. They reported a strong benefit at 12 months (43% periodontal healing versus 88% for the experimental group). There was no formal reporting of adverse events.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-06 09:24:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence suggests that extra-oral endodontics is not detrimental for teeth replanted after more than 60 minutes dry time. Studies with moderate/high risk of bias indicate that soaking in thymosin alpha 1 and gentamycin sulphate followed by hyperbaric oxygen may be advantageous however, they have not previously been reported as interventions for avulsed teeth and need further validation. More evidence with low risk of bias is required and, with the low incidence of avulsed teeth, collaborative multicentre trials are indicated.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:50:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-29 09:33:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Traumatic dental injuries are common, with between 6% to 34% of children aged 8 to 15 years old experiencing damage to their permanent teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1993</LINK>). One of the most severe dento-alveolar injuries is avulsion, where the tooth or teeth are completely knocked out of the mouth. This injury accounts for between 0.5% to 3% of dento-alveolar trauma to permanent teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 2007</LINK>). In the most severe scenarios the tooth or teeth are lost or extracted due to the failure of the replanted tooth. The latest UK national study (<LINK REF="REF-Chadwick-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chadwick 2006</LINK>) reported a prevalence of 1.2% of 15-year old children with missing anterior teeth as a result of trauma. Over three quarters of all traumatic oral injuries occur in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Eilert_x002d_Petersson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eilert-Petersson 1997</LINK>) and for this age group was the fourth most common site of injuries, despite occupying only 1% of body surface.</P>
<P>The current treatment for this injury is time-consuming with an average 7.2 hours spent in the dental chair for the first year alone and the direct costs of initial treatment averaging out at CAD 1465 (<LINK REF="REF-Nguyen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nguyen 2004</LINK>). Despite the treatment provided, this injury carries one of the poorest outcomes for dento-alveolar trauma with 73% to 96% of replanted teeth eventually being lost (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 2007</LINK>). The damage to the periodontal ligament (PDL) at the time of injury, the conditions of a tooth's subsequent storage and the duration prior to replantation all profoundly influence the prognosis (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinirons-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinirons 2000</LINK>). For these reasons PDL healing is the primary outcome measure when assessing interventions for tooth avulsion. Clinical interventions are aimed at promoting favourable healing of the PDL.</P>
<P>Where the healing of the PDL is unfavourable, replacement root resorption of the tooth takes place. This happens, where due to the lack of a viable PDL there is no longer any protection of the root from the surrounding bone (in the socket). The bone, like all bone, undergoes continual physiological remodelling (resorption and replacement). The root is gradually replaced by bone (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1997</LINK>). Eventually with no root left, the crown of the tooth fractures, leaving the patient with a missing front tooth. This can have a major effect on dental and facial aesthetics due to the prominence of the maxillary teeth. Visibly missing anterior teeth were considered to be the most facially and dentally unattractive feature in one American study (<LINK REF="REF-FDS-CG-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDS CG 1997</LINK>). This can affect the individual's self esteem and general social interaction. It will also affect the perceptions of the child or adolescent made by peers and adults (<LINK REF="REF-Marcenes-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marcenes 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Where replacement resorption occurs there is a failure of further dento-alveolar bone growth. This has minimal consequences in an adult patient who has completed their facial growth. In children, especially those prior to the pubertal growth spurt, there is still significant alveolar growth especially in the vertical component (<LINK REF="REF-Malmgren-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malmgren 2002</LINK>). The surrounding teeth undergo continued vertical bony growth while the ankylosed tooth (where replacement resorption has occurred) fuses to the bone in its position where it was originally replanted. This can result in significant complications in aesthetics and future dental treatment. No one, however, has studied whether the retention of a resorbing tooth increases the complexity or simplifies the subsequent restorative replacement in comparison to not replanting the tooth in the first place.</P>
<P>The results of treating avulsed and replanted permanent incisor teeth can be divided into short, medium and long term survival of the tooth. Where the tooth is replanted, the tooth in the short term acts both as a space maintainer, bone maintainer and provides good to excellent aesthetics. Where unfavourable healing has occurred the tooth can be expected to last into the medium term (2 to 10+ years) (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1995</LINK>), depending on the speed of alveolar bone turnover (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1997</LINK>). This provides a medium term solution to the patient aesthetics and allows for controlled loss of the tooth prior to other treatment options (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2008</LINK>). Long term survival of the tooth only occurs where favourable periodontal ligament healing has occurred. In this situation the tooth can be expected to survive as long as any other tooth.</P>
<P>This systematic reviews seeks to provide reliable evidence for the different treatment options available for managing traumatised permanent teeth with avulsion injuries.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessing the risk of bias in the included studies</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the criteria described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> 5.0.2 (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). This assessment of the included trials was carried out independently by the two review authors (PD and MD) without blinding the name of authors, institutions and journals.</P>
<P>The studies' validity was judged on the basis of:<BR/>(1) Sequence generation - Method of randomisation<BR/>For this criterion, the method used to generate the allocation sequence had to be described in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it had produce comparable groups (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). The risk of bias for the method used was then assessed as.</P>
<P>Inadequate (no): utilising any of the following: case record number, date of birth or alternate numbers.<BR/>Unclear: poorly defined.<BR/>Adequate (yes): included any one of the following methods of randomisation: computer generated or table of random numbers, drawing of lots, coin-toss, shuffling cards or throw of a dice.</P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment - Methods used<BR/>For this criterion the method used to conceal the allocation sequence was described in sufficient detail to determine whether intervention allocations could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). The risk of bias for the method used was then assessed as.</P>
<P>Inadequate (no): if there was an open allocation sequence or where either the participants or clinician recruiting the subjects could foresee the upcoming assignment.<BR/>Unclear: no such information reported.<BR/>Adequate (yes): included either central randomisation or sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors - Protection against performance bias<BR/>For this criterion we investigated the method of blinding of the study participants and clinician as to which intervention a participant received, was assessed. In addition, any information relating to whether the intended blinding was effective was also recorded (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>).

<P>Unclear: when papers did not report such information.<BR/>Inadequate (no): no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.<BR/>Adequate (yes): when patients and researchers assessing outcome measures were kept blinded. Or participants or some key study personnel were not blinded, but outcome assessment was blinded and the non-blinding of others was unlikely to introduce bias.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data<BR/>This section described the completeness of outcome data for each main outcome. The assessment included: whether attrition and exclusions rates were reported and the reasons for these and the numbers in each intervention group were compared with the total number of participants recruited (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). Was there an assessment of comparability of control and treatment groups taking the retention and follow-up of participants into account, for example intention-to-treat analysis? This again was categorised, using the criteria described below.</P>
<P>Yes: if there were no missing outcome data or the reasons for missing data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome.<BR/>No: if the reason for the missing outcome data was likely to be related to the true outcome, leading to either an imbalance in numbers or the reason why data were missing across groups of interventions.<BR/>Unclear: insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusion of participants.</P>
<P>(5) Selective outcome reporting<BR/>This criterion assessed the possibility of selective outcome reporting (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). This assessed the clarity and transparency of the study description. For example, was there clear reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria? With regards to outcome measures were all these clearly described and could they be validated by reviewing the study protocol?</P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias<BR/>This criterion looked for any important concerns about bias and the design and running of the study which were not discussed in the previous sections.</P>
<P>Finally following these assessments a global risk of bias was assessed. Studies were recorded in three categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: all of the criteria met.</LI>
<LI>Moderate risk of bias: one or more criteria partially met.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more criteria unmet.</LI>
</UL>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>The data synthesis methodology was specified if the situation arose where sufficient trials using similar interventions were available to combine their results. For binary outcomes, the estimate of effect of an intervention would be expressed as risk ratios (RR) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, mean differences and standard deviations would be used to summarise the data for each study using mean differences and 95% CIs.</P>
<P>Only if there were studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures would a meta-analysis be carried out. Risk ratios would be combined for binary data, and mean differences for continuous data, using random-effects models.</P>
<P>The significance of any discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials would be assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity and the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage total variation across studies that would be due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Clinical heterogeneity would be assessed by examining the types of participants and interventions for all outcomes in each study. A sensitivity analysis would be implemented to examine the effect of the study quality assessment (high, medium or low risk of bias) on the overall estimates of effect. In addition, the effect of including unpublished literature on the review's findings would be examined.<B>

<P>The electronic search strategy provided 247 potential studies. Following a review of the titles and abstracts, full paper copies of 16 studies were collected. The remainder included: 11 studies on in vitro testing of storage mediums for avulsed teeth, 16 on epidemiology, cost and quality of life related to avulsion injuries, 19 studies on other areas of dento-alveolar trauma and 165 on topics which were not related to the subject area. Two papers were published in Chinese. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2003</LINK>) despite our best efforts was not retrievable and is awaiting classification, and one study was a conference abstract but no reports of full publication could be found and was excluded and listed in the excluded studies table (<LINK REF="STD-Parodi-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Parodi 1991</LINK>). The other Chinese paper (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) was translated for evaluation. A further 32 clinical studies were located from the grey literature and from reviewing the reference lists from other studies. A full copy of all these studies was obtained and all were case series of avulsed teeth. Therefore they were excluded from further evaluation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Giannetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) was carried out by a specialist paediatric dentistry department which was attached to the University Dental School, Modena, Italy. Both authors were specialist paediatric dentists. They reported that the initial treatment was provided by the dento-alveolar traumatology division of dentistry and maxillofacial surgery. Who provided the follow-up care was not reported nor how the two groups worked together. The study used a randomised controlled trial design, with avulsed teeth randomised at a patient, rather than tooth level. Patient recruitment took place between January 2004 and January 2006. Patients were followed up for 1 year to ascertain the amount of radiographic resorption seen. </P>
<P>Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) was undertaken at a University Dental School, Sichuan, China, with patients presenting to this institution for their emergency and follow-up care. This was a double blind randomised controlled trial with randomisation at a patient level. The recruitment period was between June 2000 and June 2007. Patients were followed up for 48 months following treatment. </P>
<P>Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) was undertaken at the School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi-an, China. It was a randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the patient level. The period of recruitment was between July 1996 and June 1999.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>Giannetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) reported on 20 children (aged 11.4 years, standard deviation (SD) +/-3) with 11 males and 9 females. The extra alveolar dry time was between 60 and 120 minutes. All teeth involved were upper central incisors and had completed their root development. Teeth were stored in saline for part of their extra alveolar time. A clear list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was provided in the text of the study.</P>
<P>Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) reported on 73 patients who were recruited to their study with an age range between 12 to 26 years old (mean age of 16.9 years, SD +/- 3.8, information obtained from email correspondence). Patients avulsing more than one tooth were excluded from the study and therefore randomisation was at patient level. Sixteen patients were female with 6 randomised to the control group and 10 to the test group. Extra alveolar time was a mean of 82.6 minutes, SD +/-17.1. Information on how comparable the groups were with regards to age, extra alveolar time and storage medium were not reported. All teeth involved had completed their root development of which 63 were upper incisors and the rest lower incisors. No list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was reported.</P>
<P>Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) reported on 69 patients with 138 avulsed and replanted teeth. The type of tooth avulsed varied with 69 upper central incisors, 34 upper lateral incisors, 12 upper canines, 10 lower central incisors, 8 lower lateral incisors and 5 lower canines. The control group consisted of 34 subjects with 65 teeth and the experimental group had 35 subjects with 73 teeth. The age of subjects ranged between 6 to 14 years old with a mean of 9.4 years. The extra alveolar times were split into two groups 30 minutes to 3 hours and 3 to 8 hours. The distribution between the groups was similar for the shorter (25 patients and 49 teeth for the control group compared with 23 patients and 47 teeth) and the longer time periods (9 patients and 16 teeth for the control group compared to 12 patients and 26 teeth). All teeth were stored dry prior to attendance. The study listed the inclusion criteria. It was reported that there was no significant variation between the two groups in age, gender, cause of injury, extra alveolar time or concomitant soft tissue injuries. A variety of root development stages would have been expected as a result of the age range of the patients recruited. The numbers of teeth in each stage was not reported and nor was the distribution between the two groups.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Giannetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) compared two treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of removal of any surface contamination from the root using a "constant irrigation of salt solution", replantation under local anaesthetic, flexible splinting for 14 days, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (2 to 3 times a day for 14 days), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid antibiotics for 6 days, but dose and frequency were not reported. The difference between the two groups was the timing of pulp extirpation and root filling. In group A, the pulp was extirpated at week 1 intra-orally and dressed with non-setting calcium hydroxide. At week 2, this dressing was removed and the tooth obturated with gutta percha. In group B, endodontic treatment was carried out extra-orally under a constant stream of 'salt solution' and the tooth was obturated with gutta percha. The tooth was then replanted. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>
<P>Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) compared two treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of washing of the tooth in 0.9% normal saline for 5 minutes. Extra-orally the pulp was then extirpated and obturated with gutta percha while the periodontal ligament was kept moist with saline. The tooth was replanted under local anaesthetic and splinted with a semirigid fibre splint for 10 days. The occlusion was adjusted to prevent contact with the opposing teeth. 250 mg of amoxicillin 3 times a day for 3 days was prescribed, together with 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash every 4 hours for 7 days. The differences in the two treatment protocols were that following the pulp extirpation and obturation, the tooth was soaked for 10 minutes in either thymosin alpha 1 (1.6 mg) or 0.9% normal saline. These solutions were then used to wash out the socket prior to replantation. Following replantation and splinting the patient was seen every day until day 7, for the injection of either 0.2 mL of thymosin alpha 1 or the same volume of 0.9% normal saline into the gingival tissues. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>
<P>Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) compared two treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of gently cleaning the tooth in 0.9% normal saline solution and then soaking for 20 minutes in gentamycin sulphate (4x10<SUP>7</SUP> U/L) prior to replantation. The teeth were then splinted with arch bars for 1 to 2 months. No elective root canal treatment was started. If a tooth was diagnosed with pulp necrosis, endodontic treatment was commenced. No details of the endodontic protocol was provided. In the experimental group hyperbaric oxygen was used. This took the form of 40 minutes pure oxygen then 10 minutes air and then 40 minutes pure oxygen in a 0.25 MPa (2.15 ATA) compression chamber. This regimen occurred once daily for 10 days. The control group received no further treatment. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcome measures</HEADING>
<P>Giannetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) reported two outcome measures. These were the clinical assessment of mobility and the radiographic assessment of root resorption (using their own scale). The mobility assessment was reported at 7 days, 14 days, 1 month and 3 months. The root resorption was reported at these intervals and additionally at 6 and 12 months.</P>
<P>Loo&#8217;s study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) reported a number of outcome measures. The short term outcomes were recorded on the day of replantation, day 1, day 2 and day 5. These outcomes included the patient&#8217;s temperature, level of pain, and levels of: C reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, interferon, interleukin 4 and 6 and white blood cell count. The long term outcomes included clinical mobility, periodontal pocketing, replacement resorption and tooth loss. These were assessed at month 3, 6, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48. No further details of how these were assessed was reported in the paper or in subsequent email correspondence.</P>
<P>Chen&#8217;s study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) reviewed their patients at 3, 6, and 12 months. At each visit, clinical examination included assessments of mobility, discolouration, pulp vitality and pain on palpation. Periodontal and periapical pathology were assessed from radiographs. Outcome measures were reported individually for tooth mobility, pulp necrosis, root resorption and tooth loss. In addition, a compound outcome criterion was used. This classified healing as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Complete success - teeth with normal pulp vitality, periodontal membrane healed, no root resorption and no tooth mobility. </LI>
<LI>Acceptable success - teeth with pulp necrosis and endodontics performed, periodontal membrane attachment or bone ankylosis (replacement resorption), mild root resorption without obvious mobility, replanted tooth will remain for relatively long time.</LI>
<LI>Failure - teeth with pulp necrosis and endodontics performed, periodontal fibrous healing, root resorption with obvious mobility, replanted tooth would be lost in short time.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Periodontal healing was not reported as an individual outcome measure. The data for the number of teeth classified with 'complete success' was used for this outcome measure as periodontal healing was one of the criteria for it. This may underestimate the number of teeth with periodontal healing as this can occur without pulpal healing but was the safest approach to take for the data presented.</P>

<BR/>Periodontal healing at 12 months, showed a statistically significant benefit for the hyperbaric oxygen group RR 2.04 (1.52, 2.73) (<LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>). For this outcome measure, 64 out of 73 teeth were reported to show periodontal healing in the hyperbaric oxygen group compared to 28 out of 65 teeth for the control group.</P>
<P>Tooth survival at 12 months, showed a statistically significant benefit for the hyperbaric oxygen group RR 1.21 (1.07, 1.36) (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).

<P>As with the study by <LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>, a 'worst case scenario' can be estimated assuming that one tooth was injured for each patient lost to follow-up or who refused treatment once randomised. For each of three outcome measures the effect of the hyperbaric oxygen was still significant (periodontal healing RR 1.87 (1.42, 2.47) (<LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>), tooth survival RR 1.17 (1.03, 1.31) (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>), and pulp survival RR 1.20 (1.01, 1.41) (<LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>)). These calculations were based on periodontal healing seen in 64 out of 75 teeth in the hyperbaric oxygen group compared to 31 out of 68 in the control group, for tooth survival 72 out of 75 for the hyperbaric oxygen group compared to 56 out of 68 for the control group and for pulp survival 66 out of 75 for the hyperbaric oxygen group compared to 50 out of 68 in the control group. The number of patients involved for each outcome measure was not reported and as more than one tooth per patient was used, this could lead to an overestimation in the effect between the two treatment interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>).

<P>Three randomised controlled trials were identified which reported on interventions for avulsed and replanted teeth. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) were at high risk of bias and therefore their results have to be interpreted with caution. The third study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) was assessed as having a moderate to high risk of bias because of the loss to follow-up suffered in the control group but not in the experimental group (16 patients to 1). Although in this study results were reported for teeth, patients were excluded if patients avulsed more than one tooth and therefore teeth and patients are the same.  </P>
<P>The outcome measures, interventions and failure to follow CONSORT guidance for reporting of clinical trials, prevented the authors from numerically synthesising the data and therefore the findings and limitations of each study were reported individually. Common treatment themes seen in more than one study were discussed.</P>
<P>Giannetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) showed a high risk of bias due to the lack of allocation concealment and the use of alternation for the randomisation sequence. This resulted in the initial clinician who recruited the patients being aware which group the patient would be randomised to. The two treatment regimens had similar outcomes with regard to the amount of root resorption seen at 1 year. In addition, no adverse events were reported for either group. More definitive findings were difficult to draw due to the small sample size of the trial. It was unfortunate that no formal assessment of clinical periodontal healing was reported, as replacement resorption would be expected for all teeth as result of the extra alveolar dry time of more than 60 minutes. A similar lack of adverse events was found in an avulsion case series (<LINK REF="REF-Barrett-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 2005</LINK>) where extra-oral obturation was provided. From a clinical point of view the provision of extra-oral endodontics reduces the amount of time, patient co-operation and number of follow-up visits required. It should be noted that this treatment regimen is already described as a potential treatment option in the current International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Flores-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flores 2007</LINK>), for teeth which will heal by replacement resorption due to their prolonged extra alveolar dry time. For teeth of shorter extra alveolar dry time (less than 60 minutes) extra-oral endodontics are not recommended due to an earlier animal study (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1981</LINK>). This reported poorer results than immediate replantation due to further damage to the periodontal ligament when providing extra-oral endodontics.</P>
<P>Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) investigated the effect of the soaking of the avulsed tooth prior to replantation with an immune modulating drug, thymosin alpha 1 and then its use as a gingival injection around the site of the avulsed tooth for 7 days post-replantation. It is unknown if the gingival injection added to the favourable outcomes seen in this study. Concerns have been raised that medicaments applied to the tooth may be rapidly lost when replanted (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 2003</LINK>). It would appear that this method of application may provide a more prolonged effect of the medicament during the early healing period.</P>
<P>The study investigated a number of short term variables including: the patient&#8217;s temperature, levels of C reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, interferon, interleukin 4 and 6 and white blood cell count. These variables may suggest a possible mechanism of action for the thymosin alpha 1 but were outside the outcome measures in this Cochrane review. The author did report on the pain perception at day 1, 2, and 5 which was one of the outcome criteria. This showed a significant reduction in pain in the thymosin alpha 1 group at day 1 only.</P>
<P>The long term outcomes for the Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) showed a significant improvement in periodontal healing and tooth survival for teeth treated with thymosin alpha 1 compared to the 0.9% normal saline group. Some caution is required with the interpretation of the study for the following reason. The loss to follow-up between the two groups was highly significant with only one patient lost (2%) in the experimental group compared to 16 (36%) in the control group. The loss of a tooth was an objective outcome measure although the cause of the tooth loss was not reported. As tooth loss in this age group is an unusual occurrence it must be assumed to be caused by the progressive replacement resorption of the tooth and its eventual demise. Even using a best/worst case scenario, a significant difference between the two groups was still present. In the control group, with the extra alveolar time reported as 82.6 +/-17.1 minutes, the replacement resorption figures are similar to clinical case series of avulsed teeth (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Barrett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrett 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kinirons-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinirons 2000</LINK>). This result for the control group increases the validity of the trial. That said, however, the tooth loss figures at 1 and 4 years for the control group (34% and 76%) were significantly higher than reported for a large case series of 1% and 9% over the same duration, age ranges and extra alveolar duration (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) showed a significant advantage for hyperbaric oxygen when used for the 10 days following an avulsion injury. These benefits included improved tooth survival and periodontal and pulpal healing. Similar to Loo's study (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) the significant difference for each of these outcome measures was maintained when the best/worst case scenario was modelled. The study, however, should be assessed in the light of three health warnings. Firstly, more than one tooth per patient was used and therefore the effect of the clustering of teeth within patients may reduce the differences seen between groups (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2009</LINK>). Secondly, the study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) reported results for both experimental and control groups that were remarkable (periodontal healing of 43% in control group and 88% in experimental group). No case series has achieved such high success rates, even in comparison to the control group, for teeth avulsed and stored dry for 30 minutes to 8 hours. In the control and experimental groups, however, it should be noted that these teeth were subject to antibiotic soaking for 20 minutes prior to replantation and this may explain to some extent the improved outcomes. There was no group in this study which received neither the antibiotic soak or the hyperbaric oxygen which would allow a direct comparison with other avulsion case series. Thirdly, the study was at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding of investigators. The use of hyperbaric oxygen to improve healing for dento-alveolar injuries has not, as far as the authors can determine, been reported in the literature before. Therefore its effect (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) as reported cannot be validated against any other study.</P>
<P>A number of animal studies have investigated the effect of topical antibiotic soaking prior to replantation. For periodontal healing, Cvek et al (<LINK REF="REF-Cvek-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvek 1990</LINK>) showed a positive effect of a doxycycline soak for 5 minutes prior to replantation in comparison to systemic doxycycline or no doxycycline. The major benefit was for teeth stored wet between 30 and 60 minutes and dry for 30 minutes. There was no benefit seen for teeth stored dry for 60 minutes. Two further animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bryson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bryson 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ma-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ma 2003</LINK>) showed no benefit in periodontal healing for teeth subject to 60 minutes dry storage prior to application of doxycycline or minocycline. Clinically one case series (<LINK REF="REF-Chappuis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappuis 2005</LINK>) reported 12-month periodontal healing results for avulsed and replanted teeth. Their results for periodontal healing (58%) outperformed other case series. Unfortunately multiple interventions were used and therefore it is difficult to ascertain the effect of the individual components of the treatment provided, which included soaking in 5% tetracycline prior to replantation. Despite these favourable results, for teeth stored dry for more than 60 minutes all healed with replacement resorption.</P>
<P>For revascularisation (e.g. pulp survival) a number of animal studies (<LINK REF="REF-Cvek-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvek 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cvek-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cvek 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritter-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritter 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yanpiset-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yanpiset 2000</LINK>) have shown significant improvements where teeth were soaked in antibiotic prior to replantation. In a case series Chappuis and von Arx (<LINK REF="REF-Chappuis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappuis 2005</LINK>) reported a 19% revascularisation rate following soaking in antibiotics prior to replanting immature teeth (e.g. children under the approximate age of 10). In three different case series, where no antibiotic washing prior to replantation was provided the following results were found. <LINK REF="REF-Ebeleseder-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebeleseder 1998</LINK> reported a 41% revascularisation rate for immature teeth (mean age 8 years) and a 9% rate for mature teeth in adolescence (mean age 12 years old). In the largest case series, <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1995a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1995a</LINK> reported a 34% chance of revascularisation for immature teeth only. Finally Kling (<LINK REF="REF-Kling-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kling 1986</LINK>) found that only 6% of their immature teeth (sample n = 72) showed revascularisation where extra-oral storage was greater than 45 minutes. Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) did not report how many of the children with complete root development underwent revascularisation (age range was between 6 to 14 years old with a mean age of 9.4 years). The high revascularisation rates in control and experiment groups (54%, 89%), however, would suggest a number of these teeth must have had complete root development. As a result of the highly superior results (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) in comparison to all avulsion case series the findings need to be viewed with caution until they have been replicated.</P>
<P>Although Chen's study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) did not directly investigate the effect of a 20-minute soaking in gentamycin prior to replantation the results presented were superior to avulsion case series as discussed earlier. Therefore both studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) suggest that immersing the tooth in an active medicament (immune response enhancer or antibiotic) may increase the chance of periodontal and pulpal healing. It would appear that this benefit extends to periodontal healing and teeth with completed root development. Previously the effect of soaking of the tooth prior to replantation and the medicament used have been a source of controversy in dental traumatology literature (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pohl-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pohl 2005</LINK>) and have lacked the appropriate well designed studies. The most appropriate medicament for soaking still requires further high quality studies. The same is true for the use of hyperbaric oxygen and thymosin alpha 1 especially as neither of these interventions have been previously reported for the treatment of avulsed teeth. Both these interventions have a significant cost in terms of finance and time, for each intervention requires the patient to return to the clinic every day for the first 7 or 10 days after the injury.</P>
<P>None of the three studies formally reported any side effects for the different interventions used. For hyperbaric oxygen side effects have been reported but for further details readers are advised to read specific reviews on the subject.</P>

<P>The findings of this Cochrane review support the following implications for the treatment of avulsed teeth in practice.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK> examined the role of extra-oral endodontics prior to replantation for teeth with an extra alveolar dry time greater than 60 minutes. This intervention showed little difference in root resorption at 1 year in comparison to intra-oral endodontics at week 1. Extra-oral endodontics prior to replantation would reduce the subsequent number and duration of review visits and the level of co-operation required for these.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The term soaking describes the dentist immersing a tooth in a medicament prior to replantation and is different to that of a storage medium which is used to transfer the avulsed tooth from the accident site to the clinic for treatment. Two studies identified in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) used soaking of the avulsed tooth in an active medicament prior to replantation. The benefit of an immune modulating drug with respect to periodontal healing and tooth survival was significant in comparison to the saline control (<LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK> both experimental and control group teeth were soaked in the same medicament. These studies suggest that soaking may be advantageous prior to replantation of avulsed teeth. This review is unable to report on which specific antibiotic or pro-inflammatory modulator should be used without further high quality research. Neither medicament has been reported as a treatment for human avulsed and replanted teeth before.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Hyperbaric oxygen was used in combination with soaking in an antibiotic solution and found to have a significant effect on tooth survival and periodontal and pulpal healing. This combination of interventions has not been used before in dental trauma and needs further high quality research to validate the findings of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>).</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:50:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unfortunately as can be seen there are very few studies in the human tooth avulsion literature which can meet the level of evidence required to be included in a Cochrane review. Therefore future studies in this area should ensure that they are able to be included when this review is updated.</P>
<P>Conducting research in this area is difficult for a number of reasons:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the rarity of the injury</LI>
<LI>the different specialities that are providing the different stages of care for patients suffering avulsion injuries</LI>
<LI>the variability of emergency presentation of patients following avulsion injury</LI>
<LI>the failure by patients to present with sufficient speed that a viable periodontal ligament is still present</LI>
<LI>the ethical problem of obtaining informed consent in an emergency situation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This list of problems does not mean that good quality research is impossible for avulsed and replanted teeth. It does, however, require good planning before undertaking a well designed study. Good quality studies require the appropriate financial sponsorship to maintain the enthusiasm of centres to recruit and retain enough patients to ensure the study reaches its power calculation and therefore that a valid conclusion can be drawn from it.</P>
<P>Methodology: A number of editorials (<LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trope-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trope 2003</LINK>) have urged clinicians and specialist centres to work together to provide sufficient numbers for multicentre research as each centre is unable to provide sufficient cases on its own in a sensible time frame. Gianetti's study (<LINK REF="STD-Giannetti-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Giannetti 2006</LINK>) validated this need due to the small numbers recruited over the 2-year period. The two Chinese studies (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loo-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Loo 2008</LINK>) both showed certain centres in China do see sufficient numbers for a single centre trial.</P>
<P>Where possible the same speciality should see the patient from acute presentation to review visits, thereby ensuring all relevant information is collected and treatment protocols followed.</P>
<P>The use of well designed study is required to minimise the risk of bias and therefore ensure the results are valid. An acceptance amongst investigators that due to the small sample likely to be recruited no more than one variable should be tested in each study.</P>
<P>Outcome measures: Because of the difficulty in the diagnosis of replacement resorption clinical trials must follow up patients for at least 1 year and ideally longer. Further work is needed on alternative robust objective measures to identify healing by replacement resorption. The other outcome measures identified in this review, where appropriate, should be included as part of the study design.</P>
<P>Priority areas of future research: This review has identified that there is a need to establish the optimal medicament and duration for soaking the tooth prior to replantation. It appears that this may be able to influence the healing responses and increase the chances of periodontal and pulpal healing. Contenders for further studies are different antibiotics or thymosin alpha 1. Other methods of application such as the use of the root canal space or daily gingival injections for providing slow and ongoing release of medicaments to the surrounding healing tissues or the use of hyperbaric oxygen should be investigated further.</P>
<P>Reporting clinical findings: All three studies identified in this review would benefit from reporting their trial in guidance with the CONSORT recommendation to ensure transparency and clarity. </P>

<P>This study was undertaken at the School of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi-an, China. It was a randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the patient level. The period of recruitment was between July 1996 and June 1999.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-10-29 13:40:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This study reported on 69 patients with 138 avulsed and replanted teeth. The type of tooth avulsed varied with 69 teeth upper central incisors, 34 upper lateral incisors, 12 upper canines, 10 lower central incisors, 8 lower lateral incisors and 5 lower canines. The control group consisted of 34 subjects with 65 teeth and the experimental group had 35 subjects with 73 teeth. The age of subjects ranged between 6 to 14 years old with a mean of 9.4 years. The extra alveolar times were split into 2 groups 30 minutes to 3 hours and 3 to 8 hours. The distribution between the groups was similar for the shorter (25 patients and 49 teeth for the control group compared with 23 patients and 47 teeth) and the longer groups (9 patients and 16 teeth for the control group compared to 12 patients and 26 teeth). All teeth were stored dry prior to attendance. The study reported their inclusion criteria. It was reported that there was no significant variation between the 2 groups in age, gender, cause of injury, extra alveolar time or concomitant soft tissue injuries. A variety of root development stages would have been expected as a result of the age range of the patients recruited. The numbers of teeth in each stage was not reported nor was the distribution between the 2 groups.</P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-10-29 13:42:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This study compared 2 treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of gently cleaning of the tooth in 0.9% normal saline solution and then immersion for 20 minutes in gentamycin sulphate (4x10<SUP>7</SUP> U/L) prior to replantation. The teeth were then splinted with arch bars for 1 to 2 months. No elective root canal treatment was started. If a tooth was diagnosed with pulp necrosis, endodontic treatment was commenced. No details of the endodontic protocol was provided. In the experimental group hyperbaric oxygen was used. This took the form of 40 minutes pure oxygen then 10 minutes air and then 40 minutes pure oxygen in a 0.25 MPa (2.15 ATA) compression chamber. This regimen occurred once daily for 10 days. The control group received no further treatment. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>

<CHAR_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-10-29 13:43:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chen&#8217;s study (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2000</LINK>) reviewed their patients at 3, 6,12 months. At each visit clinical examination included assessments of mobility, discolouration, pulp vitality, pain on palpation. Periodontal and periapical pathology was assessed from radiographs. Outcome measures were reported individually for tooth mobility, pulp necrosis, root resorption and tooth loss. In addition, a compound outcome criterion was used. This classified healing as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Complete success - teeth with normal pulp vitality, periodontal membrane healed, no root resorption and no tooth mobility. </LI>
<LI>Acceptable success - teeth with pulp necrosis and endodontics performed, periodontal membrane attachment or bone ankylosis (replacement resorption), mild root resorption without obvious mobility, replanted tooth will remain for relatively long time.</LI>
<LI>Failure - teeth with pulp necrosis and endodontics performed, periodontal fibrous healing, root resorption with obvious mobility, replanted tooth will be lost in short time.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Periodontal healing was not reported as an individual outcome measure. The data for the number of teeth classified with 'complete success' was used for this outcome measure as periodontal healing was one of the criteria for it. This may underestimate the number of teeth with periodontal healing as this can occur without pulpal healing but was the safest approach to take for the data presented.</P>

<P>This study was carried out by a specialist paediatric dentistry department which was attached to the University Dental School, Modena, Italy.  Both authors were specialist paediatric dentists. They reported that the initial treatment was provided by the dento-alveolar traumatology division of dentistry and maxillofacial surgery. Who provided the follow-up care was not reported nor how the 2 groups worked together. The trial used a randomised controlled trial design, with patients randomised at a patient, rather than tooth level. Patient recruitment took place between January 2004 to January 2006. Patients were followed up for 1 year to ascertain the amount of radiographic resorption seen.</P>

<P>This study reported on 20 children (aged 11.4 years, SD +/-3) with 11 males and 9 females. The extra alveolar dry time was between 60 and 120 minutes. All teeth involved were upper central incisors and had completed their root development. Prior to arrival for their emergency care all teeth had been stored in saline. A clear list of inclusion and exclusion criteria was provided in the text of the study.</P>

<P>This study compared 2 treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of removal of any surface contamination from the root using a "constant irrigation of salt solution", replantation under local anaesthetic, flexible splinting for 14 days, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash (2 to 3 times a day for 14 days), amoxicillin and clavulanic acid antibiotics for 6 days, but dose and frequency were not reported. The difference between the 2 groups was the timing of pulp extirpation and root filling. In group A, the pulp was extirpated at week 1 intra-orally and dressed with non setting calcium hydroxide. At week 2, this dressing was removed and the tooth obturated with gutta percha. In group B, endodontic treatment was carried out extra-orally under a constant stream of 'salt solution' and the tooth was obturated with gutta percha. The tooth was then replanted. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>

<P>This study compared 2 treatment interventions. All patients received a standardised treatment protocol of washing of the tooth in 0.9% normal saline for 5 minutes. Extra-orally the pulp was then extirpated and obturated with gutta percha while the periodontal ligament was kept moist with saline. The tooth was replanted under local anaesthetic and splinted with a semirigid fibre splint for 10 days. The occlusion was adjusted to prevent contact with the opposing teeth. Amoxicillin (250 mg 3 times a day for 3 days was prescribed) together with 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash every 4 hours for 7 days. The differences in the 2 treatment protocols were that following the pulp extirpation and obturation, the tooth was immersed for 10 minutes in either thymosin alpha 1 (1.6 mg) or 0.9% normal saline. These solutions were then used to wash out the socket prior to replantation. Following replantation and splinting the patient was seen every day until day 7, for the injection of either 0.2 mL of thymosin alpha 1 or the same volume of 0.9% normal saline into the gingival tissues. Patients then entered into a standardised review protocol.</P>

<P>Thanks to the author for his time spent in replying to our questions. This appeared to be a semirandomised trial, but there were considerable concerns with regards to randomisation and allocation concealment as attempts were made to ensure equal numbers were assigned to each group. There were multiple interventions and it was unclear which patients had been allocated to which study group. Finally the outcomes were difficult to follow with regards to which intervention was responsible for what. No clear protocol or flow diagram was provided for the treatments received by each group.</P>

<P>Inclusion criteria for acute presentation are:<BR/>1. Patients who are under the age of 16 and have avulsed a tooth or teeth that has been replanted<BR/>2. The tooth has completed root development with or without an open apex (as these teeth have no chance of pulpal regeneration)<BR/>3. With no more than 20 minutes extra alveolar dry time<BR/>4. A maximum total time of 1 hour has elapsed with the tooth being kept outside the mouth in milk or other storage media and a maximum of 20 minutes being kept in dry conditions<BR/>5. With no previous endodontic treatment carried out<BR/>6. The patient presents to the specialist unit within 10 days following the injury (this ensures that the patient has a chance of randomly being entered into one or other treatment group).</P>
<P>Inclusion criteria for delayed presentation:<BR/>1. Where replantation has been carried out away from a specialist centre and is performed within the guidelines of the International Association of Dental Traumatology (2003)<BR/>2. Details can be obtained from the dentist who provided this treatment (e.g. extra alveolar time, extra alveolar medium, dry time, surface contamination, antibiotics, etc.)<BR/>3.
