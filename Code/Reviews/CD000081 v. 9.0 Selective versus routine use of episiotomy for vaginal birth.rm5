<P>In women where no instrumental delivery is intended, selective episiotomy policies result in fewer women with severe perineal/vaginal trauma. This suggests that the rationale used to justify routine episiotomy - that it reduces perineal/vaginal trauma - is unfounded. Other findings, both in the short or long term, provide no clear indication of harm of restrictive policies.</P>
<P>The review thus demonstrates that believing that routine episiotomy reduces perineal/vaginal trauma is not justified by current evidence. Further research in women where instrumental delivery is intended may help clarify if routine episiotomy is useful in this particular group. These trials should use better, standardised outcome assessment methods.</P>

<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Normal birth can cause tears to the vagina and the surrounding tissue, usually as the baby's head is born, and sometimes these tears extend to the rectum. These are repaired surgically, but take time to heal. To avoid these severe tears, doctors have recommended making a surgical cut to the perineum with scissors or scalpel to prevent severe tearing and facilitate the birth. This intervention, known as an episiotomy, is used as a routine care policy during births in some countries. Both a tear and an episiotomy need sutures, and can result in severe pain, bleeding, infection, pain with sex, and can contribute to long term urinary incontinence.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>An episiotomy requires suturing and benefits and harms as part of routine management of normal births remains unclear. In particular, we need to know if it does indeed prevent large tears, because women otherwise may be subjected to an unnecessary operation, pain and in some cases long-term problems. The question of whether to apply a policy of routine episiotomy is important for clinical practice and for the health and well-being of women and babies.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We prepared this edition of this review by updating the methods and searching for evidence from the medical literature on 14 September 2016. The review now includes 11 randomised controlled trials (with 5977 women) that compared episiotomy as needed (selective episiotomy) with routine episiotomy in terms of benefits and harms for mother and baby in women at low risk of instrumental delivery.</P>
<P>The trials were from ten different countries. In women where health staff were only conducting selective episiotomy, there may be 30% fewer with severe perineal trauma at birth compared with women where a policy of routine episiotomy was applied (eight trials, 5375 women, low-certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in average blood loss between the groups (two trials, very low-certainty evidence). There is probably no difference in Apgar less than seven at five minutes, with no events in either groups (moderate-certainty evidence). We do not know if there is a difference in the number of women with moderate or severe perineal pain three days after giving birth (one trial, 165 women, very low-certainty evidence) but careful assessment of women's pain was not well carried out in the included trials. There may be little or no difference in the number of women developing perineal infection (two trials, low-certainty evidence); and there is probably little or no difference in women reporting painful sexual intercourse six months or more after delivery (three trials, 1107 women, moderate-certainty evidence); for urinary incontinence six months or more after delivery, there may be little or no difference between the groups. One study reported genital prolapse three years after the birth and there was no clear difference between groups (low-certainty evidence). Other important outcomes relating to long-term effects were not reported in these trials (urinary fistula, rectal fistula, and faecal incontinence).</P>
<P>One trial examined selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy in women for whom an operative vaginal birth was intended. The results showed no clear difference in severe perineal trauma between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy.</P>
<P>Women's views on the different policies were not reported.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, the findings show that selective use of episiotomy in women (where a normal delivery without forceps is anticipated) means that fewer women have severe perineal trauma. Thus the rationale for conducting routine episiotomies to prevent severe perineal trauma is not justified by current evidence, and we could not identify any benefits of routine episiotomy for the baby or the mother.</P>
<P>More research is needed in order to inform policy in women where an instrumental birth is planned and episiotomy is often advocated. Outcomes could be better standardised and measured.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing selective versus routine use of episiotomy, irrespective of parity, setting or surgical type of episiotomy.

<P>Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. A third author mediated where there was no clear consensus.

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-01 16:52:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This updated review includes 12 studies (6177 women), 11 in women in labour for whom a vaginal birth was intended, and one in women where an assisted birth was anticipated. Two were trials each with more than 1000 women (Argentina and the UK), and the rest were smaller (from Canada, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan, Columbia and Saudi Arabia). Eight trials included primiparous women only, and four trials were in both primiparous and multiparous women. For risk of bias, allocation was adequately concealed and reported in nine trials; sequence generation random and adequately reported in three trials; blinding of outcomes adequate and reported in one trial, blinding of participants and personnel reported in one trial.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-01-18 08:58:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vaginal birth can cause tears to the vagina and perineum. Estimates of the frequency vary, with some estimates (that include episiotomy) indicating this occurs in 85% of births (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2008</LINK>), compared with a more recent retrospective cohort reporting that 4% of 1785 Australian women sustained a perineal scrape and 34% sustained a first- or second-degree perineal tear (<LINK REF="REF-Catling_x002d_Paull-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catling-Paull 2013</LINK>). While minor tears may heal quickly without intervention, some are more severe, damaging tissue, muscle and sometimes extending to the anal sphincter. These more severe tears need surgical repair, and depending on the extent, may cause a number of problems in the early postnatal period. Women may experience pain, bleeding, infection, dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), and have a prolonged hospital stay. In a small percentage of women, the damage to the vaginal and perineal tissues can result in some long-term problems such as pain, urinary fistula (an abnormal connection between vagina and bladder), urinary incontinence (the inability of control causing urinary 'accidents'), rectal fistula (an abnormal connection between the vagina and rectum), faecal incontinence (the inability of control causing faecal 'accidents'), dyspareunia and genital-urinary prolapse (the pelvic organs descending from their normal position) (<LINK REF="REF-Kettle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kettle 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tears of the perineum and vagina are classified as follows (<LINK REF="REF-Fernando-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernando 2006</LINK>):</P>
<UL>
<LI>first degree: involving the fourchette, perineal skin and vaginal mucous membrane, but not the underlying fascia and muscle;</LI>
<LI>second degree: involving the perineal muscles and skin;</LI>
<LI>third degree: injury to the anal sphincter complex;</LI>
<UL>
<LI>3a: less than 50% of the external anal sphincter torn;</LI>
<LI>3b: 50% of the external anal sphincter torn; and</LI>
<LI>3c: injury to the external and internal anal sphincter;</LI>
</UL>
<LI>fourth degree: injury extends through the anal sphincter complex to anal epithelium.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Severe perineal trauma usually refers to a third-degree or fourth-degree tear (<LINK REF="REF-Priddis-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Priddis 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Episiotomy, a surgical cut of the vagina and perineum, is sometimes used in an attempt to prevent serious perineal damage caused by tearing and to facilitate the birth of the baby.</P>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-18 08:58:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Episiotomy is a surgical incision of the vagina and perineum carried out by a skilled birth attendant to enlarge the vaginal opening (<LINK REF="REF-FIGO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">FIGO 2012</LINK>). The first documented episiotomy dates back to over 270 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Ould-1741" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ould 1741</LINK>). Rates of episiotomy increased substantially during the first half of the 20th century. At that time, there was an increasing move for women to give birth in a hospital and for physicians to manage normal uncomplicated childbirths. Since then, episiotomy has become one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the world (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1997</LINK>). Reported rates of episiotomies vary from as low as 9.7% (Sweden) to as high as 100% (Taiwan) (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 2005</LINK>). The large differences in episiotomy rates closely relate to the differences in policies regarding the use of episiotomy. Episiotomy rates are high in some countries, such as Argentina and China, with a policy of routine use of episiotomy for nearly all first births (<LINK REF="REF-Lede-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lede 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Qian-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Qian 2001</LINK>). Other places adopt a policy of 'selective' use of episiotomy where the use of episiotomy is restricted rather than universally performed - clinicians use their clinical judgement to determine the need for episiotomy where the benefits likely outweigh the harms in situations such as impending severe perineal tear, prolonged second stage of labour, shoulder dystocia, instrumental delivery, and non-reassuring fetal heart rate (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Melo-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Melo 2014</LINK>). In the USA, the episiotomy rate decreased from 60.9% in 1979 to 24.5% in 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-Frankman-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frankman 2009</LINK>). In Finland, the episiotomy rate decreased from 71.5% to 54.9% between 1997 to 1999 and 2006 to 2007 among primiparous women, and from 21.5% to 9.2% between 1997 to 2001 and 2006 to 2007 among multiparous women (<LINK REF="REF-R_x00e4_is_x00e4_nen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Räisänen 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Episiotomy is made with scissors or scalpel and requires repair by suturing (<LINK REF="REF-Thacker-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thacker 1983</LINK>). There are seven ways of performing an episiotomy, with 'midline' and 'mediolateral' being the two main types of episiotomy in the literature and medical practice (<LINK REF="REF-Kalis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalis 2012</LINK>). A midline (sometimes called 'median') episiotomy is "a vertical incision from the posterior fourchette and runs along the midline through the central tendon of the perineal body" (<LINK REF="REF-Kalis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalis 2012</LINK>). Critics point out that if a midline episiotomy extends, it is likely to extend into the anal sphincter causing a third- or fourth-degree tear. A mediolateral episiotomy is "an incision beginning in the midline and directed laterally and downwards away from the rectum" (<LINK REF="REF-Kalis-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalis 2012</LINK>). In theory, if a mediolateral tear extends, it will extend away from the anal sphincter. An episiotomy is generally done late in second stage when the perineum is stretched thin. Prior to the incision, local anaesthesia is injected to numb the perineum, if a mother does not have regional anaesthesia (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2006</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-01-16 15:51:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is thought that enlarging the vaginal outlet by episiotomy would reduce vaginal soft tissue stretching and tension during childbirth, thereby preventing higher degrees of perineal traumas and their subsequent complications (<LINK REF="REF-Cunningham-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cunningham 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ould-1741" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ould 1741</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thacker-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thacker 1983</LINK>). More space also allows for instrumentation of assisted deliveries by forceps or vacuums (<LINK REF="REF-Cargill-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cargill 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2008a</LINK>). At other times, episiotomy is performed to shorten second stage of labour for various maternal and fetal indications (<LINK REF="REF-Hamilton-1861" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hamilton 1861</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 2005</LINK>) such as maternal exhaustion and fetal bradycardia.</P>
<P>Clinicians who advocate routine episiotomies reason that perineal tears, including severe tears, can occur in women who are not thought likely to have serious tears and who have not had an episiotomy under a selective regimen. However, the effectiveness of routine episiotomy preventing severe perineal trauma has been questioned and the procedure has its own associated complications. Since not all vaginal births result in perineal trauma, some women are subjected to unnecessary incisions and their associated complications and morbidity as a result of a 'routine' episiotomy policy. Even in obstetrical emergencies such as shoulder dystocia, and in instrumental-assisted deliveries, episiotomy may not reduce severe perineal tears (<LINK REF="REF-Steiner-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steiner 2012</LINK>). Complications associated with episiotomy include bleeding, pain and discomfort of the wound and sutures (which may cause pain while sitting, and in turn affect breastfeeding), wound scarring, dyspareunia, or complications in subsequent vaginal births. Other adverse effects of episiotomy include: (a) extension of episiotomy through the anal sphincter and rectum by the clinician making the incision, or by spontaneous extension of the incision; (b) unsatisfactory anatomic healing resulting in skin tags, asymmetry or excessive narrowing of the introitus, vaginal prolapse, recto-vaginal fistula and fistula-in-ano (<LINK REF="REF-Homsi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homsi 1994</LINK>); (c) increased blood loss and hematoma; (d) pain and oedema around the episiotomy wound; (e) infection and dehiscence (<LINK REF="REF-Homsi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Homsi 1994</LINK>); (f) dyspareunia, which may be a short-term consequence, or may become more established and cause persistent dyspareunia (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 1982</LINK>); and finally, (h) at least one woman has died as a result of infection complicating an episiotomy wound (<LINK REF="REF-Lynch-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lynch 1997</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-01-16 15:53:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the wide use of episiotomy globally and questions on its benefits and harms, it is important to provide solid evidence to inform the appropriate clinical practice and to ensure the well-being of women and their infants. This review aims to evaluate the evidence of selective versus routine use of episiotomy. To help our thinking on this, we developed a diagram to summarise the rationale commonly used to justify routine episiotomy (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). We used the outcomes identified in this diagram to evaluate research evidence of whether this rationale is justified.</P>

<P>The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register, including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth</A> in the Cochrane Library and select the &#8216;Specialized Register&#8217; section from the options on the left side of the screen.</P>
<P>Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from:</P>

<P>Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.

<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from RevMan 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create 'Summary of findings' tables.

The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence was downgraded from 'high' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Setting</HEADING>
<P>Ten of the included 12 studies were carried out between July 1982 and October 2009 (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013)</LINK>. Two studies did not describe when the studies took place (<LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>). Seven of the 11 studies were carried out in high-income countries, including Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>), Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>), Ireland (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>), Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>), and the UK (<LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>). Five of the studies were conducted in middle- and low-income countries, and these included Argentina (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>), Columbia (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>), Malaysia (<LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>), Pakistan (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>), and Saudi Arabia (<LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five studies were carried out in university teaching hospitals, relatively high complexity care institutions (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>). One of these five studies also recruited some of participants from a mid-complexity level hospital (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>). The remaining seven studies were conducted in maternity units with inadequate information to judge the institution's level of care (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>) stated that there was no severe perineal trauma in either selective or routine episiotomy group. However, the main table reported 100% severe perineal trauma in both groups. We have assumed the results are as stated in the abstract but have written to the study authors for clarification.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sample sizes</HEADING>
<P>Overall, the sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 109 (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; 146 randomised but data for only 109 reported) to 2606 (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>). Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>) had a sample size of 1000 or above; one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>) involved more than 500 women and the remaining eight studies involved between 100 and 500 women.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The participants in the included studies were pregnant women (above 16 years old), between 28 gestational weeks and full term, with a live singleton fetus, and had vaginal birth. The women did not have severe medical or psychiatric conditions.</P>
<P>The gravidity of the trial participants is summarised in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Eight trials included primiparous women only (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>), and the other four included both primiparous and multiparous women (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 11 studies randomisation was done during labour, and in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>) there was no description.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions and comparisons</HEADING>
<P>In all but one of the trials vaginal births without complications were anticipated; the <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK> study, which only recruited women where operative vaginal delivery was anticipated at the start of labour. The <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK> study was included, but data are reported separately.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Location</HEADING>
<P>The indication for selective episiotomy was specified differently in the various studies, although overall related to both fetal or maternal indications. Seven trials performed selective episiotomy to avoid either severe perineal tear or fetal distress (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>). Two studies only conducted the selective episiotomy for fetal reasons (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>). Two studies carried out selective episiotomy mainly to prevent laceration (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>). One study provided the selective episiotomy to avoid severe perineal tear at operative vaginal delivery (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ten trials utilised mediolateral episiotomies (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>) and two trials used midline episiotomies (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008)</LINK>.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Episiotomy rates</HEADING>
<P>The actual episiotomy rates are described in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. Rates in the selective arm ranged from 8% to 59% with a median of 32%, in the routine arm rates ranged from 100% in four studies through to 51%, with a median of 83%.</P>
<P>The difference within trials between the selective and the routine episiotomy groups ranged from 21% to 92% more episiotomies in the control arm.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Operative delivery rates</HEADING>
<P>The operative delivery rate in the selective arm ranged from 1% (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>) to 8% (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>), median of 4% (<LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). In the comparator, routine arm rates ranged from 2% in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez 2008</LINK>), through to 15% (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>), with a median of 5%. All trials included these operative deliveries in their reporting of outcomes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Length of follow up is described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>. Three trials only reported on outcomes in the immediate postnatal period (under one month); a further three trials reported outcomes in the short term (up to six months); four studies reported on long-term follow-up (beyond six months). An additional study included follow-up beyond six months, but only reported the mean time of follow-up which would include women followed-up for a shorter period (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">At discharge (immediately postpartum up to discharge from the hospital)</HEADING>
<P>Severe perineal/vaginal trauma (review primary outcome) was reported in all studies. We compared our definition and the trial definitions (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). All the trials described third and fourth degree tears as in the standard definition, and one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>) specifically mentioned upper vaginal tear in the definition.</P>
<P>The need for perineal suturing was reported in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>).</P>

<P>Newborn Apgar scores at five minutes were reported in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Admission to special care baby unit was reported in five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sulaiman-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sulaiman 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Perineal infection was reported in two trials at three days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>) and seven days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain assessed using a visual analogue scale was reported by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>). Moderate or severe pain by visual analogue scale was only reported in one trial at three days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>). Another two trials presented pain using scores, analysed as a continuous variable (<LINK REF="STD-Dannecker-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Dannecker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). A number of trials reported pain at different time points (any measure), for example, at hospital puerperium (<LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>), at days one, two and 10 postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Klein-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Klein 1992</LINK>), seven days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>), or at 10 days postpartum (<LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>For the outcomes of days in hospital, initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, and satisfaction with the experience of childbirth, results were not reported in any of the included studies.</P>

In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Juste_x002d_Pina-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Juste-Pina 2007</LINK>, the loss to follow-up was around 4% during hospital puerperium, 5% at three months postpartum, and 9% three years after childbirth.

<P>In one study, data were not reported by randomisation group and we judged it as high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>).

Another study was also assessed as high risk as there was no description of loss to follow-up, and there appeared to be a differential loss to follow-up (at 7th day postpartum, 19 women were lost from the selective group, and 12 from the routine group (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>)).

<P>A total of 6352 participants in 12 trials were included in this review. Eleven trials with a total of 6177 participants examined selective versus routine use of episiotomy in births where a non-operative vaginal delivery was anticipated. One trial with 175 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-2008b" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 2008b</LINK>) was conducted in women where an operative vaginal delivery was anticipated and performed. This study was analysed independently (comparison B, analysis 4) and presented at the end of the main results.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. All data are included in this analysis, including all women irrespective of parity.</P>
<P>All eleven trials included in this comparison reported episiotomy rates. Event rates in both selective and routine episiotomy groups varied considerably between trials (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Main outcomes</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Severe perineal/vaginal trauma</HEADING>
<P>While all 11 trials reported this outcome, only eight of the trials contributed estimable data to the meta-analysis; overall, there was a 30% reduction in severe perineal/vaginal trauma (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.94; 5375 women; 8 trials; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 37%; low-certainty evidence (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was moderate quantitative heterogeneity in the analysis.</P>
<P>To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, we conducted a single subgroup analysis, by the degree of success of implementing the policies. In trials where the difference in episiotomy rates between selective and routine groups was less than 30%, there was no obvious difference in outcome. In trials where the difference in the rate was greater than 30%, there was a clear effect on severe vaginal/perineal trauma (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81; 4877 women, 7 contributing trials; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 21%).</P>
<P>We carried out a sensitivity analysis only including trials with adequate allocation concealment. The estimate was similar, although the point estimate of the difference was less marked (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.25; 4949 participants, 7 trials). When we only included studies with low risk of bias for follow-up, only two trials contributed and the analysis was not informative.</P>
<P>Visual assessment of the funnel plot suggests possible publication bias, with small studies showing that routine episiotomy resulted in higher rates of perineal trauma (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>). This is noted in the GRADE assessment.</P>

One showed a marked average difference, and the other study showed no important difference, which was apparent in the statistical test for heterogeneity (T<SUP>2 </SUP>= 902.46; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 72%). The average effect from meta-analysis was little different (mean difference 27 mL less with selective, 95% CI 74.80 less to 20.49 more; 336 women; 2 trials; <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>; very low-certainty evidence<I>).</I>

One trial (<LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>) used the individual women's score to categorise by severity, and provided an analysis on women with moderate to severe pain at day three, not detecting a difference between the two groups (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.05, 165 women; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

One trial reported 'any pain at 10 days', with no clear difference detected (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); three trials reported 'moderate-severe pain in first 10 days' with no clear difference between the two groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.12; 1127 women; <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>).

However, the reasons for suturing were not set out in trial reports, and repair of episiotomy incisions were not clearly differentiated from other perineal suturing. Clearly, any woman that had an episiotomy - either routinely or selectively - would require suturing, Some women that had episiotomy may have required further sutures if the incision was extended by tearing during the birth. Two trials reported the outcome "perineal surgical repair" (<LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK>); in the <LINK REF="STD-Ali-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ali 2004</LINK> trial all women in the routine episiotomy group had "surgical repair" while in the <LINK REF="STD-Belizan-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Belizan 1993</LINK> trial most women in this group had repair. It was not clear whether women required any sutures over and above those needed to repair the surgical incision. In the selective episiotomy groups fewer women had surgical repair, but in this group it was not clear what proportion of the women required repair of an episiotomy, repair beyond that needed to suture any episiotomy incision, or had non-episiotomy tears requiring sutures. Two trials reported the outcome "required suturing" (<LINK REF="STD-Eltorkey-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Eltorkey 1994</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Sleep-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Sleep 1984</LINK>) and similar issues arise regarding lack of clarity. Results do not reveal any possible differences in the proportions of episiotomy and non-episiotomy perineal repair in the two study groups. In the other two trials, we have presented the number of women undergoing perineal suturing by adding the numbers for episiotomy, second degree tear and above (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-House-1986" TYPE="STUDY">House 1986</LINK>). Although for completeness we have presented these data in <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>, we have not pooled data as studies may have been examining different outcomes, and within studies what was reported for the routine and selective groups may also have differed. Overall, compared with the routine episiotomy group, fewer women in the selective episiotomy group required perineal suturing. However, without clear outcome definition, findings from studies are not simple to interpret and may be meaningless from a clinical point of view.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-25 11:21:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials (6177 women), 11 in women in labour for whom a vaginal birth was intended, and one in women where an assisted birth was anticipated. Two were large trials (more than 1000 women, from Argentina and the UK), and the rest smaller, from Canada, Columbia, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Spain. Eight were only in primiparous women, and four both primiparous and multiparous women.</P>
<P>For women in whom an unassisted vaginal birth was intended, selective episiotomy resulted in less severe perineal/vaginal trauma. Both selective and routine episiotomy seemed to have little or no effect on Apgar less than seven at five minutes or on blood loss at delivery<I>.</I>
</P>
<P>Pain was measured with an objective scale at three days in one study, and we do not know if selective episiotomy compared to routine results in fewer women with moderate or severe pain; there is probably little or no difference for long-term (at least six months) dyspareunia and there may be little or no difference in the number suffering from urinary incontinence from six months onwards or other long-term effects, such as genital prolapse.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses by parity showed no clear evidence of a difference between primi- and multi-gravid women. The subgroup analysis by surgical method (midline and mediolateral) did not detect any modifying effects.</P>
<P>One trial examined selective episiotomy compared to routine episiotomy in women where an operative vaginal delivery was intended. The results of this study with 175 women did not show clear differences on main and other outcomes between the restrictive and routine use of episiotomy, but the analysis was underpowered.</P>
<P>Overall, careful assessment of women's pain was not well performed in any of the studies. The included studies did not provide any data relating to breastfeeding, the number of days in hospital after birth, or women's satisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus the rationale commonly used to justify routine episiotomy (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) is not supported by any evidence from randomised trials.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-01 17:15:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The outcomes of the review included both potential benefits and harms. Overall, there were clear differences between groups for severe perineal trauma but for low Apgar score at 5 minutes and other important outcomes, with no clear differences were shown.</P>
<P>Long-term outcomes were considered as important, but measuring long-term outcomes is not easy and even when it is attempted there is often high loss at follow up. Subsequent pregnancy was not excluded from the long-term outcomes in a few studies, which might not truly reflect the effect of selective episiotomy. Very few good estimates of pain were available to us and none of the studies reported women's preferences. The studies included in the review were carried out over a wide range of locations, including Europe, North America, South America, and Asian countries. We have restricted the main analysis to births where "vaginal delivery is anticipated" rather than "operative vaginal delivery is anticipated". This was because we were not sure whether these results would apply to operative vaginal delivery.</P>
<P>Based on the logic framework, routine episiotomy appears to offer no advantages or benefits. Evidence in the short term is clear, and some evidence in the long term. No data were available on short-term indicators of hospital stay, initiation of breastfeeding, and long-term indicators such as urinary fistula, rectal fistula and women's satisfaction.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-01-17 12:13:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The quality of evidence for the main outcome "severe perineal/vaginal trama" was low. The downgrading on imprecision was because of no or few events, The downgrading on inconsistency was due to the heterogeneity in study population for long-term outcomes -the mix of women with or without subsequent delivery after selective episiotomy (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). The heterogeneity appeared to be explained by dividing trials into those where there was a clear difference in the proportion of women receiving episiotomies between intervention and control.</P>
<P>Overall, there was moderate bias in the included studies although several studies had high risk of bias relating to incomplete outcome data. Long-term follow up can be challenging. Some trials did carry this out, and this is important since these long term outcomes related to the presumed benefit of selective episiotomy (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). There was considerable loss to follow-up in some trials and it was not easy to determine whether this might have caused bias differentially, but the results certainly did not demonstrate any harms of a policy of selective episiotomy.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-01-17 12:13:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In early 1980s, the routine use of episiotomy was questioned since there were no supporting data to show more benefits than risks (<LINK REF="REF-Banta-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Banta 1982</LINK>). This review has provided the evidence that routine use of episiotomy could do harm. The main findings of this review are consistent with the previous version of this review that also compared selective episiotomy with routine episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Carroli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroli 2009</LINK>). Both this and the previous version of our review found that selective episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy resulted in less severe perineal/vaginal trauma, and less need for perineal suture. Evidence synthesis by another review also reported that maternal outcomes of routine episiotomy including severe perineal laceration, pain and pain medication use were no better than in women with selective use of episiotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Hartmann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartmann 2005</LINK>). However, our review presents the main evidence alongside the use of GRADE - the other reviews have not done so.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-01 17:21:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-02-01 17:16:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Proponents of episiotomy argue that routine episiotomy facilitates delivery, that surgical healing results in better outcomes, and that the procedure reduces third- and fourth-degree tears, as outlined in our logic framework (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). In terms of the outcomes reflecting these arguments, the evidence does not support a policy of routine episiotomy: we identified increased risk of severe perineal/vaginal trauma; and no clear difference on blood loss at delivery, babies with newborn Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, perineal infection, women with moderate or severe pain (measured by visual analogue scale), long-term dyspareunia (at least six months) and long-term urinary incontinence (at least six months) when compared with the policy of selective episiotomy.</P>
<P>Practically speaking, it is probable that an episiotomy means that women require a longer postnatal stay in hospital while their episiotomy heals. Women with an intact perineum usually leave much more quickly. This is more convenient, and reduces hospital costs. Further cost-effectiveness analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Borghi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borghi 2002</LINK>) may help elucidate the extent of cost savings with selective episiotomy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-02-01 17:21:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The data on pain were mostly not well collected or standardised, which may reflect the age of the studies. Activities of daily living measured by a validated scale might have helped when comparing two different policies of episiotomy. Blood loss estimates were not measured using a standard approach, and future studies in instrumental delivery would benefit from clear and standardised outcome definition. Few trials reported some of our key outcomes: low Apgar score at five minutes was reported in only two trials, perineal infection in two, perineal pain in one, long term dyspareunia in three, and urinary incontinence in three trials, as well as any possible effect on breastfeeding. The trials included in this review did not appear to consider women's preferences and views on these procedures and the outcomes important to them.</P>
<P>Other remaining questions relate to relative effects with the type of episiotomy (midline or mediolateral, or different angles of episiotomy).</P>

<PRO_REV_DIFF MODIFIED="2017-02-02 17:06:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We removed Objective 2 of the protocol, "to compare midline and mediolateral episiotomy" since we found it inappropriate to include this objective in the course of writing the review, as the topic 'selective versus routine episiotomy for vaginal birth' and which procedure is used are two different topics. We did look in a subgroup analysis for evidence of a difference in effects depending on the procedure, but there was no obvious pattern. We think it better to carry out another independent review to make this comparison, although we did not find eligible studies comparing these two surgical procedures.</P>
<P>In the protocol, the primary outcome was described as "Severe perineal trauma including, severe vaginal trauma, or severe perineal and vaginal trauma (third- or fourth-degree trauma, irrespective of allocated group, as defined in the background)". We noted during the review that it was a little ambiguous as to where this actually included vaginal trauma, so we altered the descriptor slightly to make this explicit.</P>
<P>In the protocol we included "first or second degree perineal trauma". This outcome is uninformative as it excludes women with severe trauma. The outcome, "any trauma" is also uninformative as the control group expects women to receive an episiotomy, which is in effect "second degree trauma" but would not be reported as such. We therefore dropped this outcome.</P>
<P>Since the previous version of this review, we have changed the title from 'Episiotomy for vaginal birth' to 'Selective versus routine use of episiotomy for vaginal birth' for clarity about the scope of the review.</P>
<P>Since only one trial reported perineal pain measured by visual analogue scale, we also reported pain at different time points by any measure of interest. We think this would be informative for clinical practice.</P>

<P>"One thousand women (93% of those who met the criteria for entry) were allocated at random to one of two management policies. But 885 were assessed on 10 days postpartum, and 895 assessed on three months postpartum." The follow-up rate at both 10 days and 3 months after delivery was 89%.</P>
<P>For 3-years' follow-up, the loss to follow-up was about 33%. There was the description "no attempt was made to contact 15 women: eight were known to speak little English; two had refused to adoption; open baby had been taken into care; and one baby had died in the neonatal period. 481 (49%) of the remaining 985 participants had changed their address in the three years since the original study, of whom 303 (31%) were still living within West Berkshire Health Authority. The new address of 100 of the remaining 178 women was not known". Another 63 women were unable to trace because they had "registered in different name (one woman had changed her name six times during the three days), or failed to reregister for medical care in a different area, or because their husbands had been transferred to military posts overseas; one mother had died"</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals range from no important difference to large difference.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for heterogeneity: there is moderate heterogeneity. Random-effects model gives confidence intervals that cross 1 (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.09). However, a subgroup analysis shows that the selective episiotomy has been well implemented (episiotomy rate difference between intervention and control &gt; 30%) there was a more substantial effect (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81; 8 trials; n = 4877).<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP>Funnel plot suggests publication bias with small studies showing that routine episiotomy results in higher perineal trauma.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for risk of bias: both studies used visual inspection with no specific training, but visual EBL consistently results in underestimation of large volumes and over estimation of large volumes.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals range from no important average loss to an important average loss<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for inconsistency: large, probably clinically important effect in 1 trial and no effect evident in the other trial<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for imprecision as there were no events. Risk difference 0.0 (-0.01 to 0.01). The risk difference provides confidence intervals indicating we are confident in there being little or no difference, although for rare but important events a larger sample size is required.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP>Apgar &lt; 7 at 1 minute was measured in 4 trials, with RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.43), with no detectable heterogeneity.<BR/>
<SUP>9</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: few events, and CI included appreciable benefit and harm. (The analysis is under-powered to detect a difference between groups; the sample size required to half 2% infection rate in the control group to 1% in the intervention group with 90% power at 5% significance would be 6202)<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP>Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: sample size to lower the 30% pain in the selective episiotomy compared to routine would need a total size of 586 with 90% power at 5% significance level, and wide confidence intervals from substantively fewer to no fewer<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for indirectness: only one trial conducted 32 years ago. Conditions, expectations, and pain relief strategies have changed, and we don't know how representative this trial is.<BR/>
<SUP>12</SUP>Additional trials report on average pain scores in the first 5 days, in a total of 355 women. Pain scores in all 3 trials were similar between the 2 groups (additional table 5).<BR/>
<SUP>13</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for imprecision: confidence intervals have a wide range.<BR/>
<SUP>14</SUP>Downgraded by 1 for risk of bias: 3 trials included, 2 trials, 1 with small sample size and 1 with large sample size had high rate of loss to follow-up, around 35%, 1 trial with large sample size had low loss to follow-up, less than 10%.</P>

<P>The relative risks reported in the results section have been calculated using a fixed effects analysis. There is significant heterogeneity in the outcomes for suturing and perineal trauma. Use of the fixed effects approach ignores this variability between studies, producing artificially narrow confidence intervals. For example, the relative risk for 'need for suturing perineal trauma' changes from 0.74 (0.71,0.77) to 0.71(0.61,0.81) with a random effects model, and that for 'any anterior trauma' changes from 1.79 (1.55,2.07) to 1.48 (0.99,2.21).</P>

<P>In cases of heterogeneity among the results of the studies, it is clearly of interest to determine the causes by conducting subgroup analyses or meta-regression on the basis of biological characteristics of the population, use of different interventions, methodological quality of the studies, etc, to find the source of heterogeneity. Trying to find the source of heterogeneity, we performed beforehand a sensitivity analysis stratifying by parity. When the heterogeneity were not readily explained by this sensitivity analysis, we used a random-effects model. A random-effects meta-analysis model involves an assumption that the effects being estimated in the different studies are not identical, but follow similar distribution. However, one needs to be careful in interpreting these results as, the relative risk summary for the random-effects model tend to show a larger treatment effect than the fixed-effect model while not eliminating the heterogeneity itself (Villar 2001).</P>

<P>This important and well-performed review assesses the effects of selective use of episiotomy compared with routine episiotomy during vaginal birth. We would like to have more information on several important definitions, used in this review. It is known that there are several strong indications for the use of an episiotomy, such as fetal distress, breech delivery and assisted delivery. We can presume that with &#8220;restricted use of episiotomy&#8221; the review authors mean that there was no episiotomy used, unless there was such a strong indication for an episiotomy in that specific case. We wonder what the exact indications were in this specific review. To prevent confusion, we think it is necessary to have a clear description of what is meant by a &#8220;restrictive use of episiotomy&#8221; policy in this Cochrane review.<BR/>
<BR/>The exact definitions of &#8220;anterior perineal trauma&#8221; and &#8220;posterior perineal trauma&#8221; are described properly under the subheading &#8220;description of the condition&#8221;. In addition, the various degrees of spontaneous ruptures are well-defined. However, the terms &#8220;severe vaginal/perineal trauma&#8221; (outcome 5) and &#8220;severe perineal trauma&#8221; (outcome 8) are not well described. We can assume involvement of the anal sphincter complex (third and fourth degree ruptures) is defined as severe trauma. Unfortunately, this is not described in the background text, although it is of great importance to interpret the outcomes of the review correctly.<BR/>
<BR/>Similarly, the exact definitions of Outcomes 21, 24 and 27 (Moderate/severe perineal pain in 3 days; - 10 days;  -3 months) are not clear. The methods used in the individual trials to assess the degree of experienced pain, for example the standardized visual analogue score, are not described. In Outcome 33 (Healing complications at 7 days), there is no specification of these complications and/or symptoms involved with healing complications. Therefore, it is not possible for the reader to determine how serious these complications were. <BR/>
<BR/>In conclusion, we think that this review would gain strength if the above mentioned definitions are added to the description of the data.<BR/>

<P>In this newly updated review, the detailed definitions of severe perineal/vaginal trauma have been listed in the Background. For perineal pain, we have set 'moderate and severe pain measured by the standardized visual analogue score' in the main outcome and included it in the GRADE. We also reported other self-reported pains at different time points of interest. Please refer to Data and Analysis 1.5 and 1.11. We hope the analysis is clear to understand. Thank you for your helpful comments.</P>
