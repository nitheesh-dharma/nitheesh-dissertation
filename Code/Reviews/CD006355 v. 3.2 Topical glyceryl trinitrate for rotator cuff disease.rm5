<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-10 22:29:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of glyceryl trinitrate patches on rotator cuff disease (RCD).</P>
<P>
<B>Pain</B>
</P>
<P>- glyceryl trinitrate patches (5 mg/day) may improve pain slightly.<BR/>- the effects of glyceryl trinitrate patches (1.25 mg/day) along with rehabilitation instruction (such as exercise) and glyceryl trinitrate patches (5 mg/day) compared to injection with corticosteroid and painkillers on pain were not reported by the studies included in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Symptoms of RCD</B>
</P>
<P>- it is uncertain whether glyceryl trinitrate patches (5 mg/day) eliminate symptoms of RCD because of the very low quality of the evidence.<BR/>- glyceryl trinitrate (1.25 mg/day) along with rehabilitation instruction (such as exercise) may be no more likely to eliminate symptoms than rehabilitation instruction alone.<BR/>- the effect of glyceryl trinitrate patches (5 mg/day) compared to injection with corticosteroid and painkillers could not be determined in this review.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<B>Physical Function</B>
<BR/>- improvement in peoples&#8217; physical function was not measured by any of the studies included in the review.</P>
<P>
<B>Side Effects</B>
</P>
<P>- it is uncertain whether topical glyceryl trinitrate (5 mg/day) has side effects such as headache because of the very low quality of the evidence.<BR/>- glyceryl trinitrate (1.25 mg/day) along with rehabilitation instruction (such as exercise) may be no more likely to cause headache or rash than rehabilitation instruction alone.</P>
<P>
<B>What is rotator cuff disease and what is glyceryl trinitrate?</B>
</P>
<P>The rotator cuff is a group of tendons that surrounds the shoulder joint. In some people, the muscles and tendons pinch when they move their shoulder over and over again. The pinching can cause the rotator cuff to swell, break down and it may tear away from the bone - this is called rotator cuff disease or tendonitis. In a lot of people, it is a normal part of ageing and they may not have symptoms. But many people with rotator cuff disease do have pain in their shoulder at some time that may not go away on its own.</P>
<P>Topical glyceryl trinitrate (also called nitroglycerin or nitroglycerine) has been used to treat chest pain for many years, and has been proposed as a promising treatment for muscle and tendon injuries. For treatment of soft tissue conditions glyceryl trinitrate is delivered topically, through the skin, using medicated patches.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-10 22:44:39 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three small studies, one at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk of bias, were included. Meta-analysis was precluded due to different interventions and outcome measures. Study participants also had differing durations of symptoms and data for pain and function could only be extracted from one study. One placebo-controlled trial (20 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, among participants with 'acute supraspinatus tendinitis' of less than seven days duration. Treatment resulted in reduced pain intensity (adjusted MD -3.50, 95% CI -3.96 to -3.04). Function was not measured. One trial (53 participants) compared one quarter of a 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patch used daily for up to 24 weeks combined with rehabilitation to placebo patches and rehabilitation among participants with 'supraspinatus tendinopathy' for longer than six months. A third trial (48 participants) tested 5 mg glyceryl trinitrate patches, used daily for three days, compared to corticosteroid injection among participants with 'rotator cuff tendinitis' of less than six-weeks duration. Fifteen out of 24 participants in the glyceryl trinitrate treatment reported headache (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96).</P>

<P>There is some evidence from one study at high risk of bias that topical glyceryl trinitrate is more effective than placebo for rotator cuff disease among patients with acute symptoms (&lt; seven-days duration), but there is insufficient evidence to be certain about their longer-term effects. Headache was a common side effect in one trial and any benefits of treatment need to be balanced against the risk of headache. Further high quality research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this new therapy.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 09:33:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Shoulder disorders are a common cause of musculoskeletal morbidity in the community and affect 7% to 30% of adults at any one time, based on self-reported surveys (<LINK REF="REF-Bjelle-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bjelle 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chard-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chard 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pope-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pope 1997</LINK>). These disorders cause pain and limitation of shoulder movement and often result in substantial disability, absence from work, and increased use of healthcare services. Shoulder pain is the third most common musculoskeletal reason for seeking medical care, after back and knee pain (<LINK REF="REF-Bot-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bot 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bridges_x002d_Webb-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridges-Webb 1992</LINK>). It accounts for 1.2% of all general practice encounters in Australia (<LINK REF="REF-Britt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Britt 2007</LINK>) and up to 10% of all referrals to physiotherapists in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Peters-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peters 1994</LINK>). Shoulder pain persists or recurs in 40% of people within one year after their first visit to a primary care physician (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Windt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Windt 1996</LINK>) and has a substantial impact upon quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-MacDermid-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDermid 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2005</LINK>). Effective treatment that shortens the duration of symptoms and disability has the potential to be of significant value in terms of reduced morbidity and costs to both the individual and the community.</P>
<P>Rotator cuff disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain seen by physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Ostor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ostor 2005</LINK>). It is estimated to occur in up to 50% of people aged 75 years or over (<LINK REF="REF-Urwin-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urwin 1998</LINK>) and the incidence is expected to rise with the ageing of the population (<LINK REF="REF-Gomoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gomoll 2004</LINK>). One recent small population study reported that shoulder pain was the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition in people aged over 65 years (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2005</LINK>). A wide range of pathophysiological conditions are included under this umbrella term, including rotator cuff tendonitis or tendinopathy, supraspinatus, infraspinatus or subscapularis tendonitis, subacromial bursitis, and partial and complete rotator cuff tears. Unfortunately, there is currently no uniformity in how these conditions are labeled and defined (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2009b</LINK>). Among published controlled trials for rotator cuff disease, the definition most commonly used is based on clinical features and includes the presence of positive impingement signs including a painful arc and pain with resisted movements or normal passive range of motion (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pathophysiology of rotator cuff disease has traditionally been viewed as a continuum that ranges from impingement syndrome to partial- and full-thickness rotator cuff tears (<LINK REF="REF-Neer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neer 1983</LINK>). While it is commonly believed that intrinsic degeneration of the rotator cuff tendons together with repetitive microtrauma contribute to its development (<LINK REF="REF-Ogata-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ogata 1990</LINK>) it is probably multifactorial, and many conflicting theories have been presented (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>). Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, asymptomatic partial and full-thickness rotator cuff tears have been demonstrated in 4% of individuals less than 40 years old and in more than 50% of individuals more than 60 years old (<LINK REF="REF-Sher-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sher 1995</LINK>). It is currently not known how many asymptomatic rotator cuff tears will subsequently become symptomatic. For example, one study of middle-aged people who presented with unilateral shoulder pain and had the contralateral shoulder examined by ultrasound suggested that 50% of asymptomatic rotator cuff tears become symptomatic within five years (<LINK REF="REF-Yamaguchi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamaguchi 2001</LINK>); while in another study in asymptomatic young elite over the head athletes, none of the eight athletes with partial or full-thickness tears found on magnetic resonance imaging had developed symptoms five years later (<LINK REF="REF-Connor-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Connor 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The diagnosis of rotator cuff disease in primary care is predominantly made by history and physical examination. Patients may present with impingement-type symptoms, manifested as pain at night and at rest as well as painful movement, with or without features of a torn rotator cuff tendon such as painful weakness and atrophy. The diagnostic utility of various physical examination tests is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Hegedus-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hegedus 2008</LINK>), however rotator cuff disease is usually distinguishable from adhesive capsulitis by the lack of global restriction of movement. Imaging techniques are also limited in their usefulness for diagnosis. Plain radiographs may exclude other causes of shoulder pain such as glenohumeral osteoarthritis, the presence of calcific deposits which are usually situated just proximal to the rotator cuff insertion, or an acromial spur that might impinge on the rotator cuff. Elevation of the humeral head, together with narrowing of the subacromial space, might indicate the presence of a large rotator cuff tear (<LINK REF="REF-Weiner-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiner 1970</LINK>). Imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI are both useful for detecting full thickness rotator cuff tears and have less accuracy for detection of partial-thickness tears (<LINK REF="REF-Dinnes-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dinnes 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2007</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-05-12 09:33:29 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives of treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff disease are to relieve pain and restore movement and function of the shoulder. Commonly used treatments include corticosteroid injections (<LINK REF="REF-Buchbinder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchbinder 2003</LINK>), analgesics (<LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2005b</LINK>), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1999</LINK>), and physical modalities including exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Green-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 2003</LINK>); surgery (decompression with or without rotator cuff repair) is usually reserved for those who fail to respond to non-operative treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Coghlan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coghlan 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate (also called nitroglycerin or nitroglycerine) has been used to treat angina for many years, and has been proposed as a promising treatment for soft tissue conditions, including muscle and tendon injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK>). For treatment of soft tissue conditions glyceryl trinitrate is delivered topically, through the skin, using medicated patches. Side effects can include skin rash and, because of its vasodilation properties, headache. Both are reversible once treatment is discontinued (<LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2005b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-05-04 04:55:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate has vasodilatator properties. In treating angina, its mechanism of action is through the production of nitric oxide (NO), an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (<LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK>). Its exact mechanism of action in healing tendon or other soft tissue damage is unknown. Animal studies show that reducing the body's production of nitric oxide slows the healing of injured tendons (<LINK REF="REF-Murrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murrell 1997</LINK>). Soft tissue also needs collagen, normally produced by fibroblastic cells, for repair and nitric oxide may stimulate collagen production (<LINK REF="REF-Murrell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murrell 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2005b</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-05-04 04:56:40 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials have assessed the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate in reducing shoulder pain due to rotator cuff disease (<LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2005b</LINK>), for achilles tendonitis (<LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2004</LINK>), and for lateral elbow pain (<LINK REF="REF-Paoloni-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paoloni 2003</LINK>). The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of topical glyceryl trinitrate for rotator cuff disease, and to establish its usefulness in the context of the other available treatment options.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors assessed the titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the initial search and excluded any clearly irrelevant studies. The complete papers were retrieved for the remaining studies and independently assessed by two authors using the inclusion criteria. The authors resolved disagreements on inclusion by consensus and, if this failed, arbitration by a third author. If not enough information was available to reach a decision, the authors of the study were contacted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and management</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies including source of funding, study population, intervention, analyses, and outcomes using standardised data extraction forms. Study authors were contacted where necessary to obtain additional data.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, we extracted the number of participants randomised into the intervention and control groups. For continuous outcomes we extracted the post-intervention mean and standard deviation. For dichotomous outcomes we extracted the number of events. For ordinal outcomes we extracted the number of participants falling into each category.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study against key criteria: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other sources of bias. Studies that did not adequately address these criteria were considered at high risk of bias. These methods have been updated since the publication of the protocol for this review to reflect revised guidance from The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008a</LINK>). Authors were not blinded with respect to study authors, institution, or journal. The authors resolved disagreements by consensus, with a third author consulted if disagreements persisted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Measures of treatment effect</HEADING>
<P>Where possible, the results of each study were plotted as point estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Effects were expressed as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, if individual studies used different scales to measure the same outcome (and results could not be converted into the same scale) then standardised mean differences (SMD) could be used.</P>
<P>Where baseline and post-intervention data were available in published reports, we adjusted for baseline measures by including the baseline outcome measurements as a covariate in a least-squares regression. The predicted mean scores adjusted for baseline values and standard deviations were calculated for the treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="REF-Stata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 2008</LINK>). For ordinal outcomes, we compared differences between treatment and placebo groups using the Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations rank test.</P>
<P>These methods were adopted after the publication of the protocol for the review, following statistical advice. Wherever reported data were converted or imputed, this was recorded in the notes section of the table 'Characteristics of Included studies'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Prior to meta-analysis, we assessed studies for clinical homogeneity with respect to type of therapy, control group, and the outcomes. Clinically heterogeneous studies were not combined in the analysis, but separately described. For any studies judged as clinically homogeneous, statistical heterogeneity could be tested using the chi-squared (Q) and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics. A P value of greater than 0.10 or an I<SUP>2</SUP> value greater than 50% would be considered substantial heterogeneity. Clinically and statistically homogeneous studies would be pooled using the fixed-effect model, and clinically homogeneous but statistically heterogeneous studies using the random-effects model.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of reporting biases</HEADING>
<P>Funnel plots would be constructed to identify possible publication bias if at least 10 studies were available for the meta-analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Subgroup analysis was planned, where data were available, to determine if outcomes differed for the following factors:</P>
<OL>
<LI>duration of symptoms;</LI>
<LI>dose or duration of treatment;</LI>
<LI>diagnostic criteria used to define study populations.</LI>
</OL>
<P>A sensitivity analysis was planned to assess the impact of any bias attributed to lack of allocation concealment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Summary of findings tables</HEADING>
<P>We presented the main results of the review in 'Summary of findings tables', which include an overall grading of the evidence using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008b</LINK>) and a summary of the available data on the main outcomes, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2008a</LINK>). For dichotomous outcomes, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated from the control group event rate and the risk ratio using the Visual Rx NNT calculator (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2004</LINK>). For continuous outcomes, the NNT was calculated using the Wells calculator software, available from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group editorial office (www.cochranemsk.org).</P>

<P>All three trials to varying degrees reported outcomes selectively, limiting the data available for extraction and meta-analysis and introducing a high risk of reporting bias. <LINK REF="STD-Pons-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2001</LINK> measured and reported only two outcomes: pain and adverse events. Although the study measured pain on a continuous scale, the results were reported on a short ordinal scale, which reduced the sensitivity of measurement. Similarly, <LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK> measured some outcomes as continuous measures but reported them as short ordinal scales (including duration of pain in the previous 24 hours, duration of sleep, and range of motion).</P>
<P>Reporting of results by <LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK> was variable.

<P>The trials were also at risk of other potential sources of bias. All three studies measured or reported some continuous outcomes (for example pain) as short ordinal scales that were difficult to interpret clinically, and which were likely to be insensitive instruments that were at risk of underestimating the effect of the glyceryl trinitrate treatment.</P>
<P>In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK> did not address differences at baseline between groups. However, we noted that participants in the treatment group had greater pain intensity and more restriction of joint motion at baseline compared to those in the placebo group, which could overestimate the effect of glyceryl trinitrate. This study also reported discontinuation of recruitment into the study after analysing the results obtained from the first 20 patients.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2001</LINK> offered repeat treatments to participants in both intervention groups if treatment failed, thus delivering different numbers of treatments to some participants and measuring outcomes at different time points. More participants had repeat treatments, and ultimately treatment success, in the injection group, while some participants may have refused additional treatments in the glyceryl trinitrate group due to adverse events (and thus were measured as treatment failures). This treatment regimen may reflect actual clinical practice but may also have influenced the results of the study.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 08:33:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis could not be performed due to the different interventions and different outcome measures across the included studies; as well as the reporting of outcome measures in a form that could not be extracted for meta-analysis, or could not be interpreted in a clinically meaningful way (for example short ordinal scales for some continuous outcomes). In addition, the trials included people with differing duration of symptoms.</P>
<P>
<B>Glyceryl trinitrate 5 mg per day versus placebo</B>
<BR/>Evidence from one study (20 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK>) indicated that glyceryl trinitrate significantly reduced pain intensity at 24 and 48 hours after treatment (adjusted MD -1.05, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.58; adjusted MD -3.50, 95% CI -3.96 to -3.04, respectively, adjusted for baseline difference by review authors) (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). We could not perform analyses on the duration of pain or restriction of joint motion outcomes as both measures were reported as short ordinal scales converted from the original continuous measures, which were difficult to interpret in a clinically meaningful way.</P>
<P>More participants receiving glyceryl trinitrate were free of all symptoms at 15 days (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.50) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). The authors reported that two participants experienced headache but did not report which treatment group these participants belonged to.</P>
<P>
<B>Glyceryl trinitrate 1.25 mg per day with rehabilitation instruction versus placebo with rehabilitation instruction</B>
<BR/>Evidence from one study (53 participants, 57 shoulders) (<LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK>) was available for this comparison however there were no data suitable for extraction for the primary outcomes of pain and function. There were no differences between the glyceryl trinitrate and placebo groups in the proportion of participants who were asymptomatic at 24 weeks (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>), although the study authors reported that a Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for this outcome was statistically significant (P = 0.007).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK> also indicated no differences between treatment and placebo in the proportion of participants without impingement on external rotation at any time point (2, 6, 12, or 24 weeks) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). There were significantly more participants without impingement on internal rotation with glyceryl trinitrate treatment at 6 weeks (RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.11 to 6.54) and 24 weeks (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.15) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the proportion of participants reporting adverse events by the end of the study at 24 weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). Fifteen participants (58%) in the glyceryl trinitrate group compared to nine participants (33%) in the placebo group reported headache (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.24). Three participants (12%) in the glyceryl trinitrate group compared to one participant (4%) in the placebo group reported a rash (RR 3.12, 95% CI 0.35 to 28.06).</P>
<P>
<B>Glyceryl trinitrate 5 mg per day versus injection with corticosteroid and anaesthetic</B>
<BR/>One study (48 participants) (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2001</LINK>) provided evidence for this comparison but did not report an appropriate measure of pain and did not measure function. The authors report complete improvement in 19/24 (79%), partial improvement in 3/24 (12%), and treatment failure in 2/24 (8%) of participants treated with corticosteroid injection; and complete improvement in 5/24 (21%), partial improvement in 5/24 (21%), and treatment failure in 14/24 (58%) of participants treated with glyceryl trinitrate. The authors report that these differences were statistically significant. We could not independently analyse this outcome in RevMan, as it was measured using a short ordinal scale, so did not verify the finding. Treatment with glyceryl trinitrate resulted in more adverse effects (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). Fifteen participants in the glyceryl trinitrate group reported headache (RR 31.00, 95% CI 1.96 to 490.31). Four participants in the corticosteroid injection group reported pain at the injection site (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-04 08:26:07 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence to assess if glyceryl trinitrate patches are effective in treating rotator cuff disease. Three small studies, one at moderate risk of bias and two at high risk of bias, assessed the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate but each reported different treatment regimens and different outcome measures. They also included participants with differing duration of symptoms. The inclusion criteria varied between studies and the selective reporting of outcomes limited the analysis of the available data.</P>
<P>Of the primary outcomes of pain and function, pain was reported adequately in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK>) and no study reported a validated function or shoulder disability measure. <LINK REF="STD-Berrazueta-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Berrazueta 1996</LINK> suggested that glyceryl trinitrate at 5 mg per day reduced pain at 24 and 48 hours following treatment in participants experiencing rotator cuff symptoms for seven days when compared with placebo.</P>
<P>A second placebo-controlled study including participants with longer-term rotator cuff tendonitis (at least three months), and using a lower treatment dose (1.25 mg per day) found few significant effects (<LINK REF="STD-Paoloni-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Paoloni 2005a</LINK>).</P>
<P>It is not clear how topical glyceryl trinitrate compares with other treatments available for rotator cuff disease. One study compared glyceryl trinitrate (5 mg per day) with corticosteroid injection but did not provide appropriate measures of effects, and participants received varying numbers of treatment cycles. The comparative benefit of the two treatments remains uncertain (<LINK REF="STD-Pons-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pons 2001</LINK>), which is consistent with the results of a Cochrane systematic review of 26 trials of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain (<LINK REF="REF-Buchbinder-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchbinder 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Glyceryl trinitrate treatment appears to be associated with headache, although the effect was not significant at the lower treatment dose.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-05-10 22:38:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence from one study at high risk of bias that glyceryl trinitrate patches are more effective than placebo for rotator cuff disease among patients with short-term symptoms, but there is insufficient reliable evidence to be certain of the effect in participants with longer-term rotator cuff disease. The development of headache may limit its usefulness in clinical practice but this is uncertain as well. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-10 22:39:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More reliable trials with validated measures of pain and shoulder function or disability outcomes, and larger numbers of participants, are required to better determine the effectiveness and safety of glyceryl trinitrate for rotator cuff disease. Trials should investigate the dosage and period of time for which the treatment is administered to clarify the most effective treatment regimen, and also investigate the duration of effect. Comparative effects against other existing treatments should be more fully investigated. As well, a uniform method for labelling and defining rotator cuff disease is needed to ensure homogeneity of trial populations across trials.</P>

<P>Authors thanked Dr A Higgs from Wellcome Research Laboratories (Beckenham) for help in correction of manuscript.</P>
<P>The authors presented individual participant data at baseline, 24 and 48 hours for pain intensity, duration of pain and restricted motion. For pain intensity, the review authors were able to calculate post-intervention measures of pain intensity at 24 and 48 hours, adjusted for baseline pain intensity by including the baseline outcome measurements as a covariate in a least squares regression. The predicted mean scores adjusted for baseline and standard deviations were calculated for the treatment and placebo groups (<LINK REF="REF-Stata-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stata 2008</LINK>). Although duration of pain (hours) and restriction of joint motion (degrees) are continuous outcomes, the trial authors grouped the data into 5-point ordinal scales. We judged the result to be difficult to interpret clinically, and thus did not present the data.</P>

<P>Comment: both groups received an active intervention: one group received patches and the other injections, and the authors did not state that participants also received a sham-injection or sham patch, thus we judged it is likely that participants were aware of their treatment. The published trial did not report if outcome assessors were blinded; correspondence from the author indicates that the investigator assessed outcomes at each visit, and prescribed further treatment if the patient was not responding, thus it is likely the invesigator assessing outcomes was aware of treatment.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>Comment: although the study authors measured duration of pain in last 24 hours and restriction of joint motion, they presented the data in 5-point ordinal scales only (rather than as continuous data), which are difficult to interpret clinically. Hours of sleep was measured (also converted to ordinal data by the study authors) but results not reported, apart from a statement that sleep had improved slightly in the intervention group and not the control group. Adverse effects of headache and dizziness were described as secondary outcomes, but headache results were only reported at 24 hours for the whole study population and were not broken down by treatment group; and dizziness was not reported.

<P>Comment: incomplete reporting of outcomes, so that data could not be extracted in a form suitable for meta-analysis, as follows. Pain at night: means and standard errors presented graphically at all time points (we could not estimate mean and SD) and P value presented only for the differences between means at weeks 12 and 24; pain at rest: no data for week 2 and 6, P values only at week 12 and 24; pain with activity: P value at week 24 only. Forward flexion range of motion, external rotation range of motion, subacromial tenderness, impingement in external rotation: P value presented only, not stated for which time point (presumably overall).

<P>Quote: "After 20 patients were treated we opened the study, looked at the results and decided to stop."</P>
<P>Comment: Decision to stop recruiting was inappropriately based on known results. The study authors do not report a pre-specified sample size, or any formal stopping rules. Baseline imbalance was also identified: participants in the glyceryl trinitrate group had greater pain intensity and more restriction of joint motion compared to placebo group, which is likely to overestimate the effect of the glyceryl trinitrate.</P>

<P>Comment: the authors report a post-hoc analysis of group mean outcome measures (presented graphically and as mean and range). Pain (at rest, with activity, at night) was measured using a 5-point ordinal scale, and tenderness on a 4-point ordinal scale; these may be too insensitive to detect clinically significant changes, and may have underestimated the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on pain.</P>
