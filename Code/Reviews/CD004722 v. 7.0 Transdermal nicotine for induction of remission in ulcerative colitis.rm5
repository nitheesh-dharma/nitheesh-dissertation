<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Ulcerative colitis is largely a disease of nonsmokers. Intermittent smokers often experience improvement in their symptoms while smoking. Nonsmokers with ulcerative colitis who begin smoking may go into remission. Randomized controlled trials were developed to test the efficacy of transdermal nicotine for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. </P>

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-06-20 13:50:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE databases were searched using the search criteria "ulcerative colitis" and "transdermal nicotine" or "nicotine" to identify relevant papers published between 1970 and June 2008. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed to identify additional studies. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included only randomized controlled trials in which patients with active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis were randomly allocated to receive transdermal nicotine (15 to 25 mg/day) or a placebo or another treatment (corticosteroids or mesalamine).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data extraction and assessment of the methodological quality of each trial were independently performed by each author. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients achieving clinical or sigmoidoscopic remission as defined by the primary studies (e.g. no symptoms of ulcerative colitis), and expressed as a percentage of the patients randomized (intention to treat analysis). Secondary outcomes included clinical response, adverse events and withdrawal because of adverse events.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-20 13:50:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Nine studies were identified, five of which met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of two trials in which 71 patients were randomized to nicotine and 70 to placebo showed a statistically significant benefit for nicotine treatment. After four to six weeks of treatment 19 of 71 patients treated with transdermal nicotine were in clinical remission compared to 9 of 70 treated with placebo (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.02-6.45). In the same group of patients improvement or remission was noted in 29 of the 71 patients assigned to nicotine compared to 14 of 70 patients assigned to placebo (OR=2.72, 95% CI 1.28 - 5.81). For patients with left sided colitis the odds ratio was 2.31 (95% CI 1.05-5.10). When transdermal nicotine was compared to standard medical therapy no significant benefit for nicotine was observed. After four to six weeks of standard therapy (oral prednisone or mesalamine), 34 of 63 patients were in clinical or sigmoidoscopic remission compared to 33 of 66 patients treated with transdermal nicotine (OR=0.77, 95% CI 0.37-1.60). A meta-analysis of all five studies which included 137 patients treated with transdermal nicotine and 133 patients treated with a placebo or standard therapy demonstrated no statistically significant benefit of nicotine therapy (OR=1.23; 95% CI 0.71-2.14). Patients treated with transdermal nicotine were significantly more likely to withdrawal due to adverse events than patients treated with placebo or standard medical therapy (OR=5.82, 95% CI, 1.66 - 20.47) and were significantly more likely to suffer from an adverse event than patients treated with placebo or standard medical therapy (OR=3.54, 95% CI, 2.07 - 6.08).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results of this review provide evidence that transdermal nicotine is superior to placebo for the induction of remission in patient's with ulcerative colitis. The review did not identify any significant advantage for transdermal nicotine therapy compared to standard medical therapy. Adverse events associated with transdermal nicotine are significant and limit its use in some patients. <BR/> </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-06-20 13:56:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon. The etiology of ulcerative colitis is multifactorial: it is due in part to a genetic susceptibility that enables an environmental agent such as a virus or bacteria to trigger an abnormal immune reaction that results in inflammation of the intestine. Interestingly an association with cigarette smoking has been made: ulcerative colitis is largely a disease of nonsmokers and patients who have quit smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jick-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jick 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Boyko-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyko 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motley 1988</LINK>). Those colitis patients who are ex-smokers usually develop colitis within a few years of smoking cessation (<LINK REF="REF-Motley-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motley 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Motley-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Motley 1988</LINK>). Also, anecdotal reports note that intermittent smokers often experience improvement in their symptoms while smoking (<LINK REF="REF-de-Castella-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Castella 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rudra-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudra 1989</LINK>). Nonsmokers with ulcerative colitis who begin smoking may go into remission (<LINK REF="REF-Rudra-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rudra 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>The mainstay of treatment for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis has consisted of oral, intravenous or topical steroids often in combination with topical or oral aminosalicylates (<LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marshall-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marshall 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDonald-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2006</LINK>). Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) have been used in chronic active disease and to maintain remission (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenberg-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenberg 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hawthorne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawthorne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kirk-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kirk 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sood-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sood 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sood-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sood 2003</LINK>). Given the anecdotal association between smoking and ulcerative colitis, randomized controlled trials were developed to test the hypothesis that nicotine patches can induce remission of a flare of ulcerative colitis. </P>

<P>The MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE databases were searched using the search criteria "ulcerative colitis" and "transdermal nicotine" or "nicotine" to identify relevant papers published between 1970 and June 2008. Manual searches of reference lists from potentially relevant papers were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy.

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Study Selection:<BR/>Each author reviewed potentially relevant studies to determine their eligibility.</P>
<P>Data Collection:<BR/>Each author extracted data independently. Any disagreement among reviewers was resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Statistical analysis:<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 4.2.3). All data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data were extracted from the original research articles and converted into 2x2 tables. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the chi-square test. As the chi-square test has low power in the situation of a meta-analysis, when trials have small sample size or are few in number, a p value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. For pooled data, summary test statistics were derived using the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals. A fixed effects model was used for pooling of data when statistical heterogeneity was not present. When statistical heterogeneity was present a random effects model was used. The definitions of treatment success, remission and clinical improvement were set by the authors of each paper, and the data were combined for analysis only if these definitions were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus).</P>

<P>Nine randomized controlled trails of nicotine treatment for ulcerative colitis were identified. The <LINK REF="STD-Lashner-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Lashner 1990</LINK> study was excluded because nicotine gum was used and it was an N of 1 trial where patients served as their own controls. <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1995</LINK> was excluded because it was a maintenance of remission trial. The <LINK REF="STD-Ingram-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Ingram 2005a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ingram-2005b" TYPE="STUDY">Ingram 2005b</LINK> studies were excluded because nicotine enemas (6 mg) were used (See characteristics of excluded studies table).</P>
<P>Five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria: <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK> both studied transdermal nicotine versus placebo. <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK> compared transdermal nicotine to oral prednisone. <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> performed a second study comparing transdermal nicotine to oral mesalamine. The participants in all included trials were adult non smokers including lifelong nonsmokers and ex-smokers. All the participants in the five trials had active colitis despite the use of standard maintenance therapy (5-ASA and corticosteroids). The five included studies are described in detail in the characteristics of included studies table. </P>
<P>Patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK> trial were randomized to receive transdermal nicotine patch (<U>&lt;</U> 22 mg/day) or an identical placebo patch for 4 weeks of treatment. Medical therapy at entry included the use of 5-ASA compounds (nicotine: 42%, placebo: 39%), oral corticosteroids (nicotine: 16%, placebo: 12%), and both 5-ASA compounds and oral corticosteroids (nicotine: 35%, placebo: 39%). During the trial, concomitant therapy with oral 5-ASA compounds, oral corticosteroids (<U>&lt;</U> 20 mg/day), topical corticosteroids and topical mesalamine was continued at pre-study doses if the doses had not been changed during the 2 weeks preceding study entry. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> randomized patients to transdermal nicotine (mean 17 mg/day) or identical placebo patch for 6 weeks of treatment. All patients had been taking mesalamine prior to entry. All patients continued with mesalamine and glucocorticoids during the study, provided the dosage had not been changed in the 4 weeks prior to entry. A similar proportion of each group received glucocorticoids (<U>&lt;</U> 10 mg/day) during the trial (nicotine: 20%, placebo: 16%). </P>
<P>Patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK> trial were randomized to receive transdermal nicotine (15 mg/day to a maximum 25 mg/day) or oral prednisolone (15 mg/day) for 6 weeks of treatment. Most patients were taking 5-ASA drugs (mean dose 2.4 g/day) at entry (nicotine: 87%, prednisolone: 68%). These were stopped at day 10. Some patients were taking topical steroids at entry (nicotine: 10%, prednisolone: 23%) and these were stopped on the day of entry.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK> randomized patients to receive transdermal nicotine patch (15 mg/day) or oral prednisone (30 mg/day for 1 week and then tapered by decreasing the dose by 5 mg every 5 days) for 5 weeks of treatment. Prior to entry all patients received maintenance therapy of mesalamine (1 g b.i.d.). All patients continued to receive mesalamine at the same dose throughout the trial. </P>
<P>All patients in the <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> trial had failed an initial 4 week course of therapy with mesalamine 4 g rectal suspension enemas once nightly. Patients were randomized to receive transdermal nicotine (15 mg/day) or oral mesalamine (800 mg t.i.d.) for four weeks of treatment. All patients continued to receive concomitant therapy with the mesalamine enemas during the trial.</P>
<P>The clinical outcome measures used varied among the trials. <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> used Rachmilewitz's activity index to calculate disease severity. <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK> used Truelove and Witts' global clinical assessment scale; while <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK> used a 13 point scale of disease activity to assess outcome. For this analysis we were interested in complete clinical remission, an outcome that does not depend on a specific scale. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>All studies were reviewed independently by the authors to determine their methodological quality. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Four of the five included trials reported adequate approaches for allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> did not report any concealment approach thus the adequacy of allocation concealment was rated as unclear. The authors of <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> were contacted to confirm the method of randomization and that allocation was concealed. No response was received from the authors of <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK>.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Transdermal nicotine versus placebo. <BR/>A total of 141 patients were enrolled in two randomized placebo controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>); 71 randomized to nicotine and 70 to placebo. After four to six weeks of treatment 19 of 71 patients (26.8%, 95% CI: 18.9-34.6) in the nicotine groups were in clinical remission compared to 9 of 70 (12.9%, 95% CI: 7.1-18.6) who received placebo. The odds ratio for induction of remission with nicotine was statistically significant (OR=2.56, 95% CI 1.02-6.45). The absolute risk reduction or risk difference was calculated to be 0.13 (95% CI 0.01 - 0.25). The number of patients that need to be treated (number needed to treat, NNT) with nicotine patch versus placebo in addition to 5-ASA compounds and corticosteroids to prevent one bad outcome was 8. In the same group of patients clinical improvement and or remission was observed in 29 of the 71 patients assigned to nicotine (40.8%, 95% CI: 31.8-49.9) and 14 of the 70 patients assigned to placebo (20.0%, 95% CI: 13.0-27.0). The odds ratio for clinical improvement and or remission was statistically significant (OR=2.72, 95% CI 1.28 - 5.81). The absolute risk reduction or risk difference was calculated to be 0.20 (95% CI 0.06 - 0.35). The NNT with nicotine patch versus placebo in addition to 5-ASA compounds and corticosteroids was 5. Clinical improvement and or remission among patients who had left sided colitis was observed among 25/59 patients who received transdermal nicotine compared to 14/59 who received placebo. The odds ratio was statistically significant (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.05-5.10). The absolute risk reduction or risk difference was calculated to be 0.18 (95% CI 0.02 - 0.35). The NNT with nicotine patch versus placebo in addition to 5-ASA compounds and corticosteroids was 6. One study provided outcome data on patients who were lifelong nonsmokers versus patients who were ex-smokers (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>). Among lifelong nonsmokers 7/18 in the nicotine group achieved clinical improvement and or remission compared to 2/16 in the placebo group (OR=4.45, 95% CI: 0.77-25.86). Among ex-smokers 5/13 in the nicotine group achieved clinical improvement and or remission compared to 1/17 in the placebo group (OR=10.00, 95% CI: 0.99-100.61). <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> reported that there was no statistically significant relation between smoking history and response to nicotine (data not provided). None of the analyses demonstrated any significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Transdermal nicotine versus standard medical therapy.<BR/>A total of 129 patients were treated in three trials that compared nicotine for induction of remission of ulcerative colitis to standard therapy: oral prednisone (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK>) or oral mesalamine (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK>). Of the patients treated with standard medical therapy, 48 patients were treated with oral prednisone and 15 with mesalamine. After four to six weeks of standard therapy 34 of 63 patients (54.0%, 95% CI: 43.8-64.2) were in remission compared to 33 of 66 patients treated with nicotine (50%, 95% CI: 40.2-59.8). The test for heterogeneity was significant (p=.0.004). The odds ratio for clinical remission was not statistically significant (OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.12 - 6.94) using a random effects model.</P>
<P>Transdermal nicotine versus standard therapy or placebo <BR/>There were 137 patients treated with nicotine and 133 treated with standard therapy or placebo. Fifty two of the 137 patients treated with nicotine achieved remission compared to 43 of the 133 treated with either standard therapy or placebo. The test for heterogeneity was significant (p=0.004). The odds ratio for induction of remission was not statistically significant (OR=1.39, 95% CI 0.37-5.24) using a random effects model. </P>
<P>Adverse Events<BR/>Four of the five trials reported the number of patients that withdrew due to adverse events (<LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK>). Of the 122 patients treated with nicotine, 15 withdrew because of adverse events related to nicotine. The adverse events leading to withdrawal included lightheadedness, nausea and contact dermatitis. Only two patients treated with either placebo or standard therapy withdrew because of adverse events. Patients treated with nicotine were significantly more likely than placebo or standard therapy patients to withdrawal due to adverse events (OR=5.82, 95% CI 1.66 - 20.47).</P>
<P>Overall the total numbers of patients with adverse events were 74 of 137 patients treated with nicotine and 37 of 133 patients treated with placebo.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-06-20 13:50:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The induction of remission of ulcerative colitis has traditionally been achieved using either mesalamine or steroids (parenteral or oral). The observation that ulcerative colitis is primarily a disease of nonsmokers and that some patients improve when they begin to smoke, led to the hypothesis that nicotine was the active agent that leads to improvement. Uncontrolled trials were then carried out using nicotine chewing gum or a transdermal patch. These observations led to the development of five randomized controlled trials that studied transdermal nicotine for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. </P>
<P>Evidence from two randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials suggests that transdermal nicotine is more effective than placebo for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK> treated 72 patients with active ulcerative colitis and found that 17 of the 35 patients in the nicotine group had complete remissions compared to 9 of 37 in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK> randomized 64 patients in a double blind placebo controlled trial and reported that 2 of 31 patients went into clinical remission with nicotine compared to none of 33 patients treated with placebo. Although some patients in the placebo groups were in remission at the end of these studies, the improvement in the nicotine group was greater. The results of this review demonstrate that patients treated with transdermal nicotine are significantly more likely to achieve remission than those treated with placebo. </P>
<P>An important issue is whether transdermal nicotine is effective in all patients or only in ex-smokers. The <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK> trial looked at this issue but found that the same proportion of ex-smokers (38%) and lifelong nonsmokers (39%) achieved clinical improvement and/or remission with nicotine treatment. However, the number of patients in these subgroups was small which would limit the power of these analyses. Thus the issue of whether transdermal nicotine is effective for all patients or ex-smokers is yet to be resolved. To help resolve this issue future studies should stratify randomization by smoking status and enroll larger numbers of ex-smokers and lifelong nonsmokers. </P>
<P>Three trials compared standard therapy (prednisone or aminosalicylates) with transdermal nicotine. <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1996</LINK> enrolled 43 patients in a six week trial comparing prednisone and transdermal nicotine. Six of thirty achieved remission in the nicotine group compared to 14 of 31 in the prednisone group (p&lt;.05). <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK> treated patients with a tapering dose of prednisone versus transdermal nicotine. Fifteen of 21 patients entered remission with nicotine compared to 15 of 17 with prednisone. Therefore, the authors did not demonstrate a difference between the effectiveness of prednisone and transdermal nicotine. However, there may have been a lack of power to show a difference given the small numbers of patients in each group. <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> enrolled thirty patients who were having a flare of ulcerative colitis despite rectal mesalamine treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to oral mesalamine (n=15) or transdermal nicotine (n=15). Twelve of 15 patients treated with nicotine responded to therapy compared to five of 15 treated with oral mesalamine (P=0.027). <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> concluded that the addition of transdermal nicotine to treatment with mesalamine enemas is superior to combined therapy with oral and rectal mesalamine. </P>
<P>The data for prednisone and mesalamine were combined and no significant difference in efficacy was found between conventional therapy (glucocorticoids and mesalamine) and nicotine. These results indicate that transdermal nicotine is not more effective than conventional therapy for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. However, there may have been a lack of power to show a difference given the small numbers of patients in each group. The results of the <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK> trial suggest that transdermal nicotine used in conjunction with rectal mesalamine may be better than the addition of rectal mesalamine to oral mesalamine. However, this trial included only thirty patients and before this could be recommended a larger trial would be necessary to confirm these results. Most of the studies involved patients who were receiving concomitant therapy with aminosalicylates with or without corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guslandi-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Guslandi 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pullan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pullan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>). It is unknown if nicotine used in conjunction with aminosalicylates or corticosteroids exert synergistic effects. </P>
<P>Both clinical response and remission rates increase during 16 weeks of therapy with the conventional agents 5-ASA and corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Sandborn-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sandborn 1997</LINK>). All of the studies included in this review assessed the efficacy of 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with transdermal nicotine. It is possible that transdermal nicotine treatment of active ulcerative colitis for a longer period (e.g. 16 weeks) could result in higher rates of clinical response or remission than those seen in the studies assessed in this review. Future research should assess the duration of treatment required to achieve the best response to transdermal nicotine treatment. </P>
<P>Although most patients tolerated transdermal nicotine, significantly more patients treated with transdermal nicotine suffered from adverse events or withdrew due to adverse events compared to those treated with standard therapy or placebo. This is in spite of the fact that the authors of these trials prescribed nicotine in stepwise increments. The greatest limitation to the use of this medication appears to be the adverse effect profile. Patients receiving nicotine patches were more likely to experience nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness and skin rash or contact dermatitis. Most of the adverse events reported in the trials were mild in nature, and none of the trials reported serious adverse events that did not resolve after either withdrawal of nicotine or lowering of the nicotine dose. Topical nicotine in an enema formulation may be better tolerated than transdermal nicotine because of fewer adverse events. However, a recent placebo-controlled trial found that nicotine enemas (6 mg) did not provide any benefit for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="STD-Ingram-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Ingram 2005a</LINK>). </P>
<P>The validity of some of these trials may have been affected by the adverse effects experienced by the these subjects. Patients receiving nicotine patches were more likely to experience adverse effects. These effects may have suggested to the patient and/or the physician that they were in the treatment arm and this unblinding could have influenced the assessment of colitis. </P>
<P>We conclude that transdermal nicotine may be effective for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis if a patient can tolerate the adverse effects. Thus induction of remission with either prednisone or aminosalicylates is a preferred first line approach. However, nicotine could be tried among patients who do not respond to standard therapy or could be used concomitantly with standard therapy for patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. </P>

<P>Evidence from randomized trials suggests that transdermal nicotine is superior to placebo for the induction of remission in patient's with ulcerative colitis. This review confirms this observation. No difference in efficacy was found between transdermal nicotine and standard therapy (prednisone and aminosalicylates). Adverse effects related to transdermal nicotine are common and limit its use in some patients. It has been suggested that nicotine enemas may be better tolerated than transdermal nicotine. However, nicotine enemas do not appear to provide any benefit for the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, transdermal nicotine may be recommended for patients who do not respond to standard therapy or could be used concomitantly with standard therapy for patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There are presently only two pharmacological agents indicated for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis - steroids and aminosalicylates. Transdermal nicotine may be effective, but its use is limited by its adverse event profile. Further research is needed to isolate the metabolites of nicotine and determine whether one is effective for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. It is possible the adverse effect profile of such a metabolite could be more tolerable. Future research should also investigate the duration of nicotine treatment that is required to achieve optimal efficacy</P>
<P>Not all patients respond to nicotine treatment. Given the adverse effects associated with this therapy it may be worthwhile to identify a subgroup of patients with ulcerative colitis who are more likely to respond. This would spare the nonresponders from experiencing the toxicities associated with nicotine therapy. Thus, further research in this area should try to identify patient attributes that predict response to nicotine therapy. For example, future trials should stratify randomization by smoking status and enroll larger numbers of ex-smokers and lifelong nonsmokers to determine if ex-smokers are more likely than lifelong nonsmokers to benefit from nicotine therapy. <BR/> </P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomized controlled trial. Duration of treatment was 5 weeks. The first 15 patients per group with clinical and endoscopic signs of remission were followed up for 6 months while continuing mesalamine treatment.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Patients (N=38) with a previous diagnosis of left-sided ulcerative colitis, and with a clinical recurrence of mild to moderate degree (Truelove and Witts) while on maintenance therapy with mesalamine 1 g bid. Exclusions: current smokers, and subjects with cardiovascular disorders, peptic ulcer, diabetes, skin diseases or a history of cutaneous allergies and patients with a severe relapse of ulcerative colitis.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Transdermal nicotine patch (15 mg/day) or oral prednisone (30 mg/day for 1 week and then tapered by decreasing the dose by 5 mg every 5 days. To reduce nicotine related adverse effects a run-in period was used whereby the patch was used for six hours on days 1 and 2, 8 hours on days 3 and 4, and 12 hours on days 5 and 6. The patches were then kept on the skin for 24 hours and treatment was continued for another 4 weeks.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Clinical evaluation was performed before and after nicotine or prednisone treatment on the basis of stool frequency, blood in stools, global assessment of symptoms, abdominal pain/cramps, fever due to colitis, laboratory findings (ESR values etc) by means of Rachmilewitz's index. A score of &lt;6 was considered a therapeutic success. Values of &gt;7 were considered a sign of clinical relapse. In patients with apparent remission at the end of therapy, flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies was performed to confirm remission. In all remaining patients sigmoidoscopy was repeated at 6 months.</P>
