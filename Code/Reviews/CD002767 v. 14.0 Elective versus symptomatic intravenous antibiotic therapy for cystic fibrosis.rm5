<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:26:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chronic infection of the airways by <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with deterioration in respiratory function. Intravenous antibiotics are the standard therapy for pulmonary exacerbations caused by this micro-organism. Many centres advocate the use of elective (regular) three-monthly antibiotics to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and therefore slow the deterioration of lung function. Alternatively, intravenous antibiotics are only prescribed when symptoms indicate. Elective therapy may encourage multi-resistance to antibiotics. This review aimed to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the results of the two different approaches. No clear conclusions were identified. This review will no longer be regularly updated. Searches will still be undertaken on a two-yearly basis by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis &amp; Genetic Disorders Group. If, in future, relevant trials are identified, the review will be updated again.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>
<I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> is the commonest micro-organism associated with respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis. Retrospective studies have suggested that using an aggressive policy of intravenous anti-pseudomonal antibiotics at regular intervals, irrespective of symptoms, increases survival.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether there is evidence that an elective (regular) versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimen is associated with an improvement in clinical status and survival rates in people with cystic fibrosis. To identify any adverse effects associated with the use of elective intravenous antibiotics, including an increase in the development of resistant organisms.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-23 15:29:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 15 March 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials describing the use of elective compared with symptomatic intravenous antibiotic policies for any duration or dose regimen. Elective versus symptomatic intravenous antibiotic regimens against any organisms were considered. People with cystic fibrosis of any age or disease severity were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Both authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality; both extracted the data. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Searches identified four studies. Two studies reporting results from a total of 79 participants were included in the review. Differences in study design and objectives meant that data could not be pooled for meta-analysis. Neither study demonstrated significant differences in outcome measures between intervention and comparison groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:25:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies are insufficient to identify conclusive evidence favouring a policy of elective intravenous antibiotic administration, despite its widespread use, neither are the potential risks adequately evaluated. The results should be viewed with caution, as participant numbers are small. Clearly there is a need for a well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentred randomised controlled trial to evaluate these issues.</P>
<P>This review will no longer be regularly updated. Searches will still be undertaken on a two-yearly basis by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis &amp; Genetic Disorders Group. If, in future, relevant trials are identified, the review will be updated again.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-07-17 15:52:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that is commonest in Caucasian populations. It is inherited by the autosomal recessive mode. Although prognosis continues to improve, it remains an important life-limiting disorder. The commonest cause of death is respiratory failure resulting from recurrent and chronic respiratory infection and inflammation.</P>
<P>
<I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>(<I>P. aeruginosa</I>) is the commonest micro-organism associated with respiratory infections in CF. The colonisation rate with <I>P. aeruginosa </I>varies considerably between clinics, depending on their infection prevention routine and early treatment policies. The onset of chronic <I>P. aeruginosa </I>infection may be substantially delayed by cohort isolation and early intensive treatment with inhaled colistin and oral ciprofloxacin from initial isolation of <I>P. aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Valerius-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Valerius 1991</LINK>). The progression of lung damage in people with CF with recurrent or chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection is highly variable, but average life expectancy is reduced compared with those who remain uninfected (<LINK REF="REF-Fitzsimmons-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fitzsimmons 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>The aim of treatment of chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection is to maintain good lung function, improve quality of life and to reduce mortality. There is no international consensus on the management of chronic <I>P. aeruginosa</I> infection in people with CF. Two main strategies are widely practised. The elective regimen is to administer regular courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics - usually three-monthly, irrespective of clinical state (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Szaff-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Szaff 1983</LINK>). The alternative regimen is prompt treatment of acute exacerbations (<LINK REF="REF-Bauernfeind-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauernfeind 1996</LINK>), as determined by clinical or radiological findings or deterioration in lung function parameters (symptomatic regimen). Intravenous antibiotics are usually given for about 14 days, but the duration may be modified depending on clinical response. Choice of antibiotics is generally determined by sputum sensitivies and centre policies. The use of single versus combination IV antibiotic therapy remains controversial and is the subject of another Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2005</LINK>). Many centres also use long-term nebulised antibiotics in people with CF who are chronically infected with <I>P. aeruginosa</I>, which may influence the outcome.</P>
<P>The median survival rate of people with CF doubled between 1969 and 1990, from 14 to 28 years (<LINK REF="REF-FitzSimmons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">FitzSimmons 1996</LINK>) and is still improving (<LINK REF="REF-Dodge-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodge 1997</LINK>). Contributory factors to this encouraging development may be cohort isolation and segregation policies, vigorous attention to nutritional status and new therapeutic agents. Recent reports suggest that the most marked increase in survival probability coincided with introducing a policy of elective IV antibiotics every three months (<LINK REF="REF-Friederiksen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friederiksen 1996</LINK>). However, the multiple use of potent antibiotics may increase the chances of adverse effects and lead to an increased emergence of resistant organisms (<LINK REF="REF-Levy-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levy 1998</LINK>). </P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2012-05-31 12:52:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">

<P>Each author assessed the methodological quality of each study using the method as described by Schulz (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).

<P>For binary outcome measures, in order to allow an intention-to-treat analysis, the authors collected data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treatment group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the participant was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow-up. They planned to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies, (using the pooled relative risk as a treatment effect estimate), however, to date, only data from one trial are available for analysis. For continuous outcomes, the authors recorded either mean change from baseline in each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and standard deviation or standard error for each group.

<INCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR MODIFIED="2008-07-17 15:56:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Two studies met the inclusion criteria including a total of 79 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). Both studies were randomised using the minimisation method (<LINK REF="REF-Pocock-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pocock 1975</LINK>), and full papers of both were published. Minimisation is a method of allocation used to provide comparison groups that are closely similar for several variables. This method is commonly used in smaller studies, or those where small numbers of participants are recruited from several centres.</P>
<P>The two included studies had different objectives. One was a direct comparison of elective versus symptomatic IV antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>), while the other was designed to look at the value of serum IgG titres against <I>P. aeruginosa</I> and involved randomising participants to elective four-monthly antibiotics, or observing participants and treating symptomatically (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>). Despite differences in methodology, both authors agreed that the two studies should be included.</P>
<P>The Brett study included 19 participants over a one-year period (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>). Seven of these participants were randomised to receive elective (four-monthly) antibiotics and the remaining 12 participants to receive symptomatic antibiotics. The Elborn study recruited 60 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). Thirty-two of these were randomised to receive elective (three-monthly) antibiotics and 28 to receive symptomatic antibiotics. The duration of the study was three years, with further data published in abstract form five years after randomisation. There were no interval data reported before the end of either study.</P>
<P>Elborn enrolled participants aged eight years or older, with a mean age of 18 years in both treatment groups, 42% of his cohort were under the age of 16 years (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). The participants in the Brett study were aged between 6 and 29 years, with a mean of 14 years in one treatment group and 13 years in the other group (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Severity of lung disease varied between the studies. The participants in the Brett study had early signs of chronic respiratory infection (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>). They had a moderate increase in serum IgG titres against <I>P. aeruginosa </I>plus isolation of the organism from respiratory cultures. Participants were excluded if they had extremely high IgG titres and if they were already on corticosteroids or nebulised anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. Previous studies would suggest that these criteria exclude those with chronic and irreversible infection (<LINK REF="REF-Brett-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brett 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brett-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brett 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brett-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brett 1988</LINK>). The mean baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> in the participants in the Brett study was 75% in the symptomatic group and 67% in the elective group. The participants in the Elborn study had lower baseline FEV<SUB>1</SUB> measurements with a mean of 63% in the symptomatic group and 59% in the elective group. Elborn selected people with CF who were chronically infected with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> (i.e. 3 or more isolations in 12 months) (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). He excluded those with a history of hypersensitivity to anti-pseudomonal agents, those who were already on a regular treatment regimen of intermittent IV antibiotics, and those who had had less than two or more than four exacerbations during the previous year requiring IV antibiotics (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). Exclusion of those who had very frequent and also infrequent IV antibiotics meant that the difference in the number of courses between the two groups was very small. Participants on nebulised antibiotics were not excluded, but on entry both groups were receiving similar concomitant treatments such as nebulised antibiotics, oral anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and regular inhaled bronchodilators (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The frequency of use of elective antibiotic administration varied. Elborn used an elective three-monthly regimen of intravenous therapy for 10 to 14 days. This resulted in four courses per annum versus three courses per year in the symptomatic group (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). Brett electively treated participants on a four-monthly regimen (each course being of 14 days duration) until serum IgG levels had dropped back down into the normal range. This resulted in an average of 2.8 courses per year in the elective group versus 1.09 in the symptomatic group (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>). In both studies the elective groups received rescue intravenous antibiotic therapy if symptoms indicated (<LINK REF="STD-Brett-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Brett 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Drug dosages were not reported. Data were not provided on the proportion of antibiotic courses administered in hospital. This would have a bearing on clinical improvement because of other inpatient services, such as physiotherapy and dietetic input. In both studies, the choice of anti-pseudomonal antibiotic was based on sputum cultures and sensitivities.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The life expectancy of people with CF has improved enormously over the last 30 years. This systematic review aimed to establish whether there is evidence that the use of an elective (regular) regimen of IV antibiotics compared with symptomatic IV antibiotics is associated with decreased morbidity and improved survival in people with CF. It is therefore disappointing that only two studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, and that the total number of participants involved was small. Due to this, any results reported should be interpreted with caution. As a result of the difference in design of the two studies, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the data. The studies used different outcome measures and were of different durations. The selection criteria for the two studies meant that the participants in the Brett study would not have been selected for the Elborn study and vice versa. The disease severity of the cohorts was different resulting in data that were incompatible for pooling. </P>
<P>Morbidity due to <I>P. aeruginosa</I> is important in CF and leads to progressive deterioration in lung function. People with CF who are chronically colonised often require repeated courses of antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. In the Elborn study, there was little difference in the total number of IV courses between the elective and symptomatic groups, therefore any real difference attributable to the elective group would need to be quite large before it would be noticeable (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). This aspect should be considered in the design of any future studies. Whilst there is anecdotal evidence of improvement in lung function with an elective three-monthly regimen of antibiotics as opposed to symptomatic IVs, we have found no substantial evidence to support this from RCTs. </P>
<P>Adverse events have not been evaluated in any great detail. Neither study reported in their methods which adverse effects were sought. These factors need to be addressed in order to make informed decisions about policy changes. In the Elborn study, there were a significantly higher proportion of deaths in the electively treated group at five years. However, this did not appear to be caused by the emergence of virulent strains of bacteria due to induced antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="STD-Elborn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Elborn 2000</LINK>). It is disturbing that there is no obvious explanation for this apparent excess of deaths and if this is a feature of further studies explanations need to be sought. </P>
<P>With the advent of nebulised and oral anti-pseudomonal agents, it is even more unclear what place elective IV antibiotics have in management protocols. Studies with clear outcome measures are needed to properly evaluate this widely used treatment policy for chronic colonisation with <I>P. aeruginosa</I> in CF. The main question would be whether regular IV antibiotics keep the lungs of people with CF healthier for longer than symptomatic IV antibiotics, and if so, at what cost.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-07-11 13:26:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have found no conclusive evidence to show that an elective regimen of intravenous antibiotics is more effective than a symptomatic regimen in reducing deterioration in respiratory function in CF. Neither is there statistically significant evidence to suggest that an elective regimen encourages the formation of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms and hence increased mortality. These results need to be interpreted with caution, as the total number of participants in these studies was small. This review will no longer be regularly updated. Searches will still be undertaken on a two-yearly basis by the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis &amp; Genetic Disorders Group. If, in future, relevant trials are identified, the review will be updated again.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There have been insufficient RCTs of elective versus symptomatic administration of intravenous antibiotics in people with CF to answer important questions about long-term outcomes. Studies should be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of routine elective intravenous antibiotics on long-term lung function, adverse effects and mortality in people with CF. The most widely used elective regimen is that of three-monthly administration and this should be compared with standard symptomatic intravenous treatment in a multicentre, adequately-powered and well-designed RCT to address these important issues.</P>
