<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Is sildenafil safe and effective in newborn babies with pulmonary hypertension?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>When a baby is born, pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs is high, and when normal breathing is established, this pressure starts to fall. In some babies, this transition does not occur and pressure remains high; this does not allow blood to go to the lungs to get adequate oxygen. This situation is called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). Other events can lead to development of high pressure in lung blood vessels that can manifest within a few days after birth. Persistent high pressure in these vessels leads to delivery of less oxygen to all organs of the body. A medication called sildenafil may cause lung blood vessels to relax, allowing improved blood flow and improved delivery of oxygen to all organs.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified five studies that evaluated effects of sildenafil: three studies that compared sildenafil with placebo (no sildenafil); one that compared sildenafil with other medication (magnesium sulphate); and one that used sildenafil in combination with another medicine (nitric oxide). These studies included 166 newborns and were conducted in Colombia, Mexico, Turkey, and Qatar.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Three studies that compared sildenafil and placebo (no sildenafil) reported that sildenafil reduced the number of deaths. Studies that compared sildenafil against another medication or that used another treatment with sildenafil described no significant reduction in the number of deaths. Sildenafil was more effective than placebo in improving oxygen levels. None of the five included studies reported safety concerns. However, these studies enrolled small numbers of infants, and most were conducted in settings where other treatments were not available. Sildenafil may be useful in settings where other treatment approaches are not available. However, additional studies are needed to compare sildenafil against existing treatment in a resourceful environment to assess its effectiveness and safety.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The quality of evidence for reducing mortality or improving respiratory parameters was low owing to the small number of included studies and the small number of babies evaluated. Some of the included studies have methodological issues, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-07-31 06:33:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Persistent pulmonary hypertension in the neonate (PPHN) is associated with high mortality. Currently, the therapeutic mainstay for PPHN consists of assisted ventilation and administration of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). However, nitric oxide is costly, and its use may not be appropriate in resource-poor settings. Approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to iNO. High concentrations of phosphodiesterases in the pulmonary vasculature have led to the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil or milrinone.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-07-29 11:09:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 18 April 2017), Embase (1980 to 18 April 2017), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 18 April 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials<B>.</B>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2017-07-29 11:10:11 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of sildenafil compared with placebo or other pulmonary vasodilators, irrespective of dose, route, and duration of administration, in neonates with pulmonary hypertension, if investigators reported any of the prespecified outcomes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2017-07-29 17:43:47 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We assessed the methodological quality of trials regarding how bias was minimised at study entry, during study intervention, and at outcomes measurement. We extracted data on relevant outcomes; we estimated the effect size and reported it as risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), or mean difference (MD), as appropriate. We applied the I<SUP>2</SUP> test of heterogeneity and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-31 08:22:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we identified two additional studies, for a total of five eligible trials that enrolled 166 infants. The methodological quality of these studies ranged from low to high risk of bias. Three studies were performed in resource-limited settings, where iNO and high-frequency ventilation were not available at the time of the study. One study compared sildenafil versus active controls, and another study evaluated sildenafil as adjuvant therapy to iNO. When comparing sildenafil with placebo, investigators noted significant reduction in mortality in the sildenafil alone group (three studies, 77 participants; typical RR 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.56; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0% - none; typical RR -0.36, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.18; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3, 95% CI 2 to 6; I<SUP>2</SUP> = 39% - low). Trials reported no significant differences in mortality upon comparison of the sildenafil group versus the active control group (one study, 65 participants; typical RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.75), or when iNO was administered to both groups (one study, 24 participants; typical RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.26 to 6.28). Physiological parameters of oxygenation (oxygenation index, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>)) suggested steady improvement after the first dose of sildenafil. None of the included trials identified any clinically important side effects. We rated the quality of evidence as low to very low owing to imprecision related to small sample size and unclear methodological features.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-07-31 08:23:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sildenafil used for treatment of pulmonary hypertension has potential for reducing mortality and improving oxygenation in neonates, especially in resource-limited settings where iNO is not available. However, large-scale randomised trials comparing sildenafil versus active controls (other pulmonary vasodilators) and providing follow-up for survivors are needed to assess the comparative effectiveness and long-term safety of sildenafil versus other pulmonary vasodilators.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-07-31 09:28:26 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neonatal pulmonary hypertension and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) are terms that can be used interchangeably to describe a neonate who has cyanosis in the first few days of life in the absence of a structural congenital cardiac lesion or haemoglobinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1984</LINK>). The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is considered when hypoxaemia is refractory to oxygen therapy or to lung recruitment strategies (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>) &lt; 55 mmHg despite fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<SUB>2</SUB>) of 1.0) (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2004</LINK>) associated with a preductal to postductal oxygen gradient greater than 20 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh_x002d_Sukys-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh-Sukys 2000</LINK>). Clinicians make the echocardiographic diagnosis of PPHN by demonstrating the presence of extrapulmonary right-to-left shunting at the ductal or atrial level in the absence of severe pulmonary parenchymal disease with Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wessel-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wessel 1997</LINK>). During cardiac catheterisation, pulmonary hypertension is defined as pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) greater than 25 to 30 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Adatia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adatia 2002</LINK>). The incidence of pulmonary hypertension among newborns has been reported as approximately 2/1000 live births, with a reported mortality rate at various centres in the United States of 4% to 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Walsh_x002d_Sukys-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh-Sukys 2000</LINK>). Pulmonary hypertension in the neonate can be primary (idiopathic) or can occur secondary to pulmonary parenchymal disease (such as meconium aspiration syndrome, surfactant deficiency, or alveolocapillary dysplasia), severe pulmonary hypoplasia (<LINK REF="REF-Adatia-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adatia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gersony-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gersony 1984</LINK>), polycythaemia, hypoglycaemia, sepsis, or maternal ingestion of prostaglandin inhibitors.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-07-31 08:28:54 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By virtue of its selective pulmonary vasodilator effects, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is considered the mainstay for treatment of pulmonary hypertension among term or near-term neonates (<LINK REF="REF-Barrington-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barrington 2010</LINK>). Approximately 30% of neonates with PPHN fail to respond to iNO (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1996</LINK>). For some patients, nitric oxide therapy is associated with rebound pulmonary hypertension when therapy is discontinued, as the result of suppression of endogenous nitric oxide production (<LINK REF="REF-Kinsella-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kinsella 2000</LINK>). Other potential complications include development of methaemoglobinaemia. In addition, iNO is a costly intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Subhedar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Subhedar 2002</LINK>). The potential role of iNO in the treatment of preterm neonates with respiratory insufficiency remains unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2017</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-07-31 08:43:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Advances in our understanding of the physiology of vasoactive mediators have revealed a high concentration of phosphodiesterases in the pulmonary vasculature (<LINK REF="REF-Rabe-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 1994</LINK>). Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 leads to increased concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) locally, which in turn leads to relaxation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscles (<LINK REF="REF-Humbert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Humbert 2004</LINK>). Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors include dipyridamole, zaprinast, pentoxifylline, and sildenafil (<LINK REF="REF-Travadi-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Travadi 2003</LINK>). Dipyridamole has a significant systemic vasodilatory effect (<LINK REF="REF-Dukarm-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dukarm 1998</LINK>). Zaprinast and pentoxifylline have not been adequately studied. Sildenafil has been studied in neonatal animal models. A neonatal pig model of pulmonary hypertension induced secondary to meconium aspiration (<LINK REF="REF-Shekerdemian-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekerdemian 2002</LINK>) demonstrated marked improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance and cardiac output (without deterioration in systemic oxygenation) one hour after intravenous infusion of sildenafil compared with control. In a separate experiment, Shekerdemian and co-workers observed improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance; however, improvement was associated with systemic vasodilation and deterioration of oxygenation when sildenafil (0.5 mg/kg) was administered along with 20 ppm of iNO (<LINK REF="REF-Shekerdemian-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shekerdemian 2004</LINK>). The interaction of sildenafil with other selective pulmonary vasodilators warrants further study.</P>
<P>Sildenafil has been used for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Kanthapillai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanthapillai 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sastry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sastry 2004</LINK>) in intravenous, oral (<LINK REF="REF-Ikeda-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ikeda 2005</LINK>), and inhaled (<LINK REF="REF-Ichinose-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ichinose 2001</LINK>) forms. Uncontrolled experiments in children showed that sildenafil reduced pulmonary vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Abrams-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abrams 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 2003</LINK>) and improved exercise capacity. Uncontrolled studies on the use of sildenafil in neonates have reported improved pulmonary vascular resistance and survival (<LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>). These reports have evoked a mixed reaction from the scientific community (<LINK REF="REF-Kumar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kumar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patole-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2002</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Marsh-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marsh 2004</LINK> reported severe retinopathy of prematurity following use of sildenafil in a neonate with severe pulmonary hypertension; however, another study did not report this complication (<LINK REF="REF-Pierce-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pierce 2005</LINK>). Use of sildenafil in adults is suspected to worsen proliferative diabetic retinopathy (<LINK REF="REF-Burton-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burton 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Behn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Behn 2001</LINK>). Therefore, retinal vascular growth must be carefully observed, especially in preterm neonates. <LINK REF="REF-Sastry-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sastry 2004</LINK> reported a slightly higher incidence of backache, headache, numbness of feet and hands, and constipation among adults who received sildenafil versus placebo for primary pulmonary hypertension.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-07-31 15:13:01 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A systematic review of sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children identified four eligible studies including 77 participants. Review authors concluded that more studies of adequate size are necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Kanthapillai-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kanthapillai 2004</LINK>). This review did not include neonates. The disease is more prevalent among neonates and, in most cases, has a different pathophysiology (in neonates, characterised by failure of the natural decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance; in children and adults, occurring as primary disease or secondary to various chronic illnesses such as collagen vascular disease, left heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial disease, or chronic thromboembolic disorders). This review systematically evaluates the use of sildenafil for treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates.</P>

</B>: single-centre randomised clinical trial conducted at an NICU in Qatar over three years (September 2011 to September 2014)</LI>
<LI>
<B>
<U>Objectives</U>
</B>: to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adding sildenafil as adjuvant therapy together with iNO when treating newborns with PPHN and/or hypoxaemic respiratory failure; to assess whether this approach could improve oxygenation, decrease time on mechanical ventilation, and prevent rebound hypoxaemic episodes</LI>
<LI>
<B>
<U>Population</U>
</B>: newborn infants born at gestational age of 34 weeks or greater who at less than 48 hours of age had an OI greater than or equal to 20 mmHg; radiological, clinical, and biochemical evidence of acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure; surfactant therapy established where indicated and an arterial line</LI>
<LI>
<B>
<U>Intervention</U>
</B>: participants given either oral sildenafil (2 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours) or placebo via nasogastric tube. Starting dose of iNO was 20ppm in both groups; weaning from iNO was carried out at 2% to 4% per hour</LI>
<LI>
<B>
<U>Outcomes</U>
</B>: primary outcome was OI absolute values and change from baseline measured after first dose, every 6 hours for 7 days, or until the infant was extubated. Improvement in OI was defined as a decrease of 10% from the previously calculated OI value. Secondary outcome measures included haemodynamic parameters, PAP (measured by echocardiography), practicality of administration, gastric tolerance, hypotension, renal function, liver function, and length of stay. Study authors provided data on all-cause mortality within the first 28 days of life. We were unable to obtain information regarding the variability of reported means for OI and mean PAP</LI>

<LINK REF="STD-Baquero-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Baquero 2006</LINK> was a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Investigators performed randomisation using presealed envelopes. The pharmacy prepared the solution in identical containers, and bedside clinicians were unaware of group assignment. Outcome assessment appears to be masked, as no one was aware of treatment allocation. Researchers terminated the study early on the basis of pre-set criteria (which included hypotension, gastric intolerance or bleeding, renal failure, and death in six infants). Pre-set criteria for discontinuation of dosing included OI &lt; 20 or administration of a maximum of eight doses. Investigators used analysis of variance for repeated comparison of data on OI, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. We assigned this study unclear risk of reporting bias, as we found no registration data to verify selective outcome reporting.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-07-31 09:52:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Publications to date include five very small randomised controlled trials that evaluated sildenafil and included a total of 166 neonates. These trials were conducted in resource-limited settings such as Columbia, Mexico, Qatar, and Turkey. The most commonly reported (40% to 45%) underlying diagnosis was meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). All three studies that compared sildenafil versus placebo reported that intensive care units did not have facilities for providing high-frequency ventilation or nitric oxide - therapies that have shown promise in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension in neonates (PPHN). <LINK REF="STD-Uslu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Uslu 2011</LINK> compared sildenafil versus active control (magnesium sulphate; MgSO<SUB>4</SUB>). <LINK REF="STD-Al-Omar-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Al Omar 2016</LINK> evaluated sildenafil and placebo as adjuvant therapy to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), as nitric oxide was routinely offered as standard of care.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, sildenafil alone was associated with a significant reduction in mortality among neonates with PPHN. Respiratory parameters (oxygenation index (OI) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<SUB>2</SUB>)) showed significant improvement in the sildenafil group when compared with the placebo group. We did not identify a significant difference in mortality or respiratory parameters when sildenafil was compared with an active control or was used as adjuvant therapy with iNO. We noted heterogeneity in severity of illness at the time of entry in different studies; however, all enrolled participants who had moderate to severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Most studies reported steady improvement in oxygenation starting from the first dose of sildenafil. In one study of only 65 participants, sildenafil was effective in reducing the need for inotropes.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-08-01 10:36:06 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although studies comparing sildenafil versus placebo consistently reported improved respiratory outcomes with sildenafil, it must be noted that these studies had several limitations. The number of enrolled participants was small, reporting of various important outcomes was inadequate, and evidence showed heterogeneity between studies. Mortality was significantly reduced in our analyses when sildenafil alone was compared with placebo. This is clinically very significant and may influence treatment decisions made in these units, especially units in resource-limited settings. Long-term effects of sildenafil use remain unknown. Furthermore, data showed no significant improvement in mortality when sildenafil was compared with active control (MgSO<SUB>4</SUB>) or was used adjuvant to iNO therapy.</P>
<P>Included studies used heterogeneous sildenafil doses (range 0.5 to 3.0 mg/kg every 6 hours) and variable loading doses. Optimum dose, optimum route of administration, incidence of rebound pulmonary hypertension, and effectiveness in reducing rebound pulmonary hypertension remain unknown. Sildenafil may not be as effective in PPHN resulting from causes such as sepsis (where overproduction of nitric oxide leading to systemic vasodilation may be the major mechanism) but may be effective when PPHN has other causes such as chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Mesubi-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mesubi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mourani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mourani 2009</LINK>). Concerns regarding retinal vascular growth (<LINK REF="REF-Kehat-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kehat 2010</LINK>) and lack of convincing data in preterm infants may preclude the use of sildenafil in preterm infants.</P>
<P>These five randomised clinical trials and several case reports, including recent reports from both resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-Juliana-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juliana 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simiyu-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simiyu 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Shivanna-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shivanna 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sayed-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Sayed 2015</LINK>) and resourceful settings (<LINK REF="STD-Steinhorn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Steinhorn 2009</LINK>), justify the call for a larger multi-centre randomised controlled study. Studies of this type can be challenging. In addition to requiring multi-centre collaboration, such studies would require that sildenafil be compared with other established therapies such as iNO and/or an optimal ventilatory strategy such as high-frequency ventilation for PPHN. Resource-limited settings could provide a platform for comparison of sildenafil versus placebo, and developed countries could provide settings for comparison with other management approaches. A large multi-centre multi-national trial in high-income countries undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous sildenafil versus placebo in terms of duration of nitric oxide treatment and treatment failure (additional treatment required for PPHN) is currently ongoing and may shed further light on this topic (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01720524" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01720524</LINK>). ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01720524; updated 27 June 2016) reports an estimated enrolment of 64 and includes a plan for 12-month and 24-month safety and neurodevelopmental follow-up. The estimated study completion date for this trial is December 2019. A pharmacokinetics study (NCT01670136; updated 17 March 2016) is currently recruiting preterm newborns receiving sildenafil as standard of care in the United States.</P>

<P>We scored evidence quality using the GRADE PRO GDT online tool <LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>. We graded the quality of evidence as low to very low, stemming from imprecision (small number of studies and small number of participants), lack of harmonised outcome measurement, and unclear methodological features due to inability to evaluate protocols because of lack of clinical trial registration.

<P>Case reports have described the efficacy of sildenafil for treatment of PPHN in neonates. A retrospective comparative assessment of iloprost versus sildenafil (<LINK REF="STD-Kahveci-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahveci 2014</LINK>) concluded that iloprost may be more effective than sildenafil in decreasing treatment time and improving ventilatory parameters for neonates with PPHN. As this review includes no published prospective randomised clinical trials of iloprost, we cannot confirm or disagree with these findings. Previous literature reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Spillers-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spillers 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Iacovidou-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iacovidou 2012</LINK>) have presented information consistent with our finding that sildenafil may be effective in PPHN when other standard treatments such as iNO are not available.</P>

<P>Sildenafil may have the potential to improve physiological parameters and to improve mortality among neonates with pulmonary hypertension in settings where iNO is not available. However, the safety and efficacy of sildenafil for treatment of PPHN have not yet been established in large randomised trials, and sildenafil should be used only within the context of randomised controlled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-07-31 10:01:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sildenafil for treatment of PPHN; some ongoing studies are currently being conducted in high-resource settings. Additional research is needed to determine the optimum sildenafil dose and route of sildenafil administration. If found effective in achieving short-term improvement in ongoing randomised controlled trials, long-term data will be needed to demonstrate safety before treatment can be broadly implemented at national and individual clinical levels. Research studies should be conducted in both resource-limited and high-income settings to address questions such as effectiveness when used as stand-alone therapy and as adjunctive therapy. A multi-centre undertaking should include long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up. In resource-limited settings, studies should enrol patients at high risk for mortality or needing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) owing to persistent hypoxaemia (OI &gt; 25). Approximate rates for mortality or need for ECMO among these patients approaches 50%. A clinically significant effect size would be a 10% to 20% absolute risk reduction in rate of death and/or need for ECMO, with type 1 error of 5% and power of 80%; the required sample size for such a study would range from approximately 100 to 400 participants. This type of study would require a multi-centre approach. In resource-limited settings, mortality is higher and the required sample size could be lower. It would be crucial for such studies to include long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up, as studies to this point have not provided sufficient information on long-term treatment effects.</P>

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2017-07-31 07:12:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used the standard methods of Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal to assess the methodological quality (to meet the validity criteria) of trials. For each trial, we sought information regarding the method of randomisation, and blinding and reporting of all outcomes of all infants enrolled in the trial. We assessed each criterion as having low, high, or unclear risk. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We added this information to the Characteristics of included studies table. We evaluated the following issues and entered the findings into the risk of bias table.</P>
<P>1. Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>b. High risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>2. Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>b. High risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>3. Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for participants; and</P>
<P>b. Low risk, high risk, or unclear risk for personnel; </P>
<P>4. Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented at the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind outcome assessment. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk for outcome assessors;.</P>
<P>b. High risk for outcome assessors; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>5. Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>b. High risk (&#8805; 20% missing data); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>6. Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of the suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk (when it is clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>b. High risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified outcomes of interest and are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>7. Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early owing to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>a. Low risk;</P>
<P>b. High risk; or</P>
<P>c. Unclear risk.</P>
<P>If needed, we explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>
