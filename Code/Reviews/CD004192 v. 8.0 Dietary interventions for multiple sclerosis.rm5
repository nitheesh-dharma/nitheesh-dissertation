<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because available conventional treatments are only partially effective and may produce side effects, most patients with MS use therapies proposed by complementary and alternative medicine, usually special diets and dietary supplements. In fact, an Internet search using the terms 'diet' and 'multiple sclerosis' produces over 27 million links, indicating that these treatments are widely used and believed in by the MS patient community. The most common dietary interventions are supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), allergen-free (gluten and milk) diets, vitamins, and micronutrients and antioxidants such as selenium, <I>Gingko biloba</I> extracts and coenzyme Q10.<BR/>The authors of this review tried to assess whether changes in dietary habits could favourably influence the prognosis for people with MS. Although a massive amount of data has been published in this area, only six controlled studies on PUFA, comprising a total of 794 patients, met the inclusion criteria in terms of methodological quality for this review. No studies on vitamins and antioxidant supplements were found that met our criteria. No papers on any other proposed dietary interventions for MS were found after extensive searching of the scientific databases.<BR/>The available data are insufficient to assess any potential benefit or harm that might result from PUFA supplementation. The absence of evidence on PUFA and the extensive lack of data on other supplements is an unfortunate event since 50% to 75% of people with MS do use dietary regimens and supplements.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain dietary regimens, particularly those including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamins, might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diets and dietary supplements are much used by people with MS in the belief that they might improve disease outcomes and overcome the effectiveness limits of conventional treatments.</P>
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane review "Dietary intervention for multiple sclerosis" (first published on <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2007, Issue 1).</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-10-16 13:06:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To answer MS patients' questions regarding the efficacy and safety of dietary regimens for MS. Can changes in dietary habits be an effective intervention for MS patients? Are the potential side effects of these interventions known, and have they been measured? Are potential interactions between dietary interventions and other curative or symptomatic treatments known and have they been studied?</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (November 2011), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (embase.com) (1974 to November 2011) and reference lists of papers found.</P>

<P>All controlled trials (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) on a specific dietary intervention, diet plan or dietary supplementation, except for vitamin D supplementation, compared to no dietary modification or placebo were eligible.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-10-31 12:00:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Two review authors independently selected articles, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were entered and analysed in RevMan.</P>
<P>Dichotomous data were summarised as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a random-effects model in the presence of heterogeneity (I² &gt; 60%). Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences, determined by the difference between the pre- and post-intervention changes in the treatment and control groups.<BR/>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 12:01:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Liliana Coco">
<P>Six RCTs that investigated PUFAs emerged from the search strategy, accounting for 794 randomised patients.</P>
<P>PUFAs did not have a significant effect on disease progression at 24 months. Omega-6 fatty acids (11 to 23 g/day linoleic acid) didn't show any benefit in 144 MS patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63). Linoleic acid (2.9 to 3.4 g/day) had no benefit in 65 chronic progressive MS patients (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.42). Omega-3 fatty acids had no benefit in 292 relapsing remitting MS patients (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.08).</P>
<P>Slight potential benefits in relapse outcomes were associated with omega-6 fatty acids in some studies, however these findings were limited by the reduced validity of the endpoints. No judgements about safety or patient-reported outcomes were possible. In general, trial quality was poor.</P>
<P>No studies on vitamin supplementation and allergen-free diets were analysed as none met the eligibility criteria, mainly due to lack of clinical outcomes.<BR/>

</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 12:03:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>PUFAs seem to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression), but they may tend to reduce the frequency of relapses over two years. However, the data that are available are insufficient to assess a real benefit or harm from PUFA supplementation because of their uncertain quality.</P>
<P>Evidence on the possible benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation and antioxidant supplements in MS is lacking. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions in MS.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an update of the Cochrane review "Dietary intervention for multiple sclerosis" (first published on <I>The Cochrane Library </I>2007, Issue 1). The authors decided to exclude the vitamin D intervention from this review update as vitamin D is the subject of another recent Cochrane review.</P>
<P>Because available conventional therapies are only partially effective and may produce side effects, people with multiple sclerosis (MS) widely use treatments proposed by complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Studies in several countries, including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia, showed that about a half to three quarters of MS patients use some form of CAM in conjunction with conventional medicine (<LINK REF="REF-www.MS_x002d_CAM.org" TYPE="REFERENCE">www.MS-CAM.org</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwartz-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwartz 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bowling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leong-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leong 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yadav-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yadav 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connors-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connors 2012</LINK>). CAM therapies commonly used by people with MS are special diets and dietary supplements (<LINK REF="REF-Horowitz-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horowitz 2011</LINK>). Many people with MS consider special diets as vital for improving their health status (<LINK REF="REF-Shinto-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shinto 2004</LINK>) and they use them particularly when they want to improve their sense of control over their disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ebers-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ebers 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A rationale has been proposed for nutritional interventions in MS, evaluating at the molecular level the effects of dietary molecules on the inflammatory and autoimmune processes involved in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Riccio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riccio 2011</LINK>). Nutritional status and dietary habits in MS patients have not been extensively studied or reported, however individual findings suggest that many patients suffer from various forms of malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Habek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habek 2010</LINK>). Several epidemiological studies have considered various nutritional factors in relation to MS, as summarised by Lauer (<LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1997</LINK>), and dietary interventions appear to have the potential to favourably influence the prognosis of MS.</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-10-31 12:06:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>MS is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. MS is the most important non-traumatic cause of neurological disability in young adults, especially women, typically striking those aged between 20 and 40 years. Although MS etiology and pathogenesis remain poorly understood, it is widely accepted that the disease has an immune-mediated basis and occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. Despite limited advances in treatments, there is still no cure. Management is also largely directed to relieving symptoms, which arise variably in the course of the disease.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-31 12:07:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Over the years, a number of diets for MS have been proposed to be effective, such as the Swank Diet and the Kousmine Diet (diets high in polyunsaturated fats and low in animal fats). Allergen-free, gluten-free, sucrose- and tobacco-free, raw food, pectin- and fructose-restricted diets, the Cambridge and other liquid diets, the Hebener diet, the Lowdown on Low Carb, and the Paleo diet have all been proposed. Supplementation with evening primrose oil, fish oils, vitamins, minerals, cerebrosides, aloe vera, and 'enzymes' as well as 'megascorbic' therapy are also quite common. A rationale for nutritional interventions in MS, provided by evaluating at the molecular level the effects of dietary molecules on the inflammatory and autoimmune processes involved in MS, has been proposed (<LINK REF="REF-Riccio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Riccio 2011</LINK>). Nutritional status and dietary habits in MS patients have not been extensively studied or reported, however individual findings suggest that many patients suffer from various forms of malnutrition (<LINK REF="REF-Habek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habek 2010</LINK>). Several epidemiological studies have considered various nutritional factors in relation to MS, as summarised by Lauer (<LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1997</LINK>), and dietary interventions appear to have the potential to favourably influence the prognosis of MS.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation</HEADING>
<P>Several ecological studies have shown that risk of MS is high in countries with a high intake of saturated fats and is low in countries with high intake of polyunsaturated fats (<LINK REF="REF-Swank-1950" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swank 1950</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swank-1952" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swank 1952</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Agranoff-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agranoff 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alter-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alter 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butcher-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butcher 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nanji-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nanji 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Malosse-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malosse 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Esparza-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Esparza 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1995</LINK>). Nine out of 19 (47%) case-control studies that investigated food consumption in different periods before MS onset found increased risk associated with animal fat or animal product consumption, or a protective effect of vegetable fats (<LINK REF="REF-Murrell-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murrell 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sepcic-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sepcic 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1994-bis" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1994 bis</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tola-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tola 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wender-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wender 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gusev-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gusev 1996</LINK>; Gronning (unpublished, reported by <LINK REF="REF-Lauer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauer 1997</LINK>); <LINK REF="REF-Ghadirian-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghadirian 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zorzon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zorzon 2003</LINK>). Vegetable fats are a rich source of PUFAs, which include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6 fatty acids include compounds such as linoleic acid and gamma-linolenic acid. Examples of omega-3 fatty acids include eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Several pathophysiological mechanisms were proposed as a rational basis for the therapeutic use of PUFAs for MS including immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory actions, effects on microcirculation and erythrocyte aggregation, antioxidant action, and also effects related to their role as constituents of the myelin membrane (<LINK REF="REF-Bates-1989-bis" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 1989 bis</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Das-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swank-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swank 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mehta-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mehta 2009</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Vitamin B12 supplementation</HEADING>
<P>Vitamin B12 plays a key role in myelin formation and is essential for the maintenance of nerve cells; it also has an immunomodulatory effect. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to deformed myelin and is associated with reduction of immunomodulatory and neurotrophic activities. Folates and vitamin B12 have fundamental roles in central nervous system (CNS) function at any age (<LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 2006</LINK>). Relationships between MS and vitamin B12 have been suggested, but none have been confirmed (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 2005</LINK>). Low or decreased levels of vitamin B12 were reported in MS patients (<LINK REF="REF-Crellin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crellin 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reynolds-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reynolds 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other vitamins and antioxidant action</HEADING>
<P>Free radicals and oxidative stress have roles in inflammatory processes and hence may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Some markers of oxidative damage, which may contribute to myelin and axonal injury, are increased in MS patients. In people with MS, and animal models of MS, products such as peroxynitrite and superoxide (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) are formed that are highly toxic to neurons (<LINK REF="REF-Gilgun_x002d_Sherki-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gilgun-Sherki 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ferretti-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ferretti 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koch-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koch 2006</LINK>). Antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and E, may decrease free radical-induced cellular injury; this is the rationale for their use in MS. Other dietary supplements with antioxidant activity that are used in MS include alpha-lipoic acid, selenium, preparations of <I>Gingko biloba</I>, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), and anthocyane preparations such as grape seed extract and pine bark extract.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Allergen-free diet</HEADING>
<P>Diets that are high in gluten and milk are generally much more common in areas characterised by elevated MS prevalence (<LINK REF="REF-Shatin-1964" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shatin 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Butcher-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Butcher 1976</LINK>). An association between MS and food allergies has been hypothesised since the 1930s. The clinical course of MS, characterised by exacerbations and remissions, is similar to the clinical course of many allergic diseases (<LINK REF="STD-Ehrentheil-1952" TYPE="STUDY">Ehrentheil 1952</LINK>). Particular attention has focused on the hypothesis that cryptic gluten sensitivity may play a role in the neurological manifestations of MS (<LINK REF="REF-Ghezzi-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ghezzi 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies suggest intestinal involvement in MS patients. For example, histological abnormalities were found in five of 12 patients with no gastrointestinal symptoms who had intestinal biopsies (<LINK REF="REF-Lange-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lange 1976</LINK>). Furthermore, malabsorption tests in 52 MS patients found malabsorption in 40%, abnormal d-xylose absorption in 27%, and abnormal jejunal mucosa in 13% of the patients (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1977</LINK>).<BR/>

<P>A search on Google® (in English) on November 2011 using the search terms "diet" and "multiple sclerosis" retrieved over 27 million links, clearly indicating that many dietary regimens are widely used and strongly recommended in the MS consumer community. No other systematic review on this topic has been published in any scientific journal we were able to retrieve after a comprehensive search.</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions (modifications to usual diet) in people with MS. Such interventions are undertaken with the expectation of modifying the course and prognosis of MS or at least improving health status.</P>
<P>The following primary questions were addressed.<BR/>1. Can changes in dietary habits be an effective intervention for MS patients?<BR/>2. Are the potential side effects of these interventions known, and have they been measured?<BR/>3. Are potential interactions between dietary interventions and other curative or symptomatic treatments known, and have they been studied?</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome measures in comparison groups at 12 months, 24 months and at the end of the scheduled follow-up period in the primary studies</HEADING>
<P>1. Patients with disease progression.</P>
<P>Disability progression has been defined as a persistent worsening by at least one point in the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kurtzke-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kurtzke 1983</LINK>) recorded by the physician out of relapse and confirmed by follow-up assessment at six months. However, other definitions of disability progression as given in an identified paper were accepted, including an increase of at least one point in entry score (if baseline score &lt; 5.5) and of at least a half-point (if baseline score &#8805; 5.5) in the EDSS, or a different time for confirmation. The EDSS is the most frequently used assessment in clinical studies on MS. It is based on the results of a neurologic examination and the patient's ability to walk. Scores range from 0 (no neurologic abnormality) to 10 (death from MS). Other disability measurement instruments were accepted provided they could be standardised to the EDSS.</P>
<P>2. Patients who had at least one exacerbation during the treatment and follow-up period.</P>
<P>Exacerbation was defined as new symptoms or signs, or worsening of previous symptoms or signs, lasting more than 24 hours in the absence of fever, infection or concurrent steroid withdrawal and confirmed by the physician. However, other definitions of disability progression were accepted if provided by the original paper.</P>

<P>3. Health related quality of life (HRQOL) assessed by validated instruments (e.g. SF-36, MSQOL-54).</P>
<P>The SF-36 is a multi-purpose short-form health survey with 36 questions that examine eight domains to provide a general measure of health. It is a generic measure as opposed to the MSQOL-54 that targets MS specifically (<LINK REF="REF-Vickrey-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickrey 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. Cognitive functions assessed by validated instruments (e.g. Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRBNT)).</P>
<P>BRBNT consists of five tests including measures of visual and acoustic sustained attention, verbal learning and delayed recall, visuo-spatial learning and delayed recall, and semantic retrieval (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>5. Physical (i.e. fatigue, spasticity, spasms, pain, bladder function, bowel symptoms) or psychological (depression, psychological well-being, stress) symptoms that are patient-reported by validated questionnaires or scales (e.g. the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS); the Mental Health Inventory (MHI)).</P>
<P>The MFIS was designed to probe the perception of the impact of fatigue on daily activities in people with MS, where higher scores indicate increased perception of fatigue (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 1999</LINK>). The MHI is a measure of overall emotional functioning covering a wide range of negative and positive emotions; higher scores indicate better mental health (<LINK REF="REF-Vickrey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vickrey 1997</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:12:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of the present review was to assess the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions in MS patients. Thus, we searched for trials on all specific dietary interventions or supplementations in the usual diet or a specific diet plan. This was except for vitamin D supplementation as vitamin D is already the subject of another Cochrane review, "Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis" (<LINK REF="REF-Jagannath-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagannath 2010</LINK>). That review included a single study with 49 participants (25 treated and 24 controls). The trial provided some evidence of a potential benefit of the intervention on several outcomes (annualised relapse rate, EDSS scores, suppression of T-cell proliferation) and reported a relative absence of any adverse events. But, due to the absence of a comparison with other RCTs and the potential high risk of biases reported by the review authors, there could be limits on the applicability of the available evidence to the MS population as a whole.</P>
<P>All the dietary interventions for which we searched for published papers may have biological activities that would justify systematic research on their effects in MS. The literature on dietary interventions in MS is extensive but, after comprehensive searching of the scientific databases, we found only six PUFA trials. The design and quality of all the six included studies, as drawn from the published articles, were uncertain and we retrieved little evidence on the efficacy of the PUFA treatments. No RCTs on any other proposed dietary intervention were found. Thus, we were not able to form any judgement about other dietary interventions. <B>

</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:10:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Disease progression, the primary endpoint, was unaffected by PUFA administration for up to two years in any subtype of analysis.</P>
<P>Relapses seemed to be less frequent in patients treated with a PUFA spread. However, this weak effect disappeared when we applied a sensitivity analysis. This finding could be due to differences between baseline characteristics of the groups that were compared (selection bias), specially if considering the number of pre-study relapses.</P>
<P>Disease progression didn't improve after 12 months for patients treated with fish oil capsules . When considering the sensitivity analysis, the result seemed in favour of the treatment arm but this was influenced by the very high losses to follow-up rate, especially in the control arm (75% versus 33%), in a study with a small sample (a total of 31 randomised participants).</P>
<P>No study reported any description of adverse events; only <LINK REF="STD-Paty-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Paty 1978</LINK> provided the number of withdrawals due to side effects. PROs were reporter by one study only (<LINK REF="STD-Weinstock_x002d_Guttman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstock-Guttman 2005</LINK>).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:09:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To help assess the applicability of the findings, the population included in the trials should be described in detail. In the included studies the researchers enrolled participants of heterogeneous disease type, severity and duration of disease.</P>
<P>In this review only data on the use of PUFA were included in the analysis because no RCTs were available on any other dietary interventions.</P>
<P>This review was not able to answer the main questions posed by the consumers directly involved in the protocol writing. In the included studies the data on health related quality of life, cognitive functions, and physical or psychological symptoms that are highly demanded by consumers are lacking. To some extent the problem is historical as four studies were published in the 1970s, one in the 1980s, and only <LINK REF="STD-Weinstock_x002d_Guttman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstock-Guttman 2005</LINK> has some reports on these outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:10:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found six RCTs available in literature that reported data for 794 randomised patients. The body of evidence identified didn't allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review because the trials that were analysed were prone to multiple biases. First, they differed in baseline characteristics, inclusion criteria and study design. They enrolled participants of variable number, disease type, severity and duration; they used different types and doses of PUFAs; and they planned different treatment durations and follow-up periods. In particular, due to different treatment schedules, we were forced to split the analysis into homogeneous intervention categories. Second, some studies had large numbers of dropouts, and dropouts were never included in the analyses. With regard to compliance, some evidence emerged that adherence to dietary interventions was poor or unsatisfactory (<LINK REF="STD-Weinstock_x002d_Guttman-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstock-Guttman 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trial quality was poor and no studies were judged as free of potential biases; most of the risk of bias domains were judged to be unclear because of the lack of information provided by the studies. Baseline characteristics were often incomplete and reported only for patients that remained in the study and were analysed at the end of the follow-up period. Most of studies didn't report how the examining physician was blinded to treatment allocation.<BR/>All studies performed statistical analysis only on the number of patients who completed the study, not considering the number of randomised participants. However, we must emphasise that most of the included studies were published when descriptions of methodological aspects were not as stringent as today.</P>
<P>Considering that none of the studies took reasonable steps to minimise the introduction of bias, all the findings must be viewed cautiously, especially when considering them in clinical practice.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:11:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We made attempts to limit bias in the review process by ensuring: i) a comprehensive search for potentially eligible studies; ii) standardisation of the review process.</P>
<P>In order to reduce the heterogeneity between trials, we split the analysis into homogeneous intervention categories. It is recommended that Cochrane reviews should seek to include all outcomes that are likely to be important to users of the review, but overall conclusions are more difficult to draw if there are multiple analyses.</P>

We are in agreement with the editorials and descriptive reviews published in scientific journals (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Das-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Namaka-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Namaka 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Habek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habek 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yadav-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yadav 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cutter-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cutter 2011</LINK>). A commentary had suggested that diets and dietary supplements that increase PUFA intake may produce beneficial effects in MS (<LINK REF="REF-Bowling-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bowling 2003</LINK>) when considering any study design, not only RCTs.</P>
<P>With the present review we are not able to confirm the positive results claimed in a broad case-series study (<LINK REF="STD-Swank-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Swank 1990</LINK>) on a dietary treatment developed by Dr Roy Swank. Swank started a dietary approach for MS treatment in the 1940s, which is still widely recommended in the patient community. The main aim of the Swank diet is a drastic reduction of intake of saturated fat (&lt; 15 g/day) and supplementation with vegetable oil and cod liver oil. The study design he used did not fit the inclusion criteria considered for this review and, as an observational study, a proper protocol and statistical tools will be necessary to analyse and discuss such a study.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2012-10-31 13:13:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dietary supplementation with PUFAs seems to have no major effect on disease progression, the main clinical outcome in MS, and does not substantially affect the risk of clinical relapses over two years. However, the available data are insufficient to assess the real benefit or harm that might result from PUFA supplementation. No randomised trials were available to assess the effectiveness of vitamins, either by supplementation or adopting a vitamin-rich diet, and antioxidant supplements in preventing disability progression, recurrence of exacerbations or symptoms worsening in people with MS.</P>
<P>There is much controversy over the role of diet and fatty acid supplements in MS, which often leads to confusion for people with MS. In patients with MS malnutrition is often the unrecognised cause of fatigue and worsening of disease symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Payne-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Payne 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Das-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schwarz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwarz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Habek-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Habek 2010</LINK>). These findings emphasize the need for nutritional information and education in MS patients, and could explain the general feeling of better health in MS patients on special diets. So diets and supplements are not a first-line therapy, but it is likely that their use in addition to conventional therapies would be beneficial, even if this has not been supported by sufficient evidence yet (<A HREF="http://www.neurologycare.net/diets-and-fatty-acid-supplements.html">http://www.neurologycare.net/diets-and-fatty-acid-supplements.html</A>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-10-31 14:15:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More research is required to assess the effectiveness of diets and dietary supplements in MS. Well-designed parallel group, double-blind trials of diets and dietary supplements for people with MS, carried out for sufficient time periods, are urgently needed. Outcomes measures should include adverse events as well as a sensitive, comprehensive and reliable measure of patient disability over time. The doses of the supplements should also be evaluated. Consumers will welcome the evidence from these trials. In addition, data from non-randomised, uncontrolled studies following a proper protocol and specific statistical analysis may provide more data and allow more exhaustive analyses on the efficacy and benefit from diets and supplements.</P>
<P>Moreover, the results of the six ongoing studies, not yet evaluated in this review, may alter the conclusions of the review.</P>

<P>The original protocol was written in 2004 and any type of dietary supplementation was considered. On June 2010 a review on "Vitamin D for the management of multiple sclerosis" (<LINK REF="REF-Jagannath-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jagannath 2010</LINK>) was published on <I>The Cochrane Library</I>. To avoid duplication of the work, and recognising the importance of a specific focus on the growing body of literature on this matter, we decided to exclude vitamin D from the treatments considered in this review update.</P>
