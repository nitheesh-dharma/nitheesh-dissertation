<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:21:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
<BR/>Does the addition of nasal saline spray or wash to usual care or placebo reduce the severity of symptoms or speed the recovery of adults and children with cold and flu symptoms that have been present for less than four weeks?</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<BR/>Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) include colds, influenza and infections of the throat, nose or sinuses. They are usually self limiting viral infections, though sometimes symptoms may persist for many weeks beyond the clearance of the initial infection, with or without establishment of secondary bacterial infections. The aim of treatment is predominantly for relief of symptoms, though some treatments may have a role in reducing the duration of post-viral symptoms, such as cough. Saline nose spray and larger volume nasal washes have become more popular as one of many treatment options for URTIs, and they have been shown to have some effectiveness for chronic sinusitis and following nasal surgery. However, little is known about their effectiveness in the treatment of acute URTI or which symptoms they may be effective for.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We identified five studies, with a total of 749 participants enrolled and 565 participants providing data, which addressed the research question and met the inclusion criteria. They all compared saline irrigation with routine care or other nose sprays. These studies covered a wide range of ages, countries, sample sizes, dosing methods and frequency, and time since onset of URTI symptoms. They were also highly variable in their design and the symptoms that were measured. This is not surprising due to the lack of consistent measures of URTI symptoms and signs. This resulted in very few common outcome measures that could be combined across these five studies. The evidence is current to August 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
<BR/>The two additional studies included since the original systematic review have not contributed data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Only the largest study, which studied 401 children aged 6 to 10 years, found significant reductions in a number of symptoms, including nasal secretions, sore throat, nasal breathing score and nasal obstruction, as well as reduced use of additional nasal decongestant medications. It also reported a significant improvement in the health status score. There was a reduction in the outcome of time to resolution of symptoms, which was reported in two trials on adult participants, but the difference was not clinically significant. Nasal saline is safe but may cause minor adverse effects, such as irritation or a burning sensation, particularly with products using higher flows or concentrations.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Most studies were small and had significant shortcomings in the design or implementation of the research. Further studies, preferably larger in size and using common outcome measures, are needed to establish the potential for the role of nasal saline irrigation in reducing the severity and duration of acute URTI symptoms, secondary infections and possibly antibiotic usage.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), including the common cold and rhinosinusitis, are common afflictions that cause discomfort and debilitation and contribute significantly to workplace absenteeism. Treatment is generally by antipyretic and decongestant drugs and sometimes antibiotics, even though most infections are viral. Nasal irrigation with saline is often employed as an adjunct treatment for URTI symptoms despite a relative lack of evidence for benefit in this clinical setting. This review is an update of the Cochrane review by Kassel et al, which found that saline was probably effective in reducing the severity of some symptoms associated with acute URTIs.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors (DK, BM) independently assessed trial quality with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and extracted data. We analysed all data using the Cochrane Review Manager software.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:18:29 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified five RCTs that randomised 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). They all compared saline irrigation to routine care or other nose sprays, rather than placebo. We included two new trials in this update, which did not contribute data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings. Most trials were small and we judged them to be of low quality, contributing to an unclear risk of bias. Most outcome measures differed greatly between included studies and therefore could not be pooled. Most results showed no difference between nasal saline treatment and control. However, one larger trial, conducted with children, did show a significant reduction in nasal secretion score (mean difference (MD) -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.48 to -0.14) and nasal breathing (obstruction) score (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.19) in the saline group. However, a MD of -0.33 on a four-point symptom scale may have minimal clinical significance. The trial also showed a significant reduction in the use of decongestant medication by the saline group. Minor nasal discomfort and/or irritation was the only side effect reported by a minority of participants.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs. However, the included trials were generally too small and had a high risk of bias, reducing confidence in the evidence supporting this. Future trials should involve larger numbers of participants and report standardised and clinically meaningful outcome measures.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-04-16 14:33:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="David B King">
<P> </P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-09-18 15:59:27 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="David B King">
<P>Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) involve the upper airways (the nose, sinuses, larynx and pharynx) and include the common cold, influenza, rhinitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media. Acute infections are defined as those with symptoms lasting up to 28 days (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Acute URTIs are common, can vary in severity from mild to distressing and debilitating and are a major cause of lost days of work and schooling. The economic impact of the common cold alone on workplace absenteeism is estimated to be billions of dollars (<LINK REF="REF-Bramley-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bramley 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Usual treatments for URTIs are symptomatic. Treatment may include antipyretic and analgesic drugs, mucolytics, expectorants and decongestants (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simasek-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simasek 2007</LINK>). While acute URTIs are mainly caused by viruses, antibiotics are often prescribed (<LINK REF="REF-Nash-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nash 2002</LINK>). This may lead to increased antibiotic resistance and adverse outcomes, as well as being unnecessary for the patient (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2015-04-16 14:33:07 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="David B King">
<P>Saline can be delivered to the nose as a large-volume wash using reservoir pots and tubing, or in a small volume via spray devices that deliver a fine mist or jet of saline into the nose. The usual concentration is 'normal saline', which approximates an iso-osmolar fluid. Hypertonic saline is sometimes used to deliver a stronger concentration of fluid to the nasal cavity and sinuses.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:23:01 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Saline irrigation of the nose, which is a popular treatment for sinonasal conditions, is believed to alleviate URTI symptoms by clearing excess mucus, reducing congestion and improving breathing (<LINK REF="REF-Tomooka-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomooka 2000</LINK>). It is thought to improve mucociliary clearance by increasing the ciliary beat frequency (<LINK REF="REF-Talbot-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Talbot 1997</LINK>). As well as relieving sinonasal symptoms, saline irrigation may remove infectious material from the sinuses and reduce cough associated with postnasal drip (<LINK REF="REF-Kaliner-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaliner 1998</LINK>). There is evidence for the effectiveness of nasal saline irrigation for chronic sinusitis (<LINK REF="REF-Rabago-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabago 2002</LINK>) and allergic rhinitis (<LINK REF="REF-Garavello-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garavello 2003</LINK>). It has been used as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other treatments, such as oral antihistamines. It is available commercially in various concentrations and formulations of salt and water combinations and is usually delivered by atomised spray or in larger volumes for lavage.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:23:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Nasal saline treatment may reduce the burden of disease and workplace absenteeism and reduce the over-prescription of antibiotics for acute URTIs. One non-systematic review of the existing literature found that most trials of nasal saline in acute URTIs were very small, with some being uncontrolled experiments, and concluded that the evidence in favour of nasal saline was "fair" (<LINK REF="REF-Papsin-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papsin 2003</LINK>). A Cochrane Review assessed nasal saline irrigation as a treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis and found that it may be useful in providing symptomatic relief, without significant side effects (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of saline irrigation in the treatment of acute URTIs, to determine whether saline nasal irrigation improves respiratory symptoms of acute URTIs.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK> studied 401 children in the Czech Republic with clinically diagnosed common cold or influenza that were randomised to receive standard treatment with or without adjunct nasal irrigation with isotonic saline. Three hundred and ninety contributed data for analysis. The intervention group was further subdivided into three subgroups using different delivery strengths: fine spray, medium jet flow and fine spray eye and nose wash. Each subgroup used the same solution of commercial isotonic seawater. Results were reported for each subgroup and for the saline group as a whole; this review considers the results for the saline group as a whole.

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK> paper also had methodological weaknesses. Patients recorded daily symptoms in a symptom diary, but the baseline score for individual and total symptom score (TSS) was calculated as a mean of daily scores during the baseline period of seven days, rather than on the day of entry to the trial. We also noted that there was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups at baseline (which included week one of treatment) as well as at two and three weeks after treatment. This could mean that there was a problem with randomisation or that nasal saline caused the difference within the first week, as these baseline data are averaged over the first seven days. We also noted incorrect data in the tables presented in the <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK> paper.

<P>The clinical measures used in the included studies were so heterogenous as to only allow minimal pooling of data.

Although nasal symptom score was measured by a few studies, differences in methods of data collection make pooling of data impossible or misleading. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Adam-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Adam 1998</LINK> reported a nasal symptoms score that was a composite of both nasal and non-nasal symptoms (cough, headache), which precluded pooling of data. <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK> also measured nasal symptoms scores.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The five included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of saline nasal irrigation provide limited evidence that treatment is effective for symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Nasal symptom scores, combined from a complex of different symptoms in different trials, were statistically similar between treatment and control groups. There was a reduction in the outcome of time to resolution of symptoms, which was reported in two trials, but the difference was not clinically significant. The largest trial, which also had a high risk of bias, reported a number of statistically significant outcomes for the nasal saline group at follow-up, including reduction of sore throat, nasal secretion and secretion type and nasal breathing score (<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK>). It also reported a significant improvement in the health status score.</P>
<P>There was a trend towards reduced antibiotic use in one study with saline nasal irrigation and this study also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the use of adjunct nasal decongestant treatment with nasal saline irrigation compared to control (<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK>). One study, reported a significant difference in quality of life and peak nasal expiratory flow (<LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>). However, there were significant methodological and reporting flaws that limit the interpretation of these data.</P>
<P>No serious adverse effects occurred in the included trials, although three children in one study experienced nosebleeds (<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK>). Minor adverse events were not uncommon and 40% to 44% of babies were shown to have difficulty with nasal drops. Discomfort in one study was associated with higher application pressures rather than the nasal saline solution itself (<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK>).</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review focused on RCTs of saline nasal irrigation for the symptomatic treatment of acute URTIs. The nature of saline nasal irrigation makes double-blinding difficult and an appropriate placebo difficult to find. There were a limited number of RCTs available and all of these studies were small in size. Of the five included trials, only two main outcomes could be combined for pooled analysis due to the differences in the clinical measures used. The two additional studies included since the original systematic review have not contributed data of sufficient size or quality to materially change the original findings (<LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Each trial reviewed used different strengths of saline solution, again limiting the possibilities for data comparison. In particular, <LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK> used a commercial isotonic seawater product containing zinc and other elements that may be a factor in the effects of the product.</P>
<P>Only one of the included papers examined the effect of saline irrigation on other symptoms, such as anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and cough associated with acute URTIs (<LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK>). This is a potential clinical application of the treatment but we located no other papers addressing the topic.</P>
<P>The clinical outcomes measured by each study were largely subjective, focusing on patient-reported symptoms, which increases risk of bias in the results. Furthermore, <LINK REF="STD-Bollag-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Bollag 1984</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wang-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wang 2009</LINK> relied on interpretation and reporting of infant patients' symptoms by parents, contributing to potential bias and this is a limitation in the interpretation of the results of these studies.</P>
<P>Two excluded studies, although excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, provided some corroborating evidence to support the need for future research that is better structured and controlled to investigate nasal saline irrigation as a treatment for acute URTIs (<LINK REF="STD-Inanli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Inanli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Passali-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Passali 2005</LINK>). The measure of mucociliary clearance (measured by <LINK REF="STD-Inanli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Inanli 2002</LINK>) is not clinically relevant and data relating to symptom relief and duration of illness would be more useful.</P>

<P>The summary of the evidence is presented in the <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>. For nasal saline versus a standard therapy or observation, we judged the evidence for a reduction in nasal symptoms or time to wellness to be of very low or low quality, meaning that we cannot have a high degree of confidence in this result. The studies are generally at unclear risk of bias and the sample sizes are small (most with fewer than 100 participants overall) and the possibility of chance findings and publication bias is high. Most of the data come from one or two trials. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.</P>

<P>We included one unpublished study in this updated review (<LINK REF="STD-King-2012" TYPE="STUDY">King 2012</LINK>). This unpublished trial was supervised by one of the authors (DK), whose role in the trial was as a supervisor and clinician. The 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction were undertaken by independent authors (BM, CW), who had no role in this trial.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Limited data from five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that saline nasal irrigation may have some benefit in patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). While some participants experienced minor discomfort, no serious side effects were identified. Nasal irrigation with saline is a safe treatment that may be mildly beneficial to some patients, though the existing evidence is too limited to support recommendations for or against its role as a standard intervention.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-04-15 01:14:50 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two new studies added to this review have not changed the findings from the last published review. However, further well-designed, sufficiently large and well-conducted RCTs are warranted to establish the place of nasal saline irrigation in acute URTIs. Further research should include clinically relevant respiratory symptoms as outcome measures, including cough. Given the range of different available topical saline treatments, future studies could include comparisons of liquid washes to sprays in the treatment of URTIs.</P>

<P>We undertook 'Risk of bias' assessment of all new and previously included studies following the new Cochrane recommendations. Some changes in reporting and interpretation of the data from studies included in the original review have occurred. These include changing the status of two studies from exclusion due to high risk of bias to exclusion due to not meeting the inclusion criteria for this review (<LINK REF="STD-Inanli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Inanli 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Passali-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Passali 2005</LINK>). We changed the primary and secondary outcome measures to avoid duplication; for example, duration of symptoms was a primary outcome in the original review while time to resolution of symptoms was a secondary outcome. Also, we noted the inclusion of the outcome 'time off work or school' from <LINK REF="STD-Slapak-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Slapak 2008</LINK> in the original review to be based on follow-up periods outside of the specifications for acute URTIs as specified in the protocol, so we omitted this from inclusion in this 2014 update.</P>

<DESCRIPTION>
<P>In addition to the above, there are some methodological flaws, mainly the averaging of symptoms over a week, especially over the first week that included a baseline measurement. We noted that from the data we cannot conclude that the groups were equal at baseline, nor that the improvement was due to an early treatment effect. We asked the authors to address this issue, with no reply</P>
