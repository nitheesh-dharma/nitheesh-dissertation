<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-29 17:58:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The use of analgesia for AAP does not mask clinical findings nor does it delay diagnosis.</P>
<P>Surgeons are reluctant to use analgesics during the diagnostic process and clinical evaluation of patients with AAP where there may be the possible requirement of surgical intervention. Generally, the fear is that analgesia can mask clinical findings and cause a delay in the diagnosis. Some reports suggest that the use of opioid analgesics in patients with AAP is not associated with masking the clinical picture or delaying the diagnosis.</P>
<P>Hence the research question of this review is: Does available evidence support the use of opioid analgesics in patients with AAP during the diagnostic process?</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to determine whether the evidence available to date supports the use of opioid analgesics in patients with AAP during the diagnostic process.</P>
<P>Clinical trials were performed, in which the use of any analgesic regime with opioids was compared to a placebo administered in the diagnosis process prior to decision-making in adult subjects with AAP, with no limitation on gender. The valued outcomes were: change in the intensity of the pain, change in the patient&#8217;s comfort level, time necessary to formulate diagnosis, time necessary to operate (in the applicable cases), rate of correct decision-making, error rate in the treatment undertaken, hospital stay and morbidity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-11 13:57:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Acute abdominal pain (AAP) is a common cause for consultation in emergency departments (ED). It is one of the top three symptoms for which patients go to the ED, and represents between 5% and 10% of all the illnesses treated in the ED (<LINK REF="REF-Stone-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stone 1998</LINK>). The most common causes of acute abdominal pain are appendicitis, cholecystitis, intestinal obstruction, urinary colic, gastritis, perforated peptic ulcer, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, gynaecological disorders in women and non-surgical abdominal pain (<LINK REF="REF-Ahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ahn 2002</LINK>). The diagnostic options that permit differentiation between serious and less serious acute abdominal problems are clinical history, physical exploration and the results of general laboratory tests (<LINK REF="REF-Mahler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahler 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>For decades, the indication of analgesia in patients with AAP has been considered prohibited, or it has been deferred at least until establishing the definitive diagnosis for fear of masking symptoms, generating a change in the physical exploration or obstructing the diagnostic process of a surgically treatable disease.</P>
<P>There are several relevant obstacles to determining the appropriate use of analgesia in patients with AAP. The most important are: lack of adequate evidence-based data, contradiction between the perception of the pain on the part of the doctors and their patients, and concern over a misdiagnosis once the patients with abdominal pain receive an analgesic (<LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHale-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McHale 2001</LINK>). Many surgeons make it standard clinical practice to not use analgesics prior to the valuation and decision regarding surgery in patients with AAP because they think the analgesia could make the evaluation and diagnostic accuracy difficult (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>This non-evidence-based approach has been questioned by some analgesic work groups who have shown that the use of analgesics in the diagnostic process of patients with AAP leads to a significant reduction in pain without affecting diagnostic accuracy (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Despite advances in the knowledge of physiology and progress in the treatment of pain, the use of analgesics in the diagnostic process of patients with AAP is not considered a conventional treatment. Some studies suggest a fast and effective analgesia does not interfere with the diagnosis in patients with acute abdomen; indeed, it may even facilitate the initial physical exploration. This is a matter in which, moreover, several analgesic regimes have been used (<LINK REF="REF-Camus_x002d_Kerebel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Camus-Kerebel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 2003a</LINK>). While this controversy surrounds the ED, only a few studies have broached the level of doctor-patient agreement regarding the intensity of the abdominal pain and the need for analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Attard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Attard 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McHale-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McHale 2001</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Thomas-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thomas 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, the early administration of analgesics in patients with AAP can reduce the pain considerably; in fact, it does not interfere with the diagnosis and may even facilitate it despite the reduction in the intensity of the symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Attard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Attard 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>This research proposes that it is humane and safe to administer pharmacological pain relief to patients who arrive at the ED with AAP as long as there are no contraindications (<LINK REF="STD-McHale-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McHale 2001</LINK>). This review examined the currently available evidence that supports opioid analgesic use or non-use in the diagnostic process of patients with AAP.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2010-06-11 13:57:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Trial Selection<BR/>From the result of the electronic searches, two independent reviewers selected the studies with the inclusion criteria using a checklist designed in advance for that purpose. The discrepancies were solved by consensus.</P>
<P>Trial Identification<BR/>Two reviewers (CM, MV) independently evaluated the titles and abstracts of reports identified through the electronic search. Potentially relevant studies selected by at least one reviewer were retrieved in full text versions to be evaluated for valuation and subsequent inclusion.</P>
<P>Data Extraction<BR/>A specific page was generated of the data collected. Two reviewers extracted the data relating to the design type of the studies included, the participants, the analgesic regime used (drugs, dose and tracts of administration), the method of random allocation (patient characteristics and numbers), the exclusion criteria after the process of random allocation, the masking of the patients and/or the observers; and the outcome measures described previously.</P>
<P>Quality Assessment<BR/>
</P>
<P>The studies were blinded (the authors and institutions were deleted and the results section removed) to the reviewers. The checklist for the quality of the de randomised controlled trials included: concealment of the allocation sequence, generation of the allocation sequence, comparability between groups at the baseline and inclusion of all randomised participants in the analysis. Allocation concealment is regarded as particularly important in protecting against bias and was graded using the Cochrane approach as follows:</P>
<P>Grade A: Clearly adequate concealment</P>
<P>Grade B: Possibly adequate concealment</P>
<P>Grade C: Clearly inadequate concealment</P>
<P>Data Analysis<BR/>
</P>
<P>The data set was generated as completely as possible. The data from the primary studies included were reviewed qualitatively and quantitatively using the Cochrane Collaborations´ statistical software RevMan Analysis 5.0.</P>
<P>The quantitative analysis of outcomes was based on intention-to-treat results. In the case of an existing clinically significant heterogeneity, statistical analyses were not applied to the results. After to meta-analysis, a heterogeneity chi-squared test was applied. In cases of heterogeneity, the random effects model was used to meta-analyse the results.</P>
<P>Then a sensitivity analysis was applied based on quality assessment.  </P>

<P>Randomised double-blind controlled trial with allocation concealment unclear, conducted at Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry. 100 consecutive patients over 16 years of age with clinically significant abdominal pain of less than 48 hours&#8217; evolution who were admitted as emergencies to a surgical firm. In the study, subjects were randomised to intramuscular injection of up to 20 mg papaveretum or an equivalent volume of saline (50 patients to each group). Outcome measures considered were pain and tenderness scores, assessment of patient comfort, accuracy of diagnosis and management decisions. Median pain and tenderness scores were lower after papaveretum. Incorrect diagnoses and management decisions applied to 2/50 patients after papaveretum compared with 9/50 patients after saline solution injection.</P>

A statistically significant change in physical examination was noted in both groups receiving analgesics, but not in the placebo group. No adverse events or delays in diagnosis were attributed to the administration of analgesics. </P>

<P>Randomized double-blind controlled trial with allocation concealment unclear, conducted at Hopitaux Universitaires de Geneve, Switzerland. 340 patients over 16 years of age who consulted the emergency department for pain in the right lower part of the abdomen were considered. In the study, subjects were randomised to morphine (10 mg) or placebo (normal saline made up to an equal volume); 175 patients received morphine and 165 received placebo. Outcome measures considered were VAS pain level, final diagnosis, diagnostic accuracy, appropriateness of the decision to operate. Pain relief was stronger in the morphine group; among female patients, the decision to operate was appropriate more often in the morphine group; and, in male patients and overall, opioid analgesia did not influence the appropriateness of the decision. </P>

<P>Randomized double-blind controlled trial with adequate allocation concealment, conducted at National University Hospital, Singapore. Sixty-six patients over 16 years with right lower quadrant pain of less than a week's duration (non-traumatic in origin) suggestive of acute appendicitis were admitted. In the study, subjects were randomised to Tramadol (1 mg/Kg) or placebo (normal saline made up to an equal volume); 33 patients to each group. Outcome measures considered were absence or presence of seven abdominal signs (tenderness on light and deep palpation, tenderness in the right lower quadrant and elsewhere, rebound, cough, and percussion tenderness) and pain measured by VAS at 0 and 30 minutes. There was significant reduction in mean VAS in the analgesic group versus in the placebo group. The analgesic group had less normalization of signs. </P>

<P>Randomized double-blind controlled trial with adequate allocation concealment, conducted at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA. 160 consecutive patients over 21 years of age with atraumatic abdominal pain of less than 48 hours&#8217; duration were enrolled in the study, of whom 153 were available for analysis. 78 were allocated to receive morphine and 75 to receive placebo. In the study, subjects were randomised to receive 0.1 mg/kg morphine sulphate or placebo. Outcome measure considered was clinically important diagnostic accuracy. The median decrease in VAS score at 15 minutes was 33 mm in the morphine group and 2 mm in the placebo group. There were 11 instances of diagnostic discrepancy in each group, for a clinically important diagnostic accuracy of 86% (67/78) in the morphine group and 85% (64/75) in the placebo group. The difference in clinically important diagnostic accuracy between the 2 groups was 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] -11% to 12%). Analysis by efficacy and intention to treat yielded similar results. Kappa for interobserver concordance in classification of clinically important diagnostic accuracy was 0.94 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.00). No patients required naloxone. </P>

<P>Randomized double-blind controlled trial with adequate allocation concealment, conducted at Sina Hospital, Teheran, Iran. 71 consecutive patients over 14 years with clinically significant abdominal pain were enrolled in the study, 35 were allocated to receive morphine and 36 to receive placebo. In the study, subjects were randomised to receive 0.1 mg/kg morphine sulphate or saline (0.9%) to a maximum dose of 10 mg over a 5 min period. Outcome measures considered were pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and signs of acute appendicitis. A more favorable change in VAS score was reported in the morphine group with a significantly greater reduction in the median VAS score than in the placebo group. In 76.7% of patients in the morphine group, appendicitis was confirmed vs. 71.4% of the placebo group. Morphine administration did not cause significant changes in patients' signs or in the physicians' plans or diagnoses. No adverse events were seen in either group.</P>

<B>Summary of included trials.</B>
</P>
<P>In summary, eight studies were selected for this systematic review. All of them published in English. The aim of these studies was to compare the use of opioid analgesia (477 patients) versus placebo (446 patients) in patients with AAP. Six trials use morphine sulphate, one study used tramadol, and the other study papaveretum. The inclusion criteria were the same for all studies: patients over 14 years old with non-traumatic AAP, less than a weeks duration, without gender restriction. Few outcome measures were analysed: changes in physical examination, pain measured by VAS (basal and after intervention), adverse events, final diagnosis, diagnostic accuracy, management decisions.</P>

<P>Eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The sample is made up of 922 patients, 475 in an opioid treatment group and 447 in a placebo group. The eight clinical trials evaluated the use of opioids compared with a saline solution administered in equivalent volume and in the same manner; six of them used morphine in a dose of 5 to 15 mg with a total of 392 subjects in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Pace-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pace 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-LoVecchio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">LoVecchio 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Amoli-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Amoli 2008</LINK>); one study used Tramadol in a dose of 1mg/kg with a total of 33 subjects in the treatment group (<LINK REF="STD-Mahadevan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mahadevan 2000</LINK>) and one study used papaveretum in a dose of 20 mg with a total of 50 subjects (<LINK REF="STD-Attard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Attard 1992</LINK>). In all the studies, the groups were comparable with respect to the intensity of pain prior to the administration of the therapies under study (Analysis 01:01: WMD 0.12, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.26]). When analysing by subgroups of drugs (Analysis 01:02), no significant differences were found in relation to the intensity of pain measured by VAS among those subjects that received morphine (WMD 0.10, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.24]) versus those that received tramadol (WMD 0.68, 95% CI [-0.04, 1.40]) or papaveretum (WMD 0.20, 95% CI [-0.65, 1.05]). The studies were combined by means of a random effects model given that there was statistical heterogeneity.</P>

<B>Change in the intensity of pain (Analysis 01:05)</B>
<BR/>The 8 trials registered the intensity of post-treatment pain as a measure of the result, reported using VAS. The grouping of the results showed that in 7 studies the intensity of the pain decreased significantly with the use of opioid analgesics (<LINK REF="STD-Amoli-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Amoli 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-LoVecchio-1997" TYPE="STUDY">LoVecchio 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Pace-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Pace 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thomas-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thomas 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Vermeulen-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Vermeulen 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Attard-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Attard 1992</LINK>) in patients with AAP (grouped WMD -1.94, 95% CI [-2.92, -0.95]). Only <LINK REF="STD-Mahadevan-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mahadevan 2000</LINK> did not demonstrate any benefit in the reduction of pain (WMD -0.09, 95% CI [-0.81, 0.63]).When analysing by subgroups of drugs, it was observed that those patients that received morphine (WMD -1.78, 95% CI [-2.62, -0.95]) and papaveretum (WMD -5.20, 95% CI [-6.91, -3.49])had a significant reduction in pain compared to those that received tramadol (WMD -0.09, 95% CI [-0.81, 0.63]).

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-11 13:59:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eight trials fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in this study. These contribute 922 patients, a number that seems reduced to us given the high prevalence that AAP represents as a cause of consultation in ED. In general terms, it is possible to mention that the methodological quality of the studies included is good, but heterogeneous.</P>
<P>This review shows that the administration of opioid analgesics as part of the diagnostic process for patients with AAP prior to a decision being made did not increase the risk of making unsuitable treatment decisions; it also significantly improved the patient&#8217;s comfort when comparing it with the placebo.</P>
<P>No information was found relating to whether the administration of opioids increases the time of clinical evaluation or if a delay occurs in the decision-making with respect to surgery. As a result, it is not possible to determine for this study the costs involved.</P>
<P>In relation to the hospital stay, this was scarcely reported; and it is only possible to mention that there are not differences in the times of hospitalisation in patients who received opioid analgesics in comparison with those who received a placebo.</P>
<P>A systematic review was found on the subject (<LINK REF="STD-Ranji-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ranji 2006</LINK>), which used 9 Randomized Controlled Trials. We excluded two of these: one for having used sublingual buprenorphine as the analgesic (<LINK REF="STD-Zoltie-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Zoltie 1986</LINK>); and the other for having used intravenous fentanyl as the analgesic and for failure to specify the characteristics of the population in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Garyfallou-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Garyfallou 1997</LINK>). There is also a narrative review (<LINK REF="STD-McHale-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McHale 2001</LINK>) that do not establishes definitive conclusions and only suggest that it is safe and humane to administer opioid analgesics to patients with AAP that require emergency attention and that do not have any contraindications for their use.</P>
<P>In general terms, there are sufficient data in this review to suggest that the use of opioid analgesics in patients with AAP does not increase the risk of inadequate treatment decisions; and indeed, it significantly improves the patient&#8217;s comfort level, while the diagnostic process if brought to a conclusion.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-10-30 00:39:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Some evidence indicates that the use of opioid analgesics in patients with AAP, in addition to improving their comfort while the diagnostic process is concluded, does not increase the risk of diagnosis error or the risk of error in decisions for treatment. However, this review is not attempting to recommend any analgesic regime in particular.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-11 13:59:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>More high-quality clinical trials are needed to establish the most effective treatment protocols. The included studies are in generally adequate to answer the questions; however, some methodological issues make it imperfect (different research objectives, small sample size and inadequate randomisation). Thus, primary studies require a common objective, an adequate sample size estimation and proper use of random assignment of study subjects. These are the methodological details that can determine that the final conclusion is inappropriate, truthful and non-reliable. In this case, the results suggest that &#8220;the use of opioid analgesics in the therapeutic diagnosis of patients with AAP does not increase the risk of diagnosis error or the risk of error in making decisions regarding treatment&#8221;, but if the primary studies were less heterogeneous and had a larger number of in study subjects, it is possible that the end result was different; for example that &#8220;the non use of opioid analgesics in the therapeutic diagnosis of patients with AAP does increase the risk of diagnosis error or the risk of error in making decisions regarding treatment&#8221; (this, based on the trend observed in the graphs of meta-analysis).</P>
