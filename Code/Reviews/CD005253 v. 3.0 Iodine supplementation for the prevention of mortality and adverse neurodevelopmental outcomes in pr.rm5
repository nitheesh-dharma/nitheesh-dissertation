<P>There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that supplementing the diet of preterm infants with iodine is beneficial. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones are important for brain development in newborn infants. Preterm infants often have low levels of iodine and of thyroid hormones in the first few weeks after birth. This may in part be due to a lack of iodine in their diet. We found only one trial that assessed the effect of giving preterm babies extra iodine. This study did not find any evidence that providing extra iodine increased the level of thyroid hormones. The trial did not assess the effect of providing extra iodine on brain development. Further trials are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Parenteral nutrition solutions, formula milks, and human breast milk contain insufficient iodine to meet recommended intakes for preterm infants. Iodine deficiency may exacerbate transient hypothyroxinaemia in preterm infants and this may be associated with adverse respiratory or neurological outcomes.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials that dietary supplementation with iodine reduces mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - November 2005), EMBASE (1980 - November 2005), CINAHL (1982 - November 2005), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared a policy of supplementing enteral or parenteral feeds with iodine (more than 30 micrograms per kilogram per day) versus placebo or no supplementation in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two reviewers, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. The primary outcomes for this review were neonatal mortality, death before hospital discharge, and longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes including severe neurodevelopmental disability.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>We found only one randomised controlled trial (N = 121) that fulfilled the review eligibility criteria (Rogahn 2000). The participants were infants born before 33 weeks' gestation (but most were of birth weight greater than 1000 grams). The primary aim of this trial was to assess the effect of iodine supplementation on thyroid function. The investigators did not detect any statistically significant effects on the plasma levels of thyroxine (free and total), triiodothyronine, or thyrotrophin in preterm infants (measured up to 40 weeks' post-conceptional age). Only one infant died and the trial was therefore underpowered to detect an effect on mortality. The trial did not assess the effect of the intervention on neurodevelopmental morbidity. There was not a statistically significant difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There are insufficient data at present to determine whether providing preterm infants with supplemental iodine (to match fetal accretion rates) prevents morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Future randomised controlled trials of iodine supplementation should focus on extremely preterm and extremely low birth weight infants, the group at greatest risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia. These trials should aim to assess the effect of iodine supplementation on clinically important outcomes including respiratory morbidity and longer term neurodevelopment.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Transient hypothyroxinaemia, a temporary postnatal reduction in serum levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine with normal levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, is well described in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>). The incidence, and degree and duration, of hypothyroxinaemia is inversely related to birth weight and gestational age and positively correlated with illness severity (particularly the severity of respiratory distress syndrome). The incidence of transient hypothyroxinaemia, defined as plasma thyroxine levels below 40 micrograms per litre, ranges from 40% in infants born at 23 weeks' gestation to 10% in infants born at 28 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>There is concern that transient hypothyroxinaemia may harm brain development. Observational studies have suggested a link between hypothyroxinaemia and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes including low intelligence and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Meijer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meijer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Den-Ouden-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Den Ouden 1996</LINK>). It is unclear whether transient hypothyroxinaemia is causally related to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes or is a consequence of extreme prematurity or severe illness in preterm infants. </P>
<P>Studies in animal models have suggested that thyroid hormones may act synergistically with corticosteroids to accelerate surfactant production and reduce the severity of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Liggins-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Liggins 1988</LINK>). However, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of antenatal administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone did not show any improvement in outcomes for preterm infants. In fact, antenatal exposure to thyrotrophin releasing hormone is associated with a higher risk of infants needing mechanical ventilation (<LINK REF="REF-Crowther-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crowther 2004</LINK>). Similarly, the Cochrane review of trials of thyroid hormones administered shortly after birth to very preterm infants did not find any evidence of effect on mortality or neurodevelopment, or on the severity of respiratory distress syndrome or the incidence of chronic lung disease (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>). However, the small number of infants included in trials in that review limited the power of the meta-analyses to detect clinically important differences in outcomes. </P>
<P>The aetiology of transient hypothyroxinaemia is multifactorial. As well as the contribution of non-thyroidal illness and immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, it is speculated that iodine deficiency may contribute to transient hypothyroxinaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Ares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ares 1997</LINK>). The neonatal thyroid gland stores low levels of iodine and is very sensitive to iodine deficiency. Nutrient balance studies in healthy preterm infants indicate that daily iodine intakes of at least 30 micrograms per kilogram are needed to maintain a positive iodine balance (<LINK REF="REF-Ares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ares 1997</LINK>). An international consensus statement recommends daily iodine intakes of 30 to 60 micrograms per kilogram for healthy growing formula fed preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Tsang-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tsang 1993</LINK>). </P>
<P>The breast milk of mothers of preterm infants contains about 100 to 150 micrograms of iodine per litre (depending on the dietary iodine intake of the mother). The iodine content of formula milks ranges from 20 to 170 micrograms per litre (<LINK REF="REF-Ares-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ares 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seibold_x002d_Weiger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seibold-Weiger 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Semba-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Semba 2001</LINK>). Neither commercially available breast-milk fortifiers nor mineral and vitamin supplements contain iodine. Enterally fed preterm infants therefore may not achieve the recommended intake of iodine, especially during the first weeks of postnatal life when feed volumes are still being advanced (<LINK REF="REF-Ares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ares 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Preterm infants who are predominantly parenterally-fed are at even greater risk of negative iodine balance. Most commercially available parenteral nutrition solutions contain less iodine than breast or formula milk (even though gastrointestinal absorption of iodine is high). The American Society for Clinical Nutrition has recommended daily parenteral iodine intakes of about one microgram per kilogram. This conservative recommendation was influenced by an assumption that most parenterally fed preterm infants will also absorb iodine transcutaneously from topical iodinated antiseptic solutions. However, the use of iodinated antiseptics for preterm infants has decreased due to concern that excessive transcutaneous iodine intake (100 micrograms per day or more) causes early acquired neonatal hypothyroidism (<LINK REF="REF-Smerdely-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smerdely 1989</LINK>). Evidence exists that parentally fed very preterm infants who have not been exposed to other sources of iodine achieve daily iodine intakes of about 1 to 3 micrograms per kilogram and are in negative iodine balance during the first week of postnatal life (<LINK REF="REF-Ibrahim-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ibrahim 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Given the potential for negative iodine balance to cause hypothyroxinaemia and consequently adverse neurological and respiratory outcomes, especially in parentally fed or sick preterm infants, and despite the lack of evidence that exogenous thyroid hormone supplementation is beneficial, we have reviewed the available evidence concerning iodine supplementation for preventing morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether dietary supplementation with iodine affects mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. We planned to examine the evidence of effect of enteral and parenteral iodine supplementation in separate comparisons.</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Supplementation with iodine compared with placebo or no supplementation. Iodine supplementation will be defined as aiming to provide more than 30 micrograms per kilogram of iodine per day.

</CRIT_OUTCOMES>
</SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<SEARCH_METHODS>
<P>We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, including electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - November 2005), CINAHL (1982 - November 2005), and EMBASE (1980 - November 2005). The search strategy used the following text words and MeSH terms: Infant-Newborn; Infant-Low Birth Weight; Infant-Premature; infan$; neonat$; newborn; premature; low birth weight; LBW; Infant-Nutrition; enteral nutrition; milk; infant food; parenteral nutrition; TPN; iodine; iodide; Thyroid Hormones; Thyroxine; Triiodothyronine; hypothyroxin$. We limited the search outputs with the relevant filters for clinical trials. We did not apply any language restriction. </P>
<P>We examined references in previous reviews and in studies identified as potentially relevant. We hand searched the abstracts presented at the annual scientific meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research, the European Society for Pediatric Research, the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (from 1980 - 2004). Unpublished studies and studies published only as abstracts were eligible for inclusion if assessment of study quality was possible and if other criteria for inclusion were fulfilled. We planned to contact authors of studies published as abstracts for further information.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Mohammed Ibrahim (MI) screened the title and abstract of all studies identified by the above search strategy and obtained the full articles for all potentially relevant trials. MI and William McGuire (WM) re-assessed independently the full text of these reports using an eligibility form based on the pre-specified inclusion criteria. We excluded studies that did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. The reviewers resolve any disagreements by discussion until consensus was achieved.</P>
<P>2. MI and WM used the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess independently the methodological quality of the included trial in terms of allocation concealment, blinding of parents or carers and assessors to intervention, and completeness of assessment in all randomised individuals. </P>
<P>3. MI and WM used a data collection form to aid extraction of relevant information and data from the included study. Each reviewer extracted the data separately, compared data, and resolved differences by discussion</P>
<P>4. We have presented outcomes for categorical data as relative risk, risk difference, and number needed to treat, with respective 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we planned to use the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence interval. </P>
<P>5. We planned estimate the treatment effects of individual trials and examine heterogeneity between trial results by inspecting the forest plots and quantifying the impact of heterogeneity in any meta-analysis using a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies' results (I- squared statistic). If we detected statistical heterogeneity, we planned to explore the possible causes (for example, differences in study quality, participants, intervention regimens, or outcome assessments) using post hoc sub group analyses. We planned to use a fixed effects model for meta-analyses. </P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We identified only one study that fulfilled the review inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Rogahn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rogahn 2000</LINK>). We did not identify any studies that appeared eligible, but did not meet all inclusion criteria following systematic appraisal.</P>
<P>The investigators randomly allocated 121 infants born before 33 weeks' gestation to receive either:<BR/>1. iodine-supplemented "preterm" formula milk (iodine concentration 272 micrograms per litre), or <BR/>2. the same formula without iodine supplementation (iodine concentration 68 micrograms per litre). </P>
<P>This strategy was designed to provide an iodine intake of 40 - 50 micrograms/kg/day in the intervention group versus 12 - 16 micrograms/kg/day in the control group. Infants were allocated to receive the trial formula milks until they reached 40 weeks' post conceptional age. Infants may have received parenteral nutrition prior to receiving formula milk. This is unlikely to have contained iodine (but this is not stated explicitly in the trial report). Similarly, it is not clear from the published report whether infants may have been exposed to iodine in skin disinfecting solutions.</P>
<P>The primary outcome was the plasma level of thyroid hormones. Short term clinical outcome data were also reported. Neurodevelopment and cognitive function were not assessed but longer term follow up of the trial cohorts may examine these outcomes. The formula milk was supplied on demand either as the sole feed or in addition to maternal breast milk. Infants who were enrolled in the study but who received sufficient maternal breast milk such that they never received any of the trial formula were still included in the primary intention-to-treat analyses. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the included study was good. The random sequence was derived from a random number table and allocation was concealed with sealed opaque envelopes. The intervention and control formula milks were identical in appearance and the iodine levels were not known to parents, carers, or outcome assessors. Complete biochemical outcome data up to 40 weeks' post-menstrual age were available for 114 (of 121) infants. Biochemical data were not available for six infants withdrawn from study post-randomisation (reasons not stated) and for one infant who died during the study period. The primary analyses were by intention-to-treat.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>Enteral iodine supplementation: </B>One eligible trial (<LINK REF="STD-Rogahn-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Rogahn 2000</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>1. Mortality: Only one infant died during the study period. The infant was randomised to the control group but only received breast milk (personal communication Steven Ryan): Relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 7.89); risk difference -0.02 (-0.06 to 0.03).</P>
<P>2. Neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes: not assessed. </P>
<P>3. Respiratory outcomes: The trial did not detect any statistically significant difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or of treatment with supplemental oxygen. These data were reported as median (range) but without standard deviations and therefore relative risks and risk differences could not be calculated. </P>
<P>16 of 61 surviving infants in the intervention group developed chronic lung disease (supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' post-conceptional age) versus 24 of 59 surviving infants in the control group: Relative risk 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.09); risk difference -0.14 (-0.31 to 0.02). Because death prior to hospital discharge and the development of chronic lung disease (supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' post-conceptional age) are competing outcomes, we aggregated these as a composite outcome "chronic lung disease or prior death". This outcome did not differ significantly between the groups: Relative risk 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 1.06); risk difference -0.15 (-0.32 to 0.01). </P>
<P>4. Measures of thyroid function: The study did not detect any statistically significant differences in the plasma levels of thyroid hormones (thyroxine, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotrophin) measured at 30, 35, and 40 weeks' post-conceptional age:</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The single trial that we have identified did not find any evidence that enteral iodine supplementation affected thyroid hormone levels or clinical outcomes in preterm infants. However, the infants who participated in this trial did not belong to the population most likely to be affected by iodine and thyroid hormone deficiency. Most of the infants were in the 1000 to 1500 grams birth weight range and were clinically stable. Only 17 of the 121 participants were of birth weight less than 1000 grams. Observational data suggest that transient hypothyroxinaemia is most strongly associated with adverse respiratory and neurological outcomes in extremely low birth weight or extremely preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Reuss-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reuss 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rooman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rooman 1996</LINK>). Secondly, the intervention (iodine-supplemented formula milk) was started when the infants had established enteral feeding, usually two weeks after birth. In extremely preterm infants, iodine balance is negative and transient hypothyroxinaemia is established in the first one to two weeks after birth. Some of the participating infants received all or part of their intake as breast milk which has a higher iodine concentration than standard formula milk. Including these infants in the intention to treat analysis may have reduced the difference in the average amounts of iodine that each group actually received. Participating infants may also have received parenteral nutrition. However, this is not likely to have contained iodine. It is not clear whether infants may have been exposed to iodine containing antiseptics. If so, this may also have contributed to reducing the difference in actual iodine intake between the groups. We will attempt to clarify these issues with the trial investigators. </P>
<P>An alternative option to iodine supplementation for infants at risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia is treatment with thyroid hormones. The available data from randomised controlled trials of post-natal thyroid hormone supplementation have not provided any evidence that this intervention prevents morbidity or mortality in very preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2001</LINK>). However, in one trial post hoc subgroup analyses suggest that thyroxine replacement might prevent neurodevelopmental morbidity in extremely preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-van-Wassenaer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Wassenaer 1997</LINK>). The Cochrane review concluded that further trials in this population may be warranted. It is not clear whether direct thyroid hormone supplementation has any advantages over iodine supplementation. Theoretically, since iodine supplementation is metabolically "upstream" of thyroid hormone replacement, it is likely to result in more physiologically appropriate tissue levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine than direct supplementation with thyroid hormones (<LINK REF="REF-Ares-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ares 1997</LINK>). However, there is also the theoretical disadvantage that over-treatment with iodine can cause transient hypothyroidism in preterm neonates who are exquisitely sensitive to the anti-thyroid effects of iodine excess (<LINK REF="REF-Smerdely-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smerdely 1989</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The data are insufficient at present to determine whether iodine supplementation prevents mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for a large pragmatic randomised controlled trial to determine if iodine supplementation, started within a few days after birth, prevents morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Trials should focus on extremely preterm and/or extremely low birth weight infants, the group at greatest risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia, and should aim to assess the effect of iodine supplementation on clinically important outcomes including respiratory morbidity and long term neurodevelopment. We are aware of one such trial that is currently in the development stage: see http://www.euthyroid.org/. </P>
