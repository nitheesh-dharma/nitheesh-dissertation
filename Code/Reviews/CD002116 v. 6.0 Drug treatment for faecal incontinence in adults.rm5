<TITLE>Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:30:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Faecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements or leakage of stool or faeces) is a common healthcare problem, affecting up to one in 10 of adults living at home. This affects daily activities in about one or two in 100 people. It is more common in people living in residential care. Leakage of urine often occurs as well. Faecal incontinence can be debilitating and embarrassing. Treatments include pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation, surgery and drugs. This review looked at drugs for the treatment of faecal incontinence. These included anti-diarrhoea drugs or laxatives to regulate stools, and drugs to try to enhance the tone of muscle around the anus which help to keep it closed. Sixteen small trials were found, including 558 participants. The review of these trials found some evidence that anti-diarrhoea drugs may reduce faecal incontinence for people having liquid stools. However, these drugs were associated with some side effects. There was some evidence that drugs to enhance the tone of the muscle around the anus may help, but more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-05-17 15:53:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-05-14 15:20:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-05-17 20:42:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:30:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:30:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross-over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight-reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence.</P>
<P>Seven trials tested anti-diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc-aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified.</P>
<P>There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses.</P>
<P>Zinc-aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group.</P>
<P>It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-05-14 15:23:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:44:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Faecal incontinence may be defined as the involuntary loss of solid or liquid faeces (<LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>). It is a common healthcare problem, and its prevalence may range from 1.6% to 15% depending on the definition used, the age of patients and whether patients are community-dwelling or living in an institution (<LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 2009</LINK>). The real prevalence of faecal incontinence is likely to be even higher than reported as the social stigma associated with faecal incontinence means patients are reluctant to seek help due to embarrassment (<LINK REF="REF-Deutekom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutekom 2012</LINK>). Faecal incontinence is a distressing symptom for patients; it has a major negative impact on quality of life and activities of daily living, and is often accompanied by severe social restriction (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rockwood-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rockwood 2000</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:30:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Faecal incontinence may occur passively, where there is involuntary loss of faeces without urge to defecate, or may be preceded by urgency, where there is loss of faeces following inability to resist the urge to defecate for long enough to reach the toilet (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>). Faecal incontinence has a range of possible causes. The maintenance of continence is reliant on a number of interacting factors which include an intact and functional anal sphincter complex, the consistency of faeces, adequate cognitive and physical ability, and bowel motility. The impairment of any of these elements may lead to incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Faecal incontinence may occur due to damage to the anal sphincter mechanism following anal surgery such as anal dilatation, sphincterotomy, fistula surgery or haemorrhoidectomy (<LINK REF="REF-Lindsey-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindsey 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>). Trauma to the anal sphincter may also occur during childbirth with third or fourth degree vaginal tears (<LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 2007</LINK>). Dysfunction of the anal sphincters may occur without structural damage in cases of primary degeneration, systemic disease such as systemic sclerosis, or due to damage of the myenteric plexus following radiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Da-Silva-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Da Silva 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vaizey-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vaizey 1997</LINK>). In addition to this, faecal incontinence may occur due to spinal injury or other neurological disease causing sensory or motor impairment to the continence mechanism, or due to rectal loading and subsequent overflow leakage in frail or immobile individuals, or due to physical or mental disability affecting toilet habits (<LINK REF="REF-Norton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2012</LINK>). Moreover, in many cases faecal incontinence occurs due to the combination of structural, physiological and psycho-social factors (<LINK REF="REF-Rao-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tuteja-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuteja 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>The management of faecal incontinence varies according to the underlying disorder, the impact of the problem on the patient's quality of life and the available resources. However, for many conditions, the treatment options are limited, relying mainly on surgery and constipating drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Madoff-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Madoff 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Treatment options include:</P>
<P>(i) Conservative Treatment</P>
<P>Conservative options include pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, dietary modification, use of pads and plug devices. Previously published Cochrane reviews have considered these modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Deutekom-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deutekom 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fader-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fader 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2012</LINK>)</P>
<P>(ii) Surgical Treatment</P>
<P>Surgical options include sphincter repair, neo-sphincter formation, formation of colostomy or stoma, the antegrade continent enema (ACE) procedure and newer techniques such as injection augmentation and implanted sacral nerve stimulation. Previously published Cochrane reviews have considered these modalities (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maeda-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maeda 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>(iii) Medical Treatment</P>
<P>Medical treatment options include the use of constipating agents and laxatives, and these drugs are the subject of this review and are discussed below. Other medical treatment options include evacuation aids and stool bulking agents but these options are not considered within this review.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:30:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Constipating agents</HEADING>
<P>Constipating agents include loperamide, codeine phosphate and co-phenotrope. Loperamide is the most common drug due to its low side-effect profile (<LINK REF="REF-Gattuso-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gattuso 1994</LINK>). Initially, small doses (e.g. 2 mg to 4 mg daily) are titrated according to clinical symptom response. Liquid formulations are available if even lower doses are needed. People with liquid stool (for example following ileoanal pouch surgery) may require much higher doses. Codeine phosphate is used in a similar way, but side effects such as drowsiness may limit its use. In unresponsive cases the combined use of both loperamide and codeine phosphate may be useful. Co-phenotrope (a proprietary mixture of diphenoxylate with atropine) is not favoured due to the high incidence of side effects, particularly those related to the atropine component.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Laxatives</HEADING>
<P>Laxative treatment (e.g. lactulose, a galactose-fructose disaccharide) is used most often in elderly people, to treat faecal incontinence associated with constipation or faecal impaction.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Drugs acting on anal sphincter tone</HEADING>
<P>Drugs which act on the anal sphincter may have an important role to play in the treatment of patients with faecal incontinence, especially in those with nocturnal symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000a-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000a #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000b-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000b #</LINK>). Phenylephrine gel, an alpha1-adrenergic agonist, is applied topically to the anal margin. Zinc-aluminium ointment is applied topically to the anal canal mucosa (<LINK REF="STD-Pinedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinedo 2012</LINK>). Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant medication which is usually taken orally for the treatment of a range of different psychiatric conditions, but may also have a contractile effect on the internal anal sphincter (<LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-1990-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 1990 #</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:31:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mode of action of constipating agents, such as loperamide, is not completely understood but they may reduce faecal incontinence by increasing anal sphincter smooth muscle tone, reducing stool weight and small bowel motility, and by altering stool consistency so that it is less soft (<LINK REF="STD-Read-1982-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1982 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herbst-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herbst 1998</LINK>). Laxatives act to reduce symptoms in those who have bypass faecal incontinence secondary to constipation or faecal impaction (<LINK REF="STD-Chassagne-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Chassagne 2000</LINK>). Phenylephrine gel, sodium valproate and zinc-aluminium ointment may reduce faecal incontinence by increasing the tone or contraction strength of the anal sphincter (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000a-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000a #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000b-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000b #</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-1990-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 1990 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinedo 2012</LINK>). There is evidence that aluminium can act to increase smooth muscle contraction by acting on the plasmatic membrane and inhibiting the influx of calcium ions in smooth muscle cells (<LINK REF="STD-Pinedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinedo 2012</LINK>).</P>

If this was not the case, we considered whether the trial should be excluded. Attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists. However, if this was not possible, data were reported as given in the studies, except if there was evidence of differential loss to follow-up from the randomised groups.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:36:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The rationale behind the pharmacological management of faecal incontinence is that drugs may improve stool consistency or enhance anal sphincter function or promote complete rectal evacuation. The use of antidiarrhoeal and constipating agents in the treatment of faecal incontinence is a common clinical strategy, either alone or as an adjunct to other treatment modalities (surgery or conservative measures). Seven trials identified in this review assessed commonly used antidiarrhoeals (loperamide, codeine and diphenoxylate plus atropine) in people with chronic diarrhoea and those who had undergone ileoanal pouch surgery. Although these trials focused on the treatment of chronic diarrhoea, rather than on the management of faecal incontinence, they were included in this review because most of the participants presented with faecal incontinence as a complication of their underlying condition. Seven trials looked at novel pharmacological strategies to enhance anal sphincter function and two further trials tested ways of using lactulose for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with impaired rectal emptying or constipation.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:36:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten of the included trials assessed whether drug therapy may improve faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea or following ileoanal pouch surgery). Two trials evaluated elderly people with faecal incontinence associated with constipation or faecal impaction, and two further trials focused on people with passive faecal incontinence but structurally intact sphincters. One trial enrolled patients who were using a drug to treat their obesity (orlistat) to decrease the incidence of faecal incontinence. Only one of these 13 trials specifically evaluated the use of drugs in incontinent people with normal stool consistency but functionally impaired anal sphincters (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000a-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000a #</LINK>). In one trial the diagnosis was not specified (<LINK REF="STD-Pinedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinedo 2012</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Findings of the included trials seem to indicate that anti-diarrhoeal/constipating drugs may perform better than placebo in terms of continence outcomes and measures of bowel function (e.g. frequency, urgency, consistency, reduction in diarrhoea), although the participants may experience adverse effects. However, no statistical weight could be given to these findings.</P>
<P>One trial comparing three different anti-diarrhoeal/constipating agents (loperamide, codeine, diphenoxylate plus atropine) in people with chronic diarrhoea showed that treatment with either loperamide or codeine was associated with a higher percentage of solid stools and fewer adverse effects and complaints of urgency than diphenoxylate plus atropine (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1980-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1980 #</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five small trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000b-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000b #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kusunoki-1990-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Kusunoki 1990 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lumi-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lumi 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Park-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Park 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pinedo-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Pinedo 2012</LINK>) showed that people receiving drugs enhancing anal sphincter tone rather than placebo improved their symptoms. However, a further trial found no evidence of a statistically significant difference between phenylephrine gel and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000a-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000a #</LINK>). The authors of this trial suggested that they might have used an inadequate dose of the active drug (phenylephrine gel), as their dose (10%) was determined by testing healthy volunteers. In another randomised cross-over trial comparing different concentrations of phenylephrine gel in people with weak internal anal sphincters, doses of 30% and 40% increased the maximal anal canal resting pressure to the normal range, where doses of 10% and 20% had not done so (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2001-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2001 #</LINK>).</P>
<P>The drug most commonly used in clinical practice is still loperamide. Low-dose loperamide (starting at 2 mg to 4 mg) titrated to the patient's symptoms is considered to be effective in patients with faecal incontinence and normal stool consistency. The greatest problem with loperamide is that it may be too potent, resulting in constipation and abdominal pain, particularly when the dose is increased rapidly (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1980-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1980 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Read-1982-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Read 1982 #</LINK>). Liquid formulations are available if even lower doses are needed to minimise side effects.</P>
<P>Finally, it must be noted that physiological measurements of anal sphincter function are surrogate measures which correlate poorly with symptoms and severity of incontinence. Furthermore, due to the great variation in the technology and methods of assessing anorectal function in different units, these measures were not directly comparable across trials.</P>

<P>No trials assessed the efficacy of drug treatment for people with anal sphincter trauma or assessed the use of drugs as an adjunct to other treatment modalities (surgery or conservative therapies).</P>
<P>Alternative measures to control faecal incontinence may be dietary (for example, see the excluded studies of fibre additives (<LINK REF="STD-Bliss-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bliss 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitebird-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Whitebird 2006</LINK>)), or the use of complex management strategies for patients with constipation and bypass incontinence (<LINK REF="STD-Christensen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Christensen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harari-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Harari 2004</LINK>). Cochrane reviews on these interventions are needed. There is a review on sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-Mowatt-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mowatt 2007</LINK>). There were no trials comparing these interventions directly with drugs.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:36:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A quantitative meta-analysis was not appropriate because the trials varied greatly in design, the characteristics and clinical diagnoses of participants, type of drugs used, duration of treatment, and choice of outcome measures. None of the 16 trials included a dose titration phase and only three trials considered different concentrations of the active drug (<LINK REF="STD-Cheetham-2001-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Cheetham 2001 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2001--_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2001 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005 #</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eleven out of the 16 included trials were of cross-over design with a short or no washout period between treatments. Only four of the cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000a-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000a #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carapeti-2000b-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Carapeti 2000b #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cohen-2001--_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Cohen 2001 #</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fox-2005-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Fox 2005 #</LINK>) addressed the issue of duration of washout. No meaningful statistical analyses were possible in the cross-over trials because results were either not provided at the end of the first trial period or not analysed using paired tests.</P>

<P>The findings of this review broadly support the guidance provided by NICE for people with faecal incontinence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2007</LINK>). After excluding specific causes of faecal incontinence, this clinical guideline recommends that loperamide should be used as first choice, starting at a low dose, and that codeine or diphenoxylate plus atropine (co-phenotrope) should be offered to people who are unable to tolerate loperamide. However, this review found one small trial (<LINK REF="STD-Palmer-1980-_x0023_" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 1980 #</LINK>) that suggested that loperamide or codeine were preferable to diphenoxylate plus atropine.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:36:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is little evidence with which to assess the use of drug therapies for the management of faecal incontinence. The data available are consistent with the use of anti-diarrhoeal/constipating drugs to improve the symptoms of people suffering from faecal incontinence due to liquid stools. They may cause side effects but these can be minimised by using low doses and titrating dose against effect. No data were found to support the use of anti-diarrhoeal agents for the treatment of faecal incontinence in people with normal stool consistency. A novel approach, using drugs to enhance anal sphincter tone, may be effective in people with normal anal sphincter function, but again the evidence was limited. There was no evidence on the use of drug therapy for faecal incontinence compared with either conservative treatment or surgery.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-03 14:36:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current literature consists of small, short-term trials that focus on the treatment of people with chronic diarrhoea, weak internal anal sphincters or difficulty with rectal evacuation (constipation). Larger more rigorous long-term trials are needed to assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of people with faecal incontinence. The trialists should use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement when designing and reporting their trials. In particular, well-designed controlled trials of the use of drugs for the treatment of incontinent people with normal stool consistency are required.</P>
<P>We recommend that future trials of drug therapy for patients suffering from faecal incontinence should:</P>
<UL>
<LI>be of sufficient duration to assess long-term effects of treatment;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>include relevant primary outcome measures (e.g. number of people cured or improved) and not only surrogate outcomes;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>analyse data using an intention-to-treat approach (with participants analysed in the groups to which they were allocated, whether or not they received that treatment);</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>outcome assessors blinded to treatment allocation;</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>if a cross-over design is used, they should provide outcome data at the end of the first arm of treatment before cross-over or, preferably, full information on the within-individual comparison of treatments, and include an adequate washout period</LI>

Therefore, we investigated the possible effects of sucralfate, an aluminium hydroxide complex of sulfated sucrose used in the treatment of gastric ulcer, in preventing radiation-induced diarrhea and bowel discomfort in patients treated with curative intention for pelvic cancer with external radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled and included 70 patients with carcinoma in the prostate or urinary bladder without distant metastases (T1-4No1xMo) and a performance status of greater than or equal to 90% on the Karnofsky scale. Radiotherapy was conventionally delivered with high-energy photons (four-field technique, the total dose 64 Gy, 2 Gy daily, total treatment time 5 to 6 weeks). Dose granules of sucralfate or placebo were dispensed to each patient 2 weeks after radiation started and continued for 6 weeks. All analyses were performed blindly. RESULTS: The frequency of defecation and stool consistency were significantly improved by sucralfate. Fourteen patients in the placebo group and three in the sucralfate group required symptomatic therapy with loperamide. One year later, the patients in the sucralfate group displayed significantly less problems with frequency of defecation, mucus, and blood in the stools compared with the placebo group. There was also a lower intake of loperamide and the weight decrease was less pronounced in the sucralfate group. There was no evidence of adverse effects associated with the use of sucralfate. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that sucralfate can be of beneficial value in diminishing bowel discomfort during treatment and, most importantly, sucralfate also reduces the late bowel disturbances that follow radiotherapeutic treatment of pelvic malignancies. The earlier proposed mechanisms of action (eg, protection of denuded mucosa, cytoprotective properties, binding bile acids) seem adequate to explain the present effects of sucralfate 53179-11-6 (Loperamide). 54182-58-0 (Sucralfate)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-10-12 14:42:04 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

We investigate the effects of sodium valproate, a gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase inhibitor, on the clinico- physiologic state after ileoanal anastomosis. METHODS. Twelve patients (five with ulcerative colitis and seven with familial adenomatous polyposis coli) were studied in a placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS. Placebo had no effect, but valproate increased the resting anal pressure by 22.4% and the maximum tolerable pouch volume by 20.7%. It also prolonged pouch emptying by 47.3%, with an associated improvement in stool frequency and incontinence. These results suggested that valproate improved both reservoir continence and sphincter continence. CONCLUSIONS. Only minimal side effects were noted, so the administration of sodium valproate appears to be a safe and useful adjunct for patients with ileoanal anastomosis in the early postoperative period EC 2-6-1-19 (Aminobutyrate Aminotransferase). 99-66-1 (Valproic Acid)&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2012-10-12 14:45:10 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">
