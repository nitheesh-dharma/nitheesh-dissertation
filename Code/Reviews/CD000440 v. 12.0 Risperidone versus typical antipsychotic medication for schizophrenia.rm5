<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Risperidone is one of the most widely used new generation of antipsychotic drugs. This review summarises its effects compared with the older antipsychotics. In essence, risperidone may be equally clinically effective to relatively high doses of haloperidol, for an outcome that is difficult to interpret as clinically meaningful. Risperidone causes less adverse effects than the side-effect prone haloperidol.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. As well as its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders than the older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980-1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980-1997), MEDLINE (1966-1997), PsycLIT (1974-1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers, papers ordered, re-inspected and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on dose of risperidone, haloperidol and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement, side effects (movement disorders) and acceptability of treatment. For homogeneous dichotomous data the Relative Risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>In the short-term, risperidone was more likely to produce an improvement in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) when compared with haloperidol (n=2368, 9 RCTs, RR not 20% improved 0.72 CI 0.59 to 0.88 NNT 8). A similar, favourable outcome for risperidone was found in long-term studies (n=859, 2RCTs RR not 20% improved 0.51 CI 0.38 to 0.67 NNT 4;n=675 1RCT, RR not improved 40% 0.75 CI 0.66 to 0.84 NNT 5; n=675, 1 RCT, RR not 60% improved 0.90 CI 0.84 to 0.96, NNT 11). Risperidone was also more likely to reduce relapse at one year follow up, compared with haloperidol (n=367, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.41 to 0.99, NNT 7). Less people allocated risperidone left studies before completion, both for short-term (n=3066, 16 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.63 to 0.92, NNT 6) and long-term trials (n=1270, 4RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.42 to 0.73 NNT 4). For general movement disorders results favoured risperidone. People given risperidone had significantly fewer general movement disorders (including extrapyramidal side effects) than those receiving older typical antipsychotics (n=2702, 10 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.56 to 0.71, NNT 3). Significantly fewer people given risperidone used antiparkinsonian drugs (n=2524, 11 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.58 to 0.74, NNT 4). As regards body weight, however, four studies (n=1708) found people were more likely to gain weight if allocated risperidone compared to typical antipsychotics (RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNH 3). Risperidone was no more or less likely than haloperidol to cause sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction (n=106, 2 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 0.58 to 4.20). Finally, some results found risperidone was more likely to cause rhinitis than conventional antipsychotics (n=656, 3 RCTs, RR1.99 CI 1.24 to 3.19, NNH 3).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Risperidone may be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia than older antipsychotics and have marginal benefits in terms of limited clinical improvement. Its adverse effect profile may be better than haloperidol. With the addition of more studies to this review, the publication bias evident in previous versions is no longer a significant issue. Any marginal benefits this drug may have have to be balanced against its greater cost and increased tendency to cause side effects such as weight gain.</P>
<P>Recent important longer term data favouring risperidone's effect on relapse needs to be replicated by researchers independently of the manufacturers of the drug.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-31 14:28:57 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>The 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are frequently used as the first line treatment for people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Kane-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1993</LINK>). However, about 5-25% of these people show poor response to these treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1977</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Christison-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Christison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1992</LINK>). In addition, adverse effects such as movement disorders (i.e. distressing restlessness, stiffness, potentially disfiguring repetitive movements of the mouth and face) and sedation often makes compliance with the 'older generation' of drug treatment problematic (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>). The effects of these medications with respect to positive symptoms, such as fixed, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptions with no cause (hallucinations) is well described (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Thornley-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thornley 2003</LINK>). However, little evidence exists that 'conventional' antipsychotic treatment has any effect on the 'negative' symptoms of schizophrenia, that is symptoms such as poverty of speech, lack of motivation and apathy, and impoverished ability to express emotion (<LINK REF="REF-Crow-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crow 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Andreasen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andreasen 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' neuroleptic compounds. These drugs have also been termed 'atypical' antipsychotics, as they have a decreased tendency to cause movement disorders. Risperidone has a well-described mechanism of action in the brain (5HT1a, 2a, 2c, H1, M1 and D1-4 receptor blockade) and was developed following the observation that a selective serotonin receptor blocker (ritanserin) produced a beneficial effect when combined with conventional neuroleptics (<LINK REF="REF-Gupta-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gupta 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1995</LINK>). Risperidone was first made available for the care of those with schizophrenia in 1986 and since then clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety (<LINK REF="REF-He-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1993b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1993b</LINK>).</P>
<P>As well as its reputed tendency to cause fewer movement disorders, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Livingston-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Livingston 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>). Unlike many neuroleptic drugs, both 'conventional' and 'atypical', risperidone does not bind to the sites in the brain (cholinergic/muscarinic receptors) that cause the dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention commonly seen with the 'conventional' class of drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-He-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">He 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Keltner-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keltner 1995</LINK>). It is also claimed that risperidone may reduce the decline in memory, attention and concentrations associated with schizophrenia which 'conventional' neuroleptics fail to reverse or prevent (<LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Stip-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stip 1996</LINK>). </P>
<P>Adverse effects commonly associated with risperidone include anxiety, agitation, insomnia, headache and weight gain (<LINK REF="REF-Remington-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remington 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Janssen_x002d_Cilag-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janssen-Cilag 1996</LINK>). Concern has been raised that the emphasis on primarily controlling the positive symptoms of schizophrenia may deflect attention from such apparently minor side effects and that this is often illustrated by the paucity of information regarding such effects in drug trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kane-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kane 1990</LINK>). </P>
<P>Risperidone is a relatively expensive neuroleptic. Treatment for one year (6mg daily) costs £1,423 (pounds sterling) as compared to £127 with 10 mg daily haloperidol (figures provided by MIMS &amp; Scottish Drug Tariff 2003). However calculating cost-effectiveness in mental health is complex and it can be argued for example that improved treatment efficacy may reduce costs incurred as a result of hospitalisation (<LINK REF="REF-Addington-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Addington 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Guest-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guest 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Individuals with schizophrenia previously resistant to treatment may be helped by treatment with risperidone and it therefore may act as an alternative to clozapine (<LINK REF="REF-Edwards-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Edwards 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1994</LINK>). Its use for those experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia is also being explored (<LINK REF="STD-Kopala-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kopala 1996</LINK>).</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the effects of risperidone compared with placebo and conventional neuroleptic drugs for people with schizophrenia. </P>
<P>It was also proposed to see if:<BR/>1. People whose illnesses were described as 'treatment resistant' differed in their treatment response from those whose illnesses were not designated as such; and if <BR/>2. Those experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia differed in their response from people who had had the illness longer.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>1. Study selection<BR/>CJ inspected all reports of studies identified as above. Randomly selected samples of 10% of all reports were re-inspected by RH in order to allow selection to be reliable. Where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion, and where there was still doubt the full article was acquired for further inspection. Once the full articles were obtained EK and FS independently decided whether the studies met the review criteria. EK was blinded to the names of the authors, institutions and journal of publication. Where disagreement occurred this was resolved by discussion and when this was not possible further information was sought. These trials were added to the list of those awaiting assessment pending acquisition of further information. For the 2001 update, the reviewer (CJ) inspected all reports identified in the new search. Randomly selected samples of 10% of all new reports were re-inspected by RH. Again once full reports were obtained, CJ and RH resolved disputes over whether studies meet inclusion criteria by discussion.</P>
<P>2. Quality assessment<BR/>Trials were allocated to three quality categories, as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>) by each reviewer. When disputes arose as to which category a trial was allocated to, resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary, data were not entered and the trial was allocated to the list of those awaiting assessment. Only trials in Category A or B were included in the review. </P>
<P>3. Assessing the presence of publication bias<BR/>Data from all included trials were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect versus trial size or 'precision') in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias. Where only 3-4 studies reported an outcome or there was little variety in sample size (or precision estimate) between studies - funnel plot analysis was not appropriate. There is currently no consensus about the validity of formal statistical tests to investigate funnel plot asymmetry, one test, proposed by <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK> has been subject to criticism (<LINK REF="REF-Irwig-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Irwig 1998</LINK>). Further versions of this review will include such tests when their validity has been proven.<BR/> <BR/>4. Data extraction<BR/>Data from selected trials were independently extracted by EK, FS, RH and SG. When disputes arose resolution was attempted by discussion. When this was not possible and further information was necessary to resolve the dilemma, data were not entered and this trial was added to the list of those awaiting assessment. For the 2001 update, CJ extracted data, a random sample of extracted data were independently checked by SG.</P>
<P>5. Data synthesis <BR/>Data types: Outcomes were assessed using continuous (for example changes on a behaviour scale), categorical (for example, one of three categories on a behaviour scale, such a 'little change', 'moderate change' or 'much change') or dichotomous measures (for example, either 'no important changes' or 'important changes' in a persons behaviour). Currently RevMan does not support categorical data so they were presented only in the text of the review.</P>
<P>5.1 Dichotomous data<BR/>Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures to dichotomous data; this may be done by identifying cut off points on rating scales and dividing subjects accordingly into 'clinically improved' or 'not clinically improved'. If the authors of a study had used a designated cut off point for determining clinical effectiveness this was used by the reviewers where appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, a random effects Relative Risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this was estimated. As a summary measure of effectiveness, the number needed to treat statistic (NNT) was also calculated. </P>
<P>5.2 Continuous data<BR/>5.2.1 Scale derived data<BR/>A wide range of rating scales is available to measure outcomes in mental health trials. These scales vary in quality and many are questionably validated, or even ad hoc. It is generally accepted that measuring instruments should have the properties of reliability (the extent to which a test effectively measures anything at all) and validity (the extent to which a test measures that which it is supposed to measure). Before publication of an instrument, most scientific journals insist that reliability and validity be demonstrated to the satisfaction of referees. It was therefore decided, as a minimum standard, not to include any data from a rating scale in this review unless its properties had been published in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, the following minimum standards for rating scales were set: the rating scale should either be a self-report, or completed by an independent rater or relative. More stringent standards for instruments may be set in future editions of this review.</P>
<P>Whenever possible we took the opportunity to make direct comparisons between trials that used the same measurement instrument to quantify specific outcomes. Where continuous data was presented from different scales rating the same effect, both sets of data were presented and the general direction of effect inspected.</P>
<P>5.2.2 Normal data<BR/>Data on outcomes in neuroleptic trials are often not normally distributed. To avoid the pitfall of applying parametric tests to non-parametric data the following standards were applied to data derived from continuous measures of end point 'state'. The criteria were used before inclusion: i. Standard deviations and means were reported in the paper or were obtainable from the authors; ii. The standard deviation (SD), when multiplied by 2 was less than the mean (as otherwise the mean was unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of the distribution) (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). Data that did not meet the first or second standard were not entered into RevMan software for analysis, but were reported in the text of the 'Results' section. </P>
<P>For continuous mean change data (endpoint minus baseline) the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if change data is skewed. The RevMan meta-analyses of continuous data are based on the assumption that the data are, at least to a reasonable degree, normally distributed. It is quite feasible that change data is skewed but, after consulting the ALLSTAT 1988 electronic statistics mailing list (http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/allstat/index.html), it was entered into RevMan in order to summarise the available information. In doing this it is assumed that either data were not skewed or that the analyses within RevMan could cope with the unknown degree of skew. Without individual trial data it is not possible to formally check this assumption.</P>
<P>5.2.3 Summary statistic<BR/>We estimated a weighted mean difference, random effects model (WMD) for continuous outcomes. </P>
<P>5.3 Intention to treat analysis<BR/>We hoped we would produce a review of risperidone that was pragmatic and answered the question as to whether, on average, those who take this new drug do better or worse than if they had taken none, an old drug or a similar new medication. The purpose of this review was not to ask the question "does risperidone work with people who are very compliant with medication and complete the course?" as this greatly limits the generalisability (external validity) of the findings. The reviewers therefore undertook an intention to treat analysis assuming that those who dropped out - from whatever group - had an unfavourable outcome. The reviewers investigated the sensitivity of the principle dichotomous outcomes to this assumption. <BR/> <BR/>For continuous, summary data it is not possible to include such an assumption so non-intention to treat data were presented. Such data, however, were excluded if studies had more than 50% of the people lost to follow-up. </P>
<P>5.4 Cluster trials<BR/>Studies increasingly employ 'cluster randomisation' (such as randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of clustered data poses problems: Firstly, authors often fail to account for intra class correlation in clustered studies, leading to a 'unit of analysis' error (<LINK REF="REF-Divine-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Divine 1992</LINK>) - whereby p values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated - causing type I errors (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). Secondly, RevMan does not currently support meta-analytic pooling of clustered dichotomous data, even when these are correctly analysed by the authors of primary studies, since the 'design effect' (a statistical correction for clustering) cannot be incorporated.</P>
<P>Where clustering was not accounted for in primary studies, we presented the data in a table, with an (*) symbol - to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. In subsequent versions of this review we will seek to contact first authors of studies to seek intra-class correlation co-efficients of their clustered data and to adjust for this using accepted methods (<LINK REF="REF-Gulliford-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gulliford 1999</LINK>). If clustering had been incorporated into the analysis of primary studies, we also presented these data in a table. No further secondary analysis (including meta-analytic pooling) will be attempted until there is consensus on the best methods of doing so, and until RevMan, or any other software, allows this. A Cochrane Statistical Methods Workgroup is currently addressing this issue. In the interim, individual studies were very crudely classified as positive or negative, according to whether a statistically significant result (p&lt;0.05) was obtained for the outcome in question, using an analytic method which allowed for clustering.</P>
<P>5.5 Test for heterogeneity <BR/>A Chi-square test was used, as well as visual inspection of graphs, to investigate the possibility of heterogeneity. A significance level less than 0.10 was interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found, the studies responsible for heterogeneity were not added to the main body of homogeneous trials, but summated and presented separately and reasons for heterogeneity investigated. </P>
<P>6. Addressing publication bias <BR/>Data from all included studies were entered into a funnel graph (trial effect against trial size) in an attempt to investigate the likelihood of overt publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>7. Sensitivity analyses <BR/>The effect of including studies with high attrition rates was analysed in a sensitivity analysis. </P>
<P>8. General <BR/>Where possible, reviewers entered data in such a way that the area to the left of the line of no effect indicated a favourable outcome for risperidone.</P>

<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>1. Excluded<BR/>A total of 30 studies have now been excluded from this review. Details are presented in the 'Excluded studies' table. All trials were excluded only after acquisition and inspection of a hard copy. Half of the 30 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria because they were not randomised. Six of these were reviews and did not report randomised studies. <LINK REF="STD-Meltzer-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Meltzer 1996</LINK> was excluded because it was a withdrawal study, rather than investigating the instigation of treatment. Six more studies were excluded because they compared risperidone to an atypical antipsychotic. A further eleven were trials that, at the moment, are only available to the authors as conference proceedings. Extraction of information from short abstracts is difficult and all data presented in these studies were unusable. </P>
<P>2. Awaiting assessment<BR/>There are currently no trials awaiting assessment.</P>
<P>3. Ongoing<BR/>As far as the authors are aware, there are six ongoing randomised trials that may be relevant to this review. It is not clear how many people are to be included in these trials.</P>
<P>4. Included<BR/>Twenty three studies have now been identified for inclusion in this review. Details of these can be found in the 'Included studies' table.</P>
<P>4.1 Length of trials<BR/>Eighteen of the included studies fell into the 'short term' (up to 12 weeks) category, with a duration of only eight weeks being most common (<LINK REF="STD-Ceskova-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceskova 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoyberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoyberg 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mesotten-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mesotten 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Min-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Min 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Blin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blin 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Potkin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Potkin 1997</LINK> were only four weeks in duration. Only <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK> reported outcomes for the 'medium term' (13-26 weeks) category. The remaining four trials were of longer duration. <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 2000</LINK> followed people for about one year, while <LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK> reported outcomes at two years and beyond.<BR/> <BR/>4.2 Participants<BR/>A total of 2595 people were randomised to receive risperidone compared with a total of 1850 people receiving either a typical antipsychotic or placebo. The uneven numbers in some studies are due to the fact that trialists randomised to several different doses of risperidone versus one comparator group. Nearly all of the studies included people diagnosed with schizophrenia according to a diagnostic manual. Most (fourteen) used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition Revised (DSM-III-R). <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK> used the 4th edition (DSM -IV) and three diagnosed people according to ICD-9 or ICD -10 (the International Classification of Diseases). Four trials did not explicitly report how they diagnosed people with schizophrenia (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 2000</LINK>). Further information is being sought.</P>
<P>All studies included both men and women, although participants were predominantly male (about 70%). The mean age was about 33 years. The age range for most trials was 18-65 years except for <LINK REF="STD-Kaleda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaleda 2000</LINK>, a study that focused on young people (age range 16-20 years). A few studies did not describe age and sex of the participants and further information is being sought. Most people in the trials had previously been admitted to hospital and were chronically ill. Only a few trials included people who were not chronically ill and/or in hospital. Two of these, <LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK>, involved people who were able to be outpatients, with <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK> specifically requiring participants to be in a stable condition. <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> included only those experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia, and <LINK REF="STD-Blin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blin 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Huttunen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Huttunen 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK> included people who were in an acute phase of their illness. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK> focused on people whose illness was designated to be treatment resistant, and <LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK> on those whose illness had been only partially responsive to neuroleptics.</P>
<P>4.3 Settings<BR/>Trials took place in a mixture of outpatient and inpatient settings although the majority of trials were conducted in a hospital. Twelve of the 30 included trials were multi-centre and overall, participants were recruited from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds including Australia, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Korea, North America, Scandinavia, South Africa and the UK.</P>
<P>4.4 Study size<BR/>A total of 4445 people participated in the included studies. The largest trial was a 15 nation multi-centre study (<LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>) that involved 1362 participants. Next in size was <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> with 675 people randomised. <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>, which were in effect one study, sometimes referred to as the North American Study, collectively randomised 523 people. All other studies were comparatively small ranging from 183 (<LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK>) to only 20 (<LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>4.5 Interventions<BR/>Risperidone doses varied and were either fixed or flexible. Seven trials used fixed doses, ranging from a minimum of 1 mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>), to a maximum of 16mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>). The remaining studies allowed the dose to be individually titrated according to response (range 2-24mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK> used both fixed and varied doses of risperidone. This trial used a fixed dose of 6mg/day for the first four weeks and then switched for the remaining four weeks to a dose that could vary according to need (range 3-15mg/day).</P>
<P>The control interventions varied. Twelve of the trials used haloperidol as the control intervention. Five of these used a fixed dose ranging from a minimum of 5mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Min-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Min 1993</LINK>) to a maximum of 20mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>). All other haloperidol trials used flexible dose regimes, individually titrating the dose according to response. The dose range for these studies was 2mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK>) to 30mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK>). Only two small studies compared risperidone with a neuroleptic other than haloperidol. <LINK REF="STD-Hoyberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoyberg 1993</LINK> used perphenazine (16-48mg/day) and <LINK REF="STD-Huttunen-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Huttunen 1995</LINK> zuclopenthixol (10-100mg/day). <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> compared risperidone with 'conventional treatment strategy'. Six trials involved three comparison groups (<LINK REF="STD-Blin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blin 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Purdon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 2000</LINK>). All of these studies had haloperidol as one of the control interventions with the other groups being randomised to methotrimeprazine (<LINK REF="STD-Blin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blin 1996</LINK>), olanzapine (<LINK REF="STD-Purdon-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Purdon 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK>) or placebo. Data relating to methotrimeprazine is not used in this review, as this compound, despite being a phenothiazine, is not one that is in common usage. The inclusion of this would introduce a potential source of heterogeneity whilst gaining little extra external validity. Olanzapine data is also not used, as this is an atypical compound.</P>
<P>4.6 Outcomes<BR/>4.6.1 Missing Outcomes<BR/>None of the studies mentioned death, suicide or self-harm. Other outcomes notable by their absence were quality of life, social functioning, employment status and cost effectiveness.</P>
<P>4.6.2 Scales<BR/>Twenty four different instruments were used to collect scale data. Only six, however, provided useful data. Seven studies reported usable scale data for clinical improvement but employed three different scales (BPRS, CGI, PANSS, for details see below). Six studies used scales to help rate adverse effects. Again, however, they employed three different scales (ESRS, CGI, UKU). Reasons for exclusion of data from other instruments are given under 'Outcomes' in the 'Included studies' section. Overall scale data were poorly presented; frequently means were reported with no variance and/or not reported at all.</P>
<P>4.6.2.1 Details of scales that reported usable data<BR/>a. Global state - Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Guy-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guy 1976</LINK>)<BR/>This is used to assess both severity of illness and clinical improvement, by comparing the conditions of the person standardised against other people with the same diagnosis. A seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing decreased severity and/or overall improvement. </P>
<P>b. Mental state<BR/>i. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (<LINK REF="REF-Overall-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Overall 1962</LINK>) <BR/>This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly used. Each item is defined on a seven-point scale varying from 'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from 0-6 or 1-7. Scores can range from 0-126, with high scores indicating more severe symptoms.</P>
<P>ii. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - PANSS (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1987</LINK>) <BR/>This schizophrenia scale has 30 items, each of which can be defined on a seven-point scoring system varying from 1 - absent to 7 - extreme. This scale can be divided into three sub-scales for measuring the severity of general psychopathology, positive symptoms (PANSS-P), and negative symptoms (PANSS-N). A low score indicates lesser severity.</P>
<P>c. Adverse effects<BR/>i. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - ESRS (<LINK REF="REF-Chouinard-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chouinard 1980</LINK>) <BR/>This consists of a questionnaire relating to parkinsonian symptoms (nine items), a physician's examination for parkinsonism and dyskinetic movements (eight items), and a clinical global impression of tardive dyskinesia. High scores indicate severe levels of movement disorder. </P>
<P>ii. Simpson Angus Scale - SAS (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 1970</LINK>) <BR/>This ten-item scale, with a scoring system of 0-4 for each item, measures drug-induced parkinsonism, a short-term drug-induced movement disorder. A low score indicates low levels of parkinsonism. </P>
<P>iii. UKU Side Effects Rating Scale - UKU-SERS (<LINK REF="REF-Lingjaerde-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lingjaerde 1987</LINK>). <BR/>The UKU rates four major topics: psychological side effects (10 items), neurological side effects (eight items), autonomic side effects (11 items) and other side effects (19 items). Each item is defined by means of a four-point scale where zero means not or doubtfully present. Scoring range is 0-144.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>1. Randomisation<BR/>All included studies were reported as randomised but only two, <LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK>, described how this was achieved. In both cases computer generated numbers were used to allocate participants to groups. <LINK REF="STD-Min-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Min 1993</LINK> stated allocation was concealed by use of sealed envelopes, and a few studies mentioned the use of 'randomised blind schedules'.</P>
<P>2. Blindness<BR/>All but three studies were reported to be double blind. <LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 1998</LINK> was an open label trial and therefore involved no blinding. <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> did not state if blinding occurred and <LINK REF="STD-Malyarov-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Malyarov 1999</LINK> said that only raters were blind to medication. The other 20 studies all stated they were double blind with half describing how this was achieved (by identical capsules or oral solutions) and the other half giving no further explanation. No trial tested whether their attempts at blinding had been successful.</P>
<P>3. Leaving the study early<BR/>All but two trials, <LINK REF="STD-Kaleda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaleda 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK>, reported the number of people leaving the study before completion and most trials attempted to ascribe reasons for this. It was assumed that the two trials which did not describe withdrawals, had no loss.</P>
<P>4. Jadad quality scores<BR/>According to the Cochrane criteria described above, all studies were at moderate risk of bias. Jadad scores were 0-2 for randomisation, 0-2 for blindness and 0-1 for description of withdrawals (high scores indicate better quality and less risk of inclusion of bias). Apart from Peuskens 1998 and <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK>, all studies received one point for their descriptions of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK> received two). Eight trials scored two for blindness (<LINK REF="STD-Blin-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Blin 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ceskova-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceskova 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Claus-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Claus 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoyberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoyberg 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mesotten-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mesotten 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Min-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Min 1993</LINK>), three (<LINK REF="STD-Bouchard-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bouchard 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Kaleda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaleda 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK>) scored none, and all others received one. Finally, all were scored as 'one' for description of withdrawals except for the two studies that were rated at zero (<LINK REF="STD-Kaleda-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Kaleda 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK>). These ratings resulted in a mean score of 2.5.</P>
<P>5. Data reporting<BR/>Reporting of data was poor. Overall, it was only possible to use relatively small amounts of the data presented in the 23 included trials. Continuous data were particularly problematic. The most common reason for exclusion of scale data was lack of standard deviations and/or failure to give any information about outcomes at all. Many studies also presented findings in graphs, in percentiles or by inexact p-values. 'P'-values are commonly used as a measure of association between intervention and outcomes instead of showing the strength of the association.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>1. The search<BR/>Sixty citations were identified by the initial search. Of these 46 were selected for further inspection, yielding 29 reports of the 14 included trials. 349 new citations were found in the 2001 update, 156 of these were selected for further inspection and 120 of these were either further references to trials already included in the review or not relevant. The remaining papers yielded nine new trials that could be included and 23 that eventually were excluded. Clive Rogers of Janssen-Cilag Ltd kindly ran a search through their databases.

<P>2. COMPARISON: RISPERIDONE versus TYPICAL NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATION</P>
<P>2.1 Global state: not improved to a clinically important degree<BR/>'Clinical improvement' was measured in several different ways. Eleven studies prestated that 'clinical improvement' was a 20% reduction in total PANSS score from baseline. <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> defined it as a 50% reduction while <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> considered 20%, 40% and 60% reductions in the same scale. Two studies used a 20% reduction in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score from baseline as a cut off for 'clinical improvement' (<LINK REF="STD-Borison-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Borison 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK>) and eight employed the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK> used personal ratings by the participants.</P>
<P>Results derived from the BPRS and CGI scales are equivocal. Two studies using the BPRS appear to show a favourable result for risperidone in the short-term but the difference is not statistically significant (n=173, 2 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.6 to 1.02). Again with the CGI, it appears as though risperidone has a favourable effect on global state in the short-term . Eight studies found a slight difference but it was not statistically significant (n=1126 8 RCTs, RR 0.78 CI 0.61 to 1.0). Results from the PANSS scale mainly favoured risperidone. Eleven studies used a 20% reduction in PANSS score as a cut off for clinical improvement. Risperidone was more likely to produce this degree of improvement, both in the short and long-term, when compared with haloperidol (short-term n=2368, 9 RCTs RR 0.85 CI 0.77 to 0.93 NNT 8; long term n=859, 2 RCTs RR 0.73 CI 0.65 to 0.83 NNT 4). <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> found risperidone was no more likely to produce a 40% reduction PANSS scores than haloperidol in the short-term (n=183, 1 RCT, RR 0.85 CI 0.6 to 1.2) but <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> found a significant difference, favouring risperidone in the long-term (n=675, 1 RCT, RR 0.75 CI 0.67 to 0.84 NNT 5). <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK> also obtained similar results for a 60% reduction (n=675, RR 0.90 CI 0.84 to 0.96, NNT 11). Only <LINK REF="STD-Wirshing-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wirshing 1999</LINK> used participant rating as a measurement of clinical improvement. This small, short-term study (n=67) found no difference between groups (RR 0.72 CI 0.47 to 1.09).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK> reported the global outcome of 'relapse'. The limited data found risperidone was more likely to reduce relapse by one year, compared with haloperidol (n=367, 1 RCT, RR 0.64 CI 0.41 to 0.99, NNT 7). The same study reported on 'time to relapse'. Results did favour people allocated to risperidone (data are too skewed to be presented graphically). <LINK REF="STD-Ceskova-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceskova 1993</LINK> found no difference between risperidone and haloperidol for discharge from hospital by 8 weeks (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 1.07 CI 0.65 to 1.76). </P>
<P>A few studies used a continuous measure of global change (change in CGI score). They provided short-term data and no difference was found between risperidone and haloperidol groups (n=503, 4 RCTs, WMD -0.11 CI -0.3 to 0.1). </P>
<P>2.2 Mental state<BR/>Five studies measured improvement in mental state by change in total PANSS scores. Results are equivocal. For this outcome risperidone, in the short-term, is not clearly different to haloperidol (n=1352, 5RCTs, WMD -1.52 CI -4.01 to 0.97). Again no significant differences were found by 12 weeks between people allocated risperidone compared with those given haloperidol for either positive PANSS score changes (n=1352, 5RCTs, WMD -0.24 CI -1.09 to 0.60) or negative PANSS score changes (n=1352, 5RCTs, WMD -0.77 CI -1.62 to 0.07). </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK> reported limited data for endpoint PANSS scores. Here there was a significant difference, favouring risperidone, in endpoint scores by 6 weeks (n=20, 1RCT, WMD -2.75 CI -3.94 to -1.56).</P>
<P>Results from trials using the BPRS to measure mental state are more favourable for risperidone. Four trials found risperidone more likely to produce a statistically significantly greater mean change in total BPRS score compared to haloperidol by 12 weeks (n=1352, 4RCTs, WMD -1.70 CI -3.22 to -0.1). </P>
<P>Levels of the specific symptom of anxiety/tension in the short-term were reported in five studies. Results do not favour either risperidone or haloperidol (n=2087, 5RCTs, RR1.05 CI 0.8 to 1.4). <LINK REF="STD-Ceskova-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceskova 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hoyberg-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Hoyberg 1993</LINK> reported whether people were depressed. Again, there were no differences for people receiving risperidone compared with those on haloperidol (n=169, 2RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.4 to 1.3).</P>
<P>2.3 Behaviour<BR/>Data are limited. Four studies (n=724) report short-term data for agitation and found no significant differences between groups (RR 0.88 CI 0.6 to 1.2) and similar non-significant results were found for the need for sedative medication (n=198, 3 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.8 to 1.4).</P>
<P>2.4 Cognitive function<BR/>For outcomes of poor concentration, risperidone is not different to haloperidol (n=1548, 4 RCTs, RR 0.90 CI 0.8 to 1.1), and the outcome for poor memory is similar (n=1469, 2 RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.7 to 1.0).</P>
<P>2.5 Acceptability of treatment<BR/>Acceptability of treatment was measured in two ways; numbers of people leaving the study before completion and by direct questioning. For the outcome, 'leaving the study early' there were three subcategories: leaving for any reason, leaving due to adverse effects and leaving due to insufficient response. In the short-term, numbers of people leaving a study early for any reason was significantly lower for people in the risperidone groups (n=3066, 16 RCTs, RR 0.76 CI 0.6 to 0.9, NNT 6) and a similar result was found for those leaving after a 26 week period (n=1270, 4 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.4 to 0.73 NNT 4). Only one study provided medium-term (12-26 weeks) data and here no difference between groups was found (n=28, 1RCT, RR 1.24 CI 0.2 to 9.0). The numbers of people leaving a study for particular reasons appeared to be lower for risperidone but the differences for both adverse effect and insufficient response were not statistically significant (n=2243, 11 RCTs, RR 0.82 CI 0.61 to 1.09; n=2498, 11 RCTs, RR 0.84 CI 0.67 to 1.06 respectively).</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Mesotten-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Mesotten 1991</LINK>(n=60) measured acceptability of treatment by direct questioning. Here no significant difference was found between groups (RR 0.70 CI 0.4 to 1.2).</P>
<P>2.6 Adverse events<BR/>For overall difference in number of adverse events between groups, risperidone was no more likely to cause adverse effects than other typical antipsychotics (n=1278, 9 RCTs, RR 0.98 CI 0.9 to 1.0).</P>
<P>Results for specific adverse events, and in particular, general movement disorders were more favourable for risperidone. People given risperidone had significantly fewer symptoms of general movement disorders (including extrapyramidal side effects) (n=2702, 10 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.56 to 0.71, NNT 3). Significantly fewer people given risperidone used antiparkinsonian drugs compared with, in the main, haloperidol (n=2524, 11 RCTs, RR 0.66 CI 0.58 to 0.74, NNT 4). Only <LINK REF="STD-Heck-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Heck 2000</LINK> (n=88) reported the numbers of people able to stop antiparkinsonian drugs during the trial and found no difference between groups (RR 1.07 CI 0.39 to 2.29).</P>
<P>For specific movement disorders, <LINK REF="STD-Ceskova-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Ceskova 1993</LINK> (n=62) reported data for tardive dyskinesia and found no significant difference between groups (RR 1.00 CI 0.07 to 15.28). For akathisia, however, results significantly favoured risperidone (n=731, 4 RCTs, RR 0.68 CI 0.52 to 0.89, NNT 5). No significant differences were found for dystonia (n=169, 2 RCTs, RR 0.72 CI 0.26 to 1.99), parkinsonism (n=62, 1 RCT, RR 0.89 CI 0.70 to 1.12), or tremor (n=101, 2 RCTs, RR 0.97 CI0.51 to 1.83). </P>
<P>Data from three studies found the change of severity of dyskinesia CGI scores were not significantly different for people on risperidone compared with those taking haloperidol (n=1778, 3 RCTs, WMD -0.20 CI -0.34 to -0.06), but were significantly different for severity of parkinsonism with the result favouring risperidone (n=468, 2 RCTs, WMD -0.78 CI -1.18 to -0.39). For change in Extrapyrimidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) scores, people given risperidone had favourable results for severity of parkinsonism scores with a significantly lower mean change (n=2507, 3 RCTs, WMD -2.07 CI -2.91 to -1.23) and people on risperidone also had a significantly better total score (n=1708, 3 RCTs, WMD -0.68 CI -1.22 to -0.15). <LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK> provided data for change in UKU Side Effects Rating Scale score. The result favoured the risperidone group (n=1350, WMD -0.49 CI -0.51 to -0.47). In one small study (<LINK REF="STD-See-1999" TYPE="STUDY">See 1999</LINK>, n=20) the Simpson and Angus Scale (SAS) endpoint score was just significantly in favour of the risperidone group (n=20 WMD -0.35 CI -0.55 to -0.15).</P>
<P>Anticholinergic effects were reported in a few studies. Dry mouth (n=1616, 5 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.59 to 1.09), blurred vision (n=1635, 5 RCTs, RR 0.83 CI 0.62 to 1.10), constipation (n=2165, 7 RCTs, RR 1.04 CI 0.80 to 1.37) and difficulty in passing urine (n=210, 3 RCTs, RR 0.24 CI 0.03 to 2.12) is no more common if receiving risperidone, compared largely with haloperidol.</P>
<P>Risperidone was also no more likely to cause sleep problems than the control medications. No significant differences between groups were found for insomnia (n=2899, 7 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.82 to 1.14), decreased quality of duration (n=1510, 3 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.69 to 1.14), increased duration (n=1469, 2 RCTs, RR 0.95 CI 0.76 to 1.18) or somnolence (n=1711, 12 RCTs, RR 0.89 CI 0.79 to 1.01).</P>
<P>As regards body weight, four studies (n=1708) found people were more likely to gain weight if allocated risperidone compared to typical antipsychotics (4 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 1.25 to 1.93, NNH 3). No significant difference between groups was found for weight loss (n=1469, 2 RCTs, RR 1.23 CI 0.98 to 1.56).</P>
<P>Results for gastrointestinal problems found no significant differences between groups. The outcomes with usable data were dyspepsia (n=322, 1 RCT, RR 1.55 CI 0.47 to 5.09), nausea (n=366, 2 RCTs, RR 1.18 CI 0.57 to 2.44) and vomiting (n=689, 2 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.43 to 1.26)</P>
<P>Risperidone is no more likely to cause dizziness than haloperidol (n=2426, 7 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 0.92 to1.43), nor is it more prone to cause headaches (n=2891, 10 RCTs, RR 1.06 CI 0.88 to 1.27).</P>
<P>Again no significant differences between groups were found for cardiovascular problems (n=419, 3 RCTs, RR tachycardia 0.85 CI 0.39 to 1.82; n=85, 2RCTs, RR palpitations 0.85 CI 0.32 to 2.26; n=103, 2 RCTs, RR hypotension 0.96 CI 0.38 to 2.43; n=367, 1 RCT, RR hypertension 0.67 CI 0.35 to 1.27).</P>
<P>Risperidone was no more likely to cause sexual problems such as erectile dysfunction (n=106, 2 RCTs, RR 1.55 CI 0.58 to 4.20) ejaculatory dysfunction (n=29, 1 RCT, RR 4.12 CI 0.21 to 78.9) orgastic function (n=107, 1 RCT, RR 1.89 CI 0.36 to 9.9) or sexual desire (n=1469, 2 RCTs, RR 0.96 CI 0.66 to 1.41).</P>
<P>Women allocated risperidone had the same frequency of menstrual problems as those on typical antipsychotic drugs (n=45, 2 RCTs, RR amenorrhoea 1.86 CI 0.4 to 8.2; n=30, 1 RCT, RR menorrhoea 3.0 CI 0.13 to 68).</P>
<P>Finally, some results found risperidone was more likely to cause rhinitis (n=656, 3 RCTs, RR 1.24 to 3.19, NNH 3), but no more likely to cause sweating (n=1506, 5 RCTs, RR 0.75 CI 0.55 to 1.02) or hypersalivation (n=183, 1 RCT, RR 0.42 CI 0.08 to 2.26), psychosis (n=367 RR0.70 CI 0.47 to 1.04) or injury (n=367 RR 1.23 CI 0.68 to 2.22).</P>
<P>3. Funnel plots<BR/>When funnel plots of effect size versus sample size were applied to outcomes where there were more than five studies reporting useable data, there was no evidence of obvious asymmetry. Statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry were non significant in all cases. </P>
<P>4. Investigator misconduct<BR/>It has come to the attention of the reviewers that Dr Richard Borison and Dr Bruce Diamond have been convicted of theft, making false statements and violations of state racketeering law in the USA. At this point, it seems that crimes were to do with criminal diversion of funds, rather than falsifying study data (http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1998/oct/notebook_981026.html). Nevertheless studies involving either of these authors were temporarily removed from the analyses to see if this made a substantive difference to the findings. In all cases where data from these trials had been added to those of others, removal of the studies resulted in no substantive changes in the findings.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>1. Publication bias<BR/>In a previous version of this review the possibility of publication bias, as evidenced by funnel plot asymmetry was raised. The conduct of further searches and addition of more studies has greatly reduced this potential source of bias, and the results of this review can be interpreted with a greater level of confidence.</P>
<P>2. Applicability of findings<BR/>2.1 Diagnoses<BR/>Despite new data from nine studies being included in the review, the overall results remain remarkably similar to those of the previous version. Methodology across all trials was virtually identical. As for the studies in the first version of this review, the majority of the new studies used the DSM-III-R as a diagnostic tool, were short in duration, yet lost about 30% of their participants before study completion. They also used haloperidol as the comparator. </P>
<P>Studies included in this review involved large numbers of participants from a wide range of cultural settings. All but nine studies involved people with a strict operational DSM-III-R diagnosis. As such, the homogeneity of the patient group can be assumed. However, this means of diagnosis excludes many people seen in routine practice who also receive anti-psychotic medication for schizophrenia and related disorders. For example, many people will receive anti-psychotic medication for presumed schizophrenia-like disorders in the absence of 'DSM-III-R' psychotic symptoms or before exhibiting continuous disturbance for six months (a major DSM-III-R criterion). Similarly, many will have co-existing substance abuse disorders or other co-morbid mental disorders, such as depression, or substance misuse. The results of the review may be internally valid and applicable to those with DSM-III-R schizophrenia, but can only be assumed to be externally valid and applicable to the large numbers of people in routine clinical practice who fall outside of the rigid DSM-III-R classificatory system, yet require anti-psychotic medication.</P>
<P>2.2 Adherence to trial protocol<BR/>About 30% of people left the studies, even before 6-8 weeks. This figure is perhaps higher than that seen in routine practice, particularly considering that the majority of participants were recruited and managed in an inpatient setting. This presumably reflects the rigidity of study protocols, which, whilst improving internal validity, potentially reduces the external applicability of results. The high default rates that are observed when a rigid trial design is imposed on routine care for schizophrenia (or any disorder) suggest that the randomised study design should more closely replicate routine care. There is no information on the subsequent care of people leaving the studies. </P>
<P>2.3 History<BR/>Although most trials included people who had long histories of schizophrenia, only <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> exclusively focused on those experiencing their first episode. These people do not appear to differ substantially in their response, or lack of it, to risperidone.</P>
<P>2.4 Interventions<BR/>This is essentially a review of the effectiveness of risperidone compared to haloperidol as 18 of the 23 included trials used haloperidol as at least one of its comparators. It is therefore problematic to generalise the findings to other 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs. Many of the studies included in this review used relatively high doses of haloperidol. A companion review has examined the relationship of dose of haloperidol to clinical outcome (<LINK REF="REF-Waraich-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waraich 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>2.5 Duration<BR/>Again most of included trials (18 of the 23) were 'short term' (less than twelve weeks duration) so little can be concluded from this review regarding the long-term effects of risperidone. Only <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK> provided some data on relapse by one year.</P>
<P>3. COMPARISON: RISPERIDONE versus TYPICAL NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATION</P>
<P>3.1 Global clinical improvement <BR/>Risperidone is slightly more effective than control (largely haloperidol) in achieving 'global clinical improvement'. Most studies defined this as a 20% reduction in the BPRS or PANSS scale. The clinical meaning of this is unclear. The PANSS and BPRS are rating scales that are not commonly used in routine clinical practice. They both include a restricted range of items relating to various aspects of psychopathology (including positive and negative symptoms). Each of these individual items attracts equal weight. The validity of using a 20% reduction in this scale must be viewed with a degree of caution. It is far from clear whether a 20% reduction in scores represents an externally valid and clinically important improvement in mental state, which people with schizophrenia and clinicians would generally regard as a successful outcome that was worth achieving. It is quite possible to record improvement amongst a small number of the items to achieve a 20% reduction, whilst still retaining the most disabling and distressing features of a schizophrenic episode. Clinicians will need to consider the significance of having to treat 10 people with risperidone instead of haloperidol in order to achieve one clinical outcome equivalent to a 20% score reduction. In the original review we stated 'that more studies are appearing that record greater degrees of clinical improvement, such as 40% and 60% is encouraging, but these findings, as reported from <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mahmoud-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmoud 1998</LINK>, should be replicated'. No new studies in the update provided usable data for the greater degrees of clinical improvement with eleven studies still using a 20% reduction as a cut off point.</P>
<P>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale is different from the BPRS and PANSS. It is less focused on specific symptoms and would take into account behavioural and social aspects of a person's day-to-day functioning. This scale failed to show any difference between risperidone and, largely, haloperidol. It could be argued that by focussing less on specific aspects of psychopathology, it represents a more valid measure of the overall impact of schizophrenia and its treatment on wider aspects of functioning and quality of life. The absence of any difference in this outcome further throws into doubt the external validity and clinical meaning of the observed changes in BPRS and PANSS scores. Whilst being a crude and imprecise measure of clinical outcome, it is perhaps a more externally valid global measure than the BPRS and PANSS.</P>
<P>Risperidone's effect on relapse was investigated in one study and findings look promising for risperidone. <LINK REF="STD-Csernansky-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Csernansky 1999</LINK> found a significant reduction in relapse if allocated risperidone. These important findings, however, should be replicated.</P>
<P>3.2 Mental state<BR/>Results for mental state are mixed according to the scale which was used to measure improvement, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect of risperidone. No marked differences in mental state between groups were found from the data provided by five studies using the mean change in PANSS scores. However, four trials used the BPRS and did find risperidone more likely to produce a greater mean change in score. One trial provided limited favourable data for the endpoint score on the PANSS. Overall it seems as though risperidone does not differ greatly from the older drugs in terms of mental state outcomes.</P>
<P>It is not possible to make any confident statements regarding the effect of risperidone on negative symptoms, due to limitations of the data. In the absence of individual patient data it was not possible to check for the presence of skew. The validity therefore of parametric tests for these change data is not known. Caution should subsequently be exercised when interpreting the results. Four trials (n=1820) were pooled in the analysis. Overall, there appeared to be no significant differences in mean change of negative symptoms between risperidone and control group. </P>
<P>The difficulty in differentiating negative symptoms from movement disorders such as slowness and poverty of movement (<LINK REF="REF-van-Putten-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Putten 1987</LINK>) may favour risperidone over haloperidol, especially when haloperidol is used in relatively high dose. It is noteworthy that less difference is observed between risperidone and haloperidol in terms of negative symptoms in the European study where 10mg/day of haloperidol is used (<LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>) as opposed to the North American studies where the dose of haloperidol was 20mg/day (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>The same problems arise for the understanding of ratings on 'positive' symptoms. In ten studies positive symptoms were assessed using the positive subscale of the PANSS scale. Mean change data and standard deviations were presented in four trials. As with negative symptoms, there was no reliable means of detecting skew and so caution should be exercised in interpretation. Risperidone appears to be no more effective than control in treating 'positive' symptoms as in those studies that did report standard deviations (n=1820) no statistically significant differences between risperidone and control were observed.</P>
<P>3.3 Behaviour<BR/>Again, no significant differences in behaviour were found between groups. The data are again limited and so no firm conclusion about this result can be made until more data is available.</P>
<P>3.4 Cognitive function<BR/>Although more recent studies specifically investigated cognitive functioning, data presentation was poor and insufficient information was available to assess the impact of risperidone on cognitive function. Limited information, available from side effect scales, reveals no significant differences between risperidone and control for causing memory or concentration difficulties.</P>
<P>3.5 Acceptability of treatment<BR/>When the acceptability of treatment is assessed indirectly by the numbers of people leaving the studies early, risperidone does appear to be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia than older typical antipsychotics.</P>
<P>3.6 Adverse events<BR/>The main objective of this review was to compare the effects of risperidone with that of 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs. Essentially, however, this review is a comparison of risperidone with haloperidol. Findings comparing side effect profiles with risperidone should be interpreted with this in mind. Data derived from the new included studies were similar and no new changes in the adverse events results were found for this update. The extra data, however, made some results more robust.</P>
<P>3.6.1 Movement disorders<BR/>People treated with risperidone experienced less movement disorders (extrapyramidal symptoms) than did those in control groups. This finding was robust and consistent across all studies. Excluding studies that used higher doses of haloperidol (&gt;10 mg/day) did not materially change the results and confirms that haloperidol has a high propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms, even at lower doses (<LINK REF="REF-Joy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joy 2000</LINK>). The availability of a greater number of randomised studies directly comparing risperidone with other conventional neuroleptics with a lower potential to cause extrapyramidal symptoms would allow more meaningful and externally valid comparisons to be made. </P>
<P>The use of antiparkinsonian medication, used to alleviate these extrapyramidal symptoms, unsurprisingly reflects the results relating directly to movement disorders. Far fewer people treated with risperidone required anti-parkinsonian medication. Again, this finding reflects comparisons between risperidone and largely haloperidol, a conventional antipsychotic with an unusually high propensity to cause parkinsonian side effects. In clinical practice, many patients will be commenced on an antipsychotic with less potent parkinsonian side effects or will be adequately managed with occasional antiparkinsonian medications. The appropriateness of these routine therapeutic options cannot be established from the studies reviewed.</P>
<P>3.6.2 Anxiety, agitation, insomnia and headache <BR/>No significant differences were observed between risperidone and control for those side effects that are considered 'common' with risperidone (anxiety, agitation, insomnia and headache). Although insomnia is no more likely to occur with risperidone than with control people treated with risperidone appear marginally less likely to experience somnolence. </P>
<P>3.6.3 Dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation <BR/>No difference between risperidone and control was revealed in terms of causing anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, and constipation). However, like risperidone, haloperidol (the main control treatment), is reputed to have a limited propensity to cause these and therefore greater differences may have been observed had other 'conventional' neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine been used as the control treatment.</P>
<P>3.6.4 Other outcomes<BR/>After the update and inclusion of more studies with usable data, we found that people treated with risperidone are more likely to gain weight than are those treated with the control drugs. Risperidone also appears more likely to cause rhinitis (nasal inflammation). This finding, similar to that found in the original review, has been replicated by further studies in the update. No differences were observed between risperidone and control for other miscellaneous side effects such as gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, sexual or menstrual problems. <BR/> <BR/>3.7 Missing outcomes<BR/>Very limited data or no information at all was provided regarding quality of life, social functioning, employment status or cost effectiveness. </P>
<P>4. Heterogeneity<BR/>Only one result was statistically significantly heterogeneous (blurring of vision). This result must be considered alongside the other outcomes and the probability of a heterogeneous result arising by chance (1 in 20). The principal outcomes under consideration were homogeneous between studies and the source of heterogeneity for blurring of vision was not apparent and was not investigated further.</P>
<P>5. Sensitivity analyses<BR/>As no trial focused exclusively on people with treatment resistant schizophrenia it was impossible to undertake sensitivity analyses on this important subgroup of people. </P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Emsley-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Emsley 1995</LINK> (n=183) included patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia. The results of this study appear consistent with other studies and excluding this trial did not materially change any of the main outcomes of interest. However, because this was not a large study, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions. </P>
<P>Three studies (n=1885) compared multiple fixed doses of risperidone with one fixed dose of haloperidol (<LINK REF="STD-Chouinard-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Chouinard 1993a</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Marder-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Marder 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Peuskens-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Peuskens 1995</LINK>). These multiple doses of risperidone were pooled together for the purposes of comparison. This meant pooling doses of risperidone of 1mg/day or 2mg/day that are arguably sub-therapeutic. Excluding these lower doses, however, did not materially change the results for the principal outcomes of interest.</P>
<P>In most studies the mean daily dose of haloperidol at endpoint was 10mg/day or less. If studies where the dose of haloperidol at endpoint was greater than this are excluded, the beneficial effect of risperidone in causing clinical improvement is no longer statistically significant. However, the magnitude of this change is very small and is most probably attributable to loss of power as a result of excluding trials. Similarly, excluding data from those given higher doses of haloperidol does marginally weaken the results relating to leaving studies early, making it no longer statistically significant. Again, this may well be due to loss of power rather than a substantive change in effect. Excluding the higher doses of haloperidol did not materially change the results in terms of extrapyramidal side effects and the strong beneficial effect of risperidone over control was retained.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>1. For people with schizophrenia<BR/>Risperidone appears to have a marginally greater effect than typical neuroleptics in improving a limited number of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Many of these symptoms are used in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and may or may not be the ones which people find most troublesome. One extra person out of every 10 treated will achieve this gain in the short term. It appears however to have little or no additional effect on the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, although, because of limited data, it is not possible to be confident about this. Risperidone has an advantage over haloperidol in that it does have reduced tendency to cause movement disorders, although haloperidol is particularly prone to cause this, and, had the people designing the studies chosen another typical antipsychotic risperidone may not have appeared to be so advantageous. However, by treating 4 people with risperidone one less patient will experience movement disorders or require medication to alleviate this, when compared with haloperidol. Risperidone seems to be more acceptable to people than, largely, haloperidol, with one less person out of every 6 treated dropping out before the study ends. Risperidone, however, makes weight gain more likely, with one additional person out of every three treated gaining weight. </P>
<P>People with schizophrenia may want to consider carefully whether they want to enter studies involving risperidone. Consumer advocates may wish to lobby for the release of data for which informed consent was given. </P>
<P>2. For clinicians<BR/>The question of whether risperidone is more effective than other 'conventional' neuroleptics needs to be answered. It does appear to have some advantages over haloperidol in terms of limited alleviation of symptoms and side effect profile. It may be more acceptable to those with schizophrenia, perhaps due to decreased sedation, despite a tendency to increase weight more than drugs such as haloperidol. There is little known from trials about long term effects.</P>
<P>3. For managers or policy makers<BR/>Surprisingly limited data exist on the clinical implications of using risperidone and there are almost no data relevant to service utilisation, hospitalisation or functioning in the community. The potential benefits of risperidone, clinically and in reducing extrapyramidal side effects, over and above, largely, haloperidol, need to be balanced against the greater costs of this drug. Whether risperidone is more effective than other low cost 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, needs to be proven.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>1. Publication bias<BR/>Those undertaking reviews are unaware of the extent to which research goes unpublished and will never be sure that they are in possession of all of the available research evidence. The current review is less prone to publication bias than the previous version. However, statutory legislation requiring prospective registration of research studies is the only solution to the problem of publication bias (<LINK REF="REF-Dickersin-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dickersin 1992</LINK>). Further, there should be a requirement on the part of those who undertake research (published or unpublished) to make all data available to those undertaking systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Naylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naylor 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>2. Methodology<BR/>Clearly more trials of risperidone are needed. The short duration of the studies included in this review make it impossible to inform people with schizophrenia about the effects of risperidone in the medium and long term. Long, well-designed, conducted and reported trials are needed.</P>
<P>Protocols for trials are now encouraged as publications quite separate from the final report (<LINK REF="REF-Horton-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horton 1997</LINK>). Appropriate power calculations, the proposed selection of participants, randomisation process and its concealment and recording of outcomes could be presented and clearly described. Final reports should present a table of baseline characteristics of those in each group to reassure readers that the groups were similar and should describe reasons for every post-randomisation loss to follow-up. Clinically useful and understandable outcomes (binary and, if required, continuous) should be presented and an intention-to-treat analysis undertaken. </P>
<P>2.1 Participants<BR/>Pragmatic entry criteria to trials would allow greater applicability of results.</P>
<P>2.2 Interventions<BR/>Clearly there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of risperidone against 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs other than haloperidol. It is possible that comparisons with, for example, chlorpromazine, or sulpiride may show risperidone to have fewer advantages for minimising movement disorders. The significantly greater cost of risperidone makes it all the more important to establish its efficacy over these cheaper alternatives. </P>
<P>2.3 Outcome Measures<BR/>Most trials used rating scales. These provided information relating to symptoms and adverse effects that was difficult to translate into anything clinically meaningful. In future studies it would be helpful to target key symptoms of interest and present data in a dichotomous form. For example, it was difficult to get a clear idea about the impact of risperidone on anxiety or depression. These symptoms could have been targeted and the numbers of people experiencing a clinically important degree of such symptoms at baseline and endpoint reported.</P>
<P>Important outcomes such as cognitive function, social functioning, quality of life, employment status, discharge from hospital and relapse rates were insufficiently reported.</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>The test for skewness is acceptable for testing continuous endpoint data but not for continuous change data. The normal distribution of change data may cross the zero line, which increases the likelihood that 2SDs is greater than the mean. Thus if the intervention is ineffective, the outcome change data are closer to zero, so more likely to be excluded. This produces a selection bias of the included studies, in that the smaller the treatment effect the less likely the study will be included in the meta-analysis. This could profoundly alter your results.</P>
</FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<FEEDBACK_REPLY>
<P>The limitation of the doubling of the standard deviation for testing for skewness is now highlighted in the Methods section of the review. In addition the following paragraph has been added: "For continuous mean change data (endpoint minus baseline) the situation is even more problematic. In the absence of individual patient data it is impossible to know if change data is skewed. The RevMan meta-analyses of continuous data are based on the assumption that the data are, at least to a reasonable degree, normally distributed. It is quite feasible that change data is skewed but, after consulting the ALLSTAT 1988 electronic statistics mailing list (http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/allstat/index.html), it was entered into RevMan in order to summarise the available information. In doing this it is assumed that either data were not skewed or that the analyses within RevMan could cope with the unknown degree of skewness. Without individual trial data it is not possible to formally check this assumption." As a result summated change data is presented in graphical form.</P>
