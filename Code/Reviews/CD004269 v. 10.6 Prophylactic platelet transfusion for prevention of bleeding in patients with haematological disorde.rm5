<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2012-03-07 07:54:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>This review was undertaken to determine the best use of platelet transfusions for the prevention of bleeding in patients who have haematological disorders and are receiving intensive (myelosuppressive) chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. The review aimed to look at three main topics. One, what is the evidence to indicate if platelet transfusions should be given to prevent bleeding as compared to a strategy aimed at transfusion when bleeding occurs? Second, if platelet transfusions are given to prevent bleeding, when should they be given, for example, at what level of platelet count when measured in a blood sample? Three, if platelet transfusions are given what platelet dose should be used? We are unable to answer the first question, however new data from two large studies should be available when this review is updated in approximately two years time. With regard to the second question, there is no evidence to suggest a change from the current practice of using a platelet count of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L to trigger the use of platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding. However, more research is required to clarify this issue. The final question can be answered. Using a lower platelet dose did not lead to an increased risk of bleeding and fewer platelets were required. The reduction in the number of platelets used should, theoretically, reduce the risk of adverse events although no true differences were seen in the studies. However, adverse events are uncommon and therefore a statistically significant difference may not be seen.</P>

<P>Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with bone marrow failure.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:43:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Carolyn Doree">
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 4, 2011), MEDLINE (1950 to Nov 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Nov 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to Nov 2011), using adaptations of the Cochrane RCT search filter, the UKBTS/SRI Transfusion Evidence Library, and ongoing trial databases to 10 November 2011.</P>

<P>RCTs involving transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis, and given to prevent bleeding in patients with haematological disorders. Four different types of prophylactic platelet transfusion trial were included. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:53:58 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Sabine Kluge">
<P>In the original review one author initially screened all electronically derived citations and abstracts of papers, identified by the review search strategy, for relevancy. Two authors performed this task in the updated review. Two authors independently assessed the full text of all potentially relevant trials for eligibility. Two authors completed data extraction independently. We requested missing data from the original investigators as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:54:00 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 18 trials that were eligible for inclusion, five of these were still ongoing.Thirteen completed published trials (2331 participants) were included for analysis in the review. The original review contained nine trials (718 participants). This updated review includes six new trials (1818 participants).Two trials (205 participants) in the original review are now excluded because fewer than 80% of participants had a haematological disorder.</P>
<P>The four different types of prophylactic platelet transfusion trial, that were the focus of this review, were included within these thirteen trials.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Three trials compared prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic-only platelet transfusions. There was no statistical difference between the number of participants with clinically significant bleeding in the therapeutic and prophylactic arms but the confidence interval was wide (RR 1.66; 95% CI 0.9 to 3.04).The time taken for a clinically significant bleed to occur was longer in the prophylactic platelet transfusion arm. There was a clear reduction in platelet transfusion usage in the therapeutic arm. There was no statistical difference between the number of participants in the therapeutic and prophylactic arms with platelet refractoriness, the only adverse event reported.</P>
<P>Three trials compared different platelet count thresholds to trigger administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions. No statistical difference was seen in the number of participants with clinically significant bleeding (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.9), however, this type of bleeding occurred on fewer days in the group of patients transfused at a higher platelet count threshold (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.22).The lack of a difference seen for the number of participants with clinically significant bleeding may be due to the studies, in combination, having insufficient power to demonstrate a difference, or due to masking of the effect by a higher number of protocol violations in the groups of patients with a lower platelet count threshold. Using a lower platelet count threshold led to a significant reduction in the number of platelet transfusions used. There were no statistical differences in the number of adverse events reported between the two groups.</P>
<P>Six trials compared different doses of prophylactic platelet transfusions. There was no evidence to suggest that using a lower platelet transfusion dose increased: the number of participants with clinically significant (WHO grade 2 or above) (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11), or life-threatening (WHO grade 4) bleeding (RR 1.87; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.08). A higher platelet transfusion dose led to a reduction in the number of platelet transfusion episodes, but an increase in total platelet utilisation. Only one adverse event, wheezing after transfusion, had a significantly higher incidence when standard and high dose transfusions were compared but this difference was not seen when low dose and high dose transfusions were compared. It is therefore likely to be a type I error (false positive).</P>
<P>One small trial compared prophylactic platelet transfusions versus platelet-poor plasma. The risk of a significant bleed was decreased in the prophylactic platelet transfusion arm (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95) and this was statistically significant.</P>
<P>All studies had threats to validity; the majority of these were due to methodology of the studies not being described in adequate detail.</P>
<P>Although it was not the main focus of the review, it was interesting to note that in one of the pre-specified sub-group analyses (treatment type) two studies showed that patients receiving an autologous transplant have a lower risk of bleeding than patients receiving intensive chemotherapy or an allogeneic transplant (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.82).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:54:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These conclusions refer to the four different types of platelet transfusion trial separately. Firstly, there is no evidence that a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy prevents bleeding. Two large trials comparing a therapeutic versus prophylactic platelet transfusion strategy, that have not yet been published, should provide important new data on this comparison. Secondly, there is no evidence, at the moment, to suggest a change from the current practice of using a platelet count of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. However, the evidence for a platelet count threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L being equivalent to 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L is not as definitive as it would first appear and further research is required. Thirdly, platelet dose does not affect the number of patients with significant bleeding, but whether it affects number of days each patient bleeds for is as yet undetermined. There is no evidence that platelet dose affects the incidence of WHO grade 4 bleeding.Prophylactic platelet transfusions were more effective than platelet-poor plasma at preventing bleeding.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:54:06 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Platelet transfusions are used in modern clinical practice to prevent and treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with bone marrow failure secondary to chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. The ready availability of platelet concentrates has undoubtedly made a major contribution in allowing the development of intensive treatment regimens for haematological disorders (malignant and non-malignant) and other malignancies.</P>
<P>The first demonstration of the effectiveness of transfusions of platelets was performed in 1910 (<LINK REF="REF-Duke-1910" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duke 1910</LINK>). However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that the use of platelet transfusions became standard treatment for thrombocytopenic patients with bone marrow failure (<LINK REF="REF-Blajchman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blajchman 2008</LINK>). Alongside changes in supportive care, the routine use of platelet transfusions in patients with haematological disorders since that time has led to a marked decrease in the number of haemorrhagic deaths associated with thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Slichter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 1980</LINK>), however this has led to a considerable increase in the demand for platelet concentrates. Currently, platelet concentrates are the second most frequently used blood component. About 266,000 adult doses per year are transfused in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 2010</LINK>), costing about £50 million per year. Administration of platelet transfusions to patients with haematological disorders now constitute a significant proportion (up to 67%) of all platelets issued (<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Greeno-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Greeno 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pendry-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pendry 2011</LINK>), and the majority of these (69%) are given to prevent bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Estcourt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estcourt 2011a</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-12 20:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the obvious beneficial effect that platelet transfusions have had on the management of patients with haematological malignancies with severe thrombocytopenia who are actively bleeding, questions still remain on how this limited resource should be used to prevent severe and life-threatening bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Estcourt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estcourt 2011b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Prophylactic platelet transfusions for patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia became standard practice following the publication of several, small, randomised controlled trials in the late 1970s and early 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Higby-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>). This review does not focus on the absolute need for platelet transfusions in this patient population but instead reviews the transfusion strategies that most effectively balance the benefits of their use against their risks.This review focused on four different types of prophylactic platelet transfusion trial.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic-only platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>The standard practice in most haematology units across the developed world has been to use prophylactic transfusions, in line with guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Slichter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 2007</LINK>). The experimental intervention was to only give platelet transfusions when bleeding occurred.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold</HEADING>
<P>Prophylactic platelet transfusions are typically given when blood platelet counts fall below a given trigger level. Studies compared different platelet count thresholds to trigger the administration of prophylactic platelet transfusions.The current consensus is that patients should receive a platelet transfusion when the platelet count is &lt;10x10<SUP>9</SUP>/L, unless there are other risk factors for bleeding, such as sepsis, concurrent use of antibiotics or other abnormalities of haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slichter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 2007</LINK>). The experimental interventions were higher or lower platelet transfusion thresholds.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Dose of prophylactic platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>This is the number of platelets given (platelet dose) during a standard platelet transfusion. For adults, the usual dose given is a single apheresis unit or a pool of four to six whole blood&#8211;derived platelets, with the absolute number of platelets in the range of 300 x 10<SUP>9 </SUP> to 600 x 10<SUP>9 </SUP>(<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>). The experimental interventions were low dose or high dose platelet transfusion strategies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Platelet transfusions versus alternative treatments (such as artificial platelet substitutes/platelet-poor plasma/ recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa)/ fibrinogen)</HEADING>
<P>The standard practice in most haematology units across the developed world has been to use prophylactic transfusions, in line with guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slichter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 2007</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelets versus therapeutic-only platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>A retrospective review of almost 3000 thrombocytopenic adult patients over a 10-year period showed no relationship between the first morning platelet count, or the lowest platelet count of the day, and the risk of bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Friedmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Friedmann 2002</LINK>). This has raised the question as to whether a threshold-defined prophylactic platelet transfusion approach is appropriate.</P>
<P>Further support for the absence of a relationship between the severity of thrombocytopenia and bleeding came from a review of case reports of severe intracranial haemorrhage. These cases were described in trials of prophylactic platelet transfusions. No clear evidence could be found for an association between the occurrence of major intracranial bleeding and absolute platelet count just prior to the onset of severe bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Thus, the overall benefit of a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy over a policy to use platelets only therapeutically, using a platelet count threshold, has not been established.</P>
<P>A recent study, using an historical control, assessed a therapeutic platelet transfusion strategy after autologous transplantation. Only 19% of the patients had clinically relevant bleeding of minor or moderate severity, and no severe or life-threatening bleeding was documented, this was a comparable rate to the historical control (20%). One-third of all transplants, and 47% after high-dose melphalan, were performed without any platelet transfusion. The numbers of platelet transfusions were reduced by 50% compared with their historical control (<LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2006</LINK>). In an interim report of a randomised controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2009</LINK>), platelet transfusions could be significantly reduced (by 27%) in the therapeutic transfusion arm compared with prophylactic transfusion. 46% of patients in the therapeutic arm did not need any platelet transfusions. However, the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was significantly higher (28.7% vs 9.5%), this is not surprising as this was the trigger for transfusion in the experimental arm.</P>
<P>Therefore a therapeutic platelet transfusion strategy may be safe and feasible. A large randomised controlled trial that hopes to answer this question has just completed recruitment of patients &#8211; TOPPs trial (<LINK REF="REF-Blajchman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blajchman 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Optimal dose of prophylactic platelets</HEADING>
<P>The dose of the platelet product transfused was based upon the perceived need to raise the patient's platelet count above a certain safe threshold. Over the years, our understanding of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients has advanced and there is now evidence to suggest that patients require only approximately 7100 platelets/µL per day to maintain haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1985</LINK>). Platelets have been shown to provide an endothelial supportive function by plugging gaps in the endothelium of otherwise intact blood vessels. Animal studies have shown that thrombocytopenia is associated with the gradual thinning of the vessel wall endothelium over time, and that, if thrombocytopenia persists, gaps gradually occur between adjacent endothelial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Blajchman-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blajchman 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kitchens-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitchens 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nachman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nachman 2008</LINK>). This thinning and fenestration of the endothelium is accompanied with the on-going and increased use of circulating platelets to prevent the loss of red blood cells (RBCs) through these gaps.</P>
<P>A mathematical model predicted that smaller, more frequent doses of platelets would be as effective as higher doses of platelets in maintaining patients' platelet counts above an agreed threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Hersh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hersh 1998</LINK>). This raised the question of whether thrombocytopenic bleeding could be prevented with a lower platelet dose (<LINK REF="REF-Tinmouth-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tinmouth 2003</LINK>). Such a strategy has potential economic and resource advantages, as fewer platelet transfusions might be required and donor exposures might be reduced.</P>
<P>Several smaller studies tried to address this question but only one of them used bleeding as a primary outcome measure (<LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>). This showed that the low-dose prophylactic regimen was just as effective as the standard dose and resulted in a 25% reduction in the number of platelets transfused.</P>
<P>There have been two recent larger trials. One was stopped early because of an excess of WHO grade 4 bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>), and the large PLADO trial confirmed the earlier finding by Tinmouth (<LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet threshold</HEADING>
<P>Efforts were also made to establish a threshold for the use of prophylactic transfusions based on the platelet count. It became standard practice to transfuse platelets at platelet counts below 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L, in an attempt to prevent bleeding (<LINK REF="REF-Beutler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beutler 1993</LINK>). This practice was partly based on the findings of non-randomised studies, such as <LINK REF="REF-Gaydos-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaydos 1962</LINK>. This showed that gross haemorrhage (haematuria, haematemesis and melaena) was present more frequently at platelet counts below 5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L than when the platelet count was between 5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L and 100 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. This study and others like it did not clearly support the use of a threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion of 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L, nor was any threshold effect seen.</P>
<P>The routine use of platelet transfusions from the 1970s, in patients with haematological malignancies, resulted in a decreased mortality rate due to bleeding (less than 1% of patients) (<LINK REF="REF-Slichter-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 1980</LINK>). However, the widespread use of a threshold platelet count of 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L for prophylactic platelet transfusions led to a marked growth in demand for platelet concentrates (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 2002</LINK>).  </P>
<P>This stimulated research to address whether the threshold could be safely lowered to 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L (<LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>,  reviewed in <LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2004</LINK>). The consensus formulated from these trials was that patients should receive a platelet transfusion when the platelet count is &lt;10x10<SUP>9</SUP>/L, unless there are other risk factors for bleeding, such as sepsis, concurrent use of antibiotics or other abnormalities of haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-BCSH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BCSH 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Slichter-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>There have been calls for a further reduction in the threshold to 5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. In the 1970s it had been shown, using faecal blood loss as an indicator of bleeding, that the increased risk of bleeding was at the 5 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L threshold (<LINK REF="REF-Slichter-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Slichter 1978</LINK>). However, the ability to decrease the platelet threshold to this level may be compromised by the inaccuracy of automated platelet counters at very low platelet counts (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although platelet mass has been used as a transfusion trigger for neonatal platelet transfusions (<LINK REF="STD-Gerday-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gerday 2009</LINK>), different platelet count thresholds have been the only known trigger used in patients with a haematological disorder.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Platelet transfusions versus alternative treatments (such as artificial platelet substitutes/platelet-poor plasma/ rFVIIa/ fibrinogen)</HEADING>
<P>Most clinical research has focused on the optimal dose for platelet transfusion or the threshold level of platelet counts for prophylactic platelet transfusions, rather than questioning the underlying assumption that prophylactic platelet transfusions are necessary or effective. The most recent RCTs have established that many patients develop bleeding at some stage during the period of greatest risk, frequently defined as a period of thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). This bleeding covers a spectrum of bleeding, from skin changes to, less commonly, intracranial haemorrhage. In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>, patients had similar rates of bleeding (17%) with morning platelet counts within the range of 6 to 80 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. This means that there are a significant number of bleeding episodes that are not being effectively treated by prophylactic platelet transfusions. Treatments that target other parts of the clotting cascade may be as effective at treating bleeding as prophylactic platelet transfusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of bleeding</HEADING>
<P>A bleeding assessment has been seen as a more clinically relevant measure of the effect of platelet transfusions than surrogate markers such as platelet increment.</P>
<P> Any review that uses bleeding as a primary outcome measure needs to assess the way that the trials have recorded bleeding. Unfortunately, the way bleeding has been recorded and assessed has varied markedly between trials (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Retrospective analysis of bleeding leads to a risk of bias because bleeding events may be missed, and only more severe bleeding is likely to have been documented. Prospective bleeding assessment forms provide more information and are less likely to miss bleeding events. However, different assessors may grade the same bleed differently and it is very difficult to blind the assessor to the intervention.</P>
<P>The majority of trials have used the WHO system for grading bleeding, or a modification of this system (<LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2004</LINK>). One limitation of all the scoring systems that have been based on the WHO system is that the categories are relatively broad and subjective. This means that a small change in a patient's bleeding risk may not be detected. Another limitation is that the modified WHO categories are partially defined by whether a bleeding patient requires a blood transfusion. The threshold for intervention may vary between clinicians and institutions and so the same level of bleeding could be graded differently in different institutions.</P>
<P>The definition of what constitutes clinically significant bleeding has varied between studies, although the majority of more recent platelet transfusion studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>) now classify it as WHO grade 2 or above there has been greater heterogeneity in the past (<LINK REF="REF-Cook-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cook 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koreth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koreth 2004</LINK>). The difficulties with assessing and grading bleeding may limit the ability to compare results between studies and this needs to be kept in mind when reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of prophylactic platelet transfusions.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-03-28 13:54:09 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Lise J Estcourt">
<P>Although considerable advances have been made in platelet transfusion therapy in the last 40 years, three major areas continue to provoke debate.</P>
<P>Firstly, what is the optimal prophylactic platelet dose to prevent thrombocytopenic bleeding?</P>
<P>Secondly, which threshold should be used to trigger the transfusion of prophylactic platelets?</P>
<P>Thirdly, are prophylactic platelet<SUP> </SUP>transfusions superior to therapeutic platelet transfusions<SUP> </SUP>for the prevention and/or control of life-threatening thrombocytopenic bleeding?</P>
<P>The initial formulation of this Cochrane review attempted to answer these questions, but there was insufficient evidence available at the time for any definitive conclusions to be drawn (<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2004</LINK>). This update of the review reassessed the literature, to ascertain whether any recent studies can provide us with the evidence to answer those questions. There has been another recent systematic review of the optimal dose for prophylactic platelets (<LINK REF="STD-Cid-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Cid 2007</LINK>), but this is now out-dated because several new large studies have recently been completed.</P>
<P>This review did not assess whether there are any differences in the efficacy of apheresis versus whole-blood derived platelet products, nor did it assess differences between ABO identical and ABO non-identical platelet transfusions. This is because both these topics have been covered by recent systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Heddle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heddle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shehata-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Shehata 2009</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Ongoing studies</HEADING>
<P>The updated review identified five ongoing studies within 11 abstracts or database records. The original review identified one ongoing study that is not currently recruiting patients (<LINK REF="STD-Franklin-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Franklin 1995</LINK>). However, no further information were available from the trialists. Searches of databases of ongoing trials and abstracts identified four further potentially relevant trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00180986" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00180986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-NCT00180986" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00180986</LINK> is not actively recruiting patients at the moment (no further information available from the author). <LINK REF="STD-Lu-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lu 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2009</LINK> have now completed recruitment of patients but results have not yet been published.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies contributing to the main outcome</HEADING>
<P>The 13 remaining RCTs (26 publications) were published between 1973 and 2010. There were 13 secondary citations of included studies (cited as secondary references for the relevant included studies).</P>
<P>There were six new studies (<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>) included in this updated review, and they were published between 2002 and 2010. Nine studies were identified in the original review (<LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Higby-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klumpp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klumpp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zumberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zumberg 2002</LINK>).Two studies that had previously been included in the review were excluded because fewer than 80% of participants had a haematological disorder and no subgroup data could be identified (<LINK REF="STD-Klumpp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klumpp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zumberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zumberg 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The thirteen RCTs included were distributed across the four review sub-categories as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three trials evaluated the effect of a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy versus a therapeutic platelet transfusion policy (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for study characteristics, including number and type of participants, type of intervention, duration of study, type of platelet product and primary outcome.</P>
<P>Three RCTs were identified in this comparison. All were single centre parallel RCTs. The number of patients randomised ranged from 12 in <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK> to 56 in <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>. Two studies were conducted in the USA in the 1970's, although one study was not published until 1982, some years after recruitment had been completed (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>). One study was conducted in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK> was only reported as a short abstract, and no further information was available from the author, therefore this study will be excluded from any quantitative analysis (12 participants were randomised, but the numbers in each arm of the study were not stated).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In total 99 participants were randomised, and of these, 97 were included in the analysis. Two patients were excluded from <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK> because they died from an intra-cranial haemorrhage on the first day of the study. The study populations varied slightly. In <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>, patients were previously untreated adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML); patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) were excluded. In <LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>, patients were previously untreated children with either AML or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL); no exclusion criteria were reported. In <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>, patients had acute leukaemia and were severely thrombocytopenic; no exclusion criteria were reported.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>All three studies compared prophylactic platelet transfusions with a platelet threshold of 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L with a therapeutic platelet transfusion regime (platelet transfusion given for clinically significant bleeding). However, in <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>, platelet transfusions were also given in the therapeutic ("specific indications") arm if there had been a 50% fall in platelets to below 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L over the previous 24 hrs.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Co-interventions</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies had any reported co-interventions. None of the studies reported a red cell transfusion policy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the three studies defined a primary outcome; this was survival (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>). Only one study commented on bleeding outcomes apart from death from bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>). Two studies reported on platelet transfusion requirements (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>). Two studies commented on adverse events (platelet refractoriness) (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In total 520 participants were randomised, of these, 499 were included in the analysis. Twenty one patients randomised in <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK> were excluded from analysis (16 no study records received; two received non-myeloablative chemotherapy; three died (two within 24 hours of enrolment into the study). Two of the studies examined adult patients with acute leukaemia; one included ALL and AML patients (<LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>); and the other included only patients with AML (<LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>). Both excluded patients with APL.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Two of the three studies defined a primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK> defined the frequency and severity of bleeding as the primary outcome, with the number of platelet transfusions as a secondary outcome. Whereas t<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK> defined the number of platelet transfusions as the primary outcome with bleeding as one of the secondary outcomes. The third study, <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>, stated that its main aims were to look at platelet use and bleeding complications. All three studies commented on adverse events associated with platelet transfusions.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In total 1808 participants were randomised, of these, 1714 were included in the analysis. Ninety one patients (7 in <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>, 5 in <LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>, and 79 in <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>) were excluded from these studies because they did not receive a platelet transfusion. Three further patients were excluded from the <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> study because there were no bleeding assessment data available. Three of the studies included only adult patients (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>).

One study included only children with acute leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>). All of the patients had hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia but the cause of this varied between studies. All of the studies included patients with acute leukaemia, however only four of the studies specifically stated that APL was an exclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>).

<P>
<B>Co-interventions</B>
</P>
<P>There were no reported co-interventions in any of the studies. Four of the six studies did not report a red cell transfusion policy and two studies (unpublished data of <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>) reported that local practice at each centre determined the red cell transfusion policy.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Participants</HEADING>
<P>In total 21 participants were randomised (18 patients were randomised once and three were randomised twice).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>All studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murphy-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Murphy 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sintnicolaas-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Sintnicolaas 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>) had some threats to validity. The majority of these potential risks were due to a lack of detail provided on the specific criteria and were thus judged as "unclear" using the Cochrane grading system.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sequence generation and allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>None of the studies reported on the method of sequence generation or allocation concealment.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>All studies were likely to be at risk of detection bias. No mechanisms were mentioned to blind outcome assessors or clinicians to the intervention. This might have been particularly problematic with respect to outcomes with potentially very high levels of subjectivity - such as enumerating significant bleeding events.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Loss to follow-up was generally low. In <LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK> analysis was not by intention-to-treat as two patients (randomised to the prophylactic arm) that died from cerebral haemorrhages on day one of the study were not included in the analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>It was unclear whether any of the studies were free of selective reporting as study protocols were not available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Protocol deviation</HEADING>
<P>No study reported on protocol deviation.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>The small numbers of participants in the studies compromised the likelihood that there was equivalence of participants at baseline.</P>
<P>All studies are therefore potentially at risk of significant bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prophylactic platelet transfusion with one trigger level versus prophylactic platelet transfusion with another trigger level</HEADING>
<P>All three studies had some threats to validity (<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>In one of the studies there was adequate blinding of the bleeding assessor (<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK>), but other medical staff were unblinded to the treatment arm. In the other two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; unpublished data of <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>), the bleeding assessors and medical staff were unblinded.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK> did not perform an intention to treat analysis. Twenty one of the randomised patients were excluded from analysis (16 no study records received; two received non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Three died (two within 24 hours of enrolment into the study); two of the three deaths were due to an intra-cerebral haemorrhage. However, the number of participants with missing outcome data were balanced across the intervention groups.</P>

<B>Protocol deviation</B>
</P>
<P>In two of the three studies there were more protocol deviations in the intervention arm of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>). The third study was insufficiently reported for an adequate assessment to be made (<LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>, there was a statistically significant difference between the two arms. 14 out of 37 patients with a transfusion threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L were affected by protocol deviations whereas only 6 out of 41 patients with a transfusion threshold of 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L were affected. In <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>, the pre-transfusion platelet count was higher than indicated in the protocol in 5.4% of platelet transfusions with a transfusion threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L, but only 2% of platelet transfusions with a higher transfusion trigger were transfused outside the protocol guidelines, whether this was statistically significant was not reported.</P>

The third study was insufficiently reported for an adequate assessment to be made (<LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the three studies are potentially at risk of bias due to the higher numbers of protocol violations in the intervention arms of the studies. The third study could not be adequately assessed for this risk.</P>

A further two studies could not be assessed for blinding of medical staff due to lack of information (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>). The final two studies had been designed as blinded studies, but the authors of both of these studies raised the suspicion that blinding was inadequate (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> this suspicion was raised because of unbalanced early withdrawal of patients from the study by physicians (seven patients were withdrawn early from the study; one in the standard dose arm and six in the low dose arm). In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> it was noted that differences in the volume of platelets transfused led to loss of blinding.</P>
<P>Three studies were designed so that the bleeding assessors were blinded to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>), but the authors of two of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>) raised the suspicion that blinding was inadequate. Two studies did not provide sufficient information to determine whether bleeding assessors were blinded to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>), the bleeding assessor was unblinded to the outcome measure.</P>
<P>In four of the six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>), the final allocation of bleeding grade was performed by individuals blinded to the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>), or by the use of a computer algorithm (<LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK> did not provide sufficient information to determine whether individuals who graded bleeding were blinded to the intervention.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Incomplete outcome data</HEADING>
<P>Two of the studies were at risk of significant bias due to an imbalance in the amount of missing data between the arms of the study (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> complete data were available on 71%, 82% and 83% of platelet transfusions in the low, medium and high dose arms of the study respectively (this was a statistically significant difference). In <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> more participants were withdrawn early from the study in the low dose arm.</P>
<P>Three of the studies were not at risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>). The sixth study was not reported in enough detail for this to be assessed (<LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the six studies was free of selective reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). In two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Sensebe-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Sensebe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>), an assessment could not be made due to a lack of information. Three of the studies were at risk of significant bias due to selective reporting (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> not all of the pre-specified outcomes were reported (including platelet response; pre- and post-transfusion bleeding grade in response to dose of therapeutic platelets transfused; cost analysis). In <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK> a large amount of data had been collected as demonstrated by the sentence that states: "<I>No correlation of the incidence of bleeding with sex, pre-transfusion haematocrit, concomitant corticosteroid therapy or the use of anti-neoplastic drugs was found</I>"</P>
<P>However, none of these results were reported. <LINK REF="STD-Steffens-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Steffens 2002</LINK> has only ever been reported as an abstract, however, it mentions within this that further outcomes (such as clinical efficacy and bleeding episodes) would be reported in more detail in the future.</P>
<P>
<B>Protocol deviation</B>
</P>
<P>Three of the six studies were at risk of bias due to an imbalance in protocol deviations between the different arms of the studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>).

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>, the platelet count that triggered a transfusion was higher in the low-dose treatment group (35.9% of transfusions (158/440) given at a trigger of 16 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L or more) than in the standard dose group (24.7% of transfusions (66/267) given at a trigger of 16 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L or more). In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>, a significantly smaller proportion of transfusions were within the assigned dose range when platelet counts were compared between low dose and medium dose groups (71% vs. 80%) and between high dose and medium dose groups (70% vs. 80%). In <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>, a total of15 out of 164 transfusions contravened the protocol in the low dose arm but only 3 out of 147 transfusions contravened the protocol in the standard dose arm.</P>

<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>, there was a marked difference in population age groups between the two arms of the study, other baseline characteristics were not reported in sufficient detail for an assessment to be made.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Risk of bias in the assessment and grading of bleeding</HEADING>
<P>There were ten studies in which bleeding outcomes were reported (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). In four of these it was the primary outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>). These four studies all reported the method of assessing bleeding and the bleeding severity scale used. However, although in three of these four studies red blood cell usage was used to partially grade bleeding severity, only one study reported a definitive red cell transfusion policy (<LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>), and two studies left the decision to transfuse up to local policies (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). Variations in red cell transfusion policies across centres within a trial could affect the assessment of bleeding grade and therefore lead to bias. Also, variations in the use of transfusions between studies could affect the results of any meta-analysis.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Number of days with a significant bleeding event</HEADING>
<P>Three of the studies reported on the number of days with a significant bleeding event (<LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>, and a fourth study provided unpublished data (<LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>, it was reported as the median number of days with WHO grade 2 or above bleeding per patient (<LINK REF="TBL-07" TYPE="TABLE">Table 7</LINK>), and no significant difference was seen between the arms of the study. Authors of <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> studies provided unpublished data on the mean number of days with bleeding. Despite re-classifying significant bleeding in <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> as the number of days with bleeding that required an intervention or a therapeutic platelet transfusion (rather than the study definition - in an attempt to decrease the differences in how bleeding events were defined between studies) there was still substantial heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP>=64%) when an attempt was made to combine the data. A formal analysis of the reasons for this could not be performed but there were several possible reasons. Firstly, <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> included 24 patients who never received a platelet transfusion, these were specifically excluded from analysis of <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>. Secondly, <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> randomised patients at initiation of chemotherapy and the study was stopped when they had a clinically significant bleed, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>, patients were randomised when they received their first prophylactic platelet transfusion and they remained within the study until platelet count recovery or discharge from hospital. Thirdly, the majority of patients in <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> were patients receiving an autologous stem cell transplant (77/111) whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> the majority of patients had acute leukaemia (103/119). The data was also skewed and therefore a meta-analysis was not performed. In <LINK REF="STD-Roy-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Roy 1973</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK> (unpublished data), the total number of days in each arm in which significant bleeding occurred was reported. Again these studies showed substantial heterogeneity (for the reasons above). In <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>, it showed a significantly larger number of days with bleeding in the low dosage arm of the study (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87). In <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>, there was no significant difference between the two arms of the study (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.02) (in the number of days with bleeding that required an intervention or a therapeutic platelet transfusion) (<LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>).</P>

<P>The main objective of this review of prophylactic platelet transfusions was to answer certain questions that continue to cause debate.</P>
<P>Firstly, are prophylactic platelet<SUP> </SUP>transfusions superior to therapeutic platelet transfusions<SUP> </SUP>for the prevention and/or control of life-threatening thrombocytopenic bleeding?</P>
<P>(Studies from the sub-categories of prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic platelet transfusions and prophylactic platelet transfusions versus alternative treatments will be used to answer this question).</P>
<P>Secondly, which threshold should be used to trigger the transfusion of prophylactic platelets?</P>
<P>Thirdly, what is the optimal prophylactic platelet dose to prevent thrombocytopenic bleeding?</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-03-12 21:10:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, five of these were ongoing studies and thirteen had data available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>Three trials that compared the effect of a prophylactic versus therapeutic platelet transfusion policy were included in the review, but only two of these studies contained separate data for each arm of the study. All of these studies were at risk of bias mainly due to lack of clarity on the methods of randomisation.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in the number of participants with clinically significant bleeding. The time to first significant bleed was significantly shorter in the therapeutic arm than the prophylactic arm. There was a significant reduction in the number of platelet units required in the therapeutic transfusion arm. There was no statistically significant effect seen on overall mortality, mortality due to bleeding, red cell transfusion requirements, remission rates, or incidence of platelet refractoriness. However, due to the size of the studies they would not be adequately powered to detect important differences and this was reflected in the wide confidence intervals for any comparison.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet transfusion with one trigger level versus prophylactic platelet transfusion with another trigger level</HEADING>
<P>Three trials that compared the effect of platelet transfusions at one platelet count trigger level versus another were included in this review. All of the studies were at risk of bias.</P>
<P>No difference was seen in the number of participants with significant bleeding between the two threshold levels, however this result may have been affected by the greater number of protocol violations in the lower threshold arm of at least two of the studies. When the number of days with significant bleeding was analysed, there was a significant increase in the number of days with significant bleeding in the group of patients transfused at the lower platelet count threshold. There was no difference seen in the number of patients with severe or life-threatening bleeding between the two threshold levels but the confidence intervals were wide (0.52 to 1.88).</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of platelet transfusions required using a threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L.</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regards to mortality, red cell transfusion requirements, survival, remission rates, hospital stay or adverse events.</P>
<P>The two studies that reported on fever and bleeding risk reached different conclusions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylactic platelet transfusion with one dose schedule versus prophylactic platelet transfusion with another dose schedule</HEADING>
<P>Six trials that compared the effect of platelet transfusion dosage were included in the review. Three compared a low dose versus standard dose platelet transfusion, whereas four compared a standard dose versus a high dose platelet transfusion strategy. All of the studies were at risk of bias.</P>
<P>There was no evidence to suggest that using a lower platelet transfusion dose increased the number of participants with clinically significant (WHO grade 2 or above), or life-threatening (WHO grade 4) bleeding.</P>
<P>Although a formal meta-analysis was not performed, two of the three studies did not show an increase in the total number of days with clinically significant bleeding, or an increase in the number of days per patient with clinically significant bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tinmouth-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Tinmouth 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Overall the trials of platelet dose showed that a low dose transfusion policy reduced patients' total platelet requirements, but at the expense of a higher number of platelet transfusions.</P>
<P>There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regards to mortality, red cell transfusion requirements, survival, remission rates or hospital stay. The only adverse event that showed a significant difference between standard and high dose platelet transfusions (wheezing) was not seen when low dose and high dose platelet transfusions were compared and is therefore likely to be a type I error (i.e. a false positive).</P>
<P>Of interest, in those studies that reported treatment subgroups autologous transplantation was associated with a lower risk of clinically significant bleeding compared to those patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or allogeneic transplantation. However, this is an additional finding and not the focus of this review.</P>

<P>This small study was at risk of bias due to differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients as well as lack of clarity on the method of randomisation (<LINK REF="STD-Higby-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1974</LINK>). It showed a reduction in the rate of significant bleeding in those patients receiving prophylactic platelet transfusions. There was no significant difference in any of the other outcomes, including adverse events, within this comparison. In this study, fever was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. However, aspirin was still used in the 1970s as an anti-pyretic (because its anti-platelet effects were unknown at that time) and therefore this may have been a confounding factor in this study.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies of prophylactic platelet transfusions versus therapeutic platelet transfusions</HEADING>
<P>The two reports of controlled trials that addressed the question of a prophylactic versus therapeutic platelet transfusion policy contained small numbers of patients and were undertaken over 30 years ago. These studies were performed at a time when different quality control measures for the platelet product were applied. The possibility that the platelets in use in the 1970's would have differed in quality from those in use today does need to be considered if attempting to generalise results to the present day. Other factors that also need to be taken in to consideration are that the patients in these studies probably received less optimal supportive therapy (e.g. prophylaxis and treatment of infection), and may have received aspirin and other compounds for fever that affect platelet function (potentially increasing the risk of bleeding).</P>
<P>Also, one studymay not actually represent a strict comparison of prophylactic versus therapeutic platelet transfusions because platelet transfusions were also given if there had been a significant reduction in the platelet count on the preceding day (<LINK REF="STD-Solomon-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Solomon 1978</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies of prophylactic platelet transfusions versus alternative treatments (such as artificial platelet substitutes/platelet-poor plasma/ rFVIIa/ fibrinogen)</HEADING>
<P>One small study that compared prophylactic platelet transfusions versus platelet-poor plasma was conducted over 35 years ago (<LINK REF="STD-Higby-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Higby 1974</LINK>). As in the other older studies there is concern over the ability to generalise the findings from this study to the present day. This is due to potential differences in the quality of the platelets and changes in the management of patients with haematological malignancies. It is very unlikely that a similar study will be performed again due to the fact that the control arm was still exposing patients to a transfusion product that might harm the patient but was not expected to benefit the patient and hence would be ethically unacceptable. Newer studies instead compare a therapeutic versus prophylactic platelet transfusion policy.</P>
<P>We are therefore unable to answer this question at the moment.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies of prophylactic platelet transfusion with one trigger level versus prophylactic platelet transfusion with another trigger level</HEADING>
<P>No statistically significant difference was demonstrated in the number of participants with clinically significant bleeding, but the 95% confidence interval (0.95 to 1.9) demonstrates that a clinically important difference in the proportion of patients with bleeding could have been missed. The studies, when combined, were not adequately powered to detect a difference. In <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>, which included 255 patients, the power calculations were based on the assumption that the rate of WHO grade 2 or above bleeding was 30%, but the actual rate in this study was 20%. If we assume the rate of bleeding was similar in all three studies, to detect a 50% increase in the rate of bleeding (i.e. from 20% to 30%) with 80% power would require 293 participants per arm of the study (586 in total) and to detect a 25% increase in the rate of bleeding (i.e. from 20% to 25%) with 80% power would require 1098 participants per arm of the study (2196 in total). As there were only 499 participants within all three studies, the meta-analysis would not be sufficiently powered to detect a 50% increase in the rate of bleeding in the restrictive transfusion arm.</P>
<P>Additionally, there were important differences between the studies that might affect the degree of confidence that can be placed on the assertion of equivalence between liberal (20 or 30 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) and restrictive (10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) platelet count thresholds for prophylactic platelet transfusions. The treatment protocols for administration of platelets varied, particularly the circumstances for which platelet transfusions could be given. In <LINK REF="STD-Rebulla-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rebulla 1997</LINK>, platelets could be given to patients in the 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L threshold arm if the platelet count was in the range of 10 to 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L and the patient's temperature was above 38<SUP>o</SUP>C. This meant that 22.6% of platelet transfusions were given above the threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. In <LINK REF="STD-Diedrich-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Diedrich 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heckman-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Heckman 1997</LINK>, there were no changes in the transfusion threshold in the presence of fever.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Studies of prophylactic platelet transfusion with one dose schedule versus prophylactic platelet transfusion with another dose schedule</HEADING>
<P>The large number of patients within these studies provided strong evidence that there was no difference in the proportion of participants with bleeding between low dose, standard dose and high dose platelet transfusions. This was reflected in the narrow confidence intervals around the point estimates.</P>
<P>Although <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> did not demonstrate any difference in donor exposures between the two arms of the trial, caution needs to be taken when drawing conclusions from this trial. This is because of the large number of protocol deviations within the trial. Patients in the low dose arm were transfused at higher platelet counts, and this may explain why there was no difference in the number of donor exposures.</P>
<P>Also, although <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> both used a WHO grading system for bleeding the categorisation of bleeding varied between the studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>, less severe bleeding was categorised as Grade 2. For example, in <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK> epistaxis that lasted for more than an hour or required packing was classed as grade 2 bleeding, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> if a patient had epistaxis that lasted for more than 30 minutes in any given 24 hour period it was classified as grade 2 bleeding. Also, in <LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>, ecchymoses larger than 10cm in size were classified as grade 2 bleeding, whereas in <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> purpura greater than 2.54cm (1 inch) in diameter were classified as grade 2 bleeding.</P>

<P>The ability to assess the quality of the evidence was limited by most of the studies not reporting study methodology in adequate detail. For example, allocation concealment was adequate in four studies and unclear in nine studies.</P>
<P>Two of the four studies that blinded the bleeding assessor documented compromise to the blinding process (<LINK REF="STD-Heddle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Heddle 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK>). This is likely to reflect the inherent difficulties with blinding platelet transfusion trials. Platelet dose trials have difficulties with blinding due to the different volumes of platelets to be transfused. Obviously, trials that compare therapeutic versus prophylactic transfusions or differing transfusion thresholds cannot blind the medical staff caring for the patient.</P>
<P>Overall, the highest quality of evidence was from the platelet dose study sub-category (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are prophylactic platelet<SUP> </SUP>transfusions superior to therapeutic platelet transfusions<SUP> </SUP>for the prevention and/or control of life-threatening thrombocytopenic bleeding?</HEADING>
<P>We are still unable to answer this question. There is no evidence to change current practice at the moment, and the results from the trials that have just completed recruitment are awaited (<LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2009</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Which threshold should be used to trigger the transfusion of prophylactic platelets?</HEADING>
<P>The evidence does not clearly show equivalence of a threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L or 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L. However, without further evidence it is reasonable to continue with the current practice of a platelet transfusion threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L in the absence of other risk factors for bleeding. This practice reduces platelet utilisation and donor exposure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What is the optimal prophylactic platelet dose to prevent thrombocytopenic bleeding?</HEADING>
<P>Most published guidelines do not suggest an optimal platelet dose for transfusion. The use of low dose prophylactic platelet transfusions for intensively treated in-patients and medium to high dose for outpatients could be considered. This would decrease the total platelet utilisation for inpatients. For out-patients it would decrease the frequency of day-unit attendances for transfusions, which could not only improve a patient's quality of life but also have resource and budget implications.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Are prophylactic platelet<SUP> </SUP>transfusions superior to therapeutic platelet transfusions<SUP> </SUP>for the prevention and/or control of life-threatening thrombocytopenic bleeding?</HEADING>
<P>We are awaiting evidence from the two trials in progress at the moment that compare a therapeutic versus prophylactic transfusion policy (<LINK REF="STD-Stanworth-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Stanworth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wandt-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wandt 2009</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Which threshold should be used to trigger the transfusion of prophylactic platelets?</HEADING>
<P>The evidence for use of a platelet count threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L needs to be re-addressed. Conclusions on the non-inferiority of a platelet count threshold of 10 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L compared to 20 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L or 30 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L have been based on under-powered studies. However, whether the morning platelet count should be used to guide prophylactic platelet transfusions at all has recently been brought into question (<LINK REF="STD-Gerday-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gerday 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Friedmann-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Friedmann 2002</LINK> performed a large retrospective analysis that demonstrated no relationship between morning platelet count and bleeding risk and in the recent PLADO study the number of days on which WHO grade 2 or above bleeding occurred was similar (17%) at platelet counts between 6 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L and 80 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">What is the optimal prophylactic platelet dose to prevent thrombocytopenic bleeding?</HEADING>
<P>If possible, further data are required from <LINK REF="STD-Slichter-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Slichter 2010</LINK> to assess whether there is an increase in the number of days with clinically significant bleeding at a low platelet transfusion dose. If this confirms that there is no difference in the number of days with bleeding overall and the mean number of days with bleeding per patient then no further studies are required.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of bleeding in future trials</HEADING>
<P>One of the difficulties within this review was the variability between studies in assessing and grading bleeding. The WHO classification of bleeding, although widely used, has never been validated, and therefore the assumption that all grade 2 bleeding is clinically significant has been brought into question. For future studies an agreed international consensus on assessing and grading bleeding would greatly enhance the ability to compare platelet transfusion trials. This would need to be validated and to take into account the impact bleeding has upon the patient from both a medical perspective and with regard to their quality of life.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged that blinding in platelet transfusion trials is difficult. However, whenever possible, the bleeding assessor should be blinded to the intervention.</P>

<P>This updated review has changed from the previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Stanworth-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stanworth 2004</LINK>). The inclusion/exclusion criteria are more restrictive so that only studies that include at least 80% haematology patients were included in the review. This led to the exclusion of two studies that were included in the previous review (<LINK REF="STD-Klumpp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Klumpp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zumberg-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zumberg 2002</LINK>). A primary outcome was pre-specified prior to performing the updated review, to comply with the current Cochrane recommendations. One of the secondary outcomes, cost of treatments, was no longer included in the updated review because none of the studies in the original review reported this outcome. Two subgroup analyses were pre-specified prior to updating the review, these were fever and patients diagnostic and treatment subgroups.</P>
