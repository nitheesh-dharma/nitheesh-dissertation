<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-12-28 15:45:44 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Kidney disease develops in 25% to 40% of diabetic patients, usually 20 to 25 years after the onset of diabetes. Approximately one third of those with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) will progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and will require long-term dialysis or possibly receive a kidney transplant. Many patients however may die from associated coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular causes before the onset of ESKD. Pentoxifylline has been described as offering properties that may be beneficial for patients with DKD. We reviewed 17 randomised controlled studies, enrolling 991 patients with DKD, which compared pentoxifylline with placebo, routine treatment or antihypertensive drugs.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline significantly reduced serum creatinine (SCr), albuminuria, and overt proteinuria, but not creatinine clearance (CrCl). When compared with routine treatment alone, pentoxifylline did not reduce SCr or blood pressure, but did significantly reduce albuminuria and proteinuria. Compared to captopril or clonidine/methyldopa there was no significant difference in SCr, albuminuria, proteinuria or blood pressure for patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. CrCl was significantly increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa but not with captopril. No data were available on the incidence of ESKD, time to ESKD, quality of life, or all-cause mortality. The adverse events of pentoxifylline were mild; no serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.</P>
<P>Pentoxifylline seemed to have some beneficial effects in improving kidney function and reducing albuminuria and proteinuria (which can indicate kidney health) for patients with DKD, and was not associated with any major adverse effects. However, the current evidence on the effects of pentoxifylline for patients with DKD was insufficient to formulate therapeutic recommendations. More large, high-quality randomised studies are needed to better inform clinical decision making about the use pentoxifylline for patients with DKD.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-12-28 15:37:11 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, mostly relating to cardiovascular complications. The relevance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of DKD has been investigated in recent years, and it has been shown that inflammatory markers are higher in people with DKD compared with the wider population. Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor with favourable anti-inflammatory effects and immunoregulatory properties. The anti-inflammatory effects conferred by pentoxifylline may be beneficial in the management of DKD.<BR/>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:41:49 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register (January 2012), CENTRAL (Issue 12, 2011), MEDLINE, EMBASE and four Chinese biomedical literature databases (CBM-disc, 1979 to July 2009), Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database (VIP, until July 2009), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, until July 2009) and WanFang database (until July 2009).<BR/>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-12-27 13:52:53 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Data were extracted independently by two authors. Meta-analyses were performed when more than one study provided data on a comparable outcome in sufficiently similar patients. Results of dichotomous outcomes were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Mean differences (MD) were calculated to assess the effects of treatment where outcomes were expressed on continuous scales, and standardised mean differences (SMD) calculated where different scales were used. Data was pooled using the random effects model. Adverse effects were assessed using descriptive techniques and where possible, risk differences (RD) with 95% CI.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-12-28 15:44:32 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>We identified 17 studies that included a total of 991 participants with DKD which met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the methodological quality of included studies was low: 4/17 reported the method of randomisation, 13/17 did not; no study described the method of random allocation; 4/17 studies were considered to be at high risk of bias and 13/17 were considered to have unclear risk for incomplete outcome data reporting; 9/17 studies were at low risk bias and in 8/17 the risk of bias was unclear for selective outcome reporting.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline significantly reduced serum creatinine (SCr) (MD -0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.03), albuminuria (SMD -2.28, 95% CI -3.85 to -0.70) and overt proteinuria (MD -428.58 µg/min, 95% CI -661.65 to -195.50), but there was no difference in creatinine clearance (CrCl) (MD -5.18 mL/min, 95% CI -15.55 to 5.19). When compared with routine treatment alone, pentoxifylline did not significantly reduce SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.07) or blood pressure (systolic (SBP): MD -0.28 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.20 to 1.63; diastolic (DBP): MD -0.15 mm Hg, 95% CI -1.44 to 1.14), but did significantly reduce albuminuria (SMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.07) and proteinuria (MD 0.46 g/24 h, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.74). There was no significant difference in SCr (MD 0.00 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.07), albuminuria (MD -8.79 µg/min, 95% CI -27.18 to 9.59), proteinuria (MD -0.01 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01) or blood pressure (SBP: MD 1.46 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.57 to 3.50; DBP: MD 1.37 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.23 to 2.98) between pentoxifylline and the active comparator (captopril or clonidine/methyldopa) for patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. CrCl was significantly increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa (MD 10.90 mL/min, 95% CI -1.40 to 20.40) but not with captopril (MD 3.26 mL/min, 95% CI -1.05 to 7.59). No data were available on the incidence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), time to ESKD, quality of life, or all-cause mortality. The adverse events of pentoxifylline were mild; no serious adverse events were reported in any of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-12-27 15:39:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>From the available evidence, pentoxifylline seems to offer some beneficial effects in renal function improvement and reduction in albuminuria and proteinuria, with no obvious serious adverse effects for patients with DKD. However, most studies were poorly reported, small, and methodologically flawed. Evidence to support the use of pentoxifylline for DKD was insufficient to develop recommendations for its use in this patient population. Rigorously designed, randomised, multicentre, large scale studies of pentoxifylline for DKD are needed to further assess its therapeutic effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:52:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 30% to 40% of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 20 to 25 years after disease onset, and in an increasing percentage (up to 25%) of type 2 diabetes patients, after a variable number of years (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>). DKD is the major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in most western nations and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with other causes of kidney disease (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999b</LINK>). There has been a continuous increase in the incidence of DKD, predominantly among patients with type 2 diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2009</LINK>). The present population of patients whose ESKD was caused by diabetes (which tripled between 1990 and 2000) is expected to increase ten-fold by 2030 to 1.3 million patients (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>). In the USA, diabetes now accounts for 45% of prevalent kidney failure, up from 18% in 1980 (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>). DKD is particularly common among elderly and non-Caucasian (African-American, Asian, and Native American) populations. A similar trend has become evident in other developed countries, which has created global concern about the need to address this major health issue (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>DKD is a major contributor of microvascular complications in patients with diabetes. It is commonly assumed that type 1 and type 2 diabetes share similar pathogenic and clinical stages of kidney damage (<LINK REF="REF-Mogensen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mogensen 1997</LINK>). Patients with diabetes typically experience several characteristic stages in the development of kidney disease: kidney hypertrophy and hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria (incipient kidney disease; urine albumin excretion (UAE) rate 30 to 300 mg/d), macroalbuminuria (overt kidney disease or overt proteinuria; UAE &gt; 300 mg/d) and ESKD. Progression through these stages is accompanied by a high incidence of cardiovascular complications, which account for most deaths among these patients (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2009</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Once ESKD occurs, patient survival is very limited (<LINK REF="REF-Chantrel-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chantrel 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>). In Germany and Australia, the five-year survival rates are 6% and 27% respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 1999a</LINK>). Patients with DKD who develop ESKD enter the highest known cardiovascular risk-state (<LINK REF="REF-McCullough-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCullough 2004</LINK>). However, more people with DKD will die from complications related to cardiovascular disease than progress to ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2011</LINK>). Data from 2011 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) show that the total Medicare costs of reported ESKD was about USD 12.2 billion in 2000 and this figure rapidly rose to USD 24.7 billion in 2009 (<LINK REF="REF-USRDS-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">USRDS 2011</LINK>). These factors justify intensive efforts to prevent and treat DKD.</P>
<P>Management of DKD is typically undertaken at three levels. Patients with no clinical and biochemical signs of kidney damage are targeted for primary prevention of DKD. Clinical and biochemical assessments to establish patients' status in relation to risk of developing DKD are: UAE &lt; 30 mg/d, adherence to strict glycaemic control achieved with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, blood pressure (BP) stable at less than 130/85 mm Hg, and obligatory use of<B> </B>angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) (<LINK REF="REF-Ritz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ritz 2006</LINK>). Secondary prevention aims to prevent or delay progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (overt proteinuria). BP and glycaemic controls are first-line therapies. At this stage, antihypertensive agents in addition to ACEi or ARB may be necessary to achieve optimal BP levels (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2005a</LINK>). Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the rate of progression to kidney failure by controlling BP, reducing dietary protein intake and controlling dyslipidaemia in the presence of a (non-fundamental) euglycaemic state. However, these measures are not wholly effective (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tonolo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tonolo 2006</LINK>). Achieving strict metabolic control is clinically challenging, and this has stimulated identification of additional and alternative treatment options to manage DKD.</P>
<P>Interest in inflammation in diabetes and its role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, including nephropathy, has increased in recent times. Results from several studies have indicated that serum levels of inflammatory markers and UAE levels are higher in patients with diabetes compared with normoalbuminuric individuals (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Festa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festa 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003b</LINK>). Moreover, some studies have shown that inflammatory marker levels increase as kidney disease progresses (<LINK REF="REF-Bruno-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bruno 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Festa-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Festa 2000</LINK>). Inflammation has therefore become an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of kidney injury in diabetes (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro_x002d_Gonzalez-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro-Gonzalez 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rivero-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rivero 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor with favourable effects on microcirculatory blood flow as a result of its haemorrheologic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Ward-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ward 1987</LINK>). Recent studies have shown that pentoxifylline also carries anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. In vivo<I> </I>studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of pentoxifylline in different models of kidney disease, including murine lupus nephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Segal-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Segal 2001</LINK>), crescentic glomerulonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2004</LINK>), and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1999</LINK>). Animal models of DKD have demonstrated significant effects of pentoxifylline in modulating inflammation, cell proliferation, and fibrosis (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2006</LINK>). Pentoxifylline administration attenuated interstitial inflammation, down-regulated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene expression, reduced expression of mitogenic and profibrogenic genes, and suppressed proliferation of interstitial fibroblast and glomerular mesangial cells (<LINK REF="REF-Han-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Han 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lin 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical studies in patients with DKD have also shown that pentoxifylline alone or combined with ACEi or ARB attenuates proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Aminorroaya-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aminorroaya 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guerrero_x002d_Romero-1995b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guerrero-Romero 1995b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyva_x002d_Jimenez-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leyva-Jimenez 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2003d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2003d</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tripathy-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tripathy 1993</LINK>) and reduces inflammatory effects (<LINK REF="REF-Navarro-1999b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Navarro-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navarro 2005b</LINK>). A significant limitation of this evidence is that most studies enrolled small numbers of participants.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK> conducted a meta-analysis that assessed the effect of pentoxifylline on proteinuria in patients with DKD that included 10 RCTs of 476 adult patients who received oral pentoxifylline. The analysis was limited to articles published before the first quarter of 2006 and predominantly looked at the effect of pentoxifylline on proteinuria in DKD patients. The report of the meta-analysis indicated that pentoxifylline may be responsible for decreasing proteinuria in patients with DKD.</P>
<P>The most important goal of DKD treatment is to reduce or delay onset of cardiovascular events and ESKD, and ultimately to prolong survival and improve quality of life. This systematic review of pentoxifylline for DKD aimed to investigate clinically important outcomes at long-term follow-up and provide the best available evidence for clinical practice and further research.</P>

<P>Data extraction was conducted independently by the same two authors using standardised data extraction forms. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Where more than one publication of one study existed, reports were grouped together and the publication with the most complete data was be used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions this data was used. Any discrepancies between published versions were to be highlighted. Where additional information was required from the original author, requests were made by written correspondence and any relevant information obtained in this manner was included in the review.

<P>For dichotomous outcomes (such as incidence of ESKD, all-cause mortality) results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement were used to assess effects of treatment (such as SCr, GFR, proteinuria, and quality of life measures), the mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales were used. Adverse effects were tabulated and assessed using descriptive techniques because they were likely to differ among the various agents. Where possible, risk difference (RD) with 95% CI was calculated for each adverse effect, either compared with no treatment or to another agent.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:25:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>This systematic review of pentoxifylline for DKD included 17 studies that enrolled 991 participants. The studies were conducted in China (five studies), Mexico (four studies), Spain (three studies), Italy (two studies), Turkey, Brazil and Iran (one study in each) and are representative of a wide range of racial, cultural and social groups. The results revealed that:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Compared with placebo, pentoxifylline reduced SCr, microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria in patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD. Pentoxifylline was no different to placebo in improving CrCl. Pentoxifylline significantly decreased SBP and DBP, but only in patients with type 1 DKD.</LI>
<LI>Compared with routine treatment, pentoxifylline did not reduce SCr or BP, but did reduce albuminuria and proteinuria in patients with DKD.</LI>
<LI>There was no significant difference in SCr, albuminuria, proteinuria or BP between pentoxifylline and active comparators (captopril and clonidine/methyldopa) for patients with type 1 or type 2 DKD. There was no significant difference in CrCl between pentoxifylline and captopril but there was significant increase when compared to clonidine/methyldopa.</LI>
<LI>The most commonly reported adverse effects associated with pentoxifylline were headache, dizziness, nausea and dyspepsia. No serious adverse events were reported.</LI>
<LI>There is no current evidence for the use of pentoxifylline when measured in terms of ESKD incidence, time to ESKD, all-cause mortality, and quality of life in patients with type 1 or type 2 DKD.</LI>
</OL>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:27:56 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Proteinuria is an independent predictive factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and progression to ESKD. Decreasing proteinuria is effective in delaying progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Eijkelkamp-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eijkelkamp 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Olsen-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Olsen 2006</LINK>). The most compelling evidence about therapies to delay disease progression points to drugs that intervene in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS). RAAS intervention is a very effective strategy to decrease proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-de-Zeeuw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Zeeuw 2007</LINK>). Nevertheless, a substantial number of patients continue to exhibit proteinuria and progress to ESKD. RAAS intervention can only be prescribed selectively because of risk to patients of developing significant renal artery stenosis and refractory hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pentoxifylline may be a worthwhile additional intervention to help decrease proteinuria in patients with DKD, especially those for whom the RAAS strategy cannot be applied.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Characteristics of participants</HEADING>
<P>Age, diabetes type, stage of DKD, presence of hypertension at study baseline, and renal pathology influenced the effects of pentoxifylline in patients with DKD. We were unable to conduct prespecified subgroup analyses comparing patients with different types of diabetes, baseline proteinuria, BP and renal pathology for each outcome from the available evidence because:</P>
<OL>
<LI>the limited number of studies of pentoxifylline for the specific outcomes;</LI>
<LI>few studies reported diagnostic criteria for DM;</LI>
<LI>the diagnosis of DKD was mainly based on UAE rate. Few studies provided kidney biopsy data or investigated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in participants (a common complication of DM). It was therefore somewhat uncertain that kidney damage was secondary to diabetes; and</LI>
<LI>of variations in inclusion and exclusion criteria among studies.</LI>
</OL>
<P>After stratifying studies based on diabetes type and baseline proteinuria, subgroup analysis indicated that pentoxifylline significantly decreased SBP and DBP in patients with type 1 DKD. A recent meta-analysis of pentoxifylline for DKD found no significant change in BP between pentoxifylline and control group participants (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK> did not conduct subgroup analyses based on diabetes type and baseline proteinuria to assess the BP control properties of pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>We were unable to explain the positive effect in BP control conferred by pentoxifylline on patients with type 1 DKD. Results from the subgroup analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Properties of interventions and comparisons</HEADING>
<P>We were unable to conduct subgroup analyses comparing dose, administration, treatment period and co-interventions for each outcome because there were very few studies of pentoxifylline for specific outcomes, and pentoxifylline was administered intravenously (100 mg/d) in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pang-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Pang 2003</LINK>). All other studies administered oral pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>There was a marked absence of blinding reported in the included studies. Bias may occur in the absence blinding - observers can inadvertently (or not) make errors in measuring data toward an expected outcome, which often favours the treatment group. Placebo response is a related and important indicator in studies that apply subjective outcome measures, such as quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Hrobjartsson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hrobjartsson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rochon-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rochon 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turner-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turner 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walsh-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walsh 2002</LINK>). Our review included nine studies that compared pentoxifylline plus routine treatment with routine treatment, and four comparing pentoxifylline with placebo. We considered that these 13 studies may be prone to bias due to the absence of blinding, which could overestimate the effects of pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>Comparisons of pentoxifylline plus routine treatment with captopril did not report any significant differences in the outcomes of interest, and only CrCl was increased when pentoxifylline was compared to clonidine/methyldopa. It should be noted that these studies were not designed to show equivalence. Therefore, if study outcomes do not show statistical differences (P &gt; 0.05) this does not indicate the existence of equal effectiveness of the studied drugs regarding these outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Routine treatment was not clearly described in the majority of studies. Some routine treatments for diabetes and CKD, such as statin, thiamine and spironolactone, have beneficial effects on kidney function, mortality and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Navaneethan-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Navaneethan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabbani-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabbani 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ustundag-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ustundag 2008</LINK>). If these variables were unevenly distributed between the study and control groups, results may be skewed.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes measures</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Efficacy</HEADING>
<P>The outlook for patients who have both diabetes and CKD is far worse than for either condition individually. DKD is a powerful predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events and death (<LINK REF="REF-KDOQI-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">KDOQI 2007</LINK>). The principal goal of DKD management is to reduce and delay the onset of cardiovascular events and ESKD, and ultimately, to prolong survival and improve quality of life.</P>
<P>Evidence from the included studies focused chiefly on secondary outcomes - SCr, CrCl, albuminuria, proteinuria, BP - which acted as surrogate endpoints. There was a notable absence of data on clinically relevant outcomes such as ESKD incidence, time to ESKD, quality of life, cardiovascular events and mortality at long-term follow-up.</P>
<P>The lack of reliable evidence on primary outcomes meant that we were unable to offer conclusions about the influence of pentoxifylline on DKD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Nine of the included studies reported adverse events. Adverse events associated with pentoxifylline for DKD were few in number and mild in severity. However, these results are not conclusive and care should be exercised in their interpretation. The pool of evidence was small and flawed: overall, studies were short in duration and included relatively few participants; follow-up data were sparse; and adverse events were not reported in adequate detail.</P>
<P>Larger samples and long-term follow-up studies are needed to reliably assess and quantify the possibility of rare, but potentially devastating, adverse events.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-03-14 14:46:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Overall, evidence appeared to show that pentoxifylline had beneficial effects in improving kidney function and reducing albuminuria and proteinuria with absence of serious adverse events for patients with type 1 or type 2 DKD. These results are however based on a small and methodologically flawed evidence base and should be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>In general evidence quality was low. Randomisation methods were adequately reported in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Moran-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Moran 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Moran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Moran 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Navarro-2005a" TYPE="STUDY">Navarro 2005a</LINK>), but allocation concealment was either absent or poorly reported in all studies. Blinding of participants and outcome assessors was reported in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Leyva_x002d_Jimenez-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leyva-Jimenez 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Moran-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Moran 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rodriguez_x002d_Moran-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Rodriguez-Moran 2006</LINK>). Four studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Guerrero_x002d_Romero-1995a" TYPE="STUDY">Guerrero-Romero 1995a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leyva_x002d_Jimenez-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Leyva-Jimenez 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sui-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Sui 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zang-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zang 1999</LINK>), and 13 studies presented unclear risk of bias.</P>
<P>It is generally accepted that methodologically flawed studies show larger differences between experimental and control groups than rigorously designed and executed studies (<LINK REF="REF-Kjaergard--1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kjaergard 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). An analysis of sources of bias reported that inadequate or unclear concealment netted higher estimates of treatment effects (P &lt; 0.001) than studies that reported application of appropriate concealment methods. These effects were amplified when odds ratios were considered (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wood-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood 2008</LINK>). Odds ratios were amplified by 41% in studies that inadequately allocation concealment, and by 30% in studies in which allocation concealment was unclear (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The plausibility of evidence overall was not robust. Sensitivity analyses could not be conducted meaningfully because of study quality and power deficits. Definitive conclusions on the efficacy of pentoxifylline for DKD cannot be drawn from the current evidence.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-12-27 14:48:56 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>The major limitations of this review are related to weaknesses inherent in the available published studies on pentoxifylline for DKD. Publication bias could not be assessed because of the limited numbers of studies for each outcome. Although we undertook extensive literature searches, we could not exclude the possibility that studies with negative findings remain unpublished.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:31:13 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Our review found that pentoxifylline for patients with DKD was associated with a significant decrease in albuminuria or proteinuria. This result was consistent with findings reported in a recent meta-analysis that investigated the effect of pentoxifylline on proteinuria in patients with DKD (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK>). Our finding that beneficial effects were conferred by pentoxifylline on kidney function and BP control were not observed in the <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK> meta-analysis. This inconsistency may be attributable to differences in included studies and analytical methods.</P>
<P>Our analysis, which stratified studies based on comparison type, found that compared to placebo (four studies), pentoxifylline significantly reduced SCr, microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria in patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD; and significantly decreased SBP and DBP, but only in patients with type 1 DKD, but this benefit was not observed in studies that compared pentoxifylline plus routine treatment with routine treatment alone (nine studies). <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK> reported pooled estimates of kidney function and BP that were derived from 10 studies that involved two comparisons: pentoxifylline plus routine treatment versus placebo plus routine treatment; and pentoxifylline plus routine treatment versus routine treatment.</P>
<P>Both reviews found that there was no difference between pentoxifylline and ACEi in decreasing proteinuria, preserving kidney function and controlling BP. The meta-regression analysis presented in <LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2008</LINK> indicated that baseline proteinuria and study duration, but not pentoxifylline dose, were significantly associated with change in proteinuria.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-12-27 14:50:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Although pentoxifylline may confer positive effects on kidney function, albuminuria and proteinuria levels, with a low adverse event profile. However the poor methodological quality of included studies, the small number of patients enrolled, and likelihood of publication bias, provided insufficient evidence to support the routine use of pentoxifylline for treating patients with type 1 and type 2 DKD.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-10 14:31:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Ann Jones">
<P>Promising results and a favourable side effects profile warrant further research in the use of pentoxifylline for DKD. Larger studies are needed to confirm the available evidence. Design and execution of methodological approach needs to ensure that studies are adequately powered, and protocols dictating randomisation, allocation and concealment are rigorously applied and reported in detail. Investigators should clearly describe their intention-to-treat rationale and analysis. Reasons for participants' withdrawal or discontinuation must be clearly described in detail. Participants' characteristics should be consistently collected, measured and reported, and include age, sex, diagnostic criteria applied to define DM and DKD, time since diagnosis, and any comorbid conditions.</P>
<P>Studies should be designed to examine the efficacy of pentoxifylline in different subgroups according to: age, type, stage and duration of DKD. In addition the should investigate the effect of different doses, administration (oral and IV) and duration of treatment. Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardised monitoring or an effective self-report system. Attention should be paid to rare, severe adverse events relevant to pentoxifylline.</P>
<P>The importance of long-term follow-up should be emphasised. Clinically important outcome measures identified as part of long-term follow-up, such as ESKD incidence, time to ESKD, cardiovascular events, quality of life and mortality, should be collected, analysed and reported in detail.</P>
