<P>
<B>Review question:</B> Does feeding preterm infants formula enriched with extra nutrients versus standard formula (designed for term infants) after hospital discharge increase growth rate and improve development?</P>
<P>
<B>Background:</B> By the time preterm infants are ready to go home from the hospital after receiving care since birth, many are smaller and weigh less than they would have had they stayed in the womb instead of being born early. It may be that feeding preterm infants a formula enriched with extra nutrients (rather than standard formula used to feed term infants) helps them grow more quickly (and catch up with infants born at term) while improving their development.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics:</B> We identified 16 eligible trials enrolling a total of 1251 infants through searches updated to 8 September 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings:</B> These trials provide moderate-quality evidence that unrestricted feeding with nutrient-enriched (vs standard) formula does not have important effects on growth and development up to about 18 months of age. Long-term growth and development have not yet been assessed.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions:</B> Current recommendations to prescribe nutrient-enriched formula for preterm infants after hospital discharge are not supported by available evidence.</P>

<P>We included 16 eligible trials with a total of 1251 infant participants. Trials were of variable methodological quality, with lack of allocation concealment and incomplete follow-up identified as major potential sources of bias. Trials (N = 11) that compared feeding infants with 'postdischarge formula' (energy density about 74 kcal/100 mL) versus standard term formula (about 67 kcal/100 mL) did not find consistent evidence of effects on growth parameters up to 12 to 18 months post term. GRADE assessments indicated that evidence was of moderate quality, and that inconsistency within pooled estimates was the main quality issue.</P>
<P>Trials (N = 5) that compared feeding with 'preterm formula' (about 80 kcal/100 mL) versus term formula found evidence of higher rates of growth throughout infancy (weighted mean differences at 12 to 18 months post term: about 500 g in weight, 5 to 10 mm in length, 5 mm in head circumference). GRADE assessments indicated that evidence was of moderate quality, and that imprecision of estimates was the main quality issue.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:10:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Compared with term infants, preterm infants have limited nutrient reserves at birth. Also, preterm infants, especially very preterm and very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, are subject to a variety of physiological and metabolic stresses that increase their nutrient needs. Recommended nutrient requirements for preterm infants are based on intrauterine growth studies and assume that the optimal rate of postnatal growth should be about the same as that of uncompromised fetuses of an equivalent postmenstrual age. Evidence indicates, however, that recommended target levels of nutrient input are rarely achieved in practice, and that most very preterm or VLBW infants accumulate significant energy, protein, mineral and other nutrient deficits during their initial hospital stay (<LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2001</LINK>). By the time they are ready to go home, typically at around 36 to 40 weeks' postmenstrual age, many infants are substantially growth-restricted relative to their term-born peers (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2003;</LINK> <LINK REF="REF-Dusick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dusick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1984</LINK>).</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:00:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>After hospital discharge, responsively (demand) fed preterm infants often consume relatively more milk than term infants to attain 'catch-up' growth (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992a</LINK>). Despite this, growth deficits can persist through childhood and adolescence (<LINK REF="REF-Bracewell-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bracewell 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Farooqi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farooqi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ford-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ford 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Trebar-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Trebar 2007</LINK>). Slow or incomplete catch-up growth is associated with higher risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in later childhood, and with poorer cognitive and educational outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hack-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leppanen-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leppanen 2014</LINK>). Preterm infants who have accumulated mineral deficits have higher risks of metabolic bone disease and slower skeletal growth compared with infants born at term, although uncertainty remains about long-term effects of such deficits on bone mass and health (<LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2011</LINK>). Furthermore, nutritional deficiency and growth restriction in utero and during early infancy may have consequences for long-term metabolic and cardiovascular health (<LINK REF="REF-Embleton-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Embleton 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lapillonne-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lapillonne 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:09:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Because slow or incomplete catch-up growth is associated with prolonged growth restriction and slower neurodevelopmental progression, attention has focused on nutritional interventions that might promote growth during the putative &#8216;critical window&#8217; of early infancy in the post-hospital discharge period. Two broad strategies for nutritional interventions are known (<LINK REF="REF-Dusick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dusick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fewtrell-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fewtrell 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klingenberg-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingenberg 2011</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Multi-nutrient fortification of expressed milk for infants fed with human breast milk.</LI>
<LI>Nutrient-enriched formula for formula-fed infants.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Another Cochrane review addresses the question of whether multi-nutrient fortification of human breast milk affects growth and development in preterm infants after hospital discharge (<LINK REF="REF-McCormick-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCormick 2013</LINK>). This review focuses on the comparison of nutrient-enriched formula versus standard formula for formula-fed preterm infants after hospital discharge.</P>
<P>A variety of standard and nutrient-enriched formula preparations are available (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2007</LINK>). These can be categorised broadly as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>standard term formula: designed for term infants, based on the composition of mature human breast milk. The typical energy content is 66 to 68 kcal/100 mL. The concentration of protein - approximately 1.4 to 1.7 g/100 mL - and calcium and phosphate content (about 50 mg/100 mL and 30 mg/100 mL, respectively) are not sufficient to satisfy recommended nutrient needs for stable and growing preterm infants;</LI>
<LI>postdischarge formula: specifically designed for preterm infants post discharge from the hospital. These are energy (about 72 to 74 kcal/100 mL) and protein (about 1.8 to 1.9 g/100 mL) enriched and are variably enriched with minerals, vitamins and trace elements compared with standard term formula. Expert bodies and authorities recommend these formulas for preterm infants for three to 12 months post discharge (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 2006</LINK>); and</LI>
<LI>preterm formula: energy-enriched (about 80 kcal/100 mL), protein-enriched (2.0 to 2.4 g/100 mL) and variably enriched with minerals, vitamins and trace elements to support intrauterine nutrient accretion rates. These formulas are commonly used for nutrition of preterm infants before hospital discharge and generally are not recommended for postdischarge feeding.</LI>
</UL>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-11-18 03:28:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Feeding preterm infants after hospital discharge formula enriched with extra energy, protein, minerals and vitamins may be expected to promote rapid catch-up growth. However, because preterm infants fed in response to hunger and satiation cues (demand or responsive feeding) adjust their volume of intake according to the energy density of formula, infants may consume less nutrient-enriched milk than standard formula (<LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1992a</LINK>). Consequently, infants fed responsively with preterm or postdischarge formula may not receive any more energy (or other nutrients, depending on the nutrient:energy ratio) than infants fed standard term formula.</P>
<P>Feeding of nutrient-enriched formula may be associated with disordered gastric motility and emptying (<LINK REF="REF-Hancock-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancock 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siegel-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siegel 1984</LINK>). Nutrient-enriched formula may therefore be poorly tolerated, thereby reducing nutrient delivery and potentially removing any benefit for growth and development. Furthermore, catch-up growth with accelerated weight gain and crossing of body mass index (BMI) percentiles might be associated with altered fat distribution and related &#8216;programmed&#8217; metabolic consequences that may increase the risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Euser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Euser-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hack-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saigal-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saigal 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>We assessed the quality of evidence for the main comparison at the outcome level by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011a</LINK>), which considers evidence from randomised controlled trials as of high quality that may be downgraded on the basis of consideration of any of five areas.</P>

<LI>Consistency across studies.</LI>
<LI>Directness of the evidence.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect but may be substantially different.</LI>
<LI>Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Two review authors assessed independently the quality of the evidence for outcomes identified as critical or important for clinical decision making (growth, development).</P>
<P>In cases for which we considered risk of bias to arise from inadequate concealment of allocation, randomised assignment, complete follow-up or blinded outcome assessment, to reduce our confidence in the effect estimates, we downgraded the quality of evidence accordingly (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011b</LINK>). We evaluated consistency on the basis of similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals and statistical criteria, including measurement of heterogeneity (I²). We downgraded the quality of evidence when inconsistency across study results was large and unexplained (i.e. some studies suggested important benefit, and others no effect or harm with no explanation) (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011c</LINK>). We assessed precision accordingly with the 95% confidence interval (CI) around the pooled estimation (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011d" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011d</LINK>). When trials were conducted in populations other than the target population, we downgraded the quality of evidence because of indirectness (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2011e" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2011e</LINK>).</P>
<P>We entered data (pooled estimates of effects and 95% CIs) and explicit judgements for each of the above aspects assessed into the Guideline Development Tool, the software used to create 'Summary of findings (SoF)' tables (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro 2008</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:03:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 885 participants provided no evidence that feeding postdischarge formula (~74 kcal/100 mL) versus standard term formula (~67 kcal/100 mL) to preterm infants after hospital discharge affects growth parameters up to 12 to 18 months post term.</P>
<P>The five trials that examined the effect of feeding preterm formula (~80 kcal/100 mL) versus standard term formula provided some evidence of an effect on growth parameters. Meta-analyses showed a weighted mean difference of about 500 g for weight, 11 mm for length and 5 to 6 mm for head circumference at 12 to 18 months post term. It is not yet known whether any of these differences persist through later childhood.</P>
<P>Evidence of the effects of nutrient-enriched formula on long-term development is unclear. The only trial of postdischarge versus term formula conducted to assess developmental outcomes showed no difference in the Bayley Scales Mental or Psychomotor Development Index assessed at 18 months' corrected age (<LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2001</LINK>). Similarly, meta-analyses of data from two trials provided no evidence that feeding preterm versus term formula affects neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months' corrected age. Data on longer-term cognitive and educational outcomes are not yet available.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:04:53 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 11 eligible trials that compared feeding with postdischarge formula versus term formula, but studies generally were small and of variable methodological quality. Quantitative synthesis was limited, as only seven of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Litmanovitz-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Litmanovitz 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lucas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lucas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roggero-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Roggero 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roggero-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Roggero 2012</LINK>) presented data that could be included in meta-analyses of growth outcomes. Interpretation of meta-analyses was further limited by heterogeneity. The source of heterogeneity is not clear, as these trials were of similar design (intervention given for six to 12 months) and methodological quality (satisfactory processes to ensure allocation concealment and achievement of about 70% to 80% follow-up at longer than six months post term). Meta-analyses of data from the five trials that compared preterm formula versus term formula were more complete and revealed no statistical heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Differences in measured effects on growth parameters between postdischarge formula and preterm formula may simply be related to total nutrient content and intake. An additional factor is that whereas postdischarge formula contains about 10% more calories and 20% to 25% more protein and bone minerals than term formula, preterm formula is about 20% energy-enriched and contains 40% to 60% more protein and minerals than term formula. Demand (responsively) fed infants regulate their volume of milk intake relative to its calorie density; therefore, infants in comparison groups may have had similar total energy intake. However, infants fed postdischarge formula would still have received about 10% more protein and minerals than those fed term formula, but infants fed preterm formula would have received up to about 25% more protein and minerals than those given term formula. It is possible that protein and mineral intake (per unit of energy) is the key factor in determining catch-up growth rates and, specifically, lean and skeletal growth, in this population of infants.</P>
<P>The applicability of currently available data is limited by the short duration of follow-up reported in clinical trials. No trials planned to undertake or undertook assessment of growth or development beyond 12 to 18 months' corrected age, and some trials reported growth outcomes only up to six months. Similarly, no trials have reported data related to possible adverse metabolic consequences of nutrient supplementation in early infancy, nor to any long-term measures of obesity (such as body mass index (BMI), fat mass) or risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as elevated blood pressure).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-11-17 02:08:39 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Interpretation of review findings is limited by methodological weaknesses associated with potential for bias in some trials (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). Methods used to preserve allocation concealment are uncertain for some trials. Only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Jeon-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jeon 2011</LINK>) reported substantial between-group differences in baseline demographics that are likely due to allocation bias. We elected to exclude one arm of this three-arm trial because of substantial differences in mean birth weight, gestational age and proportion of growth-restricted infants. The other methodological limitation apparent in six trials was incomplete outcome assessment (loss to follow-up &gt; 20%). In most of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Atkinson-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Atkinson 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Koo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Peng-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Peng 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Picaud-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Picaud 2005</LINK>), loss to follow-up was less than 30% and was distributed evenly between intervention and control groups. In two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Agosti-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Agosti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Carver-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Carver 2001</LINK>), loss to follow-up at 12-month assessment was greater than 50%. However, these trials did not contribute substantially to any meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The GRADE assessment revealed that evidence for key growth outcomes was of moderate quality because of inconsistency (moderate or high heterogeneity in meta-analyses of trials of postdischarge formula vs standard formula; <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>) and imprecision (few trials with low numbers of participants included in meta-analyses of preterm formula vs standard formula; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-11-17 02:11:05 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our main concern with the review process is that findings may be subject to publication and other reporting biases, including greater availability of numerical data for inclusion in meta-analyses from trials that reported statistically significant or clinically important effects (<LINK REF="REF-Hopewell-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hopewell 2009</LINK>). We attempted to minimise this threat by searching the proceedings of major international perinatal conferences to identify trial reports that were not (or were not yet) published in full form in academic journals. However, we cannot be sure whether other trials have been undertaken but not reported, and we remain concerned that such trials are less likely than published trials to have detected statistically significant or clinically important effects. The meta-analyses that we performed did not include sufficient trials to explore the symmetry of funnel plots as a means of identifying possible publication or reporting bias.</P>

<P>These findings do not support expert group and consensus recommendations that formula-fed preterm infants should receive a postdischarge formula for up to 12 months after discharge from the hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Aggett-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aggett 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhatia-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhatia 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carver-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carver 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dusick-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dusick 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffin-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffin 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kleinman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kleinman 2004</LINK>). In contrast, available trial data indicate that feeding with 'preterm formula', which generally is licensed and available only for in-hospital use, may increase weight, length and head circumference growth up to 12 to 18 months post term.</P>
<P>Infants who participated in the trials included in this review were fed responsively (on demand), and study findings may not be applicable to infants who cannot feed responsively, for example, because of oro-motor dysmotility or chronic lung disease.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-11-18 04:08:34 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Follow-up of infants who participated in the trials identified in this review might provide further data on the effect of this intervention on growth through later childhood, specifically, whether final height is affected; on effects on later neurodevelopmental outcomes; and on long-term effects on metabolic or cardiovascular outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Euser-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Euser 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2007</LINK>). If additional large randomised controlled trials are undertaken to evaluate the effects of feeding preterm infants with nutrient-enriched formula after hospital discharge, it may be appropriate to include in these research efforts preterm infants who are not able to feed ad libitum after hospital discharge, and who have extra metabolic demands, for example, because of severe growth restriction or chronic lung disease. Trials should aim to assess long-term clinically important outcomes such as final height and body composition and neurodevelopment (including cognitive and educational outcomes).</P>
<P>Further research is needed to determine which specific nutrients (including appropriate energy:protein balance) are key to promoting lean mass and linear growth and to improving developmental outcomes. As a first step, it may be worthwhile to review systematically trials that could not be included in this review because the nutrient-enriched formula examined differed only in protein and mineral content (but not in energy) from standard term formula.</P>

<P>Initially, 3 groups were randomly allocated to receive (1) standard term formula, (2) preterm formula for 3 months or (3) preterm formula for 6 months. However, results showed substantial and significant between-group differences in baseline demographic characteristics, especially between group (3) and the other groups. Group (3) infants had statistically significantly lower birth weight and were more likely to be small for gestational age.
