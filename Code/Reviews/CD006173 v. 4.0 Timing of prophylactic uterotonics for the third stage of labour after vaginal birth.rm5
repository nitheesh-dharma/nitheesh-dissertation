<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:13:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Active management of the third stage of labour has been shown to reduce the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. It usually involves clamping and cutting the cord, administration of uterotonic drugs and controlled cord traction (inserting pressure on the uterus and pulling the cord mainly with the sign of placental separation). Although active management has been shown to reduce the risk of postpartum haemorrhage, it may have an impact on the well-being of the mother and baby in terms of the amount of blood that has been transfused to the baby before the separation of the placenta. The optimum timing of uterotonic administration (before or after placental expulsion) can have a major role in this process and it has not been systematically investigated previously. This review of three trials (1671 participants) found that routine administration of oxytocin with the anterior shoulder compared with use of oxytocin after delivery of the placenta did not have any influence on the amount of bleeding postpartum or retained placenta. The route of administration of oxytocin in two of the three included studies was through intravenous infusion. Cord management at delivery was consistent with double clamping and immediate cutting after delivery of the baby. Application of controlled cord traction was slightly different among the included studies. In two of the studies, the placenta was delivered with controlled cord traction when signs of placental separation were present. Fundal pressure on the uterus was used in one study from the beginning to ensure continued uterine contraction. Oxytocin was the only uterotonic assessed. There were no assessments of any impact on neonatal health. More well designed studies using consistent approaches in this area of the management of the third stage of labour are required.</P>

<P>We included three trials involving 1671 participants; oxytocin was the only uterotonic drug that was used. The dose and route of administration of oxytocin varied among the included studies. Administration of oxytocin before and after the expulsion of placenta does not significantly influence the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss greater than 500 ml) (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.04; n = 1667, three trials); retained placenta (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.11; n = 1667, three trials); length of third stage of labour (minutes) (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.95 to 0.36; n = 1667, three trials); postpartum blood loss (ml) (MD 22.32, 95% CI -58.21 to 102.86; n = 181, two trials); changes in haemoglobin (g/dL) (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.72; n = 51, one trial); blood transfusion (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.73; n = 1667, three trials); the use of additional uterotonics (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.52; n = 1667, three trials); the incidence of maternal hypotension (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 26.70; n = 130, one trial) and the incidence of severe postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss 1000 ml or more) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.98; n = 130, one trial). No data on other maternal or neonatal outcome measures were available.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:12:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Administration of oxytocin before and after the expulsion of placenta did not have any significant influence on many clinically important outcomes such as the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, rate of placental retention and the length of the third stage of labour. However, the number of available studies were limited. The only uterotonic drug used was oxytocin, mainly through intravenous infusion, therefore its extrapolation to other routes of administration should be interpreted cautiously. More studies are required to examine other maternal and neonatal outcomes using consistent approaches.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:14:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The delivery of the placenta after childbirth can be a critical stage in relation to maternal and neonatal well-being. It is managed in a number of different ways, ranging from active (including early clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord, administration of oxytocic drugs and controlled cord traction) to totally physiological (expectant) with no interventions at all. Different aspects of the management may also be combined in a piecemeal way, which is not recommended based on the current available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Gyte-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gyte 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The routine prophylactic use of oxytocics such as oxytocin or combined oxytocin/ergometrine (syntometrine) has been shown to reduce the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>). The timing of the administration of oxytocic drugs, however, varies greatly among practitioners. The main recommended approach in the active management is to administer relevant drugs at the delivery of the anterior shoulder. This, however, can make the process complicated in many busy maternity units and increases the demand for having more than one healthcare professional present at the time of birth. In the practical setting, many clinicians use oxytocics immediately after the birth of the baby. There are others who administer the oxytocic drugs at the crowning of the head or even after the delivery of the placenta (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>). The latter is mainly reported in the American literature and it is believed to reduce the risk of placental retention (<LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK>). The timing of oxytocic drugs can potentially impact on the blood perfusion to the baby and on the amount of maternal blood loss at the time of delivery. In addition, although there are no studies evaluating the transfusion of oxytocic drugs through the placenta or no reported evidence of any harmful effects on the baby, this may be a concern for some women. It is therefore, pertinent to include outcome measures which reflect the immediate well-being of the neonate (Apgar scores) or haemodynamic indicators (for example, maternal blood pressure and haemoglobin changes). It is also important to note that there is a great deal of interaction between different components of the active third stage management. The outcomes such as PPH or neonatal haemoglobin level may be influenced by the combination of the timing of oxytocic administration as well as the timing of cord clamping. Therefore, when synthesising or interpreting the results, special attention should be given to these confounding factors.</P>
<P>A number of Cochrane reviews have compared specific uterotonic agents (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2004</LINK>) or the whole package of different types of care (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2004</LINK>); however, evaluation of the individual aspects of the management of the third stage of labour rarely occurs. The timing of cord clamping (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>) and the effects of cord drainage (<LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2005</LINK>) have both been systematically reviewed. The timing of cord clamping had no effect on the risk of PPH. For the neonate however, there was a significantly improved iron status up to six months of age and a possible increased risk of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, in delayed cord clamping compared with early cord clamping. The results of the latter review showed a potential reduction in the length of the third stage of labour; however, the limited and heterogenous information available made it difficult to reach a conclusive statement. The timing of oxytocic administration, which can potentially influence maternal blood loss, neonatal blood volume or haemodynamics, as well as the resources needed at the time of birth, has not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this review was therefore, to examine the effect of the timing of the administration of uterotonic drugs being administered before or after placental delivery, on various aspects of the third stage of labour and the postnatal period.</P>

<P>We identified no cluster-randomised trials in this review.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of this intervention, cluster-randomisation is unlikely. However, if we identify such trials in future updates of this review we will include them in the analyses along with individually randomised trials. We will adjust their<I> </I>standard errors<I> </I>using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources are used, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a separate meta-analysis.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:10:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis. In addition, we designed all outcome analyses to be on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator for each outcome in each trial would be the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing. For included studies, we have noted levels of attrition. All included studies had a low attrition rate (5% or less), hence we classed these as high quality and have carried out no sensitivity analyses.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:17:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The search identified seven trial reports (of six studies). We included three trials (four reports) involving 1671 participants in this review. We excluded three trials. For more information about included and excluded studies see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Of the seven reports that we initially identified, three were full article publications (<LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zamora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zamora 1999</LINK>) and the other four were abstracts (<LINK REF="REF-Huh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huh 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schemmer-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Schemmer 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tharakan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tharakan 2007</LINK>). One abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Huh-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Huh 2000</LINK>) is an additional report of <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK>. We excluded the other three abstracts because there were insufficient data to identify the details of study design, methodology and quality in relation to the randomisation process and sequence generation. Attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Schaefer-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Schaefer 2004</LINK> included women who had caesarean section in their study and <LINK REF="STD-Tharakan-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Tharakan 2007</LINK> with an attrition rate of 35% and lack of adequate information to assess its quality, made them inappropriate for inclusion in this review.</P>
<P>The dose and route of administration of oxytocin varied among the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Zamora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zamora 1999</LINK> used 20 units of oxytocin infusion in a 1000 ml solution, given intravenously anytime after the birth of the fetal anterior shoulder (but before the delivery of the placenta) compared to the same process of administering oxytocin after the birth of the placenta. <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK> administered 20 units of oxytocin in a 500 ml crystalloid intravenous bolus, beginning upon delivery of fetal anterior shoulder compared to the same, after delivery of the placenta. <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK> administered 10 units of oxytocin intramuscularly at delivery of fetal anterior shoulder compared to the same procedure immediately after placental delivery.</P>
<P>Both <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK> were double blinded studies and employed active management of third stage of labour in a similar manner, involving uterine massage and controlled cord traction. <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK> stated that they clamped the cord within 30 seconds with the infant at the level of perineum, accompanied with intermittent controlled cord traction and uterine massage upon signs of placental separation. <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK> applied a gentle traction from the beginning of the third stage with a greater traction after the signs of placental separation. <LINK REF="STD-Zamora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zamora 1999</LINK> have also clamped the cord within the first 30 seconds of infant's birth and applied controlled cord traction after signs of placental separation with no mention of uterine massage.</P>
<P>In all studies, retained placenta was defined as a third stage duration of 30 minutes or longer. <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK> measured the haemoglobin changes from admission to labour until second postpartum day and <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK> measured the changes from routinely collected blood samples at 36 weeks (if not available on admission to labour) to at least 12 hours postpartum. But the latter reported the results as percentages of women with a change in Hb of 2g/dl or more, which was not in the format appropriate for this review. Blood loss was objectively measured and converted to blood volume in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK>. Augmentation and use of oxytocin (other than as part of the study intervention) has been reported as a confounding factor by both studies. <LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK> explained that if a participant's labour was augmented with oxytocin, the agent was discontinued at the beginning of the third stage of labour.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:18:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The first two included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Huh-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Huh 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jackson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jackson 2001</LINK>) were placebo, double blinded randomised controlled trials and their attrition rates were well below 20% due to randomising women at delivery. <LINK REF="STD-Zamora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zamora 1999</LINK> did not use the blinding technique for participants or healthcare professionals (acknowledging the difficulty of such approaches) but the doctors who measured the blood loss were different from those who were involved in the study and were blind to the process. Their attrition rate was 3%. The quality of all three studies according to their allocation concealment were adequately high, as they used a centrally generated randomisation with opaque coded envelops. The reported haemoglobin levels seems to be too high in <LINK REF="STD-Zamora-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Zamora 1999</LINK>; therefore, we have not added this outcome to the analysis. They reported mean differences (±SD) (g/dl) between Hb levels measured at admission and 24 hours after delivery for each group (oxytocin before and after delivery) as 16.20 (±14.21) and 20.20 (±17.17) respectively.

<P>Oxytocin was the only uterotonic drug that has been the subject of available studies with data from a total of 1667 participants. The results show that administration of oxytocin before and after expulsion of placenta does not significantly influence the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss 500 ml or more) (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.04; n = 1667, three trials); retained placenta (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.11; n = 1667, three trials); length of third stage of labour (minutes) (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% CI -0.95 to 0.36; n = 1667, three trials); postpartum blood loss (ml) (MD 22.32, 95% CI -58.21 to 102.86; n = 181, two trials); changes in haemoglobin (g/dL) (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.72; n = 51, one trial); blood transfusion (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.73; n = 1667, three trials); the use of additional uterotonics (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.52; n = 1667, three trials); the incidence of maternal hypotension (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 26.70; n = 130, one trial) and the incidence of severe postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss 1000 ml or more) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.98; n = 130, one trial).

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:20:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The results of this review indicate that administration of oxytocin before and after placental expulsion does not significantly influence major clinical outcomes such as the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). This is particularly important since other systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Cotter-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cotter 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prendiville-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prendiville 2000</LINK>) have shown a trend towards an increased rate of placental retention when the third stage of labour is actively managed in which the uterotonic drugs were administered prior to or at the beginning of the third stage of labour in women of low risk of haemorrhage. <LINK REF="REF-Hutton-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hutton 2007</LINK>, in their review of late versus early cord clamping, suggested that there is an increased possibility of neonatal polycythaemia (although clinically benign) which could be due to the administration of uterotonic drugs prior to cord clamping. Administration of oxytocin after the expulsion of placenta has the advantage of reducing the risk of over-infusion of placental blood to the baby. Previous evidence (<LINK REF="REF-McDonald-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDonald 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rabe-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rabe 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soltani-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soltani 2005</LINK>) have shown beneficial effects in delaying cord clamping or in cord drainage, and the use of oxytocin after the third stage of labour can add to these benefits in normalising the birth process while preserving the known prophylactic effects of such interventions.</P>
<P>In this review, administration of oxytocin before or after the placental delivery had no significant effect on the length of the third stage of labour (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). This is an interesting observation and it may indicate that other components of the active management of the third stage of labour, used routinely in the included studies such as CCT or uterine massage, may have a more significant role in reducing the third stage of labour than administration of oxytocin. These results should be considered within a context that the two major included studies in this review, have used oxytocin through intravenous (IV) infusion and its extrapolation to the conventional route of oxytocin administration (intramuscular) needs further investigation.</P>
<P>All three included studies are of a high quality in terms of methodological rigour; however, the number of available studies in this area is limited. The lack of significant results in this review may well be due to the small number of available studies. It is also noteworthy that the majority of participants included in this review had IV infusion of oxytocin. The effect of administration of intramuscular uterotonic drugs before and after delivery of placenta should be further investigated. In addition, none of the available studies provided information on the neonatal outcomes.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-05-27 14:51:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The reported studies demonstrated no statistically significant risk of postpartum haemorrhage by waiting until after the delivery of the placenta to administer the oxytocic drugs. However, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution in the clinical setting, due to the relatively small sample sizes of the included studies. Giving the uterotonic drug after delivery of the placenta removes any risk to the baby of excessive transfer of placental blood during delayed cord clamping.<BR/>
</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-06-16 09:10:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Large well designed studies with a consistent approach in relation to the type of the uterotonic drug and its route of administration, the use of uterine massage and CCT are required to shed light on this clinically important aspect of the third stage management of labour. There should also be specific attention to neonatal outcomes such as jaundice.</P>
