<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-13 15:33:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Cardenolides, sometimes referred to as cardiac glycosides or cardioactive steroids, are naturally occurring plant toxins which act primarily on the heart (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 2002</LINK>). The most well known are the digitalis cardenolides (digoxin and digitoxin) which are used therapeutically for the treatment of cardiac failure. Poisoning with digitalis cardenolides are reported worldwide and require admission to a coronary care unit (if available) to monitor for significant cardiotoxicity, and administration of antidotes such as anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin, as needed. Case fatality ratios up to 20% have been reported, and severe toxicity may not occur until 24 hours post-admission for digoxin, or up to five days for digitoxin poisonings (<LINK REF="REF-Taboulet-1993a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taboulet 1993a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Cardiotoxicity is reported from other cardenolides also, in particular yellow oleander (<I>Thevetia peruviana</I>) and pink or white oleander (<I>Nerium oleander</I>), as well as the sea mango tree (<I>Cerbera manghas</I>). The oleander plants are found commonly through much of the tropics and subtropics around houses and gardens (<LINK REF="REF-Langford-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Langford 1996</LINK>). These cardenolides are structurally similar to digitalis, and treatments for digitalis poisoning such as the anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin have been trialled in the management of acute poisoning with these cardenolides (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2000</LINK>). In parts of India and Sri Lanka, yellow oleander has become a popular means of self harm with tens of thousands of cases in South Asia each year, and probably hundreds of deaths given the case fatality ratio of 5 to 10%. Further, significant dysrhythmias may be delayed for up to 72 hours post ingestion, requiring prolonged hospital admissions (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>). Unfortunately, because the anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin is expensive, it is not readily available worldwide, particularly in developing countries where poisonings with these cardenolides are common (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2003</LINK>). As such, the management of patients with severe cardenolide poisoning is generally difficult and costly in countries with limited resources.</P>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2008-10-13 15:33:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>A number of specific treatments for cardenolide poisoning have been either used or recommended, including atropine, isoprenaline (isoproterenol), multiple-dose activated charcoal, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxins. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of all these treatments. The benefit of these treatments in the context of cost is also of high interest as most poisonings occur in developing countries where resources are very limited (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>Since there is evidence that the quality of allocation concealment particularly affects the results of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>), the authors scored quality on the scale used by Schulz as shown below, assigning C to poorest quality and A to best quality:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A = trials deemed to have taken adequate measures to conceal allocation (that is, central randomisation; serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes; or other description that contained elements convincing of concealment).</LI>
<LI>B = trials in which the authors either did not report an allocation concealment approach at all or reported an approach that did not fall into one of the other categories.</LI>
<LI>C = trials in which concealment was inadequate (such as alternation or reference to case record numbers or to dates of birth).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The overall quality of each trial was independently assessed by both authors according to the method of Jadad using the following criteria, where the maximum possible score for any study is 5/5: (<LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK>)<BR/>

<LI>Randomly assigned: A method to generate the sequence of randomisation will be regarded as appropriate if it allowed each study participant to have the same chance of receiving each intervention and the investigators could not predict which treatment was next. This criteria is scored when the method to generate the sequence of randomisation was described (one point) and it was appropriate (table of random numbers, computer generated, etc) (one point).</LI>
<LI>Double blind: A study must be regarded as double blind if the word "double blind" is used. The method will be regarded as appropriate if it is stated that neither the person doing the assessments nor the study participant could identify the intervention being assessed, or if in the absence of such a statement the use of active placebos, identical placebos, or dummies is mentioned. This criteria is scored when the method of double blinding was described (one point) and it was appropriate (one point).</LI>

<P>If the data were suited to meta-analysis, we proposed to use a random-effects model to pool the data given that heterogeneity between studies was considered likely. The presence of heterogeneity of the observed treatment effects was to be assessed using the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity appears significant, pooled results were to be interpreted with caution.</P>

<BR/>The administration of MDAC (compared to single dose activated charcoal (SDAC)) indicated beneficial effects in terms of mortality (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83), occurrence of severe arrhythmias (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71) and requirement for temporary pacing (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70). </P>

<BR/>Administration of anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin reduced the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias two hours post-administration (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.81) and increased the mean heart rate at two hours (WMD 16.00, 95% CI 8.18 to 23.82) and at eight hours (WMD 15.00, 95% CI 7.50 to 22.50) post-administration.

<P>Adverse effects were reported to be more frequent from anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin (13% of patients administered Fab), and while some potentially severe reactions were reported (including bronchospasm in two patients and mild angioedema in one patient), the reactions all responded promptly to standard treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines and corticosteroids. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Few high quality studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of antidotes for the treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning. In particular there are no randomised controlled trials in acute digitalis poisoning, despite the widespread therapeutic use of digitalis cardenolides and the relative frequency of poisonings. Instead, the evidence supporting antidotes for digitalis poisoning (where they have been assessed) is limited to observational and retrospective studies. While these studies have demonstrated an apparent reversal of cardiotoxicity, the role of the antidote in causing this response, independent of the effects of confounding variables such as other treatments and the natural history of the cardiotoxicity, cannot be clearly defined. </P>
<P>The suboptimal study design is of particular importance when considering the effect of the anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin. Because the Fab antitoxin is expensive, clear guidelines on indications for its use and quantified benefits would be of interest to clinicians and others. However, because of the favourable outcomes from the observational studies and widespread use of this antidote, it would now be considered unethical to conduct a randomised controlled trial. Similarly, given the widespread use of atropine for cardenolide-induced bradycardia, and clinical experience suggesting its efficacy, it seems unlikely that a randomised controlled trial will be conducted to define its efficacy. </P>
<P>Fortunately, randomised controlled trials have been conducted on antidotes for the treatment of acute yellow oleander poisoning (see 'Characteristics of included studies' table for more details). Yellow oleander poisoning is a particular problem in developing countries where resources are limited and therefore more information on the efficacy of antidotes is required to determine if it should be available. Unfortunately, in the case of antidotes such as anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin, despite this data the cost of the drug limits its use in developing countries such as Sri Lanka (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2003</LINK>). Given pharmacokinetic differences between individual cardenolides, the effect of antidotes administered to patients with yellow oleander poisoning cannot be readily translated to those of other cardenolides. </P>
<P>The final interim report of the ongoing randomised controlled trial into the efficacy of activated charcoal in acute poisoning did not report a difference in terms of the primary outcome (death) for the subgroup of patients with yellow oleander poisoning (n = 1515 patients) and secondary analysis data is not yet available (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2005</LINK>). This is in contrast to the included study which reported improvements in mortality from MDAC. The data from this ongoing study are undergoing final analysis and the results are eagerly awaited. </P>
<P>There are other potentially useful antidotes for cardenolide poisoning which have not yet been assessed. Of particular interest is fructose-1,6-diphosphate which appears to be useful in dogs poisoned with nerium oleander (<LINK REF="REF-Markov-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Markov 1999</LINK>). A phase II clinical trial is currently underway in Sri Lanka to assess the effect of this antidote in patients with acute yellow oleander poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>With the exception of two studies conducted in patients with acute yellow oleander poisoning (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roberts-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Roberts 2006</LINK>), the excluded studies were all conducted on subjects exposed to digitalis cardenolides (many included patients with both acute and chronic toxicity). A limited range of antidotes were considered in the excluded studies, notably anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin (15), activated charcoal (4), glucagon (1), phenytoin (1). This highlights the gap in the available data, inviting further research into antidotes for the management of acute cardenolide poisoning.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is some evidence to suggest that MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin may be effective treatments for yellow oleander poisoning. However, the efficacy and indications of these interventions for the treatment of acute digitalis poisoning is uncertain due to the lack of good quality controlled clinical trials. The evidence base supporting the current treatment of acute cardenolide poisoning, in particular digitalis, is limited.</P>
<P>Considering the findings of the two included studies and their limitations, the current treatment recommendations for antidotes may include MDAC and anti-digoxin Fab antitoxin for patients with yellow oleander poisoning. However due to the absence of high quality controlled trials, the effectiveness of other antidotes for cardenolide poisoning (such as isoprenaline (isoproterenol), frustose-1,6-diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium, phenytoin) is unknown. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research is required to confirm the efficacy of antidotes which have been suggested to be useful for acute cardenolide poisoning. In particular, research into antidotes which are relatively cheap (for example, magnesium, fructose-1,6-diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate and phenytoin) should be encouraged, given the high incidence of yellow oleander poisoning in developing countries. </P>
