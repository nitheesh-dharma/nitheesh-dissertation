Salpeter reference added.&lt;br&gt;1.Synopis- have reinstated final sentence on increase in nonICS users and african americans for combined ASRDs and LTAs.&lt;br&gt;2. Asbtract main results. A sentence on primary outcomes in nonICS users and african americans reinstated.&lt;br&gt;3. Discussion of deaths. order of staements changed to reflect SMART primary outcome ombined ASRDs and LTAs coming first.&lt;br&gt;I have not changed the order of outcomes in any comparison or checked any outcome formatting.&lt;br&gt;If you are happy with these changes could you go ahead and submit befroe deadline please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Editing 20 October 2006&lt;br&gt;Abstract results and conclusions focus too much on subgroup results from SMART. Synopsis same issue. I have amended in red.&lt;br&gt;Background needs to include the recent Salpeter review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: adverse eventsamended to include mortality and life-threatening asthma .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doses Salmeterol 50mcg bd is the standard clinical dose so should be used for all primary analyses? Does this only apply to Dahl 1991a that included an arm with 100 bd that may have been used in the analysis? IF this has been examined in sensitivity analyses this is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: *****does it make sense to combine PEF in children and adults unless they are % predicted. Interesting to note effect of weights using random and fixed models. ? ****Can we combine the adults without including the children.&lt;br&gt;******Von Berg evening peak flow needs checking please, looks too high compared to 4% predicted in outcome 11(this will also alter 5#4). Totals need switching off for single trials please. (eg 1#12 etc)&lt;br&gt;There are so many lung function outcomes that is makes it difficult for the reader. I think we should chose up to 10 outcomes for the primary analysis, PEF, FEV1, symptoms, rescue, days free, nights free and exacerbations for example and put this as comparison one, the rest can be moved down to secondary stuff below adverse events in outcome two. This will also affect the order of reporting of the results. Again I think we should separate children and adults for lung function.&lt;br&gt;I have rewritten the paragraph on asthma-related deaths. I have also taken out Peto OR as I had forgotten that it underestimates large effect sizes and this makes quite a large difference in the asthma related deaths. All outcomes from SMART have been changed to RR to match the trial reports, and i have used the Risk Difference with its CI to estimate number needed to harm (as this also accommodates zero cells better).&lt;br&gt;Metaview graphs at the start of Comparison 2 have been reordered and SMART primary outcome numbers corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Some refinements added in red.&lt;br&gt;Toby can this go back to the authors and out for review before the deadline next week. The *** comments can be left for the next revision I think.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;06.10.06&lt;br&gt;Dear Toby, Sending revman version with changes to date.&lt;br&gt;I have entered Haydn's versions of the discussion and any other changed sections, added 3 additional references and checked text with analyses.&lt;br&gt;To follow up&lt;br&gt;1. The data from SMART on the Afro-american subgroup- should that be entered in tables so readers can view it or leave them to find it in Nelson. My preference would be to enter it for reader convenience.&lt;br&gt;2. New title - to reflect review content- does it convey what is here?&lt;br&gt;3. re crossover and PG for continuous outcomes, I am happy to leave them separate as reported.&lt;br&gt;4. Tidying up subgroups in comparisons and data tables neds to be done&lt;br&gt;5. Peer review - will let you and Chris discuss&lt;br&gt;6. Authorship- you will be an author for this update I presume&lt;br&gt;Regards Julia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22082006&lt;br&gt;Comparisons - severity (nocturnal symptoms&lt;br&gt;16082006&lt;br&gt;Hi Julia,&lt;br&gt;Warm from the press - attached is the draft of the LABA review update for 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most pressing amendment that I have not made was the classification of studies on the basis of severity. On balance I feel that any insights I have on this issue are very much second hand, and I think that between yourself and Haydn you will be able to paint a much better picture for who in these studies represent mild, moderate and severe asthmatics. Once that is done, all we need worry about is copying the data between the relevant comparisons. As you can see there are some changes to the lists of outcomes. This was forced on me by the rather extensive list of endpoints that contribute data to the review, so I felt it better to store the efficacy and safety data separately (the list of outcomes only goes up to 99 for each comparison) - and I have also used GIV for continuous data where only mean differences were available from the trials. I have stored the old WMD outcomes in an archive (from recent experience I think that it is quite helpful to retain descriptive statistics for control groups, to help get a sense for what the relative differences tell us).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also notice a comparison of imputed SD outcomes - these can be copied up to replace their equivalents in the efficacy comparison if you wish. Not really sure how you wanted to play this particular card. I don't think that the additional SDs make a huge difference to the efficacy variables, but I think that it makes for a more authoritative piece of work, if we are able to at least state that we have thought about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope that you find the work I have done on it satisfactory. If you are unclear on anything let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;11082006&lt;br&gt;TJL: Where studies report two treatment arms with high and low dose LABA, I have extracted the efficacy data for the low dose and the safety data for the high dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;02082006&lt;br&gt;TJL: Checked data for Kemp 1998 against original publication. In review Salmeterol n = 149 and placebo N = 12. In original trial publication, N = 152. I have amended this in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------&lt;br&gt;STUDIES NOW EXCLUDED BY TJL BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER ASSESSING LABA AS ADDITIONAL THERAPY TO ICS WHERE ICS IS: i) A STANDARDISED DOSE or ii) GIVEN AS PART OF A COMBINATION THERAPY (N = 9):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chuchalin 2002; Kavuru 2000b; O'Byrne 2001a; O'Byrne 2001b; Pauwels 1997a; Pauwles 1997b; Pearlman 1999a; Pearlman 1999b; Shapiro 2000a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STUDIES ADDED TO THE REVIEW:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleskow 2003; SLGA3014 1994; SMART; Wolfe 2006&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where studies have reported two dosage arms of LABA, I have entered the lower dose arm for the efficacy endpoints and the higher dose arm for the safety endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfe 2006 reported data on two subgroups - those with &amp;amp; those without anti-inflammatory medication for exacerbations, total adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events. 57% of participants were on inhaled steroids and I have taken the data from those in the anti-inflammatory group and considered these to be ICS - this consitutes 64% of recruited participants. In other words some 7% of overall sample are miscalssified according to this. Should the data be moved from the ICS subgroup to the subgroup described as mixed co-interventions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imputation of SDs.&lt;br&gt;I have weighted these according to sample size in relation to pooled sample size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:56:55 +0100" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh" REVIEW_NO="ILA-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.3.3 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="9.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:53:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>
<B>Note added in July 2014:</B> Since the original version of this review, guidance around LABA has changed. International asthma guidelines now only recommend the use of LABA in conjunction with ICS. The US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has issued a warning that LABA should not be used to treat asthma without concurrent ICS.<B> </B>The review will continue to be available for people to read on the Cochrane Library, but we will not update the review again. It is no longer considered safe to take LABA on their own without taking inhaled steroids due to harms which can occur.</P>
<P>
<B>Plain language summary published in 2006:</B> In this review of studies in which patients were either not on inhaled corticosteroids, or in which some patients but not all were on inhaled corticosteroids, treatment with regular long-acting beta-2 agonists such as salmeterol (Serevent) or formoterol (Foradil, Oxis) in chronic asthma resulted in fewer asthma symptoms by day or night, less relief bronchodilator medication requirement, better lung function, a lower risk of acute worsening of asthma and better quality of life, but most of the evidence comes from groups in which at least some used inhaled corticosteroid therapy. There is less information on asthma control in patients who did not use a regular 'preventer medication' or in children under twelve years, but the same generally positive effects on symptoms and lung function seem to apply. We have also been particularly focused on serious adverse events, given previous concerns about potential risks, especially of death, from regular beta-2 agonist use. A significant increase in asthma related deaths or life threatening experiences has been found in a recently published surveillance study, with an increased risk of around one event over 6 months for every thousand patients treated. This increase was mainly in African-Americans and those not on inhaled corticosteroids, although these observations were drawn from analyses conducted after the event (post-hoc) and as such lack the validity of pre-defined distinctions.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:53:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Asthma is a common respiratory disease among both adults and children and short acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are used widely for 'reliever' bronchodilator therapy. Long acting beta-2 agonists (LABA) were introduced as prospective 'symptom controllers' in addition to inhaled corticosteroid 'preventer' therapy (ICS). </P>
<P>We originally analysed studies comparing the use of LABA with placebo in mixed populations in which only some were taking ICS and in populations not using ICS therapy. However international guidelines no longer recommend the use of LABA in people who are not taking ICS for their asthma. We are therefore no longer updating this review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>This review aimed to determine the benefit or detriment on the primary outcome of asthma control with the regular use of LABA compared with placebo, in mixed populations in which only some were taking ICS and in populations not using ICS therapy.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-07-21 11:29:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, most recently in October 2005. We searched bibliographies of identified RCTs for additional relevant RCTs and contacted authors of identified RCTs for other published and unpublished studies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised studies of at least four weeks duration, comparing a LABA given twice daily with a placebo, in chronic asthma. Selection criteria to this updated review have been altered to accommodate recently published Cochrane reviews on combination and addition of LABA to ICS therapy. Studies in which all individuals were uniformly taking ICS were excluded from this review.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-01 17:29:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Two review authors performed data extraction and study quality assessment independently. We contacted authors of studies for missing data.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Sixty-seven studies (representing 68 experimental comparisons) randomising 42,333 participants met the inclusion criteria. Salmeterol was used as long-acting agent in 50 studies and formoterol fumarate in 17. The treatment period was four to nine weeks in 29 studies, and 12 to 52 weeks in 38 studies. Twenty-four studies did not permit the use of ICS, and forty permitted either inhaled corticosteroid or cromones (in three studies this was unclear). In these studies between 22% and 92% were taking ICS, with a median of 62%. There were significant advantages to LABA treatment compared to placebo for a variety of measurements of airway calibre including morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), evening PEF and FEV1. They were associated with significantly fewer symptoms, less use of rescue medication and higher quality of life scores. This was true whether patients were taking LABA in combination with ICS or not. Findings from SMART (a recently published surveillance study) indicated significant increases in asthma related deaths, respiratory related deaths and combined asthma related deaths and life threatening experiences. The absolute increase in asthma-related mortality was consistent with an increase of around one per 1250 patients treated with LABA for six months, but the confidence intervals are wide (from 700 to 10,000). Post-hoc exploratory subgroups suggested that African-Americans and those not on inhaled corticosteroids were at particular risk for the primary end-point of death or life-threatening asthma event. There was also a suggestion of an increase in exacerbation rate in children. Pharmacologically predicted side effects such as headache, throat irritation, tremor and nervousness were more frequent with LABA treatment.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:53:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>LABA are effective in the control of chronic asthma in the "real-life" subject groups included. However there are potential safety issues which call into question the safety of LABA, particularly people with asthma who are not taking ICS, and it is not clear why African-Americans were found to have significant differences in comparison to Caucasians for combined respiratory-related death and life threatening experiences, but not for asthma-related death.</P>
<P>Since the original version of this review, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has added a warning that LABA should not be used to treat asthma without concurrent ICS. International guidelines only recommend the use of LABA in conjunction with ICS. Readers should consult the overviews which summarise the results of Cochrane reviews on the safety of LABAs in adults and children (Cates 2012; Cates 2014).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-01 17:29:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Asthma is a common respiratory disease among both adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2000</LINK>), though there are large geographical differences in the prevalence of asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Janson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Janson 2001</LINK>). The prevalence is increasing in many countries; estimates for asthma prevalence for adults in 1990 varied from 8.5% in Australia to 4% in the USA and 3% in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1996</LINK>) and repeat estimates in Australia in 1999 (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2001</LINK>) gave rates for physician diagnosed asthma of 18% while 10% had used asthma medications in the past year. As a chronic illness, asthma is responsible for significant economic costs, both direct medical costs and indirect costs. Measurements in Australia (population approximately 20 million) range from direct costs of US$250 million to US$3.6 billion for total costs. Costs per patient have been estimated at US$326 per year in Australia and US$1,043 per year in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Sullivan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sullivan 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pathophysiological studies over the past two decades have increasingly recognised asthma as an inflammatory airway disease. National treatment guidelines for asthma have been published in several countries including Britain, USA and Australia (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-NAC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2002</LINK>). They recommend the use of ICS as 'preventer' maintenance therapy for all but mildest grades of asthma severity. In addition, bronchodilator therapy is an essential component of treatment, traditionally used for relief of symptoms as needed. The most widely used bronchodilators in asthma are inhaled beta-2 agonists which can be divided into two groups: those with a short duration of action (2-6 hours) which are used in a reactive 'relief' mode and those, introduced more recently, with a longer duration of action (&gt;12 hours). The latter were introduced as prospective 'symptom controllers'. The major representatives of the short acting beta-2 agonist agents in clinical use are salbutamol (known in North America as albuterol), terbutaline and orciprenaline, while the LABA in use are salmeterol and formoterol.</P>
<P>There has been controversy over the regular use of beta-2 agonists (<LINK REF="REF-AAACI-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAACI 1993</LINK>). It was proposed that excessive use of short acting beta-2 agonists might have contributed directly or indirectly to peaks in asthma mortality seen in the 1960's and late 1970's (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1986</LINK>). A study by Campbell (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 1976</LINK>) showed that in four Australian states there was a high correlation between the sales of adrenergic bronchodilator aerosols and the corresponding asthma mortality rates for the periods 1961-1963 and 1964-1966. Later, in 1989, a case control study in New Zealand linked the use of inhaled fenoterol with increased risk of death from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>). This was followed soon after by a similar study in Saskatchewan that also showed an association between excessive use of beta-2 agonists and the risk of death or near death from asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Spitzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spitzer 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Excessive use of beta-2 agonists and high blood levels of beta-2 agonists in poorly controlled asthma may contribute to deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Abramson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abramson 2001</LINK>). This study also showed significantly less use of asthma management plans and less use of inhaled corticosteroids in fatal cases.</P>
<P>The development of beta-2- agonists with long-acting properties, such as salmeterol (<LINK REF="REF-Adkins-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adkins 1997</LINK>) and (e)formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Bartow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartow 1998</LINK>) has provided potential pharmacological advantages over short-acting beta-agonists, such as prolonged bronchodilatation and protection against induced bronchospasm. However, there remain concerns about adverse effects of regular use of LABA (<LINK REF="REF-Devoy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devoy 1995</LINK>), especially on enhancing bronchial hyper responsiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>), the development of tolerance to bronchodilatation (<LINK REF="STD-Newnham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Newnham 1995</LINK>), progressively reduced protection against provoking stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Taylor-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taylor 1997</LINK>) and masking of deteriorating asthma pathology (<LINK REF="STD-McIvor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McIvor 1998</LINK>). These concerns have influenced national and international guidelines for asthma management, which stipulate that short-acting beta-2 agonists should be used only as needed, and not on a regular basis. LABA are in contrast generally only recommended to be taken on a regular basis.</P>
<P>The initial version of this review aimed to determine the benefit or detriment on the primary outcome of asthma control with the regular use of LABA compared with placebo. The review concluded that LABAs conferred benefits when given in addition to ICS therapy, and that they were safe. Several Cochrane reviews have since been published which confirm the benefit of LABA when given in addition to inhaled steroid therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>), and so we have narrowed the focus of this update. In addition to these reviews, the publication of a large study that suggested that there was an increase in the risk of asthma related mortality, (<LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK>), prompted us to re-assess the evidence base supporting the safety of LABA in chronic asthma.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this new updated review was to compare the effects of regular inhaled LABA versus placebo in chronic asthma. The specific purpose of the review was to assess whether there are any beneficial or harmful effects from the regular use of inhaled LABA compared with placebo on the primary outcome of asthma control, assessed through measurements of airway calibre, symptoms and exacerbations of asthma. Secondary outcomes included assessment of quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse events and the tolerance (tachyphylaxis) to bronchodilatation and bronchoprotection. Following the publication of <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK>, we have also updated the review to include an estimate of the risk of death in participants given a LABA to control their asthma. Studies in which all subjects were given LABA consistently with ICS were excluded.</P>

<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>We considered all randomised studies, both open and blinded, though double blind studies were preferable. The scoring system gave a lower score to open studies, and was used to assess the contribution of open studies, or if necessary to exclude them from analyses. Studies could be either of parallel group or crossover design.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>We included studies in which participants had a clinical diagnosis of asthma, present for at least three months but excluded the studies already included in currently published Cochrane reviews i.e. in which all patients were on ICS (see below). Participants belonged to populations with either variable ICS rates of use, or were uniformly not on ICS.<BR/>We included both adults and children. We looked specifically for evidence of reversibility of airway obstruction to short acting inhaled beta-2 agonists as a basic diagnostic criterion. We sought to document the severity of participants' asthma at inclusion and the proportion of participants using other asthma therapies, most notably disease-modifying agents such as ICS. Studies that included some or all participants with other pulmonary diseases, and especially smoking-related Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were excluded unless the results for those with asthma alone were available or could be extracted separately.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2014-07-22 13:54:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Participants in one treatment arm used a LABA either salmeterol or formoterol (also known as eformoterol), administered twice daily via any inhalation device. The second treatment arm consisted of regular doses of placebo, administered in the same way. The dose, inhalational device and frequency of administration were recorded. The minimum period of treatment was changed from the two weeks in our original review to four weeks in this update, to fit with the aim of assessing regular use in a relatively chronic setting. Since the initial publication of this review, a number of reviews have been published assessing the effects of addition of ICS or combination of LABA with ICS in chronic asthma (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>). We have therefore modified the criteria of this review in order to address a more focused question than the one we sought to answer previously. Thus, for the 2006 update of this review, we have included studies only where a LABA was administered without a standardised co-intervention with ICS (e.g. without standardised fixed combination therapy, where use of ICS therapy was an inclusion criterion or was uniformly provided by the study investigator). This means that we have included studies where a LABA was administered on top of usual therapy, such that a subset of participants only were using a regular ICS, provided that the regimen of maintenance ICS was not altered prior to the study. There was also a subgroup not using ICS or other disease - modifying agents at all. We have combined these studies, with subdivisions into subgroups, and recorded the number of participants on "preventer" inhaled therapy where this is available (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>Outcome measures chosen were those generally accepted as reflecting the primary outcome of asthma control. Thus the planned outcome measures were: daytime and night-time asthma symptom scores, bronchodilator use for symptom relief, daily peak flow measurement (PEF) and its variability, clinic measurements of lung function and asthma exacerbation rates. Secondary outcomes used were: adverse events (with a particular interest in mortality and life threatening asthma events), airway hyper-reactivity, quality of life score, global assessment of efficacy by patient and investigator, reduction in use of other asthma medication including ICS, development of tolerance to the effects of beta-2 agonists and effects on exercise-induced asthma.</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2008-08-01 17:33:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Where possible we have attempted to extract and verify raw data for continuous variable endpoints for all of the studies where these are reported. However, we have come across a number of studies where means, or mean differences are reported without an associated estimate of variance (e.g. standard deviation, standard error or 95% CI). We have therefore calculated a weighted estimate of the variation for each study where this is reported, and applied this to studies where such data are missing. This is calculated based from the ratio of the sample size for each study to the pooled sample size, generating a fraction. We have multiplied the standard deviation by the fraction, and then we have summed these to generate an average standard deviation.<BR/>

<P>All included trials were combined using the Review Manager. Data from parallel group and crossover studies were analysed separately.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as mean differences (MD) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), routinely using fixed effects models. However if heterogeneity was found in analyses (I square &gt;20%, <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>), use of the random effects model was included in its investigation. Results are reported as fixed effect unless otherwise stated. Where different scales had been used to measure the outcome, the pooled standardised mean differences (SMD), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated. The SMD is a statistic that expresses the difference in means between the two treatment groups in units of the pooled standard deviation. This applied particularly to measures of bronchial reactivity, symptom scores and diurnal variation in PEF.</P>
<P>For dichotomous outcomes, individual and pooled statistics were calculated as Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), using a fixed-effect model, with random-effects model being used in the investigation of any heterogeneity, as above.</P>
<P>For pooled effects a Breslow-Day test of heterogeneity was carried out, and a P value &lt;0.05 was considered significant, indicating possible differences between studies. Investigation of heterogeneity included performing analyses using the domains:<BR/>1. Fixed-effect versus random-effects modelling.<BR/>2. Methodological quality - Cochrane criteria A and B versus C ; Jadad score 3-5 versus 1-2.<BR/>3. Use of funnel plots to examine the effects, and investigate publication bias and look for asymmetry of effect sizes.</P>
<P>With regular use for at least two weeks there does not seem to be a significant difference between eformoterol used twice daily at either 6, 12 or 24 mcg dose on the development of tachyphylaxis to their bronchoprotective effects (<LINK REF="STD-Lipworth-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Lipworth 1998</LINK>). The effects on lung function and asthma symptom scores after 12 weeks treatment are similar for formoterol at doses of 12 and 24 mcg twice daily (<LINK REF="STD-Bensch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bensch 2001</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Schreurs-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schreurs 1996</LINK> found that the lowest effective dose of eformoterol was 6 mcg twice daily on outcomes such as daily PEF, lung function, daily asthma symptoms scores and use of rescue medication. Higher doses induced a greater effect in absolute numbers for some outcomes such as PEF in the morning, with a significant difference between the 6 mcg and 24 mcg doses. <LINK REF="STD-Bensch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bensch 2001</LINK> showed a slightly greater frequency of adverse events with the higher dose of 24 mcg compared to 12 mcg twice daily.</P>
<P>The four week <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1991a</LINK> study showed that the lowest effective dose of salmeterol on outcomes such as PEF, asthma symptom scores, rescue bronchodilator use and nocturnal awakenings was 12.5 mcg twice daily, with dose related increases occurring with salmeterol 50 and 100 mcg twice daily. The incidence of pharmacologically predictable adverse events was greater with a dose of 100 mcg twice daily.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Fitzpatrick-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzpatrick 1990</LINK> showed improvement in overnight PEF and sleep quality using salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily, while the 100 mcg dose also improved PEF and reduced the need for rescue bronchodilator use but did not improve sleep quality. When 100 mcg was used once daily at night (<LINK REF="STD-Faurschou-1994a" TYPE="STUDY">Faurschou 1994a</LINK>) it was shown that there was a similar effect on nocturnal asthma symptoms compared to 50 mcg given twice daily.</P>

<I>Agents</I>
<BR/>The LABA agent was salmeterol xinafoate in 49 studies and formoterol fumarate in 18 studies. Salmeterol 50 mcg given twice daily at 12 hourly intervals was used in 49 studies. Two studies compared different doses with placebo: 12.5, 50 and 100 mcg in <LINK REF="STD-Dahl-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Dahl 1991a</LINK>, and 25 with 50mcg BID in <LINK REF="STD-SLGA3014-1994" TYPE="STUDY">SLGA3014 1994</LINK>.</P>
<P>Formoterol fumarate was the LABA agent used in 17 studies. The dose was 24 mcg twice daily in four studies, 12 mcg twice daily in nine studies and 6 mcg twice daily in three studies. Four studies using a 24 mcg dosage had a comparison group using a different dose: <LINK REF="STD-Bensch-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bensch 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bensch-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bensch 2002</LINK> using 12 mcg, <LINK REF="STD-Schreurs-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Schreurs 1996</LINK> using 6 mcg and 12 mcg,</P>
<P>Where data from studies were combined, the dose of LABA used was the same or equivalent i.e. salmeterol 50 mcg, formoterol 12 mcg or 24 mcg (<LINK REF="STD-Campbell-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Campbell 1999</LINK>). As mentioned, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of variations in doses on the result.</P>
<P>The bronchodilator rescue agent used in 54 studies was a short-acting beta-2 agonist agent; salbutamol (albuterol) in 48 studies at doses of 200 or 400 mcg or terbutaline in 4 studies at doses of 250 or 500 mcg. In one study fenoterol was used and in additional trial the agent used was either salbutamol or terbutaline. One study permitted the use of either salbutamol or fenoterol. In one study a combination short-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergic was used.

<BR/>Any treatment period of four weeks or greater was specified in the revised review protocol and of the included studies the treatment periods were: four weeks (20 studies); six weeks (four studies); eight weeks (four studies); nine weeks (one study); 12 weeks (25 studies); 16 weeks (three studies); 24 weeks (three studies); 26 weeks (two studies); 36 weeks (one study); 52 weeks (five studies).</P>

<B>Participants<BR/>
</B>
<I>Age</I>
<BR/>Fifty-six studies included adult or adolescent participants over the age of 12 and eleven included children younger than 12 years of age.<BR/>
<BR/>
<I>Asthma severity</I>
<BR/>Information on the severity of participants' asthma at entry to the study was sought from each paper. Few authors specified how the classification of participants' asthma was arrived at and consistent use of guidelines to assess severity, such as those described in the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (<LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>) was used or not evident. Where authors of the included studies stated that the participants had asthma of specific grades of severity this was recorded under the categories: mild, mild - moderate, moderate - severe or "persistent" if asthma was described as "persistent or symptomatic". Those studies in which no details were available on the participants' asthma severity were classified as "unknown severity".</P>
<P>Of the 67 included studies, 28 included participants with mild - moderate asthma, nine included subjects with mild asthma only and one included participants with moderate - severe asthma. Eleven studies included participants with persistent or symptomatic asthma and for 18 studies the severity of participants' asthma was unknown.</P>
<P>
<I>Co-interventions</I>
<BR/>Studies were assessed according to the co-intervention treatment for asthma used by subjects during the course of the study. The information was available for all but three unpublished studies (<LINK REF="STD-SLGA2004" TYPE="STUDY">SLGA2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SLGL82" TYPE="STUDY">SLGL82</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SLMP03" TYPE="STUDY">SLMP03</LINK>), and in most cases the authors specified that the dose was kept constant during the course of the study treatment period.</P>
<P>The majority of studies permitted a mixture of co-intervention treatments (40 out of 67 studies). The most frequently used were ICS or cromones, but some of these studies also permitted oral steroids at low dose and theophyllines (see table 'Characteristics of included studies').</P>
<P>Twenty-four studies did not permit ICS.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> details the studies in terms of their severity and concomitant steroid use.</P>
<P>
<B>Outcomes</B>
<BR/>Not all the 68 experimental groups contributed to the analyses in the review because of lack of data. Seven studies did not contribute any data, either because none could be obtained in a suitable form from the papers or on request from the authors or sponsors, or because the outcomes in the studies could not be combined.</P>
<P>The results from the parallel group studies, with subjects of any age, were combined and analysed together, stratified on the basis of age (participants under 12) and maintenance therapy usage (ICS at any dose versus no ICS used). For the crossover studies, results for first period of treatment alone were not available for combination with the parallel group studies analyses. Therefore, the crossover studies were separately combined and then the two data sets compared. The results discussed below refer to studies of parallel group design, unless otherwise specified in the text.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The methodological quality of the majority of trials was good and on the Jadad scoring method, seven scored 5 while thirty-three scored 4 and twenty-three scored 3. Four studies were given the lower score of 2 as they were not blinded by intervention. Lack of information in publications on the methods of randomisation used, meant that allocation concealment could not be confirmed in many cases (although they probably were adequate), so only eight studies were graded as confirmed adequate (A), fifty-eight were unclear (B) with one graded as obviously inadequately concealed (C).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">OVERVIEW OF OUTCOMES</HEADING>
<P>Measures of airway calibre showed consistent benefit from LABA treatment on morning and evening peak expiratory flow and FEV1. There were also benefits in asthma symptoms, quality of life and rescue bronchodilator usage. Major exacerbations were reduced in adults but not in children. A recently published surveillance study <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK> has found a statistically significant increase in asthma-related deaths in LABA in comparison with placebo, respiratory related deaths and the combined outcome of asthma related deaths or life threatening experiences. The increase in all cause mortality and the primary outcome of the study (combined respiratory related deaths or life threatening experiences) did not show statistical significance. The absolute increase in all of these events with LABA was in the region of one extra per thousand patients treated over 6 months, but the confidence intervals around these estimate are wide. For asthma related deaths NNT(H) is 1250 (95% CI 700 to 10,000). Serious adverse events were significantly higher with LABA when the results of three studies in children were combined.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW (PEF)</HEADING>
<P>Morning PEF was greater in the LABA group by around 15 L/min (95% CI 11 to 19.4; 20 studies, 3682 participants), but with high levels of heterogeneity (I square 69.5%). The result remained significant with random effects modelling (23 L/min (95% CI 13.3 to 32.5). In six studies with 235 participants not using any ICS the MD was 23.08 L/min (95%CI 4.74 to 41.41). There was a comparable result from three crossover studies (38.2 L/min (95% CI 3.1 to 73.29). The majority of these studies were conducted in participants with mild and mild-moderate asthma (4 studies (140 participants), 11 studies, (1410 participants) respectively). In the mild studies the effect of LABA was not significant with either random effects or fixed effect modelling but they included only small numbers and may be examples of Type II statistical errors. In the mild-moderate and persistent/symptomatic studies the effect of LABA was significant with both models (mild-moderate: FE: 16.12 L/min (95% CI 11.17 to 21.07); RE: 28.82 L/min (95% CI 14.06 to 43.59); persistent/symptomatic studies: FE/RE: 15.04 L/min (95% CI 1.95 to 28.13)).</P>
<P>For evening PEF the advantage to the LABA group across all studies was 12.43 L/min (95%CI 7.61 to 17.24; 14 studies, 2590 participants). In the subgroup analyses, for studies with mixed co-interventions, the difference in favour of LABA-treated participants was 23.81 L/min (95%CI 14.81 to 32.81). For non-ICS users the difference was significant, but the finding was less precise (18.32 (95% CI 2.25 to 34.38), six studies, 245 participants). There was a moderate level of statistical variation in this subgroup (I square 48.1%), and when applying a random effects model the result became non-significant (29.22 L/min (95% CI -9.31 to 67.74). Subgroup analyses by severity of asthma gave similar results for mild-moderate studies (13.29 L/min (95%CI 8.12 to 18.46)). There was a significant difference in studies recruiting children less than 12 years old (change in am PEF: 12 L/min (95% CI 2 to 22), but an advantage was not evident in three studies in mild asthma with 79 participants.</P>
<P>When all of the studies were combined there were significantly greater changes from baseline in PEF during treatment, measured both in the morning and the evening, in the LABA group. The differences in those treated with and without ICS were similar.<BR/>
<BR/>Change scores also indicated that LABA treatment led to significant differences compared with placebo (change in am PEF: 24.7 L/min (95% CI 22.62 to 26.79; 25 studies, 5512 participants); change in pm PEF: 15.09 L/min (95%CI 12.98 to 17.2; 22 studies, 5350 participants)). The findings remained significant when random effects modelling was applied (change in am PEF: 24.84 L/min (95%CI 20.41 to 29.27); change in pm PEF: 15.09 L/min (95%CI 12.98 to 17.2)). In studies where LABA was added to usual 'preventer' therapies, the change in am PEF was 29 L/min (95% CI 23 to 35.4; random effects model). In studies where participants were not using ICS the difference was 24 (95% CI 15 to 33; random effects model). Among the studies contributing to this result <LINK REF="STD-Nathan-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Nathan 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pearlman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Pearlman 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rosenthal-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Rosenthal 1999</LINK> only included participants who had not used ICS for at least three months. The result from these studies alone did not show heterogeneity, MD 22.30 L/min (95%CI 16.70 to 27.89) (chi-squared 2.26 df 2).</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity in the subgroup analyses for the change in evening PEF. In participants where LABA was added to usual therapies the subgroup effect was 17 L/min (95%CI 14 to 20) (2980 participants, 12 studies; I square 71.2%). Funnel plots and selective omission of individual studies did not fully explain the causes of heterogeneity, although omitting <LINK REF="STD-Jones-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 1994</LINK> reduced the I square statistic to 57%). This study did not provide an estimate of the variance for the published trial and so we applied an imputed standard deviation.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses of change in PEF by severity of asthma confirmed advantages of similar magnitude, though in the two largest groups those with asthma of mild-moderate and persistent/symptomatic asthma severity there was significant heterogeneity, probably related to the wide variety of co-interventions used by participants. The random effects WMD for change in morning PEF was 25.31 L/min (95%CI 16.25 to 34.38, I square 79.9%) and for persistent/symptomatic asthma was 26.31 L/min (95%CI 17.56 to 35.06, I square 86.1%).<I> </I>There was a high level of statistical heterogeneity of effect size of LABAs on change in evening in mild-moderate asthma (I square 77.6%), although random effects modelling did not alter the direction of the fixed effect (16.75 L/min (95% CI 12.03 to 21.47)<I>.</I> For both morning and evening PEF changes there was only one study contributing to the analysis in mild asthmatics and in only two studies for moderate-severe asthmatics, where the difference failed to achieve statistical significance.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Studies conducted in children</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant advantage in treatment with LABAs in children less than 12 years old with a larger improvement seen for both change in morning PEF (MD 16 L/min (95%CI 12 to 20); four studies, 1065 children) and for change in evening PEF (15 L/min (95%CI 12 to 19); four studies, 1063 children).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">FEV1</HEADING>
<P>For laboratory measures of lung function, the most frequently reported measure was the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Overall FEV1 was higher in LABA treated participants by around 0.24 litres (95%CI 0.21 to 0.28) with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I square 45.9%). In studies where LABA was added to background therapy the effect was 0.25 L (0.21 to 0.28). Two small studies on participants not using ICS were underpowered to detect significant differences between treatment groups (MD 0.1 litres (95%CI -0.3 to 0.5).</P>
<P>Small numbers of studies in the extremes of mild or severe asthmatics, limited subgroup analyses by severity of asthma. In seven studies with 1932 participants with mild-moderate asthma the MD was 0.22 litres (95%CI 0.16 to 0.29). <I>
<BR/>
</I>
<BR/>Similar results were seen in five studies of crossover design with a MD at the end of treatment of 0.13 litres (95%CI 0.01 to 0.25). In one parallel group study with 354 children under 12 years the difference was 0.19 litres (95%CI 0.06 to 0.32).</P>
<P>LABA led to a significantly greater increase in FEV1 from baseline over that on placebo by 0.17 litres (95%CI 0.14 to 0.2); 17 studies, 3295 participants. The difference between the subgroups of studies where background therapy was used and studies with no ICS use was not significant (P = 0.269).</P>
<P>Two subgroups had two or more studies in them. In persistent/symptomatic asthma the mean difference was 0.2 (95 % CI 0.15 to 0.26, four studies with 1336 participants), and in moderate asthma the MD was 0.15 litres (95%CI 0.06 to 0.24, two studies with 274 participants). There was only one study each with data including subjects with either mild or severe asthma, though both gave significant results of similar magnitude to the overall outcome data.</P>
<P>Data on FEV<SUB>1</SUB> change for children were available as % predicted FEV1 from three trials (693 children), indicating a significant difference in favour of LABA of 4% (95% CI 2 to 6).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">FEV1 AUC</HEADING>
<P>There was a significant difference in favour of LABA of around L-h 2.23 L-h (95% CI 1.71 to 2.75), seven studies, 1312 participants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">FVC, FEF 25-75%</HEADING>
<P>Results for forced vital capacity (FVC) or maximum mid expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) were only reported in two studies using 302 subjects with asthma of mild-moderate severity and taking a variety of co-interventions. The differences favoured the LABA treatment group but were not statistically significant.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">SYMPTOM SCORES</HEADING>
<P>There were significantly fewer symptoms in the LABA group across the board on a variety of measures at the end of treatment. Scales used to measure asthma symptoms varied from 3 to 6 points and scores were generally derived as a composite based on a number of symptoms, e.g. cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness assessed during the day and/or overnight and whether sleep was broken by asthma symptoms. The proportion of days with symptom scores of zero and nights without awakenings due to asthma were also assessed. All measures showed significant advantages in the LABA compared with placebo. All findings reported below pertain to SMDs because of the different metrics used to assess this series of outcomes.</P>
<P>Daytime symptoms were significantly better in LABA treated participants (-0.34 95% CI -0.44 to -0.25; 14 studies, 1836 participants). Nocturnal symptoms were also better in LABA treated participants: SMD -0.54 (95% CI -0.64 to -0.45 in eight studies with 1758 participants). There was no significant difference between the subgroups analysed on the basis of including background ICS use.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis of symptom score data indicated that the effect of LABAs was consistent across the groups of trials based on the classifications of severity in the review.</P>
<P>Symptoms fell from baseline by a greater amount during treatment with LABAs compared to placebo. The difference overall was -0.49 (95%CI -0.58 to -0.41) for day time symptoms in eleven studies with data reported on 2629 participants, and -0.54 (95%CI -0.87 to -0.22, random-effects modelling) for night time symptoms in three studies with 823 participants. The nocturnal symptom results showed significant heterogeneity that may be due to the variations in severity of asthma and different doses of preventer drugs being used.</P>
<P>LABA treated participants had significantly fewer days affected by asthma (16%, 95% CI 14 to 19; nine studies, 2060 participants), and also fewer night symptoms expressed as both % nights without symptoms (10.79%, 95% CI 6.48 to 15.1; nine studies, 2093 participants), and the % nights without awakenings (15.81%, 95% CI 14.22 to 17.41; 13 studies, 3925 participants). The high level of statistical heterogeneity observed for % nights without symptoms may be partly explained by the difference between non-ICS users and participants where LABA was added to variable usual therapies (P = 0.047). Two possible effects could explain this difference. One possibility is that in the usual therapy trials, the addition of LABA improves asthma control in the participants on stable doses of ICS whose relief from symptoms is more pronounced than it is in the participants who are given LABA alone, who do not benefit from an effective concomitant maintenance treatment. The second possibility is that since this difference is of only borderline statistical significance, it is an artefact of the numerous analyses based on multiple outcomes and subgroups identified in this review. Only one study in children was reported with the percentage of nights affected by asthma awakenings with LABA in 210 children being fewer with the MD being 6.40% (95%CI 2.11 to 10.69).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">RESCUE BRONCHODILATOR USE</HEADING>
<P>LABA treated participants used significantly less rescue medication than the placebo group. The rescue agent used in all studies contributing data to the analyses was a short-acting beta-2 agonist.</P>
<P>LABA reduced the requirement for rescue short-acting beta-agonist when expressed as absolute and change scores for 24-hour and also day and night periods. In spite of high levels of statistical heterogeneity in these outcomes the results were significant with both fixed-effect and random-effects modelling (difference in SABA usage for 24 hours: -0.9 puffs/d, 95% CI -1 to -0.7; eight studies, 1885 participants; mean change in SABA usage over 24 hours: -1.2 puffs/d, 95% CI -1.4 to -1; 12 studies, 2197 participants; SABA use (day): -1 puffs/d, (95% CI -1.3 to -0.8; three studies, 691 participants; change in SABA use (night): -0.54, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.4; two studies, 633 participants).</P>
<P>There was significant heterogeneity found in the pooled analysis of rescue therapy use. A contributing factor in addition to variation in asthma severity and treatment may have been the different short acting beta-2 agonist agents used, the different doses and varying inhalational devices. Heterogeneity persisted in the subgroup analyses.</P>
<P>Results of a similar magnitude and direction were seen for the change in rescue medication use both during the day time and at night time across the severity range. The limited data from mild and severe asthma mean that a larger evidence base in these patients is required before more reliable statistical investigation of the effects of LABA on rescue medication usage based upon disease severity can be undertaken.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">EXACERBATIONS OF ASTHMA: MAJOR EXACERBATIONS</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-three studies (5995 participants) reported data on exacerbations of asthma. There was a large reduction in the odds of experiencing at least one major exacerbation during the study in the LABA group compared with placebo, OR 0.73 (95%CI 0.64 to 0.84). The definition of a major exacerbation was stated for the majority of studies. In 10 studies with 2547 adult participants a major exacerbation of asthma was defined as worsening of asthma symptoms requiring treatment in addition to the study drug and usual rescue short acting inhaled beta-2 agonist agent. When the analysis was confined to these studies the OR was 0.64 (95%CI 0.52 to 0.79). In 10 studies with 2468 adult participants where a definition was not given or was less precise the result was similar, OR 0.59 (95%CI 0.46 to 0.76). 5 cross over studies (n=337) showed a similar but non-significant result, OR 0.80 (95%CI 0.42 to1.54).</P>
<P>Paradoxically, three studies on children reported data on exacerbations and the pooled analysis actually suggested an increased risk of exacerbation, OR 1.22 (95%CI 0.92 to 1.62) though the result was not statistically significant. Based on a test of interaction, the difference between the adult and children subgroups was highly significant (P = 0.000045).</P>

In six studies with 1500 participants not using ICS, the reduction in the odds of an exacerbation was similar and also significant, OR 0.71 (95%CI 0.53 to 0.96).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Subgroup analyses -Asthma severity</HEADING>
<P>The LABA treatment group had a significantly lower risk of a major exacerbation in mild - moderate asthma and persistent/symptomatic asthma, which characterised the majority of the study populations in this outcome (mild - moderate asthma: OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.83; 10 studies with 3106 participants; persistent/symptomatic asthma: OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93; eight studies, 2408 participants). The findings were re-examined with sensitivity analysis restricted to adult studies since the paediatric data highlighted the possibility of an increase in the odds of an exacerbation in children. The resultant OR in the mild - moderate subgroup of studies was lower (OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.6)).<BR/>A single crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Taylor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Taylor 1998</LINK>) reported a difference for the corrected rate of major exacerbations of -0.18 exacerbations per patient per year (95%CI -0.38 to 0.02) with LABA.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Asthma-related Death</HEADING>
<P>Findings from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK> indicated that in participants using mixed co-interventions (including ICS) at baseline there was a significant increase in the odds of asthma-related death occurring in the LABA treated group (13 versus 3; RR 4.4, 1.25 to 15.3; N = 26355). This represents an absolute increase of one extra death over six months for every 1250 patients treated with LABA, but the confidence interval is wide (95% CI 700 to 10,000). The size of this difference was consistent across all the mortality and life threatening experience outcomes measured in this study, and was statistically significant for asthma related death, respiratory related death and the combined outcome of asthma-related death and life threatening experiences, but not for all cause mortality (with or without life-threatening experiences or the combined endpoint of respiratory-related death or life-threatening experiences). In those not using ICS at baseline, the number of participants suffering asthma-related death was higher in LABA than placebo treated groups (9 versus 0, N = 14090). The published trial report did not provide an estimate of the risk ratio as the authors decided that Relative Risk should not be calculated when there were no event rates in the control group. However, we used RevMan 4.2 to calculate the Relative Risk of asthma-related death for both the subgroups with and without ICS at baseline (using the normal adjustment of adding 0.5 to each cell when there are no events in one cell); for those taking ICS at baseline the Relative Risk is 1.34 (95% CI 0.30 to 5.97), whilst for those not taking ICS at baseline the Relative Risk is 18.98 (95% CI 1.1 to 326). The test for interaction between these subgroups does not reach significance (P= 0.08). Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of subgroup differences as patients were not randomised to ICS in this study, and data on ICS use was collected at baseline only.</P>
<P>A post-hoc within study subgroup analysis by ethnicity, indicated that African-Americans were more likely to experience a composite endpoint of respiratory -related death and life threatening adverse events (intubation and mechanical ventilation) than Caucasians, Relative Risk Increase 3.9 (95% CI 1.29 to 11.84). There was, however, no significant difference found in asthma-related deaths between African-Americans and Caucasians; results from life table analyses for African-Americans 7 versus 1; RR 7.26(95% CI 0.89 to 58.94: N = 4685), whilst for Caucasians 6 versus 1; RR 5.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 48.37; N=18,642).</P>
<P>When the endpoint was broadened to incorporate respiratory-related death there was a just significant difference in the Relative Risk of death between LABA and placebo for the total population of 2.18 (95% CI 1.07 to 4.05), N = 26355. There was no significant difference between the subgroups using ICS at baseline and those not using ICS at baseline (test for interaction P = 0.84). The increase in all-cause mortality yielded non-significant results (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.35; three studies using the non-ICS subgroup from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK>, N = 14534 and RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.14 using all participants from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK>, N = 26799).</P>

However, the odds ratios of life-threatening adverse events from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK> for both mixed (i.e. total) and ICS - treated populations were not significantly different.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">QUALITY OF LIFE</HEADING>
<P>In addition to instruments to measure general quality of life, asthma-specific measurement of the impact of asthma on patients' quality of life is now possible, using purpose -designed instruments, which are of proven reliability, validity and responsiveness. These provide a robust and reliable measurement of this aspect of treatment efficacy. The asthma specific measures most often used in the studies included in this review were the Living with Asthma Questionnaire (LWAQ) by <LINK REF="REF-Hyland-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyland 1991</LINK> and Asthma Quality Of Life Score (AQOL) based on <LINK REF="REF-Juniper-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 1992</LINK>.</P>
<P>Six parallel group studies (1608 participants) measured quality of life changes with treatment and reported results that could be combined for analyses. They each used the AQOL, which contains 32 questions in four domains; activity limitation, symptoms, emotional function and environmental stimuli. For the global score, there was a clinically and statistically significant advantage to the LABA treatment group compared with placebo, though on inspection there were high levels of statistical heterogeneity across the trials (I square 73.1%). The random effects MD for the improvement in global score during treatment was 0.51 (95%CI 0.42 to 0.6)).</P>
<P>Results for improvements in the separate QOL domains for a subset of these studies were: for activity limitations: 0.4 (95%CI 0.3 to 0.50; three trials), for symptoms: 0.73 (95%CI 0.58 to 0.87; two trials), for emotional function: 0.66 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.83; two trials) and for exposure to environmental stimuli: 0.56 (95%CI 0.42 to 0.7; two trials). There were no studies on participants not using ICS.</P>
<P>One crossover study (<LINK REF="STD-Juniper-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Juniper 1995</LINK>) used the same instrument to assess quality of life in 140 participants on a variety of mixed co-interventions with asthma of unclassified severity, and reported the results as differences between active and placebo treatment. There were significant advantages, similar to the combined parallel group studies results above, for the LABA group overall in the global score of 0.55 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.83) and in the four individual domains:, activity limitation 0.43 (95%CI 0.28 to 0.58); symptoms 0.65 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.83); emotional function 0.65 (95%CI 0.43 to 0.86); and exposure to environmental stimuli 0.45 (95%CI 0.29 to 0.61).</P>

<P>Seven studies assessed bronchial hyperreactivity which involved inhalational challenge to the airways with solutions of methacholine or histamine, carried out 8-12 hours after the last dose of study medication, and measured changes in "underlying" airway reactivity from baseline during treatment periods from 4-52 weeks. There was a greater increase in PD/PC 20 i.e. a larger fall in airway reactivity in the LABA group relative to baseline, than during treatment with placebo. There was a consistent and significant difference in favour of LABA over placebo of 0.56 doubling-doses of inhalational bronchoconstrictor (95% CI 0.30 to 0.82).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">BRONCHOPROTECTION AGAINST AIRWAY CHALLENGE</HEADING>
<P>Measurement of airway reactivity one hour after a dose of a beta-2 agonist measures the bronchoprotection that it confers, presumably mainly due to physiological antagonism of the induced airway smooth muscle contraction. This was investigated in four studies for the first dose of a LABA and repeated after regular doses over periods from 2 to 8 weeks, to assess the development of "tachyphylaxis" to bronchoprotection. The degree of protection fell from the initial dose effect after regular LABA treatment. In one parallel group study with 23 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cheung-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Cheung 1992</LINK>) the difference in first dose bronchoprotection for LABA treatment compared to placebo was MD 3.94 doubling doses methacholine (95%CI 3.21 to 4.67). Similarly, in one study of crossover design (<LINK REF="STD-Boulet-1998b" TYPE="STUDY">Boulet 1998b</LINK>), the MD was 1.76 doubling doses (95%CI 0.81 to 2.71).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Newnham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Newnham 1995</LINK> investigated tachyphylaxis to airway response to formoterol with regular treatment over 4 weeks in two crossover studies in subjects on a variety of asthma co-interventions. The peak FEV1 increase from the dose response curve to LABA was significantly attenuated with regular use; the difference in one study was -0.26 litres (95%CI -0.43 to -0.09) and in the other study the results were given as 0.84 litres for active treatment compared to 1.00 litres for placebo, but the standard deviation was not available. Investigation of tachyphylaxis after regular LABA treatment to salbutamol-induced bronchodilatation in two studies did not produce results suitable for combining in an analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1999b</LINK> found no significant differences in the salbutamol dose-response curves for changes in FEV1 after treatment with salmeterol whether participants were treated with or without ICS.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2014-07-21 11:56:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>As a chronic disease, with no known cure, the accepted goals of management in chronic asthma are to minimise the adverse impact of the disease on the patient's physical and mental well being and to try, through good control, to minimise long term damage to the airways and prevent undue fixed airway obstruction thought to be due to structural "remodelling" of the airway wall. Treatment is therefore directed at improving physiological endpoints, patient-perceived physical and mental health, and overall minimisation of disease activity and risk to health.</P>
<P>There have now been a number of systematic reviews on LABA use published in the Cochrane Library on asthma subjects uniformly receiving ICS. This review has attempted to summarise the remaining studies, which have included patients receiving either a variety of background disease modifying agents (usually ICS) or none. We have focused on disease control, but have also emphasised severe adverse events, and especially mortality; drug related death being the worse outcome of all. For the primary outcome of interest in this review, that of asthma control as assessed by airway calibre, asthma symptoms with rescue medication use and exacerbations of asthma, we have demonstrated that there were significant and clinically meaningful advantages to regular treatment with inhaled LABA agents compared to placebo in both adults and children, generally across the board in the subjects of interest: both those on a variable regime of preventer medication and those taking no preventer (ICS).</P>
<P>There were consistent advantages for FEV1, morning and evening peak expiratory flows, in patient-assessed symptoms and in the amount of additional bronchodilator agent used in overall pooled analyses. Subgroup analyses indicated the most consistent effects to be in studies with participants using ICS or other co-interventions regularly. Evidence from analyses on studies of asthmatics not using inhaled corticosteroids generally similar but was less consistent, though there were fewer studies in this category</P>
<P>The heterogeneity found in some of our analyses, especially when all studies were combined, may be explained by differences in the population of asthmatics from which participants were recruited, reflecting a large natural variation within the disease spectrum. Heterogeneity was markedly less in the analyses of studies classified by participants' use of ICS or severity of asthma. For the most part we have accepted the study authors' categorisation of "severity" of disease. This is likely to reflect a mixture of asthma features: past severe disease episodes, need for ICS at whatever dose, and current level of symptoms and lung function in spite of that dose on ICS. The concept of asthma severity is always somewhat circular and tautological, but in a robust way is helpful clinically and as a general descriptor. Although the precise definitions used might have differed in specific circumstances, it is likely that the definitions here would not have been much different to those used by national and international guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-BTS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-GINA-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">GINA 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NAC-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NAC 2002</LINK>) because they all arise from similar clinical concepts and shared clinical cultures and experiences. Where exactly to fit into a "severity" spectrum those described as "symptomatic" or "persistent" is perhaps rather more difficult, because it depends on context, and how aggressively their caring physician had attempted to ameliorate the symptoms with preventer therapy i.e. ICS. It is likely that they would have fitted best with the moderate - severe group, and their outcomes as a group would suggest that, but we made a prospective decision to analyse them separately which was undertaken. However, overall the consistency of the results across the board and their clinically important levels make the positive results for LABA use compelling.</P>
<P>Evidence of deterioration in asthma control was sought in assessing occurrence of exacerbations of asthma during treatment, particularly in the light of historical concerns about regular use of beta-2 agonist agents potentially making asthma control worse. In the event, there was a significantly decreased risk of experiencing an exacerbation of asthma in the total adult LABA treatment group, and this result was robust with differing definitions of an exacerbation. When defined precisely as worsening of asthma symptoms that required treatment in addition to the study drug and rescue bronchodilator, the OR for an exacerbation was 0.7 (95%CI 0.6 to 0.8). Although the outcome was generally consistent, it was not significant in those studies not using ICS at all or in those with either mild asthma alone or moderate - severe asthma alone. A paradoxical result was obtained in studies with children alone. There was a non-significant increase in risk of exacerbation of asthma found in five studies in which all paediatric participants used regular preventer, the majority using ICS, with cromones being used by the remainder. Why children might be different from adults needs further investigations as it could be of major concern and clinical relevance.</P>
<P>The lower risk of asthma exacerbations in adults is in contrast to the fears expressed in the debate over regular beta-2 agonist use and its possible harmful effects. The finding is of interest in terms of the pathological data found in studies of airway biopsies and lavage fluid from airways taken during treatment with LABA, which have consistently shown either no change or an improvement in underlying airway inflammation on LABA treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Gardiner-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Gardiner 1994</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Li-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Li 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wallin-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 1999</LINK>). LABA may enhance the effects of corticosteroid at a gene level by increasing translocation of the CS-CS Receptor complex to the nucleus (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>), but LABA may have independent anti-inflammatory effects especially on the Innate Immune System (<LINK REF="REF-Reid-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reid 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Deaths<BR/>We were especially interested in the most severe potential negative outcome from LABA therapy, namely asthma-related death and life-threatening asthma events. Most of the data contributing to these analyses came from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK> (Nelson 2006), which recruited over 26,000 adult subjects between 1996 and 2003, 47% on ICS, before being concluded prematurely because of excess asthma deaths on LABA (Salmeterol) and difficulties in recruiting. The all-cause deaths were low (72 in total in a 28 week study i.e. about 0.2%), and not significantly different between LABA and placebo groups. The asthma-related death rate was lower overall than expected, by about 50%, but significantly different between groups: 13 to 3 in LABA versus placebo groups. There was a significant excess of the primary outcome of combined asthma-related death or life threatening experience on LABA, 37 to 22 (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1 to 2.9), with a significant difference found between African-Americans (who constituted 18% of this study population) and Caucasians (71%), test for interaction P = 0.02. The former as a group had more symptomatic asthma and worse lung function, but less use of ICS (38% versus 49% for Caucasians). No significant differences were found for the outcomes asthma-related deaths or respiratory-related deaths when African-Americans were compared with Caucasians. Furthermore, all the excess in deaths occurred in the first three year phase of recruitment, and in particular in 1998, when recruitment was by community advertisement, rather than through the subsequent method of recruitment through doctors' clinics. The excess of deaths was also predominantly in those not on ICS. Although the finger of doubt is undoubtedly pointed at LABA for "causing" excess deaths from <LINK REF="STD-SMART" TYPE="STUDY">SMART</LINK>, it may be that the excess mortality relates to poorly controlled, non-ICS treated patients. It is possible that there could be a genetic polymorphism common in African-Americans that makes them more pre-disposed to severe asthma events on LABA (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2006</LINK>), but given the other features and peculiarities in this study's outcomes, it seems even more likely that danger arises if LABA is prescribed without ICS in poorly controlled subjects who should definitely be on ICS by standard guideline definitions.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes assessed, results from Quality of Life measures showed that treatment with LABA conferred clinically significant advantages at or above the minimally important level in overall score and in the separate domains of asthma symptoms, emotional function, and exposure to environmental stimuli. For activity limitation the change was just less than that defined as of minimal clinical importance, a mean difference of &gt;= 0.5 representing the minimally clinically important change, with 1.0 and 1.5 representing moderate and maximal changes respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Juniper-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juniper 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The evidence for an effect of regular treatment with LABA in permitting weaning from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory asthma medication was not conclusive, but there was a significantly greater odds ratio for at least a 50% reduction in ICS dose in one study (Nielsen 1999) and a non-significant reduction in daily ICS dose in two other studies. This was supported by a similar difference in ICS dose after weaning in a crossover study, -18% (95%CI -38 to 2) (<LINK REF="STD-McIvor-1998" TYPE="STUDY">McIvor 1998</LINK>). The possibility of a reduction in need for anti-inflammatory medication on treatment with LABA again suggests some inherent anti-inflammatory or disease modifying effects. This may be independent of ICS use, or may be through enhancing the efficacy of ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2004</LINK>)</P>
<P>The results confirm the acceptability of treatment with LABA as assessed by both patients and investigators. Results for assessment of control of asthma as 'good' or 'very good' by patients gave significantly higher odds ratio in those using LABA compared to those using placebo. Investigators also rated efficacy with LABA as superior, though most studies did not quote the actual results.</P>
<P>This review specifically assessed possible pharmacologically - predictable adverse effects of regular use of inhaled LABA. If beta-2 agonists are absorbed into the systemic circulation, then stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in non-respiratory tissues will occur, in a dose-related way i.e. dependent upon blood levels of drug achieved. These effects include a positive cardiac chronotropic (increased heart rate) and inotropic (increased force of heart contraction) effect, which may be experienced as palpitations. Skeletal muscle receptor activation will cause fine tremor of the hands, and contribute to metabolic effects including hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, elevation of free fatty acids and ketones. Direct vascular effects cause systemic peripheral vasodilatation, which may precipitate headaches and cause a fall in blood pressure. For those studies that reported adverse events data, there was a small increase in the odds ratio for some for these predictable trial medication-related adverse event occurring in the LABA group compared with the placebo group, but this was mainly for the occurrence of headache. There was no significantly increased risk found for the occurrence of palpitations, tremor or muscle cramps.</P>
<P>Underlying airway responsiveness was assessed to directly acting bronchoconstrictor agents such as methacholine or histamine, at a time when most of the bronchodilator effects would have dissipated, with a significant improvement in BHR during treatment, WMD 0.5 doubling doses (95%CI 0.3 to 0.7) when all studies were combined. This was similar whether participants were using ICS or not. This is reassuring in that underlying airway responsiveness is not worsened, as had been hypothesised in the "-agonist debate" of the late 1980's and early 1990's. Even so the residual improvement in this late phase may not be clinically meaningful, being still less than one doubling dose, which is usually taken as the minimally significant and measurable change in PD 20 in a group.</P>
<P>There is ongoing debate over tachyphylaxis to LABA protection against direct airway challenge agents and against indirect agents acting through mast cell de-granulation. The analyses confirmed that tachyphylaxis develops to the initial bronchoprotective effect of LABA on direct airway challenge with regular treatment. Even so, there was continuing clinically significant protection against direct airway challenge conferred by LABA even after regular periods of treatment.</P>
<P>Overall, this review gives reassuring evidence for the effectiveness of LABA used regularly in chronic asthma, and does not show any evidence that underlying control of asthma deteriorates with regular use. The evidence is based on a broad range of studies across the asthma spectrum, but is strongest for mild - moderate severity and when concurrent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is given. There was a relative paucity of studies on children with contributing data and in children a possible increase in exacerbations requires further investigation.</P>
<P>A lack of consistency in outcomes chosen for measurement and reported in individual studies reduced the data available for the analyses. However, the conclusions for the main clinical outcomes were based on large numbers of subjects, whereas for secondary outcomes in studies investigating the mechanisms of action of LABA the conclusions were based on smaller numbers and may thus have less weight. Heterogeneity was quite large in the analyses of some outcomes, but do not confound the conclusions.<BR/>

<P>Long acting beta-2 agonists (LABA) are highly effective in chronic asthma, and the evidence particularly supports their use in ICS treated asthmatics, as emphasised in current guidelines. These suggest that LABA should be used in patients who remain symptomatic in spite of the use of reasonable doses of ICS. The short acting beta-2 agonist debate, centred mainly on epidemiological data, suggests that regular short acting beta-2 agonist use might have risks and lead to deterioration of underlying disease. This review indicates that the overall risk of asthma-related deaths may be increased with LABA, but the size of this increase in uncertain with a confidence interval ranging from one extra death for every 700 to 10,000 given LABA for six months.</P>
<P>The US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has added a warning that LABA should not be used to treat asthma without concurrent ICS. Therefore we have decided not to carry out any further updates to this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-07-21 10:23:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Future research is needed on whether LABA modify the long term accelerated decline in FEV1 in chronic asthma, especially if used in addition to ICS. Studies in children using preventer medication and adults with mild asthma not using ICS over longer periods are needed to investigate exacerbation rates and safety. LABA given regularly would seem to have disease modifying effects that cannot be explained merely by long-acting bronchodilatation and this needs further exploration to gain insights into what pathophysiological changes occur in the airways during their use. More evidence is needed on effects of LABA on chronic inflammation and especially on airway wall remodelling, where there is a particularly marked paucity of information in such an important area. </P>
<P>The implications for research have been revised to reflect current evidence regarding the known benefits and harms of LABAs from other Cochrane Reviews. Readers should consult the overviews which summarise the results of Cochrane reviews on the safety of LABAs in adults and children (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2014</LINK>).</P>
