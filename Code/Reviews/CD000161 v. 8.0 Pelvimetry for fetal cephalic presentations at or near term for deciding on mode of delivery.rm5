<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>Does the use of pelvimetry to assess the size of the woman's pelvis improve outcomes for baby and mother? Pelvimetry might identify babies whose heads are too big for their mother's pelvis. In this case, an elective caesarean section might improve the outcome. Forms of pelvimetry include radiological pelvimetry (X-ray, computerised tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and clinical examination of the woman. We planned to include all studies comparing the use of clinical or radiological (X-ray, CT or MRI) pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry, or different types of pelvimetry.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Sometimes, normal labour does not progress because the baby's head is too big, or the pelvis of the mother is too small, for the baby to pass through. This is called "cephalo-pelvic disproportion" or "obstructed labour" which may lead to an emergency caesarean section with possible risks for both mother and baby. A pregnant mother or her caregiver might be worried that disproportion could occur and for this reason, pelvimetry can be performed either before or during labour. It can be undertaken by clinical examination, X-ray, CT-scan or MRI. Pelvimetry measures the diameters of the pelvis and the baby's head. However, doing a pelvimetry also has implications: clinical examination might be very uncomfortable for the mother, X-ray and CT-scanning might be harmful for the baby and MRI is very expensive. All of these techniques have to be performed meticulously by experienced and skilled people to have any real value.</P>
<P>If we could diagnose the disproportion accurately before birth using pelvimetry, we might reduce the need for an emergency caesarean section and plan an elective procedure, with better outcomes for the baby and less complications for the mother.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We searched for evidence on 30th November 2016 and identified five trials with a total of 1159 pregnant women. All five trials used X-ray pelvimetry in comparison to no X-ray pelvimetry.</P>
<P>The women who received X-ray pelvimetry were more likely to have a caesarean section (<I>low-quality evidence</I>). Whether a woman had pelvimetry or not, we found no difference in the numbers of babies that died (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>), who did not have enough oxygen during labour, or were admitted to special care baby units (<I>very low-quality evidence</I>). For the women, no differences were found between numbers of women with wound sepsis, those who received a blood transfusion, or those whose caesarean section scar began to break down (<I>all very low-quality evidence</I>). Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was not reported in any study.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>There is too little evidence (the majority of which is low quality) to show whether measuring the size of the woman's pelvis (pelvimetry) is beneficial and safe when the baby is in a head-down position. The number of women having a caesarean section increased if women had X-ray pelvimetry but there was insufficient good-quality evidence to show if pelvimetry improves outcomes for the baby. More research is needed.</P>

<P>Pelvimetry assesses the size of a woman's pelvis aiming to predict whether she will be able to give birth vaginally or not. This can be done by clinical examination, or by conventional X-rays, computerised tomography (CT) scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2017-01-14 11:29:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valerie Vannevel">
<P>To assess the effects of pelvimetry (performed antenatally or intrapartum) on the method of birth, on perinatal mortality and morbidity, and on maternal morbidity. This review concentrates exclusively on women whose fetuses have a cephalic presentation.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-02-15 13:05:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies.</P>

<P>Randomised controlled trials (including quasi-randomised) assessing the use of pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or assessing different types of pelvimetry in women with a cephalic presentation at or near term were included.

<P>Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:27:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials with a total of 1159 women were included. All used X-ray pelvimetry to assess the pelvis. X-ray pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or clinical pelvimetry is the only comparison included in this review due to the lack of trials identified that examined other types of radiological pelvimetry or that compared clinical pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry.</P>
<P>The included trials were generally at high risk of bias. There is an overall high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of women and staff. Two studies were also at high risk of selection bias. We used <A HREF="http://www.gradepro.org/">GRADEpro</A> software to grade evidence for our selected outcomes; for caesarean section we rated the evidence low quality and all the other outcomes (perinatal mortality, wound sepsis, blood transfusion, scar dehiscence and admission to special care baby unit) as very low quality. Downgrading was due to risk of bias relating to lack of allocation concealment and blinding, and imprecision of effect estimates.</P>
<P>Women undergoing X-ray pelvimetry were more likely to have a caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.52; 1159 women; 5 studies; <I>low-quality evidence</I>). There were no clear differences between groups for perinatal outcomes: perinatal mortality (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45; 1159 infants; 5 studies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), perinatal asphyxia (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10; 305 infants; 1 study), and admission to special care baby unit (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.13; 288 infants; 1 study; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Other outcomes assessed were wound sepsis (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.67; 288 women; 1 study; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), blood transfusion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.59; 288 women; 1 study; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>), and scar dehiscence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.46; 390 women; 2 studies; <I>very low-quality evidence</I>). Again, no clear differences were found for these outcomes between the women who received X-ray pelvimetry and those who did not. Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was not reported in any study.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-03-27 14:26:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>X-ray pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or clinical pelvimetry is the only comparison included in this review due to the lack of trials identified that used other types or pelvimetry (other radiological examination or clinical pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry). There is not enough evidence to support the use of X-ray pelvimetry for deciding on mode of delivery in women whose fetuses have a cephalic presentation. Women who undergo an X-ray pelvimetry may be more likely to have a caesarean section.</P>
<P>Further research should be directed towards defining whether there are specific clinical situations in which pelvimetry can be shown to be of value. Newer methods of pelvimetry (CT, MRI) should be subjected to randomised trials to assess their value. Further trials of X-ray pelvimetry in cephalic presentations would be of value if large enough to assess the effect on perinatal mortality.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:40:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:39:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cephalo-pelvic disproportion (CPD) is one of the leading indications for an emergency caesarean section. CPD occurs when there is a mismatch between the fetal head and the maternal pelvis (when the fetal head is too big for the pelvis), resulting in obstructed labour.</P>
<P>Emergency caesarean sections have been shown to have an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-van-Ham-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Ham 1997</LINK>). Women undergoing an emergency caesarean section are at an increased risk for intra- and postoperative complications such as haemorrhage (tearing of the uterine incision into the parametrium or cervix, hysterotomy extension), infection (wound sepsis, endometritis), deep vein thrombosis and prolonged hospitalisation. Risks for the neonate include respiratory problems and trauma.</P>
<P>Women with a previous caesarean scar are known to be at risk for uterine rupture, stillbirth and placenta praevia in subsequent pregnancies. Performing a repeat caesarean section also increases the risk of bowel or bladder injury and haemorrhage and women who have had a previous caesarean section can be offered a trial of labour (vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)) to reduce the intra- and postoperative complications of a caesarean section. However, the low but life-threatening risk (for both mother and fetus) of a uterine rupture during labour has to be taken into consideration and explained to the woman (<LINK REF="REF-Dodd-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dodd 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-01-14 10:23:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Valerie Vannevel">
<P>Assessment of the size of a woman's pelvis (pelvimetry) can be achieved by clinical examination (where the bony pelvis is digitally examined to identify prominent structures that may cause obstructed labour), or by conventional X-rays (usually a lateral and anterior-posterior view used to physically measure the sizes of the pelvic inlet, midpelvis and pelvic outlet, <LINK REF="REF-Morgan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 1992</LINK>), computerised tomography (CT) scanning (measuring the pelvis in the lateral, anterior-posterior and axial views, <LINK REF="REF-Morris-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morris 1993</LINK>), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, measuring of a midline sagittal, and oblique coronal views of the pelvis, <LINK REF="REF-Sporri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sporri 2002</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:39:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The aim of pelvimetry (whichever method is used) in women whose fetuses have a cephalic presentation, is to detect the presence of cephalo-pelvic disproportion and therefore the need for caesarean section. Pelvimetry may influence clinical care since clinicians who feel that vaginal birth would be impossible, would offer the woman an elective caesarean section, thereby reducing the need of an emergency caesarean section. The criteria for determining an adequate or small pelvis have been from descriptive studies and senior opinions (<LINK REF="REF-Mengert-1948" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mengert 1948</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:40:03 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These techniques are not without risks, the greatest of all being a false positive result and unnecessary caesarean section. Clinical pelvimetry is very uncomfortable for the woman, X-rays and CT scanning expose the fetus to radiation (the latter slightly less so), and MRI is very expensive. All of these techniques have to be performed meticulously by experienced and skilled people in order to have any value at all.</P>

<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (31 January 2017).</P>
<P>The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth</A> in the Cochrane Library and select the &#8216;<I>
<B>Specialized Register</B> </I>&#8217; section from the options on the left side of the screen.</P>
<P>Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from:</P>
<OL>
<LI>monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);</LI>
<LI>weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);</LI>
<LI>monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);</LI>
<LI>handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;</LI>
<LI>weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (<LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results.

<P>We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses which we undertook.</P>

<P>We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.</P>
<P>We assessed the methods as:</P>
<UL>
<LI>low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk of bias (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</LI>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we planned to assess the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach</HEADING>
<P>For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach as outlined in the <A HREF="http://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org/central_prod/_design/client/handbook/handbook.html">GRADE handbook</A> in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes for the main comparison - X-ray pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or clinical pelvimetry in cephalic presentations.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Caesarean section</LI>
<LI>Perinatal mortality</LI>
<LI>Wound sepsis</LI>
<LI>Blood transfusion</LI>
<LI>Scar dehiscence</LI>
<LI>Admission to special care baby units</LI>
<LI>Apgar score less than seven at five minutes</LI>
</OL>
<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEpro</A> Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) in order to create a 'Summary of findings&#8217; table. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials to include in the analyses. However, in future updates of the review, if we identify suitable cluster-randomised trials, we will adjust their sample sizes or standard errors using the methods described in the <I>Handbook</I> Section 16.3.4 or 16.3.6 using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>Women with multiple pregnancies were not included in this review. If included in future updates, we will use cluster-trial methods as described above to adjust the data. Babies from multiple pregnancies may be more likely to develop the same outcomes (non-independence), so counting each as a separate data point may overestimate the sample size and make confidence intervals too narrow. We will regard each woman as a randomised cluster and use cluster-trial methods to adjust outcomes for the baby.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:43:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>).

<P>In future updates, if there is clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity is detected, we will use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary, if an average treatment effect across trials is considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary will be treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we will discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect is not clinically meaningful, we will not combine trials. If we use random-effects analyses, the results will be presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of Tau and I.</P>

There is no difference in perinatal mortality (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.90; 769 women; 3 trials). There was a slight decrease in perinatal asphyxia and perinatal mortality in <LINK REF="STD-Crichton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Crichton 1962</LINK>, but this decrease in perinatal mortality was not observed in <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1985</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Gaitan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Gaitan 2009</LINK>. Neither trial reported perinatal asphyxia. The decrease seen in <LINK REF="STD-Crichton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Crichton 1962</LINK> could be due to chance or lack in fetal monitoring.

There was an overall increase in the caesarean section rate in both studies in the X-ray pelvimetry groups (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.67; 390 women; 2 trials). There was a slight decrease in perinatal mortality, which could have occurred by chance, in <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1985</LINK>, but this was not observed in <LINK REF="STD-Thubisi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thubisi 1993</LINK> where there were no perinatal deaths in either group (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.91; 390 women; 2 trials). There were similar rates of scar dehiscence in the intervention and control groups (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.46; 390 women; 2 trials). <LINK REF="STD-Thubisi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thubisi 1993</LINK> reported a slight increase in admissions to special care baby units in the control group, but again these could have occurred by chance. <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1985</LINK> did not report this outcome.

There were not sufficient data to remove these trials from the other outcomes and maintain a meaningful analysis.</P>
<P>For the outcome caesarean section/symphysiotomy, removing the trial data widened the CIs and lessened the effect slightly (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.49), but the data still showed that women who had pelvimetry were more likely to have a caesarean section. Regarding the women without a previous caesarean section, removing <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1985</LINK> meant that the CIs crossed the line of no effect (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.47).</P>
<P>There were no perinatal deaths in either <LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1985</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Thubisi-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thubisi 1993</LINK>, so removing the data from the meta-analysis made no difference to the overall relative risk.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-22 11:31:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Five trials with a total of 1159 women were included. All used X-ray pelvimetry to assess the pelvis. X-ray pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or clinical pelvimetry is the only comparison included in this review due to the lack of trials identified that used other types or pelvimetry.</P>
<P>Women who received an X-ray pelvimetry, had a higher risk having a caesarean section, without a decrease in perinatal mortality. The control groups tended to a slightly raised perinatal mortality, but this could be due to chance. The numbers studied were insufficient to assess perinatal mortality adequately. No clear differences were found between groups for puerperal pyrexia, wound sepsis, blood transfusion, scar dehiscence, perinatal asphyxia or admission to special care baby unit. No trial reported Apgar score less than seven at five minutes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Parsons-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Parsons 1985</LINK> explains the increased perinatal mortality and asphyxia in <LINK REF="STD-Crichton-1962" TYPE="STUDY">Crichton 1962</LINK> by the lack of electronic fetal monitoring available to the women in Crichton's trial. The two deaths in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Richards-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1985</LINK> occurred in utero before the onset of labour.</P>
<P>Some of the outcomes in this review, relating to women with a previous caesarean, are difficult to interpret because they are mediated by another outcome, for example, wound sepsis and blood transfusion are only relevant to those women who have a caesarean section.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:46:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The trials are compatible with respect to the common measures of outcome. The small number of trials included in this review address the research question and do not support the use of X-ray pelvimetry, though they are of low quality, and there are no trials to assess the use of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pelvimetry. The paucity of trials assessing the effectiveness of all methods of pelvimetry, for both women with and without a previous caesarean, limits the applicability of this review. The majority of the few trials available are over 20 years old. This perhaps reflects how little pelvimetry is used by clinicians in current practice.</P>
<P>The trials were also conducted in a small number of countries (South Africa, Spain, and the USA) and therefore the findings may not be applicable to low-income settings.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-03-13 15:46:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trial designs regarding treatment allocation were of poor quality, assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. None of the trials blinded participants, staff or outcome assessors. The trials were not well-reported so it was difficult to assess the other 'Risk of bias' domains. The two trials in women with previous caesarean sections were performed at the same institution a few years apart. We have found that overall, the findings are at a moderate to high risk of bias. Please see <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK> for a summary of the risk of bias.</P>
<P>We used <A HREF="http://www.gradepro.org/">GRADEpro</A> software to grade evidence for our selected outcomes; for caesarean section we rated the evidence low quality and all the other outcomes, perinatal mortality, wound sepsis, blood transfusion, scar dehiscence and admission to special care baby unit as very low quality. Downgrading was due to risk of bias relating to lack of allocation concealment and blinding, and imprecision of effect estimates.

<P>We took steps to reduce bias as we are aware of the potential to introduce bias throughout the process of writing the review.

<P>The results of this review agree with another non-Cochrane systematic review that looked at clinical interventions, including X-ray pelvimetry, which increased vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) (<LINK REF="REF-Catling_x002d_Paull-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catling-Paull 2011</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Catling_x002d_Paull-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Catling-Paull 2011</LINK> found that X-ray pelvimetry was a poor predictor of birth outcome, and that women who received pelvimetry were less likely to attempt a vaginal birth.

<P>X-ray pelvimetry versus no pelvimetry or clinical pelvimetry is the only comparison included in this review due to the lack of trials identified that used other types or pelvimetry (e.g. other radiological examinations). There is not enough evidence to support the use of X-ray pelvimetry for deciding on the mode of delivery in women whose fetuses have a cephalic presentation, and the practice may be harmful to the mother by increasing the risk of having a caesarean section, without increasing the benefit to the fetus or neonate.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-02 13:46:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research should be directed towards defining whether there are specific clinical situations, for example, breech presentations, in which X-ray pelvimetry can be shown to be of value. Newer methods of pelvimetry should be subjected to randomised trials to assess their value.</P>
