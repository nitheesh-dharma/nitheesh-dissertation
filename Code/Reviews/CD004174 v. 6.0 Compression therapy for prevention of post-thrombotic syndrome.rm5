<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow through a vein. One in every three people with DVT will develop chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes in the legs, called post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Compression therapy with, for example, elastic compression stockings is used to try to reduce swelling and improve blood flow in the veins of the leg. People with DVT can reduce the chance of developing PTS by wearing elastic compression stockings. Our objective was to determine effectiveness and rate of complications when compression therapy is used in people with DVT for prevention of PTS.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics and key results</B>
</P>
<P>We identified 10 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy (current until March 2017). We combined five trials to assess our main outcome - PTS. We found that people with DVT who wear elastic compression stockings are less likely to develop PTS, and that compression did not lead to reduced incidence of severe PTS. We found no clear differences in occurrence of pulmonary embolism (blockage of the artery in the lung) nor in reports of recurrent DVT. Compression in the acute phase of DVT compared with "no compression" treatment did not significantly lower PTS incidence. Thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings. One trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence. Compression treatment did not seem to improve quality of life, except during the first nine days after DVT, but we could draw no real conclusions regarding this outcome. Side effects included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction. The study investigators reported no serious adverse events and indicated that compliance with use of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Although studies show a reduction in the number of people developing PTS, the quality of evidence is low because of considerable differences between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. Overall, the included studies were of poor methodological quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:46:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a long-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that is characterised by chronic pain, swelling, and skin changes in the affected limb. One of every three people with DVT will develop post-thrombotic complications within five years. Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome during the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and compression therapy. Clinicians and guidelines differ in their assessment of the utility of compression therapy for treatment of DVT. This is an update of a review first published in 2003.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:47:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 10 RCTs with a total of 2361 participants that evaluated compression therapy. The overall methodological quality of these trials was low. We used only five studies in meta-analysis owing to differences in intervention types and lack of data. Three studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg at the ankle) versus no intervention. Two studies compared elastic compression stockings (pressure 20 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. Overall, use of elastic compression stockings led to a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of PTS (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; 1393 participants; 5 studies; low-quality evidence); no reduction in the incidence of severe PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; 1224 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence); and no clear difference in DVT recurrence (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.28; 1212 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism because this information was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups included in individual studies (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Two studies evaluated effects of compression in the acute phase versus no compression treatment and found no differences in the incidence of PTS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.16; P = 0.2; 101 participants). One study reported that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection against development of PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants). Another trial reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence.</P>
<P>Two of the 10 included studies described patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems. The first study showed significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life with compression treatment (P &lt; 0.05) compared with bed rest, and the second study showed no differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Four studies poorly reported side effects (low-quality evidence) that included itching, erythema, and other forms of allergic reaction and described no serious adverse events. Compliance with wearing of compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:47:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings may reduce the occurrence of PTS after DVT. We downgraded the quality of evidence owing to considerable heterogeneity between studies and lack of or unclear risk of blinding due to clinical assessment scores. No serious adverse effects occurred in these studies. Large randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings because of current lack of high-quality evidence and considerable heterogeneity.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:50:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One out of every three people with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will develop post-thrombotic sequelae (complications resulting from a disease) within five years (<LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 2009</LINK>). Although no consensus has been reached on the definition provided in the literature, several scoring systems are used to define post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Porter-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Porter 1995</LINK>). The main item included in all definitions is (documented) DVT preceding chronic complaints of the leg(s). Complaints may include subjective symptoms of the legs (e.g. pain, cramps, heaviness, pruritus (itching), paraesthesia (sensation that makes it impossible to keep the leg still)); signs of stasis (pretibial oedema, redness, induration (hardening) of the skin, hyperpigmentation, new venous ectasia (dilatation), and pain during calf compression); and venous leg ulceration. All these complaints have an impact on quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Post-thrombotic syndrome seems to develop as the result of several factors such as deep vein obstruction, venous reflux (back flow of blood in the veins), calf muscle pump dysfunction, and abnormal microvasculature or lymphatic function (<LINK REF="REF-Haenen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haenen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prandoni-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prandoni 2009</LINK>). In the acute phase of DVT, a fresh thrombus in the deep vein produces an obstruction. During the first few months following onset of DVT, recanalisation - a complex process involving fibrinolysis (dissolving of a blood clot), thrombus organisation, and neovascularisation (proliferation of blood vessels) - may occur (<LINK REF="REF-Meissner-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meissner 2002</LINK>). This process can result in valve destruction. Damaged valves, insufficient closure, and/or occlusion of the veins increase pressure within the veins (venous hypertension). It is postulated that this venous hypertension disturbs normal blood flow in small capillaries, resulting in increased capillary filtration leading to ankle flare, oedema (swelling of tissue caused by excessive fluid in the subcutaneous tissue) in the lower leg, and various skin changes including dermatitis, lipodermatosclerosis, and white skin atrophy. (Lipodermatosclerosis is the term given to hardening of the skin, which may gain a red/brown pigmentation, that is accompanied by wasting of the subcutaneous fat. White skin atrophy consists of small depressions of ivory-coloured hard skin with stippled red spots.) Finally, this disturbed microcirculation may lead to a decrease in cutaneous oxygen concentration (TcPO<SUB>2</SUB>), contributing to delayed healing after injury to the skin, or leading to spontaneous breakdown of the skin (venous leg ulceration) (<LINK REF="REF-Guex-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guex 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neumann-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 1984</LINK>). These changes are called 'chronic venous insufficiency', and when DVT is the source of this insufficiency, the condition is called 'post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)'.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:50:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Several non-pharmaceutical measures are used for prevention of PTS in the acute phase of DVT. These include elevation of the legs and use of compression therapy. Compression therapy may consist of circular pressure on the leg applied with removable bandages or permanent bandages such as an adherent bandage or an Unna paste boot, medical elastic compression stockings, antithrombosis stockings, or an external intermittent pneumatic device (<LINK REF="REF-Brakkee-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brakkee 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neumann-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neumann 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Partsch-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 2001</LINK>). Medical elastic compression stockings are classified according to the amount of pressure that they exert (<LINK REF="REF-European-Committee-for-Standardization-_x0028_CEN_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">European Committee for Standardization (CEN)</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2017-09-18 13:50:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The mechanism of action of compression therapy of the legs is produced by one or more of the following: reduction of oedema, acceleration of venous blood flow, and improvement in venous pump function (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1991</LINK>). Very tight non-elastic bandages are used in an attempt to reverse venous hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1984b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1984b</LINK>). Although compression therapy is generally harmless, it can lead to complications. Pressure sores may develop if pressure is given at an extremely high level because such pressure will reduce blood supply to the skin (<LINK REF="REF-Kay-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1986</LINK>). Similarly, application of moderate pressure in people with impaired arterial blood supply to the legs may result in exacerbation of arterial insufficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Callam-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callam 1987</LINK>).</P>

<P>Three review authors (DA, DK, and EvL) independently assessed bias in all studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>), resolving disagreements by discussion. We examined five key domains for bias: selection bias; performance bias; attrition bias; detection bias; and reporting bias. We assessed these and classified them as having low risk of bias or high risk of bias. When a study provided insufficient detail for assessment of risk, we reported this as 'unclear' risk.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">'Summary of findings'</HEADING>
<P>We prepared a 'Summary of findings' table to present evidence for the use of compression in preventing PTS among participants with a diagnosis of DVT. We used no external information in generating the 'Assumed risk' column. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the evidence and to assign one of four levels of quality: high, moderate, low, or very low (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We required no departures from standard methods in generating these tables. We included the primary and secondary endpoints described under <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>: incidence of PTS; recurrence of DVT and PE; adverse effects; patient satisfaction and quality of life; and compliance rates. We chose these endpoints because we deemed them to be most clinically relevant. Outcomes such as adverse effects, patient satisfaction, and compliance reflect details of all comparisons and studies included in the review.

<P>We identified six studies for inclusion in this review update (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>We identified 10 RCTs that met all inclusion criteria with mean follow-up ranging from 2 to 6.3 years, and with a total of 2361 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). We identified no CCTs. </P>
<P>Two trials measured the incidence of PTS, comparing compression stockings versus placebo stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ginsberg included 47 participants one year after a diagnosed proximal DVT and compared the effectiveness of below-knee elastic compression stockings (20 to 30 mmHg pressure at the ankle) versus placebo stockings (one to two sizes too large) (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>). At the time of inclusion, participants did not have pain or swelling of the leg, but all had venous valvular insufficiency measured by plethysmography and/or Doppler ultrasonography. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as pain and swelling of the leg appearing during subsequent follow-up. The study included people with symptomatic (n = 33) and asymptomatic (n = 12) DVT; for two participants, the clinical presentation was unknown. Kahn included 806 patients presenting with a first symptomatic, proximal DVT, objectively confirmed on ultrasonography (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). Investigators treated DVT using standard anticoagulant therapy, equally for both groups. They compared active stockings (30 to 40 mmHg) versus placebo stockings. They applied stockings within two weeks of DVT diagnosis and asked participants to wear them daily for two years. Trial results show assessment of PTS from 6 to 24 months' follow-up, using Ginsberg&#8217;s criteria (leg pain and swelling of &#8805; 1 month's duration) and Villalta's score (score &#8805; 5 indicates PTS). Other secondary outcomes were presence of leg ulcers, objectively confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism, death, adverse events, venous valvular reflux, and quality of life.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Four trials compared compression therapy versus no intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aschwanden included 169 adults with first or recurrent proximal DVT confirmed by duplex ultrasonography (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>). Comparing compression stockings versus no stockings, they assessed post-thrombotic skin changes according to C4 or higher (clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology (CEAP) classification). As secondary outcomes, they assessed occurrence of symptoms related to PTS such as pain, heaviness, heat sensation, tension, and tiredness. Investigators randomised participants to either group after they had received a standard treatment regimen for six months after DVT, which also included compression stockings. Follow-up examinations took place every three months during the first year after inclusion, and from then on, every six months. Trialists censored recurrent DVT during follow-up from further analysis because of the need for compression stockings.<BR/>
<BR/>The Brandjes and Prandoni trials consisted of 194 and 180 participants, respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). Both studies compared graduated elastic compression stockings with ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg versus no intervention. Researchers randomised participants to either group one to three weeks after first proximal DVT. Assessment took place at least six-monthly for up to five years. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of PTS. Both studies used a self-developed scale for assessment of PTS (Brandjes Scale and Villalta Scale) that was based on symptoms and appearance of the affected leg. As secondary outcomes, they assessed both venous thromboembolism recurrence and treatment compliance.</P>
<P>Jayaraj included 69 participants within 48 hours of diagnosis of a first acute proximal DVT by duplex ultrasonography (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>). Participants underwent standard anticoagulation therapy for DVT and were randomised to treatment with graduated compression stockings (30 to 40 mmHg) or no stockings. Investigators used the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) and the Villalta score to assess PTS at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. They maintained compliance by providing telephone follow-up between study co-ordinator and participants, and by instructing participants to use a compliance calendar. They assessed no other secondary outcomes.</P>
<P>Two studies compared compression therapy versus no intervention in the acute stage of DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>In their three-part study, Partsch et al randomised 53 participants with confirmed first proximal DVT to three groups (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>). They compared inelastic compression bandages (Unna boots on the lower leg, adhesive bandages on the thigh), thigh-length compression stockings (class II, 30 mmHg), and bed rest without compression for nine days. They instructed groups A and B to stay mobile. At first, primary outcomes were pain reduction and leg circumference between baseline and day nine; on both days, investigators objectively assessed the presence of PE and the extent of DVT by performing ventilation-perfusion lung scintography and duplex ultrasonography, respectively. They assessed patient well-being and quality of life in the first nine days after DVT. After nine days, all participants received class II elastic compression stockings (thigh-length or knee-length, depending on thigh oedema). Independent observers re-evaluated 37 study participants after two years: 11 in the bed rest group, 13 in the bandage group, and 13 in the stocking group. They assessed PTS incidence using the Villalta Scale, for which they combined bandaging and stocking groups of the acute phase (= active group) for comparison with groups treated with bed rest without compression. They carried out clinical and venous duplex investigations.</P>
<P>Roumen-Klappe evaluated compression treatment in the acute phase of first proximal and distal DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). Researchers included 69 patients with acute symptomatic DVT. All participants received standard anticoagulant DVT therapy for three months and were randomised to immediate multi-layer bandaging or no bandaging in the acute phase. Investigators encouraged all participants to walk as much as possible. After reduction of oedema, they applied sized-to-fit elastic stockings for all participants after 7 to 14 days and instructed participants to wear these for at least two years. When participants were assigned to no immediate bandaging but oedema was persistent after 10 days, study authors applied bandaging after all. They planned follow-up after 7, 30, and 90 days and at 1 year. After 1 year, they evaluated participants for clinical PTS using both the clinical CEAP classification (with PTS defined as C3 or higher) and the Villalta Scale. They did not assess recurrence of DVT or PE, nor did they evaluate compliance with compression therapy.</P>
<P>Another study compared thigh-length versus knee-length compression stockings, both worn for two years (30 to 40 mmHg), starting the first week after DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>). This study included 267 participants with a first episode of symptomatic proximal DVT, as confirmed by ultrasonography. The primary outcome was 3-year cumulative incidence of PTS, which investigators assessed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the acute episode, using the Villalta Scale (score &#8805; 5 indicates PTS). They recorded recurrent venous thromboembolism as well. In addition, researchers assessed compliance with assigned compression stockings and their tolerability (including adverse effects) by instructing participants to record this information every day in a booklet. Compliance was satisfactory if stockings were used at least 70% of the time during the day.</P>
<P>The non-inferiority trial of Mol compared 1-year versus 2-year use of compression stockings; the main outcome measure was incidence of PTS 24 months after diagnosis of first proximal DVT, assessed by the Villalta Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>). Secondary outcomes were adherence to use of stockings during study follow-up, recurrent DVT, death, and quality of life assessed using the VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire. Investigators randomly assigned participants to continue or stop wearing compression stockings 1 year after the index DVT. They scheduled follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months from the baseline visit.</P>

<P>The included studies had low to moderate overall risk of bias; highest risk involved performance bias for subjective outcomes because participants were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). Selection bias was generally low because most studies concealed allocation to treatments, but risk was unclear for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). Risk of attrition bias was unclear among half of the included studies because researchers did not always describe loss to follow-up clearly (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>), but most studies used survival curves to deal with loss to follow-up, and we therefore believe that this approach did not introduce high risk of bias.

Investigators assessed the outcome PTS by using scoring systems that contained both subjective and objective criteria. Subjective criteria, most of which consist of patient-reported items, introduce high risk of bias when participants are not blinded. Use of placebo stockings, as done by two studies could potentially avoid this bias (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). However, participant awareness of the allocated treatment could still influence subjective outcomes in a way. Kahn correctly blinded participants, but 41% were allocated to the active stockings group and correctly guessed the group to which they belonged, compared with 17% of the placebo group (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). For this reason, we assessed this bias as unclear. For objective criteria, lack of blinding of outcome assessors may influence the incidence of PTS. <BR/>

<P>Five studies had unclear risk of bias, and the other five had low risk of bias. When necessary, appropriate survival analysis with censoring of loss to follow-up was performed. Reasons for loss to follow-up were usually mentioned in flow diagrams. Numbers and reasons for loss to follow-up were generally balanced across groups. When sufficiently reported and balanced across groups, loss to follow-up did not represent a risk. We excluded one study from meta-analysis owing to lack of data because investigators did not report exact numbers and presented only hazard ratios (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study did not fully describe loss to follow-up, but indicated that three people in the active stockings group died (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>). Another study had a high rate of attrition in both intervention and control groups, with the latter showing greatest loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>). However, investigators conducted Kaplan-Meier analyses to deal with censored cases; therefore, we did not classify this study as being at high risk. In another study, 186 participants were lost owing to withdrawal, death, and loss to follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). Although researchers conducted a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to deal with censored cases, the description of reasons for loss to follow-up was very brief, so it is unclear whether reasons for withdrawal were related to outcomes. Prandoni presented a flow diagram that did not provide clear reasons for exclusion (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). Six participants withdrew, which still leaves unexplained losses to follow-up. Trial authors stated that three participants died of PE but did not describe their treatment groups, omitting relevant information. In a later study, Prandoni did not further specify reasons for loss to follow-up, which was higher in the thigh-length group than in the below-knee group (eight vs three) (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>).

<P>All studies reported on post-thrombotic syndrome, but we were unable to combine all 10 in our meta-analysis.</P>
<P>We did not include two studies in the overall meta-analysis, as investigators studied effects of different kinds of compression therapy during the acute phase of DVT, after which all participants received compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). This treatment regimen differed from that used in the other studies. Therefore we pooled these data separately. We did not include three other studies in our meta-analysis, the first because investigators did not include a control group that would enable them to determine any beneficial effect of compression therapy (placebo stockings or no treatment) but instead compared thigh-length versus knee-length compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>). We omitted another study from our meta-analysis because researchers compared two different durations of use of the same compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>). We excluded a third study because researchers did not present specific numbers and we could not retrieve risk ratios (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>).

<P>After performing subgroup analysis for which we grouped studies with similar populations, we found that one study was the main cause of heterogeneity in our meta-analysis (subgroup difference P &lt; 0.0001), possibly because it included a much larger study population than was included in the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>).

See <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>.</P>
<P>Thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6; 267 participants; 1 study). See <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>.</P>

<P>Results of individual studies are detailed below.</P>
<P>In the Aschwanden study, 11 participants (13.1%) in the stockings group and 17 (20.0%) in the control group developed PTS (P &lt; 0.19) (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>). Trialists did not provide exact differentiation between mild, moderate, and severe PTS. Seventeen participants in the control group developed dermatoliposclerosis (C4b). Study authors reported no venous ulcerations.</P>
<P>In the study by Brandjes, PTS occurred in 19 (20%) of 96 participants treated with stockings and was considered severe in 11 participants; corresponding numbers in the control group were 46 (47%) of 98 participants, 23 of whom had severe PTS (<LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>). Prandoni obtained similar results in his study (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84) (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). PTS occurred in 23 (26%) of 90 participants treated with stockings and was considered severe in three participants. In the control group, 44 (49%) of 90 participants developed PTS and 10 participants had severe PTS. Risk reduction for any, and for severe, PTS was highly statistically significant at P &lt; 0.001. Although 12 participants In the control group wore stockings (12 to 18 mmHg), a significant difference in outcomes favoured the stockings group (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the Ginsberg trial, none of the 24 participants in the active stocking group were considered treatment failures (PTS was considered treatment failure) compared with one (4.3%) of 23 participants treated with placebo stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In another study, the cumulative incidence of PTS at two years (750 days) was 14.2% in the active stockings group and 12.7% in the placebo group (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.76; P = 0.58) (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). Using the Villalta Scale, investigators found a two-year cumulative incidence of PTS of 52.6% in the active stockings group and 52.3% in the placebo group (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.24; P = 096). PTS was severe in 27 and 20 participants in the stockings group and the placebo group, respectively. PTS severity did not differ between groups. In each group, 17 ulcers developed.</P>
<P>Jayaraj reported that the cumulative incidence of PTS depended on which cutoff point was used during follow-up for diagnosis of PTS (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>). Study authors did not report specific data but found no statistically significant difference in PTS incidence between the two groups. At two years' follow-up, general cumulative incidence based on the Villalta score was high (65% to 80%) compared with that based on the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (20% to 40%).</P>
<P>Partsch found significantly lower median Villalta scores in the mobile group than in the bed rest group (P &lt; 0.01) (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>). PTS developed in 54% (14 of 26) in the mobile group (bandages or stockings) and in 82% (9 of 11) in the bed rest group. This difference was not significant. Investigators reported no cases of severe PTS.</P>
<P>Another trial used two measures to assess PTS up to a year (<LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). Using CEAP classification, investigators found a PTS incidence of 39% in participants with bandages and 42% in those without bandages (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.56). The Villalta score showed that the incidence of PTS was 29% and 33%, respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.8). Severity of PTS did not differ between groups. Study authors reported no cases of severe PTS.</P>
<P>Prandoni found that the three-year cumulative incidence of PTS was 33.9% in the thigh-length group and 36.7% in the below-knee group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.41) (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>). PTS developed in 32.6% (44 of 135) of participants in the thigh-length compression stockings group and in 35.6% (47 of 132) of those in the below-knee group. Severe PTS developed in three participants in each group.</P>
<P>Mol reported that wearing compression stockings for two years seemed to be superior to wearing them for one year in terms of PTS incidence after DVT (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.5; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.29; P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>).</P>

Adherence to stockings was 76% (73 of 96) up to two years in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>). Jayaraj reported compliance with stockings of 80% at six months, 70% at one year, and 60% at two years (<LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>). Kahn reported that compliance with either stockings was 70% at one-year follow-up and 56% at two years (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). Partsch found better compliance in the bed rest group than in the active group (73% vs 50%) (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>). In their first study, Prandoni and colleagues stated that 78 (out of 90 participants) wore their stockings for at least 80% of daytime hours during the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). In their other study, Prandoni provided data showing that rates of compliance with thigh-length and knee-length stockings were 67% (90 of 135) and 83% (109 of 132), respectively (P = 0.003) (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-09-18 14:10:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Results of this systematic review show that use of elastic compression stockings reduces the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.01; P = 0.05; low-quality evidence) but not the severity of PTS (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.15; P = 0.21; low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>Compression in the acute phase of DVT did not seem to reduce PTS incidence, but these results were based on two studies with small sample sizes (<LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). In both studies, all participants received compression stockings after initial compression treatment during the acute phase of DVT. This could have led to a lower overall incidence of PTS in both groups and could have diminished between-group differences. Compliance with stockings in was higher in the bed rest group than in the active group in <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>. This may have masked a potential beneficial effect of early compression therapy on later PTS incidence in the active group. Another group used DVT symptoms as one of its outcomes (<LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). However, investigators did not fully specify which symptoms were used and how they scored these. This made it difficult to interpret presented results on this outcome. Aschwanden also included patients with recurrent DVT, which in theory could lead to a higher incidence of PTS (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>). However, this group defined post-thrombotic skin changes of C4 or higher (clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology (CEAP) classification) as its endpoint and did not include changes of C3 or lower. This group also added compression stockings to standard DVT therapy before randomising participants to treatment groups. These factors may have led to a lower incidence of PTS in this study. Results showed that only women seemed to benefit from wearing stockings for prevention of PTS; this could be explained by the much lower rate of compliance among men in this study (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>). Another group described a substantial difference between PTS incidence rates based on the Ginsberg or Villalta Scale score, with the latter accounting for a five times higher incidence (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). This can be explained by the fact that the Ginsberg score is more specific for measuring severe PTS (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soosainathan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soosainathan 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Included studies showed considerable heterogeneity, with only one study finding no statistically significant effects of compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). This study included one of the largest sample sizes but described low compliance. Although study authors found no significant difference in PTS incidence when analysing subgroups of compliant and frequent stocking users (hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.74), their conclusion that compression stockings do not lower PTS incidence has to be interpreted with caution. We performed subgroup analyses based on study populations of similar size; one subgroup contained four studies and showed a reduction of PTS in the compression group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.66; P &lt; 0.00001); the second subgroup contained only one study and showed no differences in PTS (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.86, 1.18; P = 0.91) (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). See <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. Other possible contributors to this heterogeneity are inclusion of unblinded studies (see section on blinding in studies under <LINK TAG="QUALITY_ASSESSMENT" TYPE="SECTION">Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</LINK>), variety in follow-up, and variation in length of time following diagnosis of DVT before randomisation for compression. Researchers started compression therapy during the first few weeks after DVT, but one study provided compression starting one year after diagnosis of DVT (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>). This could in theory lead to a higher overall incidence of PTS.</P>
<P>We found no differences in DVT recurrence (P = 0.69; low-quality evidence). We did not pool data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) because this was poorly reported, but we observed no differences between groups in individual studies (low-quality evidence). One study indicated that high-length stockings did not provide better protection against PTS than knee-length stockings (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28; P = 0.6) (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the 10 included studies reported patient satisfaction and quality of life (moderate-quality evidence), using different measurement systems; the first study noted significant improvement in well-being and DVT-related quality of life when comparing compression treatment versus bed rest (P &lt; 0.05), and the second study reported no significant differences in quality of life scores between compression and placebo groups. Compliance with compression stockings was generally high but varied across studies. Researchers reported no serious adverse effects after compression therapy was initiated.</P>
<P>In general, adverse effects of stockings do not often occur. Most frequently reported adverse effects (in four studies) were itching, erythema, rash, and other forms of allergic reaction (low-quality evidence).</P>
<P>We included only one trial investigating the duration of compression treatment; these researchers concluded that wearing compression stockings for one year was not non-inferior to wearing them for two years (<LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>). One large trial that is also studying the duration of compression treatment is ongoing; we will include this trial in future updates (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01429714" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01429714</LINK>).<BR/>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2017-09-18 14:01:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our literature search, which included all languages, yielded 10 randomised controlled trials dedicated to the prevention of such a prevalent disorder as PTS. At first glance, it seemed that these studies were conflicting. Ginsberg concluded that most participants had no PTS one year after proximal DVT and did not require use of elastic compression stockings (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>). However, this study included people with asymptomatic DVT who carry low risk for PTS. In fact, in a subpopulation of participants with symptomatic DVT, these investigators assessed the prevalence of PTS (using a different, non-validated, and possibly less sensitive scale) as 27%, and as not distinctly different from both other studies. Another important difference is the use of stockings one to two sizes too large instead of no intervention. This might have diminished the contrast between treatment groups, in that even a stocking that is too large will certainly provide some compression (<LINK REF="REF-Compression-Bulletin" TYPE="REFERENCE">Compression Bulletin</LINK>). Indeed, it has been shown that stockings that are one or two sizes too large exert considerable pressure when compared with stockings without elastic threads. Moreover, the therapeutic stocking used exerted pressure of 20 to 30 mmHg at the ankle region. This is less than the pressure applied in other studies, which compared a stocking with an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg. In addition, in this study, stockings were provided only at one year after the index thrombosis (i.e. at a time point when most people might already have developed PTS), and a much less preventive effect could be achieved. In the previous version of this review, we analysed data on thigh-high and knee-length stockings together because study authors reported no superiority of thigh-high stockings upon measuring venous pressure and foot volume (<LINK REF="REF-Partsch-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Partsch 1984</LINK>). A more recent study also found that thigh-length stockings did not provide better protection than below-knee stockings, and that lower tolerability of thigh-length stockings can lead to discontinuation (<LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2012</LINK>). All included trials and results are relevant to our review questions. High-quality evidence needed to fully support the use of compression therapy in prevention of PTS is lacking, and any conclusions drawn from current evidence should be interpreted with care.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-09-18 14:01:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Our review is limited by considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the included studies and by use of different scoring systems for assessment of PTS. Therefore we judged evidence for the incidence of PTS and severe PTS, recurrence of DVT, incidence of PE, adverse effects, and compliance to be of low quality. We judged the outcomes of patient satisfaction and quality of life to be of moderate quality. We downgraded these because of risk of bias and significant heterogeneity among studies. For this reason, pooled results of our meta-analyses should be interpreted with caution. See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>.</P>

Searching of the literature was extensive, but it remains possible that relevant data were not included in this review because they were not published or were not found during the search.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2017-09-18 14:01:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found six other reviews that used the same main outcome measure (<LINK REF="REF-Berntsen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berntsen 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giannoukas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannoukas 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Musani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musani 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tie 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two reviews - <LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Musani-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musani 2010</LINK> - included studies that we also included in our review (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). These review authors concluded that compression treatment reduced the incidence of PTS, particularly of severe PTS. We did not reach the same conclusion for severe PTS, presumably because we included one, more recent study for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>). Two other reviews - <LINK REF="REF-Giannoukas-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giannoukas 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Tie-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tie 2015</LINK> - drew very similar conclusions to those presented in our review and addressed the same problems that we encountered (mostly heterogeneity), as they included the same studies (<LINK REF="STD-Aschwanden-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Aschwanden 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brandjes-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Brandjes 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jayaraj-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Jayaraj 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Partsch-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Partsch 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Roumen_x002d_Klappe-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Roumen-Klappe 2009</LINK>). Both of these reviews concluded that compression therapy reduced the overall incidence of PTS, but not of severe PTS specifically. Two recent reviews were also reluctant to draw firm conclusions based on current evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Berntsen-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berntsen 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2016</LINK>). These review authors found no reduction in the incidence of PTS with compression treatment. One of these reviews - <LINK REF="REF-Jin-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jin 2016</LINK> - analysed only studies using the Villalta or Ginsberg scoring system, for which they made two subgroups (<LINK REF="STD-Ginsberg-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Ginsberg 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kahn-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Kahn 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prandoni-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Prandoni 2004</LINK>). These findings confirm the need to use a single scoring system in future trials; review authors recommend using the Villalta Scale.<BR/>

<P>Low-quality evidence suggests that elastic compression stockings reduce the occurrence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Included studies have reported no serious adverse effects and generally high compliance. Thigh-length stockings do not provide better protection than knee-length stockings against development of PTS and recurrence of DVT, according to one study. Quality of life was not significantly improved with compression stockings, except in the first nine days after DVT. In terms of PTS incidence, wearing these stockings for two years is likely the better choice over wearing them for one year, according to one non-inferiority trial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-09-18 14:01:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Larger randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trials are needed to confirm the findings of this review because currently high-quality evidence is lacking and heterogeneity is considerable. It is uncertain whether stockings should be prescribed immediately or after compression bandaging during the acute phase (one to two weeks) of DVT. In addition, it is important to study how long stockings must be worn. We found only one trial on this topic that we could include (<LINK REF="STD-Mol-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Mol 2016</LINK>) and one ongoing trial that is studying duration of compression (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01429714" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01429714</LINK>), highlighting the need for additional trials conducted to explore this matter. We also identified a need for researchers to compare elastic compression stockings versus different compression classes for prevention of PTS. None of the included studies assessed costs. Most compared the use of compression stockings versus other forms of compression therapy or versus no compression therapy. Future trials conducted to compare stockings and to evaluate their use versus other forms of non-pharmaceutical treatment (e.g. intermittent pneumatic compression) are warranted. Assessment of cost perspectives could prove useful for future researchers. Differences among measurement scales used give rise to variability of PTS incidence. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to correctly combine data. Future studies should use one single measurement scale, for which we advise using the Villalta Scale (<LINK REF="REF-Kahn-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kahn 2009</LINK>).</P>

<P>Control group will receive care using elastic compression stocking, and intervention group will use the ACTitouch device (pneumatic compression).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Device: The ACTitouch device is applied to the lower leg (calf, ankle, and foot) and consists of an undersock worn against the skin, a compression sleeve containing 4 inflatable chambers, and a controller unit. The controller provides airflow to inflate the chambers and monitors and adjusts chamber pressure to maintain intended treatment pressures.</LI>
<LI>Device: Compression garments (stockings) now serve as the generally recommended standard of care for participants post DVT and will be utilised as the control compression method in this study. Compression garments utilised in this study will be "below the knee" style with a pressure range of 30 to 40 mmHg. If a participant does not have compression garments as indicated, these stockings will be provided.</LI>

<P>I found this review interesting and very useful.</P>
<P>You mentioned in the Results section, secondary outcomes: No information was available in those three studies about recurrence of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, compliance with compression therapy, or costs.</P>
<P>I wonder whether this involves Brandjes study 1997, as in this study the authors found no difference in the recurrence rate of DVT between both groups of the study (14 of the 96 patients in the stocking group and 13 of the 98 patients in the control group developed documented recurrence of venous thromboembolism)?</P>
<P>Regarding assessment of compliance the authors of the same study reported that 73 of the 96 patients always wore their stockings a further 16 patients usually wore the stockings.</P>

<P>Further to my previous correspondence (earlier today 25/08/05), I have had chance to read Pandoni's 2004 paper. Again about the same point of secondary outcomes, the authors of this study reported 25 cases of confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolic complications (12 patients in the elastic group and 13 in the control group).</P>
<P>The authors reported as well that 78 patients out of 90 used their stockings for at least 80% of daytime hours; I think this is a good compliance rate.</P>
<P>Thanks in advance for clarifying those points.</P>
