<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic crashes are a major problem worldwide. In high-income countries, traffic calming schemes aim to make the roads safer (particularly for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists) in areas that are particular 'hot spots'. Strategies include slowing down traffic (eg road/speed humps, mini-roundabouts, reduced speed limit zones), visual changes (road surface treatment, changes to road lighting), redistributing traffic (blocking roads, creating one-way streets), and/or changes to road environments (such as trees). This review found that area-wide traffic calming may have the potential to reduce death and injuries, but more research is needed particularly in low and middle income countries.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>It is estimated that by 2020 road traffic crashes will have moved from ninth to third in the world disease burden ranking, as measured in disability adjusted life years, and to second in developing countries.

</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched the the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and TRANSPORT. We searched the web sites of road safety organisations, handsearched conference proceedings, checked reference lists of relevant papers and contacted experts in the area. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The searches were last updated in 2008.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-29 14:19:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>Randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies of area-wide traffic calming schemes.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data on type of study, characteristics of intervention and control areas, and length of data collection periods. Before and after data were collected on the total number of road traffic crashes, all road user deaths and injuries, pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions and road user deaths. The results of each study were expressed as rate ratios. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We found no randomised controlled trials, but 22 controlled before-and-after studies met our inclusion criteria. Seven studies were conducted in Germany, seven in the UK, two in Australia, two in the Netherlands, two in Denmark, one in Japan, and one in Spain. There were no studies in low or middle income countries. Nine trials reported the number of road traffic crashes resulting in deaths; pooled rate ratio 0.79 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.68). Eighteen studies reported the number of road traffic crashes resulting in injuries (fatal and non-fatal); pooled rate ratio 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.96). Twelve studies reported the total number of road traffic crashes; pooled rate ratio 0.89 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.05). Fourteen trials reported the number of pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions; pooled rate ratio 1.01 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.16). There was evidence of significant heterogeneity for the total number of crashes and road user injuries outcomes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:45:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The results from this review suggest that area-wide traffic calming in towns and cities may be a promising intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths. However, further rigorous evaluations of such interventions are needed.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The global epidemic of road traffic deaths and injuries is only just beginning. At present, an estimated 1.23 million people die each year and between 20 and 50 million suffer non-fatal road injuries (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). For people under 44 years, road traffic crashes are a leading cause of death and disablement second only to HIV and AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Krug-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krug 2002</LINK>). Moreover, many developing countries are still at comparatively low levels of motorisation and the situation in these countries can only be expected to get worse as motorisation increases. In 1995, road death rates in China were similar to those in the United States, but there were only five vehicles per 1000 population in China compared with 770 vehicles per 1000 in the United States (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1995</LINK>). It is estimated that by 2020 road traffic crashes will have moved from ninth to third in the world disease burden ranking, as measured in disability adjusted life years (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). Most of the road deaths in developing countries involve vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. In Ethiopia, pedestrian injuries account for 84% of all road traffic fatalities compared with 32% in Britain and 15% in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Barss-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barss 1998</LINK>). In the heavily motorised countries drivers and passengers account for the majority of road deaths but pedestrians account for a large proportion of road deaths involving children. The identification of effective strategies for the prevention of road traffic injuries is of global health importance.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-03-24 15:59:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Katharine Ker">
<P>In urban areas many road traffic crashes are scattered widely, and in such situations traditional treatments for high-risk sites are not appropriate. In high income countries, area-wide traffic calming schemes, including the treatment of both main roads and residential roads, have been proposed as one strategy for reducing scattered crashes. Such schemes aim to discourage through traffic on residential roads and make the roads safer, particularly for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-08-06 12:12:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>A previous meta-analysis found that area-wide traffic calming schemes on average reduce the number of injury crashes by about 15% (<LINK REF="REF-Elvik-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elvik 2001</LINK>). However, this study included uncontrolled before-after studies in which the effect of traffic calming could be confounded by the effect of other concurrent changes in road traffic injury rates. For example, in many high income countries pedestrian injury rates have fallen because walking has become a less popular way of travelling. In this case, the inclusion of uncontrolled studies could exaggerate the apparent effect of traffic calming. We conducted a systematic review of area-wide traffic calming including only controlled before-after studies.</P>

<P>Studies were included if they involved either of the following research designs:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trial (RCT)</LI>
<LI>Controlled before and after study (CBA)</LI>
</UL>
<P>The definition of CBA is based on that used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group and is given below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>RCT: A study involving at least one test and one control treatment, concurrent enrolment and follow-up of the test- and control-treated groups, and in which the treatments to be administered are selected by a random process, such as the use of a random numbers table (coin flips are also acceptable). If the author(s) state explicitly (usually by using some variant of the term 'random' to describe the allocation procedure used) that the groups compared in the trial were established by random allocation, then the trial is classified as 'RCT'. Treatment allocations using odd-even numbers, days of the week, or other such pseudo- or quasi-random processes, are designated as quasi-randomised.</LI>
<LI>CBA: A design where there is contemporaneous data collection before and after the intervention and an appropriate control site or activity.</LI>

<LI>Redistribution of traffic or alteration to road hierarchy, (e.g. permanent or temporary blocking of road, diagonal blocks, gateways, creation of one-way streets, re-introduction of two-way streets, four-way stops)</LI>
<LI>Changes to road environment (increased vegetation (trees, shrubs) along road, introduction of street furniture).</LI>
<LI>Reduced speed limit zones (e.g. 20-mph zones, 30 km/h zones) where speeds are physically limited by traffic calming measures.</LI>
</UL>
<P>We excluded studies evaluating single interventions or those looking solely at the following interventions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Enforcement of legal interventions (enforcement of speed limits, increased fines for speeding, speed cameras (mock or real), educational programmes aimed at altering driver or pedestrian behaviour, or interventions involving vehicle design changes).</LI>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:32:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>One author examined titles, abstracts, and keywords of citations, as given on electronic databases, for eligibility. Where possible, we obtained the full text of all possible relevant citations. One author decided whether studies met the inclusion criteria, and this was checked by a second author.</P>
</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data from each eligible study using a standard form. Data were extracted on the type of study (e.g. RCT, CBA), characteristics of intervention and control areas, the types of intervention, duration of follow up and the outcomes evaluated. Differences found in data extraction were resolved by discussion. Where necessary, we sought additional information from researchers involved in the studies.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-07-10 16:26:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The assessment of the quality of non-randomised trials is problematic. Controlled before-after studies are recognised to be methodologically weaker than randomised controlled trials, and few quality assessment tools exist. In this review we assessed the quality of the CBAs by extracting data on how well the intervention and control areas were matched, and the length of the before and after data collection periods. Because of the potential for contamination, we also noted the distance between the intervention and control areas.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The results of each study are expressed as rate ratios. The rate ratio is the ratio of event rates post and pre intervention in the intervention area divided by the corresponding post to pre intervention event ratio in the control area. Provided that any changes in the population at risk are the same in both control and intervention areas, the rate ratio gives the reduction in the event rate in the intervention area compared to that in the control area. For example, a rate ratio of 0.8 corresponds to a 20% reduction in events in the intervention area compared to that predicted from the rates in the control area.</P>
<P>We calculated standard errors for logarithms of rate ratios and hence 95% confidence intervals for rate ratios, assuming that the number of events in each area in each period followed a Poisson distribution.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We examined statistical heterogeneity by using both the I-squared and Chi<SUP>2</SUP> tests. The I<SUP>2</SUP> test describes the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity; substantial heterogeneity is considered to exist when I<SUP>2</SUP> &gt; 50% (<A HREF="http://130.226.106.162/sections/documents/view?version=5C890A6E82E26AA2004DD5A172740102&amp;format=REVMAN#REF-Higgins-2008">Higgins 2008</A>). For the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, we used a P value of &lt; 0.10 to indicate the presence of statistically significant heterogeneity.</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:48:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Using the generic inverse variance method in <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager</LINK>, we combined the rate ratios on a logarithmic scale using a random effects meta-analysis model. The assumption of random effects both allows for the anticipated heterogeneity between effects across studies and provides robustness if the assumption that events follow Poisson distributions is violated through overdispersion.</P>
<P>In the analysis of road user deaths, where the majority of studies had no events in at least one period, no test of heterogeneity was carried out and a pooled estimate of the rate ratio was obtained from the column totals. The confidence interval for this estimate would, in expectation, be too narrow since the method ignores the likely heterogeneity between studies. However, under the circumstances of many zero observations, this method has some advantage over the alternative of adding 0.5 when observing zero.</P>

<P>In all the studies in this review the areas involved were predominantly residential, often located close to the central commercial sector of a large town or city. Area-wide traffic calming involved a reclassification of the streets in the area, aiming to move through traffic away from residential streets and concentrate it on roads that were classified as main roads. In all studies a combination of traffic calming measures was used, including interventions such as road closures, changes to junctions, changes to the road environment (for example with traffic humps or chicanes), improvement in pedestrian crossing facilities and the use of mini-roundabouts. Seven studies were conducted in Germany (<LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Borgentreich-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Borgentreich 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Buxtehude-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Buxtehude 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Charlottenburg-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Charlottenburg 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Esslingen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Esslingen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Mainz-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Mainz 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Moabit-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Moabit 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-GST_x002d_Ingolstadt-1993" TYPE="STUDY">GST-Ingolstadt 1993</LINK>), seven in the UK (<LINK REF="STD-London-2007" TYPE="STUDY">London 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Swindon-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Swindon 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USP-Bradford-1989" TYPE="STUDY">USP Bradford 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USP-Bristol-1989" TYPE="STUDY">USP Bristol 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USP-Nelson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">USP Nelson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USP-Reading-1989" TYPE="STUDY">USP Reading 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USP-Sheffield-1989" TYPE="STUDY">USP Sheffield 1989</LINK>), two in Australia (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney_x002d_Canterbury-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney-Canterbury 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sydney_x002d_Willoughby-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney-Willoughby 1990</LINK>), two in the Netherlands (<LINK REF="STD-Rijswijk_x002f_Eindhoven-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Rijswijk/Eindhoven 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-The-Netherlands-1992" TYPE="STUDY">The Netherlands 1992</LINK>), two in Denmark (<LINK REF="STD-Denmark-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Denmark 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-M_x00f8_rkh_x00f8_j-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mørkhøj 2001</LINK>), one in Japan (<LINK REF="STD-Osaka-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Osaka 1998</LINK>), and one in Spain (<LINK REF="STD-Madrid-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Madrid 2006</LINK>).

For each town a five year 'before' period was used to detect trends and seasonal variation in the crash pattern and so to establish a range of crashes that might be expected in the 'after' period had the project not taken place. Two years of after data were collected. Any differences in crash-rate between the 'before' and 'after' periods was taken to be due to a combination of system-wide secular effects, random effects and the effects of the scheme itself. The criteria used for choosing the areas in the project were that they were of average risk, had a range of residential network types, and were large enough to show the interaction between main road and residential road traffic redistribution. A second area with similar crash and network characteristics was chosen for the control. The areas were not immediately adjacent. Data on the number of crashes and injuries were collected from police records. Incidence of crashes and injuries in the intervention and control areas were fairly well matched for the before period.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Perceived safety</HEADING>
<P>Two trials looked at residents' perceptions of safety before and after the schemes. In one (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney_x002d_Willoughby-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney-Willoughby 1990</LINK>), almost 80% of those who responded (response rate of 43%) supported the council's policy of improving residential safety by reducing the volume of through traffic. However, only 64% supported the permanent installation of the trial scheme. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Sydney_x002d_Canterbury-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Sydney-Canterbury 1990</LINK>), the majority of residents who responded (65%) felt that the level of safety had remained constant or diminished.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The results of this systematic review of controlled before-after studies shows that area-wide traffic calming schemes may have the potential to reduce road traffic deaths and injuries. Although the effect on road traffic injury deaths alone was in the same direction and of a similar magnitude, the number of road deaths in the included studies was low, and the estimate is likely to be too narrow since the method used ignored the likely heterogeneity between the studies. As very few studies reported the number of deaths and injuries for the different categories of road user (pedestrians, cyclists and vehicle occupants) it was not possible to examine the effect of traffic calming by road user category. Although there was no evidence that traffic calming schemes prevent pedestrian-motor collisions, the possibility that they might reduce the occurrence of pedestrian injury cannot be excluded. An important effect of traffic calming schemes is to reduce the speed of traffic, in which case traffic calming might still reduce the likelihood of injury in the event of a collision.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Road traffic crashes are a major cause of death and injury in low and middle income countries. With increasing motorisation in these countries the problem is likely to get worse. In low income countries the majority of casualties are not motor vehicle occupants; they are pedestrians, cyclists and riders of motorised two-wheelers. Compared to educationally based road safety interventions, area-wide traffic calming appears to be a more promising intervention for reducing traffic injuries and deaths. However, further rigorous evaluation is required, particularly in middle and lower income countries.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2009-08-04 17:51:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The validity of a systematic review also depends importantly on the validity of the included studies. Although we found no randomised controlled trials of traffic calming schemes, the inclusion of studies with well matched intervention and control areas, with adequate before and after periods, may avoid the problem of confounding by changes in the background rate of injury. All of the included studies collected at least one year before and two years after data, with a number collecting up to six years of before or after data.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>There are a number of methodological issues that could have an important bearing on the validity of these results. Publication and other selection biases are a potential threat to validity in all systematic reviews but this is a particular problem in road safety where a large proportion of the available research information is published in the grey literature of the road safety research organisations. There are also problems identifying the published controlled studies in the road safety databases (<LINK REF="REF-Wentz-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wentz 2001</LINK>). Search strategies for identifying controlled studies in medical databases can achieve high sensitivity and positive predictive value because terms describing the study methodology are included among the indexing (descriptor) terms. Road safety databases however, have a very limited range of indexing terms describing the study methodology. Because of these problems we used only limited methodological search terms when searching the TRANSPORT databases but screened all studies of traffic calming schemes for eligibility. Nevertheless, despite our considerable efforts to identity all eligible studies, published and unpublished and irrespective of language of publication, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias.</P>
<P>Although we chose to pool the data in a random effects meta-analysis, because there was significant heterogeneity for both the pooled number of road traffic crashes and the number of road traffic crashes resulting in injuries, these results should be interpreted with caution. The observed heterogeneity may be due to differences in study design, differences in the types of traffic calming schemes involved, or to differences in the way outcomes were defined and data collected. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity for the other outcomes, death and pedestrian motor-vehicle collisions. However, it is still plausible that heterogeneity did exist as there is no reason to assume that differences between studies would cause heterogeneity for some outcomes but not for others.</P>

<P>Area-wide traffic calming appears to be a promising intervention for reducing traffic injuries and deaths in towns and cities. However, further rigorous evaluation is needed before we can answer the question conclusively.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-08-10 11:21:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>In searching for studies of traffic calming we found numerous uncontrolled before-after studies but only 22 controlled before-after studies and no randomised controlled trials. Traffic calming interventions need to be properly evaluated using well-designed controlled studies, so that we can more accurately estimate their effects. In addition, researchers need to assess the effect of these interventions in middle and lower income countries.</P>
