<P>In some patient groups, different blood pressure lowering drugs have differing relative beneficial and harmful effects in addition to their blood pressure lowering action. We investigated whether different classes of drugs might have different relative effects in kidney transplant patients. We found that calcium channel blockers (CCB) reduced the risk of graft loss by about 25% in randomised studies, compared to placebo or no treatment. CCB also improved the function of grafts, as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with GFR 4.5 mL/min higher on average in patients receiving CCB compared to placebo. There were fewer studies comparing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) to placebo and their results were inconclusive. In studies that compared ACEi to CCB, ACEi worsened GFR by about 11.5 mL/min on average. ACEi also lowered haemoglobin and increased the risk of elevated blood potassium compared to CCB. There were not enough studies of other classes of drugs to draw conclusions about their relative effects. On current evidence CCB might therefore be the best agents for kidney transplant patients.</P>

<P>Data was extracted by two investigators independently. Study quality, transplant outcomes and other patient centred outcomes were assessed using random effects meta-analysis.

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-11 15:29:04 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified 60 studies, enrolling 3802 recipients. Twenty-nine studies (2262 participants) compared calcium channel blockers (CCB) to placebo/no treatment, 10 studies (445 participants) compared angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) to placebo/no treatment and seven studies (405 participants) compared CCB to ACEi. CCB compared to placebo/no treatment (plus additional agents in either arm as required) reduced graft loss (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99) and improved glomerular filtration rate (GFR), (MD, 4.45 mL/min, 95% CI 2.22 to 6.68). Data on ACEi versus placebo/no treatment were inconclusive for GFR (MD -8.07 mL/min, 95% CI -18.57 to 2.43), and variable for graft loss, precluding meta-analysis. In direct comparison with CCB, ACEi decreased GFR (MD -11.48 mL/min, 95% CI -5.75 to -7.21), proteinuria (MD -0.28 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.10), haemoglobin (MD -12.96 g/L, 95% CI -5.72 to -10.21) and increased hyperkalaemia (RR 3.74, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.43). Graft loss data were inconclusive (RR 7.37, 95% CI 0.39 to 140.35). Other drug comparisons were compared in small numbers of participants and studies.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-05-07 16:46:35 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>These data suggest that CCB may be preferred as first line agents for hypertensive kidney transplant recipients. ACEi have some detrimental effects in kidney transplant recipients. More high quality studies reporting patient centred outcomes are required.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-05-11 16:47:59 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Hypertension affects up to 75% of kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000</LINK>) and is associated with premature death (<LINK REF="REF-El_x002d_Agroudy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">El-Agroudy 2003</LINK>) and graft loss (<LINK REF="REF-Opelz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 1998</LINK>). Other conditions for which antihypertensive drugs have been shown to be of benefit in nontransplant patients are also common in kidney recipients, such as ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Barama-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barama 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Choice of antihypertensive agent is likely to be important in kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Curtis-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kendrick-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kendrick 2001</LINK>). In other patient populations, specific classes of antihypertensive agent offer benefits beyond their ability to control blood pressure alone. For example, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease, and reduce risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and death (<LINK REF="REF-Strippoli-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strippoli 2006</LINK>) and are recommended for all patients with diabetic kidney disease, irrespective of blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nicholls-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nicholls 2006</LINK>). There are biological reasons why benefits and harms may differ between kidney recipients and other populations. For example, calcium channel blockers (CCB) promote vasodilation of afferent arterioles which may counteract calcineurin inhibitor induced afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Baroletti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baroletti 2003</LINK>).</P>

<P>Titles and abstracts of all identified papers were reviewed by two authors (NC, AW), and any titles deemed eligible or possibly eligible by either author were retrieved in full. Where more than one report from a single study was identified, all reports were assessed for eligible data, but each study was included only once. Where it was unclear if reports were of the same study, authors were contacted for clarification.</P>
<P>Data was extracted by two authors (NC and PM or AW) working independently, using a preformatted purpose designed data recording sheet. Consensus was used to resolve disagreements with another author (AW or JC) arbitrating any that remained unresolved. Data were then entered into Review Manager. Microsoft ® Excel 2002, SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and Intercooled Stata 8.2 for Windows (TX, USA) were used for additional analyses.</P>
<P>Data were extracted on study and sample characteristics (study inclusion and exclusion criteria, setting, mean age, male:female ratio, donor source, immunosuppression) randomised intervention(s) and control(s) (name, class, dose, frequency, route, duration of administration), non-randomised antihypertensive cointerventions (allowed or not, class(es) permitted), and publication type (journal article, letter, abstract or unpublished). Where studies reported outcomes separately for groups by patient characteristics data was entered separately into analyses, designated by a suffix after the study name to identify the subgroup (for example, in patients receiving cyclosporin (CSA) (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkie-1993-CSA" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkie 1993 CSA</LINK>) and not receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (<LINK REF="STD-Wilkie-1993-No-CNI" TYPE="STUDY">Wilkie 1993 No CNI</LINK>).</P>

<P>Items were assessed according to the method described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>), and risk of bias tables created.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quantitative data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>Dichotomous outcomes were reported as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Mean change in continuous outcomes was used where possible, otherwise mean results at final follow-up were used. Studies reporting change differences and end of treatment differences were entered into the same analyses. Interventions were compared on the basis of drug class, so where studies randomised recipients across three or more arms, involving comparisons of members of the same drug class, the data for arms comparing the same drug class were combined.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity in treatment effects across studies was assessed using inspection of forest plots, was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I²<SUP> </SUP>statistic (P &lt; 0.05 and &gt; 50% respectively considered evidence of significant heterogeneity). Where there was no significant heterogeneity, the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird was used to combine study results (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>). Where significant heterogeneity was evident summary estimates were not calculated but investigated further using stratified analyses and random effects meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). Potential factors that might contribute to heterogeneity were defined <I>a-priori</I>, and included specific immunosuppression regimen used, participant selection criteria (for example, hypertension, erythrocytosis), and subgroup of CCB, dihydropyridine versus non-dihydropyridine. To investigate the potential effect of differences in blood pressure control across randomised comparisons on outcomes, we assessed differences in achieved blood pressure (where reported) and performed sensitivity analyses by eliminating studies which reported significant differences in blood pressure across arms. Funnel plots were generated and inspected for evidence of publication or other bias.</P>
<P>Interventions were compared on the basis of drug class. Individual classes were compared to placebo, to other individual classes, (e.g. CCB versus ACEi). Studies that randomised patients to more than two eligible interventions were used in each available pair wise comparison. To enable this within Review Manager, entries were made for each comparison identifiable by the final part of the name (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Sperschneider-1997-Dilt" TYPE="STUDY">Sperschneider 1997 Dilt</LINK> / <LINK REF="STD-Sperschneider-1997-Nifed" TYPE="STUDY">Sperschneider 1997 Nifed</LINK> identifies the comparisons diltiazem versus no treatment and nifedipine versus no treatment respectively). Where studies enrolled patients to more than two arms eligible for inclusion in a single comparison, the total number of patients and outcomes is divided equally for the arm that appears twice within the comparison for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. for a study of 50 patients in each arm of diltiazem versus nifedipine versus placebo for CCB versus placebo, with 10 deaths in each arm, becomes 10/50 deaths in diltiazem versus 5/25 deaths in placebo AND 10/50 deaths in nifedipine versus 5/25 deaths in placebo, each entered into the CCB versus placebo/no treatment comparison). For continuous outcomes, the number of individuals is divided equally across comparisons half in the arm to be included twice (mean and SD are unchanged). In this way, each individual patient appears no more than once in any single analysis.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity of intervention effects is further investigated using stratified analyses and random effects meta-regression (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 2002</LINK>). It was expected <I>a-priori</I> that important causes of difference in outcome could include immunosuppression regimen used (especially for outcomes such as rejection, which tend to occur less frequently with newer immunosuppressive agents), indication for selection for treatment (for example, patients with established hypertension would be likely to have poorer clinical outcomes overall than unselected kidney transplants, and might have stronger beneficial effects of some classes of agent, or be insensitive to the benefits of some classes of agents), and subgroups of medication within classes (for example, dihydropyridine versus non-dihydropyridine CCB). In addition, differences in blood pressure in different groups could account for differences in outcomes, should the effect of the intervention be due to non-specific blood pressure reduction. Study quality factors could affect outcomes, for example blinding in semi-subjective outcomes such as clinic recorded blood pressure. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were performed where sufficient numbers of trails were available, and where there was sufficient between study heterogeneity in outcome and predictor variables.</P>

<P>We identified 150 reports from 66 studies, with 4516 participants (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Six studies (714 participants) could not be included because relevant outcome data were not available in published reports and could not be obtained from study authors (<LINK REF="STD-Almeshari-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Almeshari 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Aros-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Aros 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Calo-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Calo 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cartier-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Cartier 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riggio-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Riggio 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SECRET-2004" TYPE="STUDY">SECRET 2004</LINK>), so 60 studies (3802 participants) contributed to data summary. Studies enrolled kidney recipients with hypertension (21 studies, 1370 participants), erythrocytosis (6 studies, 111 participants), chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN; 2 studies, 93 participants), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; 2 studies, 131 participants), and no specific indication for therapy (30 studies, 2099 participants).</P>
<P>Median study duration was six months (IQR 3 to 12 months). In 56/60 studies, patients were still receiving the randomised intervention at the time of the final outcome recording. In four studies, outcomes were reported while on treatment, and then also after a period without treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Dawidson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dawidson 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Lehtonen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Lehtonen 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Morales-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Morales 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hausberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hausberg 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>Patients generally received cyclosporin (all patients in 47 studies, and the majority of patients in a further five studies). In three studies, separate outcome data were available for patients receiving no CNI. Tacrolimus (TAC) was used in only a proportion of patients in at least three studies (it was unclear in a further seven studies), but no study reported effects in TAC patients separately.</P>

<P>No study included all outcomes of interest in this review (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). For example, participant death was only reported in 18/60 included studies.

<P>There were 17 pair wise comparisons available across all included studies (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Most studies involved CCB and/or ACEi (<LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Most studies assessed single agents versus placebo or no treatment, or single agents versus another active comparator. Four studies included three intervention arms and a single study included four arms. ACEi and ARB were considered separate drug classes, although reanalysis of data combining these drug classes together for the comparisons ACEi or ARB versus no treatment and ACEi or ARB versus CCB made no difference to any conclusion (comparisons 21 and 22 respectively).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blood pressure cointerventions and differences in achieved blood pressure among interventions</HEADING>
<P>In addition to the randomised intervention, 31 studies permitted additional treatment for hypertension control if required and 17 studies reported explicit protocols for use of additional agents (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for allowable cointerventions for included studies). Only one two-month duration crossover study comparing two active agents in 10 individuals explicitly prohibited additional cointerventions (<LINK REF="STD-Sennesael-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sennesael 1995</LINK>). In the remaining studies, antihypertensive cointerventions were not mentioned. There were no systematic differences in blood pressure noted in any comparison where two active agents were compared, including the six studies of CCB versus ACEi (<LINK REF="CMP-018.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 18.16</LINK>.2: MD -0.81 mm Hg, 95% CI -3.89 to 2.88 mm Hg, P = 0.61). Where an active agent was compared to placebo, effects varied.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">CCB versus placebo/no treatment</HEADING>
<P>Twenty-nine studies (2262 participants) evaluated CCBs versus placebo/no treatment. Twenty-five studies (1951 participants) enrolled kidney transplant recipients irrespective of blood pressure. In 18 (1500 participants) of these studies enrolment was within the first month after transplantation. In the remaining four (311 participants) of the 29 studies, patients were enrolled after the first post transplant month and were hypertensive.</P>
<P>Blood pressure at the end of follow-up was reported in eight studies (590 participants). Significant heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was no effect of CCB on risk of death at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK> (12 studies, 792 patients): RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.82). This result did not change after eliminating the study which showed lower blood pressure (favouring CCB) at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1998</LINK>) (leaving 11 studies, 693 patients: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.21).</P>
<P>CCB reduced the risk of graft loss at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> (17 studies 1255 participants): RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99). There was no difference in this result if the study in which a blood pressure difference at the end of follow-up favouring CCB was eliminated (<LINK REF="STD-Rahn-1999-HT" TYPE="STUDY">Rahn 1999 HT</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Rahn-1999-NT" TYPE="STUDY">Rahn 1999 NT</LINK>; leaving 16 studies, 1002 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02).</P>
<P>CCB had no effect on the risk of acute rejection, either reported as risk of any episode (as defined by individual study authors; <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK> (10 studies, 771 participants): RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23), or as rejection rates (i.e. number of episodes of any proven or suspected rejection/person/unit time) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.1: RR 0.88 95% CI 0.64 to 1.20, P = 0.4). A single study (<LINK REF="STD-Chrysostomou-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Chrysostomou 1993</LINK>, 113 participants) reported rejection by histological subtypes and found lower biopsy proven vascular rejection rates in patients exposed to CCB (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>.3: RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.96). No study with a reported difference in final blood pressure reported rejection outcomes.</P>
<P>Patients treated with CCB had higher estimated or measured GFR (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK> (16 studies, 1119 participants): MD 4.45 mL/min, 95% CI 2.22 to 6.68). Excluding estimated CrCl studies (leaving 11 studies, 533 participants: MD 4.77 mL/min, 95% CI 1.92 to 7.63), or excluding the data from three studies with differences in end of follow-up blood pressure did not alter this summary estimate (<LINK REF="STD-Madsen-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Madsen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahn-1999-NT" TYPE="STUDY">Rahn 1999 NT</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Schaaf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Schaaf 1995</LINK>, leaving 14 studies, 919 participants, MD 4.29 mL/min, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.40 mL/min).</P>
<P>Serum creatinine was reported in 17 studies (1174 participants). There was significant heterogeneity, accounted for by a study that allowed CCB intervention in the control arm if required (<LINK REF="STD-Pirsch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pirsch 1993</LINK>). Serum creatinine in the remaining 16 studies (1140 participants) was lower in patients allocated to CCB (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>, MD -10.13 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -17.32 to -2.93 &#956;mol/L). This result did not alter if the two studies with lower blood pressure in the CCB arm at follow-up were also removed (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Schaaf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Schaaf 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rahn-1999-NT" TYPE="STUDY">Rahn 1999 NT</LINK>; leaving 15 studies, 991 participants: MD -10.01 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -18.24 to 1.77 &#956;mol/L).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACEi versus placebo/no treatment</HEADING>
<P>There were 10 studies assessing this comparison (445 participants). Studies enrolled participants with erythrocytosis (3 studies, 53 participants), hypertension (2 studies, 77 participants), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (2 studies, 131 participants), hypertension and LVH (1 study, 52 participants), CAN (1 study, 65 participants) and transplant recipients without other criteria in two studies (67 participants). In one study, selection criteria were unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Takahara-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Takahara 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood pressure (either SBP or MAP) was reported in nine studies (392 participants). Although in all studies patients were allowed to be treated if they developed hypertension in either arm, there was significant heterogeneity, with blood pressure lower in patients randomised to ACEi in some studies but not in others (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). There was no apparent association with baseline blood pressure or allowable cointerventions.</P>
<P>Patient death was reported in only one study (30 participants) with a single death in both arms (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.55).</P>
<P>Graft loss was reported in only two studies (93 participants). Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). In one study, performed in patients not receiving CNI, two grafts were lost from each arm at three months follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gronhagen_x002d_Riska-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Gronhagen-Riska 1984</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Kim-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2002a</LINK> 65 patients with CAN were treated for a mean of 23 months and graft losses were significantly fewer in patients treated with ACEi (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85).</P>
<P>A single study (19 participants) reported acute rejection risk, there was no difference between ACEi and no treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.55).</P>
<P>GFR was measured in two studies and estimated by CrCl in a third (77 participants in total). In all studies, mean GFR was lower in ACEi arms, although the results were consistent with no difference in effect on GFR (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>, MD -8.07 mL/min, 95% CI -18.57 to 2.43).</P>
<P>Seven studies (282 participants) reported SCr. There was significant heterogeneity, accounted for by the study undertaken in patients with CAN (<LINK REF="STD-Kim-2002a" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 2002a</LINK>). In this study, SCr was significantly lower in patients treated with enalapril (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>: MD -100 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -112 to -88). In the remaining six studies (236 participants), SCr was no different with ACEi treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>, MD 7.55 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -2.10 to 17.20). This finding was not affected if the two studies with significantly lower blood pressures in the ACEi arms were removed (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Schaaf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Schaaf 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hernandez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hernandez 2000</LINK>; leaving 4 studies, 144 participants: MD 7.50 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI -9.74 to 24.74). In no study was presence of proteinuria a selection criterion. Proteinuria was reported in three studies (175 participants), and showed no difference with ACEi treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>, MD -0.08 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.06). This finding was similar in the two studies with lower blood pressure in the ACEi arm.</P>
<P>For the effects of ACEi on HCT (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>, 5 studies, 103 participants) and Hb (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>, 5 studies, 191 participants) there was significant heterogeneity, related to patient selection and intervention dose. In studies of treatment of erythrocytosis, compared to no treatment or placebo, ACEi reduced HCT (3 studies, 53 participants) by MD -7.29% (95% CI -10.34 to -4.24). The effect was smaller in the study that used enalapril 2.5 mg as the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Beckingham-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Beckingham 1995</LINK>), and greatest in one that used fosinopril 10-20 mg (<LINK REF="STD-Trivedi-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Trivedi 2003</LINK>). The effect was not seen in studies in patients without erythrocytosis (two studies, 50 participants: MD -1.29%, 95% CI -2.93 to 0.35). Similar effects were seen in studies reporting the effect on Hb concentration.</P>
<P>Serum potassium was higher in patients randomised to ACEi, by between 0.2 and 0.7 mmol/L (3 studies, 59 participants). Significant heterogeneity precluded obtaining summary estimates of effect (<LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>No study reported cardiovascular outcomes.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">ACEi versus CCB</HEADING>
<P>ACEi and CCB were compared head to head in seven studies (405 participants). All studies selected hypertensive kidney transplant recipients for enrolment, and in one study patients also had to have dipstick detectable proteinuria (<LINK REF="STD-Halimi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Halimi 2007</LINK>). One study enrolled patients within the first month after transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Midtvedt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Midtvedt 2001</LINK>), the remainder were at least five months after transplant.</P>
<P>Blood pressure at the end of follow-up was reported in six studies (275 participants). There was no difference in blood pressure at the end of follow-up (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>: MD 0.58 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.02 to 3.18).</P>
<P>Death was reported in two studies (221 participants) with no difference in risk (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>: RR 4.03, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.82). Graft loss was only reported in one study (157 participants) with no difference in risk (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>: RR 7.37, 95% CI 0.39 to 140.35).</P>
<P>GFR was assessed in six studies, by measured GFR in four (208 participants) and CrCl in two (88 participants). Patients receiving ACEi had lower GFR (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>: MD -11.48 mL/min, 95% CI -15.75 to -7.21).This difference was consistent across all studies, including the study of transplant recipients with proteinuria on dipstick (<LINK REF="STD-Halimi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Halimi 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>SCr was higher in patients randomised to ACEi (<LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>: MD 12.88 &#956;mol/L, 95% CI 8.14 to 17.62).</P>
<P>Acute rejection was reported in three studies, with inconsistent results which may be due to study era or selection criteria. In one 2007 study which enrolled 67 patients at least 12 months post-transplant, no patient in either arm had an episode of acute rejection (<LINK REF="STD-Halimi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Halimi 2007</LINK>). In a 2001 study that enrolled patients within the first three weeks after transplantation (<LINK REF="STD-Midtvedt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Midtvedt 2001</LINK>), 85/154 patients had at least one episode of acute rejection and risk of rejection was higher in patients on ACEi (<LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>, RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.07). In one study of 102 patients, the rate of rejection episodes was not increased in patients receiving ACEi (<LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.31).</P>
<P>Cardiovascular disease outcomes after 12 months were reported in one study (123 participants). No patient suffered myocardial infarction (<LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). Three patients on ACEi and one on CCB developed new onset angina pectoris, consistent with no difference in risk (<LINK REF="CMP-003.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.9</LINK>, RR 3.83, 95% CI 0.41 to 35.83). Ankle oedema was also consistent with no difference in risk (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.19).</P>
<P>ACEi, compared to CCB, increased serum potassium (<LINK REF="CMP-003.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.11</LINK> (4 studies, 189 participants): MD 0.27 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41) and risk of hyperkalaemia (<LINK REF="CMP-003.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.12</LINK> (3 studies, 211 participants): RR 3.74, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.43).

One study that allowed CCB in the placebo arm if required is excluded from this analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Pirsch-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pirsch 1993</LINK>) because in the earlier meta-analysis it was responsible for heterogeneity of effect. Other comparisons either had insufficient studies or insufficient variability in effect on the outcome of interest to allow informative stratified analyses or meta-regression.

<P>Prespecified confounders largely did not alter the effect of CCB relative to placebo or no treatment, with the exception of CCB subtype on SCr outcomes and follow-up time on graft loss (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> - <I>Calcium channel blocker (CCB) versus placebo/no treatment: meta-regression of potential confounding factors</I>). Compared to non-dihydropyridine CCB (DHPCCB) studies (n = 7), studies using DHPCCB (such as amlodipine, n = 12) resulted in increasingly favourable SCr in the treated arms (MD -13.1 µmol/L, 95% CI -24.3 to -2.0).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-05-12 15:38:03 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Data from 17 studies involving 1255 kidney transplant recipients suggest that the routine administration of CCB reduces the risk of graft loss by about 25%, and improves GFR and SCr (surrogate outcomes for graft survival). These findings suggest that CCB should be the first line treatment for hypertensive kidney transplant recipients, although there are limited data on side effects and cardiovascular outcomes. This is contrary to published guidelines which do not select any class for first-line status for the treatment of kidney recipients (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2004</LINK>). As improvements in outcomes were seen irrespective of the presence of hypertension, and because hypertension is extremely common after transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000</LINK>), CCB may be indicated for all patients from the time of transplantation.</P>
<P>CCB have been evaluated in more participants and in more studies than other agents and were significantly superior to placebo and ACEi for most outcomes. In head to head studies, CCB significantly improved GFR compared to ACEi by about 12 mL/min. While reduction in GFR may be observed acutely following introduction of ACEi, reduced GFR in ACEi compared to CCB was observed in all six studies, including three which measured GFR at least six months after treatment initiation. Effects on outcomes were inconclusive due to sparse data, but the point estimates favoured CCB (for example, less graft loss). In studies comparing CCB to placebo or no treatment, in addition to a significant reduction in risk of graft loss, CCB improved graft function. Beneficial effects of CCB were not accounted for by differences in blood pressure. The effects of CCB were consistent across studies with different enrolment characteristics, treatment doses, and allowable additional interventions.</P>
<P>We used meta-regression to explore potential differences in outcomes by enrolment and intervention characteristics in studies of CCB versus placebo/no treatment. The beneficial effects of CCB on graft loss did not vary by indication for therapy (patients selected for enrolment with any blood pressure versus hypertensive patients), suggesting that these medications could benefit patients irrespective of baseline hypertension. Reduction in graft loss was more apparent in studies with longer follow-up. There was heterogeneity in SCr outcomes which was explained by choice of CCB. Non-dihydropyridine CCB (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) cause important impairment in CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein, necessitating dose reductions of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (<LINK REF="REF-Page-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Page 2005</LINK>). Dihydropyridine CCB cause less impact on CNI metabolism and generally do not lead to dose reduction (<LINK REF="REF-Ciclosporin-DRUGDEX_x0028_R_x0029_-Evaluation" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ciclosporin DRUGDEX(R) Evaluation</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tacrolimus-DRUGDEX_x0028_R_x0029_-Evaluation" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tacrolimus DRUGDEX(R) Evaluation</LINK>). Dihydropyridine CCB studies reported greater differences in SCr, favouring CCB. There was a commensurate effect seen on GFR outcomes, although this did not reach statistical significance. These findings suggest that dihydropyridine CCB, which may be simpler to administer to patients receiving CNI because of lack of interaction, might be favoured over non-dihydropyridine CCB.</P>
<P>ACEi (and ARB) are recommended for use preferentially in non-transplant patients with diabetic kidney disease and in other patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria, based on evidence that they slow decline in GFR and progression to ESKD (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taal-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taal 2007</LINK>). However, as these additional benefits are not shown to extend to transplant recipients based on currently available RCTs, ACEi should not be preferred to CCB in this patient population. Outcomes are generally less favourable than with CCB (both in the indirect comparison with placebo or no treatment as the common comparator, and in the direct comparison) and there are considerably less data for ACEi used in transplant patients. Compared to CCB, ACEi reduced GFR. While poorer graft function is associated with an increased risk of graft loss in registry based observational studies (<LINK REF="REF-Hariharan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hariharan 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lenihan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lenihan 2008</LINK>), it is uncertain whether ACEi induced reduction in GFR leads to increased graft loss. In the only head to head comparison of ACEi versus CCB study in which graft loss was reported, three patients in the ACEi arm lost their grafts compared to no patient in the CCB arm (P= 0.18) (<LINK REF="STD-Midtvedt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Midtvedt 2001</LINK>). Hyperkalaemia was more common in patients randomised to receive ACEi compared to CCB (RR 3.7). In studies of ACEi compared to placebo or no treatment, ACEi reduced GFR in two small studies (MD -5.4 mL/min). Graft loss outcomes were heterogeneous. In a single study undertaken in 65 patients with CAN, enalapril compared to placebo reduced graft loss (RR 0.35). In the only other study, 28 kidney recipients treated from the time of transplant for three months, there was no effect on graft loss (RR 1.0). ACEi use was also associated with reduction in Hb, compared to CCB or placebo or no treatment. While this may be a therapeutic goal of therapy in some post-transplant patients with erythrocytosis, this effect was also observed in studies where hypertensive and unselected patients were enrolled. Anaemia is associated with increased risk of poor outcomes including rejection and graft loss in cohort studies (<LINK REF="REF-Chhabra-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chhabra 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>There may still be a role for ACEi in kidney transplant recipients. Beneficial effects may not have been seen in this review due to a lack of reported data, leading to inability to detect clinically relevant benefits, particularly in subgroups of transplant patients (for example, recipients with proteinuria). In our review, proteinuria was reduced by ACEi relative to CCB by 0.28 g/24 h (although not significantly in the few studies comparing ACEi to placebo or no treatment and reporting this outcome). In the non-transplant setting, proteinuria reduction of approximately 0.3 g/24 h was associated with reduced risk of ESKD in a patient-level data meta-analysis of ACEi in patients with proteinuria, although the beneficial effect was restricted to patients with proteinuria at least 0.5 g/24 h (<LINK REF="REF-Jafar-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jafar 2001</LINK>). Reduction of proteinuria as a therapeutic goal is not necessarily associated with improved kidney outcomes in all settings. For example, although combination ACE/ARB therapy reduces proteinuria over either treatment alone (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 2008</LINK>), combination therapy increased adverse kidney outcomes in patients with atherosclerosis or diabetes with end-organ damage compared to either agent alone (<LINK REF="REF-Mann-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mann 2008</LINK>).Whether ACEi cause net benefit or harm to proteinuric kidney transplant patients is unresolved, although a study in progress in proteinuric transplants with reduced GFR will address this group (<LINK REF="STD-Knoll-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Knoll 2008</LINK>). Whether ACEi are beneficial overall for an individual patient may be a balance of competing harms (e.g. increased risk of anaemia, hyperkalaemia, reduction in GFR) and benefits (e.g. reduction in proteinuria, treatment of LVH) (<LINK REF="REF-Cruzado-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruzado 2008</LINK>). Observational registry based data suggest that there is no associated patient or graft survival benefit associated with ACEi or ARB prescription in kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Opelz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Opelz 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>There are potential caveats that may affect the validity of these findings. Firstly, the quality of available studies is moderate only, with many included studies judged to have a risk of bias on at least some domains assessed. Despite this, there was limited heterogeneity in outcomes, suggesting that no important bias was present. Secondly, publication bias can not be excluded (i.e. bias caused by lack of publication of studies with neutral or negative effects), although funnel plots do not suggest significant publication bias is present (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-09" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 9</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-10" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 10</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-11" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 11</LINK>).Thirdly, highly relevant clinical outcomes were not reported in the majority of studies (e.g. patient death, cardiovascular disease events). We cannot be sure that outcomes in these studies were the same as in the studies which did report, or that differences in patient death or cardiovascular outcomes favouring other agents and outweighing the demonstrated graft survival and GFR benefit of CCB do not exist. Finally, few patients enrolled were receiving TAC as immunosuppression. If there are differences in effects of antihypertensive agents in patients receiving TAC then these findings may not apply.</P>

<P>An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of ACEi or ARB in kidney transplant recipients (<LINK REF="REF-Hiremath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiremath 2007</LINK>), and concluded that ACEi or ARB lead to clinically important reductions proteinuria, HCT and GFR, consistent with our work . We have shown that at least some of this detrimental effect of ACEi on GFR is likely to be due to the beneficial effect of the CCB, which were the comparator agent in approximately half of the included studies in that review (<LINK REF="REF-Hiremath-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiremath 2007</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-01-23 16:28:38 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Nicholas B Cross">
<P>Currently available data suggest that CCB should be first line antihypertensive agents in kidney transplant patients, because they improve graft function and reduce graft loss. On the basis of the findings from this review, treating 100 patients with average risk of graft loss over the first year (~10%) with CCB, compared to no treatment, would prevent three patients from losing their grafts over this period. This effect does not appear to be modified by the presence of hypertension or confined to any identifiable subgroup of patients, suggesting that these drugs should be considered for all patients after kidney transplantation. ACEi have detrimental effects on clinically relevant transplant outcomes such as graft function, and have fewer studies investigating their effects in kidney recipients. They should be reserved for situations where any potential advantage to the patient for the treatment of other conditions outweighs demonstrated detrimental effects. Other agents have limited data in kidney transplant patients.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-05-12 15:38:12 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Few studies reported cardiovascular disease outcomes. This is particularly important, given evidence from observational studies suggesting that the use of dihydropyridine CCB (but not non-dihydropyridine CCB) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease events in the first year after transplantation (<LINK REF="REF-Kasiske-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasiske 2000</LINK>). Additional studies of CCB reporting cardiovascular outcomes are needed or meta-analysis of existing study data if cardiovascular outcomes were collected but not yet reported. Studies of kidney transplant recipients with specific indications for other therapies (e.g. diabetic recipients, recipients with proteinuria) are needed to establish whether specific benefits of these agents apply to kidney transplant recipients with these conditions. </P>
<P>Available studies were also of short duration (median six months). This is important as it is possible that relative beneficial effects of CCB over other agents may not persist in the medium to long term. For example, in non-transplant patients, ACEi are recognised to cause reduction in GFR in the short term (weeks) after initiation, yet are recommended over other agents because ACEi reduce risk of long-term adverse renal events (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2004</LINK>). To clarify remaining uncertainty in the transplant population, longer term outcomes where collected but not yet published, or meta-analysis of individual patient data would be informative, followed by additional studies if required.</P>
