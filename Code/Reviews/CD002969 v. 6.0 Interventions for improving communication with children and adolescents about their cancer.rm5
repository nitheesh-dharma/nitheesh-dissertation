<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-30 17:23:23 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan J Prictor">
<P>Communicating about cancer may help some children and adolescents understand the disease and its treatment and help them cope better with their cancer.</P>
<P>Children and adolescents with cancer face many issues and may benefit from greater opportunities to talk to health professionals. Concerns about their illness and its treatment can result in psychological, behavioural and developmental problems. Various methods of communication have been designed to provide better access to the knowledge and understanding these children and adolescents require. The review of trials found that specific information-giving programs, support before and during particular procedures, and school reintegration programs may benefit children and adolescents with cancer when individual factors such as their age, level of understanding and medical condition have been considered. More research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Communication with children and adolescents with cancer about their disease and treatment and the implications of these is an important aspect of good quality care. It is often poorly performed in practice. Various interventions have been developed that aim to enhance communication involving children or adolescents with cancer. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, its treatment and their implications, updating the 2003 version of this review.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>In April 2006 we updated searches of the following sources: CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, issue 1 2006); MEDLINE (Ovid), (2003 to March week 5 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (2003 to 2006 week 13); PsycINFO (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); CINAHL (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); ERIC (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Sociological Abstracts (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Dissertation Abstracts: (2002 to 6 April 2006). </P>
<P>In 2003 we conducted searches of CENTRAL; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts and Dissertation Abstracts. </P>
<P>For the initial (2001) publication of this review we also searched the following databases: PsycLIT; Cancerlit; Sociofile; Health Management Information Consortium; ASSIA; LISA; PAIS; Information Science Abstracts; JICST; Pascal; Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts; Mental Health Abstracts; AMED; MANTIS.</P>
<P>We also searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion, and contacted experts in the field.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-12 16:40:18 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and before and after studies, evaluating the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, treatment and related issues.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data relating to the interventions, populations and outcomes studied and the design and methodological quality of included studies were extracted by one review author and checked by another review author. We present a narrative summary of the results.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-12 16:40:21 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>One new study met the criteria for inclusion; in total we have included ten studies involving 438 participants. Studies were diverse in terms of the interventions evaluated, study designs used, types of people who participated and the outcomes measured.</P>
<P>One study of a computer-assisted education programme reported improvements in knowledge and understanding about blood counts and cancer symptoms. One study of a CD-ROM about leukaemia reported an improvement in children's feelings of control over their health. One study of art therapy as support for children during painful procedures reported an increase in positive, collaborative behaviour. Two out of two studies of school reintegration programs reported improvements in some aspects of psychosocial wellbeing (one in anxiety and one in depression), social wellbeing (two in social competence and one in social support) and behavioural problems; and one reported improvements in physical competence. One newly-identified study of a multifaceted interactive intervention reported a reduction in distress (as measured by heart rate) related to radiation therapy.</P>
<P>Two studies of group therapy, one of planned play and story telling, and one of a self-care coping intervention, found no significant effects on the psychological or clinical outcomes measured.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-14 11:47:57 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. The weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information-giving programs, from support before and during particular procedures, and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-12 16:42:41 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>A diagnosis of cancer in a child or adolescent can cause great suffering to patients and families. In addition to the effects of the disease itself, children and adolescents with cancer may undergo numerous medical examinations, tests, surgical operations, chemo- and/or radiotherapies, and other procedures, which can be painful, toxic and psychologically distressing. The disease and its treatment can cause disruption to schooling, and to other aspects of the child's and family's social life and relationships (<LINK REF="REF-Cavusoglu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cavusoglu 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some experts argue that improved communication between health professionals and children and adolescents with cancer is needed (<LINK REF="STD-Claflin-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Claflin 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Harrington-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harrington 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hughes-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hytten-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hytten 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kreuger-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kreuger 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 1984</LINK>). Improvements to routine communications with health professionals and/or additional communication-based interventions may help children and adolescents with cancer in several ways. They may help children and their families to better understand, prepare for, and cope with their illness, the medical or surgical procedures they may undergo, their discharge from hospital and return to school and community, any relapses that may occur, and, in some cases, their last weeks of life. Interventions that offer opportunities for children and adolescents with cancer to communicate their experience of their illness and treatment may be helpful to them and may also provide others with information relevant to caring for them and managing their illness.<BR/>
<BR/>Children and adolescents with cancer need honest communication that is appropriate to their needs and level of understanding (<LINK REF="STD-Diez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Diez 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eden-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eden 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foley-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenberg-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenberg 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Horstman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horstman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Last-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Last 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nathanson-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nathanson 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Verri-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verri 1985</LINK>). Communication needs will vary across patients of different ages, preferences, types and stages of disease and treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Levenson-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Levenson 1982</LINK>), and care setting (<LINK REF="REF-Mercer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 1997</LINK>). Young children in particular may be unable to understand or remember adult explanations, so it may be necessary to find alternative approaches to communicating with them about their cancer and treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Eiser-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Eiser 1986</LINK>). Teenagers' coping skills may be already stretched by their passage through adolescence, making coping with cancer especially hard.</P>
<P>Parents play an important role in meeting the communication needs of children with cancer. Parents are usually, though not always, gatekeepers or conduits for communication between health professionals and the ill child or adolescent. Communication with children and adolescents with cancer should be seen in the context of the family and other support systems. This can make communicating with them about their disease and its treatment a more sensitive and complex task than with adult patients (<LINK REF="REF-Foley-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foley 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Naber-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Naber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ely-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ely 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulhern-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulhern 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ways of communicating with children and adolescents with cancer have been studied for around thirty years. This review focuses on evaluative research that investigates the effects of interventions to improve communication.</P>
<P>A variety of different ways of enhancing communication with young cancer patients has been tried including play, art and storytelling, group therapy, and more formal education and rehabilitation techniques. Advances in technology provide new opportunities for support using interactive multimedia (<LINK REF="STD-Bradlyn-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bradlyn 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Suzuki-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Suzuki 2003</LINK>). However, little is known about the effectiveness of the different methods used. This systematic review assesses the effects of interventions that aim to enhance communication with children and adolescents with cancer.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children and/or adolescents diagnosed with cancer. Childhood and adolescence are flexible categories and definitions vary. For the purposes of this review a child is defined as a person 2 to 12 years of age and an adolescent is defined as a person 13 to 21 years of age (<LINK REF="REF-Dark-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dark 1999</LINK>). Studies were eligible for inclusion if the majority of participants had a diagnosis of cancer and were aged between 2 and 21 years.</P>
<P>Children and/or adolescents in long-term remission from cancer (ie. 'survivors' of cancer) are excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-08-14 13:14:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Any intervention designed to enhance communication between health professionals or others (for example parents or school teachers) and children and/or adolescents with cancer about their disease, its treatment and their implications. The interventions might aim to improve routine communication between health professionals and patients (for example by communication skills training, or by introducing new tools or techniques such as visual aids or puppets into routine discussions) or they might be communication-based interventions that are additions to routine care (for example additional discussion sessions, educational social programs, or access to informational resources).</P>
<P>Interventions featuring distraction techniques (e.g. during painful procedures) are excluded, unless there is a distinct information or education component to them.</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-03-06 13:46:35 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Megan J Prictor">
<P>One review author pre-screened all identified titles and abstracts for relevance. Two review authors assessed potentially relevant studies for inclusion independently. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>A systematic approach to data extraction was used to produce a descriptive summary of evaluative studies of methods of enhancing communicating with children or adolescents about their cancer and/or its treatment. One review author extracted the relevant data from the included studies. A second review author checked the data extraction. Data extracted about participants included age, setting, diagnosis and stage of disease and treatment. Data extracted about interventions included aims, content, timing, duration and frequency. Outcome data extraction focused on timing, type of outcome and instruments. Authors were contacted for clarification where necessary.</P>
<P>The following aspects of methodological quality were assessed for all included studies: study design, numbers of patients, methods of recruitment of participants, method of allocation/randomisation, blinding of outcome assessor(s), participants' awareness of the study, proportion of participants followed up, method of analysis (whether or not intention to treat analyses were used). One review author assessed methodological quality and a second review author checked the assessments.</P>
<P>We prepared tabular summaries of extracted data (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>) and present a narrative overview of the findings.</P>
<P>For the original iteration of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Scott-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scott 2001</LINK>), an advisory panel was set up to ensure the scientific validity and relevance of the review. To ensure that patient views and perspectives are represented in the review, the advisory panel included patient consumers of cancer care and consumer advocacy organisations in the United Kingdom, including Cancer BACUP, The National Cancer Alliance, the Consumers' Advisory Group for Clinical Trials (CAG-CT), and the Standing Advisory Group on Consumer Involvement in NHS Research. Review advisory panel members were invited to comment on both the protocol and the draft review.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2008-08-12 16:40:46 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>In the initial (2001) review, of approximately 1,500 studies identified, 49 were judged potentially relevant and the full papers were assessed in detail. In the 2003 update, an additional ten studies were judged potentially relevant and the full papers were assessed in detail. In the 2006-07 update, 57 were judged potentially relevant and the full papers were assessed in detail.</P>
<P>Overall, ten studies were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review: four randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hinds-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hinds 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varni 1993</LINK>), two non-randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Frick-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frick 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1988</LINK>), one non-randomised trial with an historical control group (<LINK REF="STD-Favara_x002d_Scacco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Favara-Scacco 2001</LINK>), one before and after study with an historical control group (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK>) and two uncontrolled before and after studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baider-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baider 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK> is newly included in the latest update of this review. Considerable heterogeneity is evident between the included studies in terms of the specific interventions evaluated, the interventions or forms of usual care given to the control groups, the age, diagnoses and stages of treatment of the participants, the types of outcomes assessed and the timing and methods of assessment.</P>
<P>One further study of a hospital-based behavioural intervention programme for families of children with newly diagnosed or relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Macner_x002d_Licht-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Macner-Licht 1998</LINK>) could not be definitively included or excluded without additional information from the study authors, who we have been unable to contact.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Two studies evaluated group therapy that aimed to provide a forum for providing mutual support and to facilitate coping: one in comparison with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1988</LINK>), the other using a before and after design (<LINK REF="STD-Baider-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baider 1989</LINK>). Two studies evaluated programmes that aimed to help children and adolescents with reintegration at school: one compared social skills training in addition to school reintegration with school reintegration alone (<LINK REF="STD-Varni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varni 1993</LINK>), the other compared a school and social reintegration programme with usual care (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK>). Two studies evaluated computer-based information programmes: one compared an interactive CD-ROM presenting information about all aspects of leukaemia and its treatment, aimed at children with leukaemia and their family, with a book about leukaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK>); the other evaluated a computer-assisted instructional program that aimed to teach children about blood counts and to prepare them for the symptoms and treatment side effects they might experience (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>One non-randomised controlled study evaluated a planned play and story-telling intervention that aimed to help children cope with bone marrow aspirations by comparing it with routine diversional play (<LINK REF="STD-Frick-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frick 1987</LINK>). One study evaluated art therapy, comprising clinical dialogue, visual imagination, medical play, structured and free drawing, redundant reading and dramatization, as support for children during painful procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Favara_x002d_Scacco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Favara-Scacco 2001</LINK>). One study evaluated a three-part educational intervention designed to facilitate self-care coping in adolescents with cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Hinds-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hinds 2000</LINK>). One newly-identified study compared a cognitive behavioural interactive package (comprising exposure to an interactive animatronic character, an educational video including filmed modelling and passive auditory distraction via narrated stories by a cartoon character) with a modified control group which comprised a cartoon video, non-interactive character and stories delivered via cassette tape (<LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>One study assessed the impact of a computer-assisted instructional program focusing on blood counts, symptoms and treatment side-effects on knowledge and understanding of the program content (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>). Another assessed the impact of a computer-assisted instructional program about all aspects of leukaemia and its treatment, versus a book about leukaemia, on knowledge about the disease, satisfaction with and use of the intervention, and health locus of control (<LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK>). Two studies evaluated the effects of group therapy programmes on psychological outcomes, including anxiety, depression, self-esteem and locus of control (<LINK REF="STD-Baider-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baider 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1988</LINK>). Two studies evaluated the effects of programmes to support children and adolescents returning to school after absences due to illness (school reintegration programmes) on psychological, social and behavioural outcomes, including anxiety, depression, behavioural and emotional problems, cognitive, social, behavioural and physical competence, self-esteem, perceived social support, school absences and grades (<LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varni 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One study evaluated a directed play and story-telling intervention on psychological and physical health outcomes, including state anxiety and pulse rates (<LINK REF="STD-Frick-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frick 1987</LINK>).

One study assessed the impact of a three-part educational intervention designed to facilitate self-care coping on psychological outcomes including locus of control, hopefulness, hopelessness, self-esteem and self-efficacy, and physical outcomes including symptom distress and toxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Hinds-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hinds 2000</LINK>). One newly-identified study assessed the impact of a cognitive behavioural interactive package designed to reduce distress during radiation therapy, on the occurrence of sedation, observed behavioural distress, heart rate and parental anxiety (<LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The outcomes assessed in the studies were not always closely related to the stated aims or theoretical basis of the interventions.The validity of the measures used to assess psychological, social and behavioural outcomes in particular often received little or no comment in the study reports.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Study design</HEADING>
<P>Four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hinds-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hinds 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varni 1993</LINK>) were randomised controlled trials. <LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK> collected data longitudinally (ie. pre- and post-test) as well as cross-sectionally (ie. experimental and control conditions). <LINK REF="STD-Hinds-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hinds 2000</LINK> collected data at four measurement points spanning the first six months of treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK> collected data from baseline until the end of a simulated radiation therapy procedure for both groups. Some of the results reported from <LINK REF="STD-Varni-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Varni 1993</LINK> were presented as within-group differences before and after the intervention. These results are subject to the same problems of interpretation as those from uncontrolled before and after studies.</P>
<P>Four other studies had control groups but did not allocate participants to them on a random basis. <LINK REF="STD-Frick-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frick 1987</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1988</LINK> were prospective studies. <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK> used an historical control group but reported most results as within-group differences before and after the intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Favara_x002d_Scacco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Favara-Scacco 2001</LINK> also used an historical control group.</P>
<P>Two other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Baider-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baider 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>) used uncontrolled before and after designs. One typical problem with these study designs is that it is hard to be confident that any differences in scores before and after the intervention are due to the effects of the intervention itself: the scores might have changed over time anyway, even if the intervention had not been used. This problem was minimised in one study that tested knowledge before and immediately after the use of a computer instruction program (<LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>).</P>

The researchers found that in both age groups (4 to 6 year olds, and 7 to 11 year olds), compared with the book, the CD-ROM was associated with a significantly greater increase in children's feelings of control over their health (4 to 6 year olds: I = before: 8.25 (SD 2.38) vs after: 9.13 (SD 3.23); C = before: 8.33 (SD 2.07) versus after: 6.17 (SD 3.87); 7 to 11 year olds: I = before: (11.14 (SD 3.29) versus after: 13.40 (SD 3.46); C = before: 13.70 (SD 2.98) versus after: 13.70 (SD 3.53)). There was no significant difference in children's understanding of events associated with leukemia between the CD-ROM and book groups, although participants in the CD-ROM group had more detailed narratives about leukemia events than those in the book group.

The researchers found participants in the intervention group had lower mean heart rates from baseline to simulated radiation therapy during the total treatment (I = 112.3 (SD 3.0) to 106.2 (SD 3.2) versus C = 105.1 (SD 2.3) to 108.4 (SD 2.8), F = 4.11, P &lt; 0.05). No statistically-significant difference was found between the groups in the proportion of children who needed sedation to complete the procedure and on the modified Observation Scale of Behavioural Distress.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-14 13:14:28 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>Only ten studies were found that satisfied the inclusion criteria of this review. Their findings are difficult to interpret and summarise due to (a) inherent problems with the design of individual studies, and (b) the heterogeneity of their aims, study designs, interventions and controls, patient populations, outcomes, assessment instruments, and methods of analysis. The available evidence about the effects of different ways of enhancing communication with children and adolescents about their cancer and its treatment is weak and inconclusive.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Problems with study designs and methods</HEADING>
<P>The interventions studied were complex in that they often had multiple components, could be tailored to individual circumstances and/or could vary according to the characteristics of the individuals who delivered them. In the <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK> study of a school and social reintegration program, for example, psychologists intervened at different stages, in different ways and with different groups (patients, family, medical staff and school personnel), and it is difficult to discern which components, or combination of components had an effect. This was also the case in the study of art therapy for painful procedures (<LINK REF="STD-Favara_x002d_Scacco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Favara-Scacco 2001</LINK>). Comparison groups sometimes also received a modified form of the intervention, rather than usual care (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The improved outcomes reported in uncontrolled before and after studies may be due to the passage of time and unrelated to the interventions tested. Some of the controlled studies reported within-group rather than (or as well as) between-group changes. These analyses have similar weaknesses to uncontrolled before and after studies. They may, however, usefully complement data from between group comparisons if the groups were not comparable at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK>, those receiving the intervention were newly diagnosed with cancer, whereas those in the control group had been diagnosed within 36 months before the study was initiated. It is possible that any between-group differences in outcomes may have been caused by systematic differences between the two groups. It is also possible that the intervention accelerated a process of adaptation, so that the intervention group adapted more rapidly than the control group.</P>
<P>Some studies assessed a large number of outcomes at several points in time and undertook many tests of statistical significance. As only a small proportion of the effects were statistically significant, it is possible that at least some of these were due to chance. Some studies were had small sample sizes (the number of participants ranged from 8 to 85) making it unlikely they could detect statistically significant treatment effects.</P>
<P>It is difficult to interpret the results of controlled studies which do not adequately describe the usual care with which interventions are compared.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other factors affecting interpretation of findings</HEADING>
<P>All the studies except <LINK REF="STD-Heiney-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Heiney 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Klosky-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Klosky 2004</LINK> recruited participants with relatively wide age ranges. Some studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Petersen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Petersen 1996</LINK>) applied the same intervention to different age-groups. If an intervention is more suitable for children or adolescents of certain ages than for others, then the age composition of the study groups could influence the effects reported. Other studies (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Katz-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Katz 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Favara_x002d_Scacco-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Favara-Scacco 2001</LINK>) probably tailored interventions to suit participants of different ages or who varied in other characteristics. This makes it difficult to know exactly what kind of intervention is most effective for whom.</P>
<P>Some of the interventions studied might have had a greater or lesser impact among different participant groups. For example, the directed play and story telling intervention evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Frick-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Frick 1987</LINK> might have had more effect among children who were less accustomed to the bone marrow aspiration it focused on. The group therapy evaluated by <LINK REF="STD-Baider-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Baider 1989</LINK> might have had a differential impact on the psychological wellbeing of young adults who were and were not receiving active treatment at the time. Young people's preferences for particular interventions might also moderate their effectiveness. For example, not all young people will be willing to participate in group therapy or other interventions.</P>
<P>The interventions studied might also have varying effects in different healthcare systems and cultural contexts. There is extremely limited evidence for the effects of these interventions beyond well-resourced, western healthcare settings. Eight of the ten studies were set in the USA. Some studies excluded participants who did not primarily speak English (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Dragone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Dragone 2002</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Range and appropriateness of outcomes assessed</HEADING>
<P>The interventions assessed in this review might impact on a range of processes and outcomes by a variety of mechanisms. The included studies assessed various outcomes, but did not always attempt to assess the extent to which all the stated aims of the interventions were achieved. Only two studies looked at knowledge and understanding. Most studies investigated the effects of communication interventions on psychological, social and behavioural outcomes. Other outcomes which could have been affected include perceptions of coping, patterns and perceptions of interaction with peers, family and health professionals, general quality of life, physical health status, and even survival, although large trials with long-term follow up periods would probably be required to test the latter.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-08-14 11:49:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Megan Prictor">
<P>There have been few reported studies which have evaluated the effects of interventions to enhance communication with children and adolescents about their cancer. Those that have reported findings that are difficult to interpret and summarise due to differences in their design, methodology and outcomes. Overall there is weak evidence to suggest that interventions, such as computer-assisted learning, art therapy and multifaceted interactive interventions offering support before and during particular procedures, and school and social reintegration programmes, may lead to improvements in knowledge and understanding and in psychological, social and behavioural outcomes.</P>
<P>In the absence of more robust empirical evidence about the effects of particular interventions, health professionals must use their own individual judgement about how better communication with these patient groups might be achieved. A wide range of approaches, using techniques derived from formal education and the expressive arts, have been developed with the intention of enhancing communication to secure a range of other benefits, but few have been rigorously evaluated.</P>
<P>The selection of strategies for improving or supplementing routine communication between health practitioners and children or adolescents with cancer should take into account a range of factors. These include the young person's medical condition, physical health, stage of cognitive, emotional and physical development, perceived needs and concerns, readiness and ability to communicate, and with whom they prefer to discuss concerns about their cancer and treatment. The child or adolescent needs to be considered in the context of their family, and family members may need to be included in interventions aimed at enhancing communication with children and adolescents with cancer.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>More rigorous research is needed to investigate the effects of interventions that aim to enhance communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, its treatment and their prognosis. </P>
<P>Interventions developed for testing should be underpinned by research that determines the needs and preferences of the children and adolescents with cancer who are supposed to benefit from them. </P>
<P>The outcomes assessed should reflect the aims of the intervention and the perceptions of children and adolescents with cancer about what is most important for the interventions to achieve and avoid. <BR/> </P>

<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Aims: the group therapy had a two-fold purpose: to prepare the participants for a support role in helping other patients in coping with cancer; and to provide a forum for the sharing and discussing of concerns arising from participants' experiences of their illness and their patterns of coping with it. </P>
<P>Participants attended weekly group therapy sessions of 1.5 hours each (number of sessions not stated). The group therapy sessions were dynamic in responding to participants' needs, as opposed to following a thematic structure imposed by the therapists. </P>

</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: 3 months.</P>
<P>Psychological, social and behavioural outcomes: (1) a range of psychologic symptoms was measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), (Derogatis and Melisaratos 1983); (2) degree of distress was measured by the Global Severity Index (GSI).<BR/>

<P>Aims: to educate children about their cancer and to give them greater feelings of control.</P>
<P>I (n = 15): received the CD-ROM 'Kidz with Leukemia: A Space Adventure' to use for approximately three months. The CD-ROM is tailored to three age groups: 4 to 6 year olds, 7 years and older, or adult. A 'Space Buddy' is the user's guide. Before users explore the planet 'Leukator' they are presented with three main facts about leukemia. The contents of the program include: 'The Get Better Place' (research studies, medicines, treatment, health care team), 'Help Yourself' (areas in which children can exert some control, including nutrition, preventing infections, pain control, creative arts, and relaxation techniques), 'The Testing Centre' (bone marrow tests and spinal taps, blood tests, radiology tests, heart testing, and vital signs), 'The Fill and Fly' (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), 'The Space Mall' (changes in appearance, central venous catheters, anatomy and physiology, and resource/reference section), and 'The Movies' (video hospital tour, living with leukemia, expert explanation of leukemia, and siblings' views of leukemia). The contents are presented interactively using video, animation, puzzles and games. Some sections of the program are designed for children 7 years and older, and adults, such as (7 years plus) 'Taking Part in Research', and (adults) 'Frequently Asked Questions for Parents', NCI's 'Physician Data Query', and the 'Resource Section' with hyperlinks to selected sites for those with internet access. Four commonly used multisyllabic words (leukemia, medicine, chemotherapy, infection) are defined via print and audio in the 'Book of Big Words' section, available to all users.</P>
<P>
<BR/>C (n=16): received a book 'You and Leukemia' (Baker, 1988), to use for approximately three months.</P>
<P>N=31.</P>
<P>Theoretical basis: (1) Social Learning Theory, (2) theory that there is a dynamic relationship between how children cognitively represent and organise their experiences and how they adjust to these experiences.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Timing of outcome assessment: pre- and post-test.</P>
<P>Psychological, social and behavioural outcomes: (1) health locus of control was measured by the Leukemia Children's Health Locus of Control (LCHLC) scale; (2) knowledge about leukemia was measured by the Leukemia Event Knowledge Interview (LEKI); satisfaction with and use of the CD-ROM was measured by questionnaire.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Power calculation: not stated.</P>
<P>The small sample size and relatively high educational level of the children's primary caregivers are the study's greatest limitations to generalisability.</P>

<P>The researcher observed a lack of verbal interactions between 'patient' and 'provider' during the dramatised play, in contrast to what happened in the actual BMA. In response to the researcher's questions, most of the children denied that the fictional child, doctor or nurse said or felt anything during the BMA.</P>
<P>The children often played out the BMA incorrectly, although they accurately reproduced in fine detail other procedures commonly carried out during a typical BMA. </P>

<P>Aims: to facilitate self care-coping.</P>
<P>I (n = 40): the study intervention was based on metacognition principles and lasted about 40 minutes. The three components of the intervention comprised 1) information on self-care coping provided verbally by one of two nurse researchers or one social worker, 2) a 25-minute video in which four adolescents demonstrated or described behavioural and coping strategies that they had found helpful and 3) a rehearsal of those strategies which the study particpant selected as most likely to help him or her cope with the demands of treatment. Each of the adolescents in the intervention group worked individually with one of the researchers. Patients were instructed to use their chosen strategies during treatment and to monitor the effectiveness of these strategies.</P>

<P>Aims: to faciliate the successful school and social reintegration of children and adolescents newly diagnosed with cancer.</P>
<P>I (n = 49): School Intervention Package including the following components:<BR/>1. Preliminary intervention activities. The psychologists discussed the importance of school reintegration with family, medical staff, and school personnel. They also helped to arrange interim educational programmes and maintained regular contact with schools. Parents and patients received direct counselling about the emotional impact of returning to school and the possibility that classmates would ask the patients questions or tease them about the visible side effects of treatment. The psychologists counselled school personnel and assisted with special educational services. They also helped school personnel to plan for predictable problems such as absenteeism, learning disabilities, physical disabilities, social isolation, anxiety, and fear.<BR/>2. Conferences with school personnel. The psychologists held conferences with school personnel to help them to understand basic issues about the patient's illness and treatment. They presented specific information about the scheduling of medical treatments and their side effects, and helped review plans for absences. They also discussed psychosocial issues such as the ability of children with cancer to participate in school and the reactions of teachers and other school staff to seriously ill children being in school. The patient's special educational needs were reviewed and an Individualized Educational Plan was developed.<BR/>3. Classroom presentations. During presentations to the patient's classmates, with the patient present, the psychologists countered the children's tendency to believe the patient to be unique owing to his or her medical condition, by exploring the natural differences in populations. The psychologists then provided age-appropriate information about the patient's illness and the medical procedures and treatment he or she had received. They continually tried to dispel common myths about cancer being contagious, hopeless or a punishment. They also reviewed the common side effects of treatment - e.g., nausea, hair loss, weight gain, immunosuppression. They led a discussion on the importance of social support to anyone with medical needs and disabilities. They also pointed out the negative consequences of teasing and the positive consequences of friendship. Finally, to facilitate communication between patients and their classmates, the psychologists established the patient as the resident expert on his or her disease and treatment. <BR/>4. Follow-up. <BR/>After the patient had returned to school, the psychologists contacted the patient, parents, and teachers periodically to insure that the process of reintegration continued throughout the course of the patient's illness. Complications of the disease were addressed as they occurred. If the patient's health deteriorated, they prepared teachers and other school personnel for the patient's impending death, offered guidelines and suggestions for preparing classmates, and, when necessary, helped school personnel and classmates with their grief and bereavement.</P>

<P>Aims: to provide explicit social skills training to enhance adjustment and perceived social support above and beyond the effects of standard school reintegration.</P>
<P>I (n=33): received social skills training in addition to routine school reintegration services provided at each centre. Social skills training comprised 3 individual 60-minute sessions with a research assistant who guided the participants through a structured curriculum. Each session was devoted to one of the following areas:<BR/>1. Social Cognitive Problem-Solving. The children were taught to problem-solve cancer-related interpersonal difficulties with peers, teachers, parents, and siblings as they occurred. <BR/>2. Assertiveness Training. The children were taught how to effectively express their thoughts, wishes, and concerns to others.<BR/>3. Handling Teasing and Name-Calling. The children were taught how to cope with verbal and physical teasing associated with changes in their physical appearance (e.g., hair loss, weight gain or loss, surgical disfigurement).<BR/>Detailed handouts were given to the children and their parents to facilitate generalisation of the skills taught to the child's home and school environment.<BR/>Two 15-minute videotapes were developed, one for children aged 5 to 8 years, and one for children aged 9 to 13 years. Actual school situations were modelled that demonstrated the coping strategies taught.<BR/>The children were also instructed in an abbreviated cue-controlled relaxation procedure to counteract social anxiety associated with physiological arousal that might inhibit social skill performance.<BR/>The children were given specific homework assignments at the end of each session.<BR/>Parents were given one training session and encouraged to support their child's social cognitive problem solving efforts at home and school throughout the intervention phase.<BR/>The children were seen for two follow-up social skills training booster sessions at 3 weeks and 6 weeks following their return to school. These sessions reviewed the child's actual school and home experiences, offered suggestions as to how children could most effectively utilise the skills that were taught, and the children were once again shown the social skills videotapes.</P>
<P>C (n=31): received the routine school reintegration services provided at each centre. Children were provided basic assistance in their reintegration into school by hospital-based paediatric psychologists. They received a minimum of 2 hours of individual intervention as part of their routine school reintegration services, as well as approximately equal time with a research assistant linked to the time spent with the intervention group. This consisted of 5 sessions of play interaction with the research assistant as an attention-control condition linked temporally with the intervention sessions.</P>
<P>The routine school reintegration intervention for both intervention and control groups consisted of the following components: (a) early preventive education and support for patients, parents, medical and school staffs about the importance of rapid return to school when medically feasible; (b) school conferences and classroom presentations to demystify the cancer experience for classmates and teachers, with direct patient participation whenever possible; (c) regular follow-up with all concerned to ensure that progress was maintained. </P>

<P>Power calculation: yes, but a sample size needed to avoid a Type II error was not achieved. To compensate for this a priori planned t tests were conducted within groups to test pretreatment to follow-up statistical significance on all outcome measures.</P>
<P>The study authors state that "it became quite evident as the present study progressed that not all children who were entered into the study required explicit social skills training, while other children were clearly at greater risk for social skills deficits and problematic peer interactions". This has implications for identifying subgroups of children who are at greatest risk and most likely to benefit from interventions tailored to their individual needs.</P>
<P>The outcomes for which statistically significant before/after differences were found tended to differ between T2 and T3.</P>

<TD>
<P>Patients' mean scores on the Leukemia Children's Health Locus of Control (LCHLC) scale: Age 4 to 6: CD-ROM = before: 8.25 (SD 2.38); after: 9.13 (SD 3.23); Book = before: 8.33 (SD 2.07); after: 6.17 (SD 3.87).Age 7 to 11: CD-ROM = before: 11.14 (SD 3.29); after: 13.40 (SD 3.46); Book = before 13.70 (SD 2.98); after: 13.70 (SD 3.53).Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the general linear models (GLM) procedure in SAS on the LCHLC change scores (post-test less pre-test), with main effects treatment group and age group, found a significant change with model F = 6.38, R2 = 0.33, P = 0.004 and no significant interaction effects. For treatment group, F = 9.24, P = 0.005; for age group, F = 5.45, P = 0.027. The analyses indicated that in both age groups, compared with the book, the CD-ROM was associated with an increase in LCHLC scores, indicating relatively increased feelings of control over health.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Satisfaction:<BR/>Children: of children in the CD-ROM group, 86.7% used their assigned intervention to learn about leukemia compared with 56.3% in the book group (P = 0.06). In the CD-ROM group, 93.3% found their intervention 'easy to use', compared to 68.8% in the book group (P = 0.08). Only three of the eight 4 to 6 year olds reported they needed help to use the CD-ROM. The groups were similar in their willingness to advise other children with leukemia to use the CD-ROM or read the book.<BR/>
<BR/>Parents: parents were asked to respond on a 4-point Likert scale to questions about use of their assigned intervention. ANOVA using the GLM procedure found no differences between the CD-ROM and book groups in ease of use for parents, use to get specific information about leukemia, or willingness to recommend their assigned intervention to other parents of children with leukemia. Parents in the book group were more likely to feel that their intervention was not easy for their children to use, compared to parents in the CD-ROM group (P = 0.01).<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Use:<BR/>Children: more children in the CD-ROM group (93.3%) reported using their intervention independently at least once than did children in the book group (37.5%, P = 0.001). In the CD-ROM group, only one child, a 4 to 6 year olds, did not report using the CD-ROM at least once by himself. None of the six children in the book group who reported using the book independently did so 'many times' compared with six of the 14 in the CD-ROM group.<BR/>
<BR/>In the CD-ROM group, 73.3% of the children used their assigned intervention for 'a long time' each time they used it, compared with 12.5% in the book group (P = 0.0006).</P>

<P>Fifteen positive behaviours were selected by the trialists as indicators that children had developed a better compliance with the painful procedures.

<TD>
<P>Leukemia Event Knowledge Interview (LEKI): The were no differences between the CD-ROM and book groups on the pre- to post-test change scores based on : (1) number of events stated, (2) number of superordinate event categories, and (3) the number of basic level events, erroneous events, spontaneously stated events, and elaborated events. However, for 7 to 11 year olds, the changes between pre- and post-test scores were in the expected direction for all variables listed above except the total number of events. In these analyses (ANOVAs with main effects treatment group and age group) both generally and specifically elicited events were entered as data. With only generally elicited events in the model, F = 2.66, R2 = 0.219, P = 0.096; for treatment group, F = 4.93, P = 0.039. For both age groups, participants in the CD-ROM group had a greater increase in the proportion of basic level events on the post-test than pre-test, compared to participants in the book group. This finding supported the comparative efficacy of the CD-ROM by showing that the CD-ROM group had more detailed narratives about leukemia events than the more superordinate, less articulated narratives among the book group.</P>

<P>Symptom distress: both groups at T1 reported moderate symptom distress scores (I = 20.5 (SD 6.9); C = 21.45 (SD 6.7)); scores decreased over time and were lowest at T4 (I = 18.14 (SD 8.6); C = 17.21 (SD 6.1)) with the greatest decrease (though not statistically significant) occuring between T1 and T2 (I: 20.5 to 18.43; C: 21.45 to 19.58). The symptoms rated as most distressing were the same at all four time-points: tiredness, altered sleep, and change in either appetite or appearance.</P>

<P>Toxicity: staff ratings of treatment- and disease-related toxicity in the HCI Common Toxicity Criteria Scale (CTC) were lowest at T1 and highest at T3 and T4 for both groups. The actual scores indicated low to moderate toxicity grades:<BR/>I = T1: 7.54 (SD 6.4); T2: 7.16 (SD 3.9); T3 10.96 (SD 5.6); T4 9.79 (SD 4.9);<BR/>C = T1: 5.84 (SD 4.9); T2: 8.22 (SD 5.3); T3: 9.13 (SD 4.0); T4: 11.07 (SD 7.0).</P>

<BR/>On the advice of peer reviewers, we subsequently searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register for studies that evaluated the use of 'puppets' in interventions designed to help prepare children for hospitalisation or unpleasant medical interventions.</P>
<P>We conducted an updated search in January 2003. The following databases were searched:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, issue 1 2003)</LI>
<LI>MEDLINE (1996 to January week 2 2003)</LI>
