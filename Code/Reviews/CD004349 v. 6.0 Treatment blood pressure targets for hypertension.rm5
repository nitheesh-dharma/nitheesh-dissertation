<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-05-13 08:22:44 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright">
<P>High blood pressure (BP) is linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. High BP has been defined as any number larger than 140 to 160 /90 to 100 mmHg and as a result this range of BPs has become the standard blood pressure target for physicians and patients. Over the last five years a trend toward lower targets has been recommended by hypertension experts who set treatment guidelines. This trend is based on the assumption that the use of drugs to bring the BP lower than140/90 mmHg will reduce heart attack and stroke similar to that seen in some population studies. However, this approach is not proven.</P>
<P>This review was performed to find and assess all trials designed to answer whether lower blood pressure targets are better than standard blood pressure targets. Data from 7 trials in over 22,000 people were analysed. Using more drugs in the lower target groups did achieve modestly lower blood pressures. However, this strategy did not prolong survival or reduce stroke, heart attack, heart failure or kidney failure. More trials are needed, but at present there is no evidence to support aiming for a blood pressure target lower than 140/90 mmHg in any hypertensive patient.</P>

<P>When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been &#8804; 140 - 160/ 90 - 100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.</P>

Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p&lt; 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74-1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.25) , congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59-1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81-1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.</P>

<P>
<B>Description of the condition</B>
</P>
<P>Epidemiological studies show a continuous direct relationship between adverse cardiovascular events and blood pressure. (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prospective-Studies" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prospective Studies</LINK>). The relationship has a greater slope with increasing levels of blood pressure. Furthermore elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events (<LINK REF="REF-Stokes-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stokes 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamler-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamler 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1996</LINK>). Several mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension and hypertension-related cardiovascular disease have been described (<LINK REF="REF-Oparil-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oparil 2003</LINK>). The primary goal of the management of patients with elevated blood pressure is to maximize the reduction in mortality and morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Chalmers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chalmers 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oparil-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oparil 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESH_x002d_ESC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH-ESC 2007</LINK>). The lower threshold at which this relationship no longer applies has not been definitively identified (<LINK REF="REF-Kannel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kannel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prospective-Studies" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prospective Studies</LINK>). Any numerical cut-off value above which elevated blood pressure (hypertension) is defined is arbitrary. The standard for diagnosis of arterial hypertension is based on consensus recommendations, which attempt to predict the blood pressure above which treatment provides more benefit than harm in a population. At present this threshold has not been defined.</P>
<P>
<B>Description of the intervention</B>
</P>
<P>When treating elevated blood pressure there are two critical and important questions: 1) what is the threshold of blood pressure above which treatment is required? And 2) what target blood pressure should be the surrogate goal of therapy? The first question has been answered arbitrarily as between 140 and 160 mmHg systolic and between 90 and 100 mmHg diastolic. The threshold is becoming lower with advancing time. The second question is the primary topic of this review and is affected by the answer to the first question. It is the critical question that the practitioner in clinical practice must answer to make treatment decisions. For example, if the diastolic blood pressure target is less than or equal to 90 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is documented as 92 mmHg then the practitioner would increase the antihypertensive treatment by increasing the dose or adding another drug. If the diastolic blood pressure is 90 mmHg or lower then the practitioner would not change therapy. The standard target pressure has generally been the arbitrary threshold blood pressure above which treatment is recommended. Thus the standard target systolic blood pressure declined from a target of &#8804; 160 mmHg to a target of &#8804; 140 mmHg. Similarly the diastolic blood pressure target has decreased from &#8804; 100 mmHg to &#8804; 90 mmHg. In most of the published randomized controlled trials designed to test the benefits and harms of treatment titrated to achieve a specific blood pressure goal, the target was either a SBP below 150 mmHg or 160 mmHg for isolated systolic hypertension trials, or a DBP below 90 mmHg or 100 mmHg for most other trials. (<LINK REF="REF-Wright-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wright 1999</LINK>) It is important to appreciate that 30% to 40% of patients in these trials do not achieve the defined target, despite the requirement to titrate doses and add up to 3 or 4 antihypertensive drugs.</P>
<P>
<B>How the intervention might work</B>
</P>
<P>Blood pressure targets lower than standard targets are becoming more prevalent in recent clinical guidelines, (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Arauz_x002d_Pacheco-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arauz-Pacheco 2002</LINK>) and thus in clinical practice. This trend toward "the lower the pressure the better", was expressed in an editorial accompanying the publication of the 2004 British Hypertension Society guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Laurent-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurent 2004</LINK>), and assumes that treating to lower blood pressure targets with antihypertensive drugs will achieve a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality similar to that seen in epidemiological observation studies. However, this assumption remains unproven. Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that achieving lower blood pressures does not provide an additional reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the <LINK REF="REF-ONTARGET-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ONTARGET 2008</LINK> trial. In this trial combination of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker caused greater blood pressure lowering, but did not reduce cardiovascular endpoints.</P>
<P>
<B>Why it is important to do this review?</B>
</P>
<P>The importance of this review is emphasized by the blood pressure targets recommended in guidelines published in recent years for example:</P>
<P>1- The Joint National Committee-7 Report (<LINK REF="REF-JNC-7-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">JNC 7 2003</LINK>) recommends "treating systolic BP and diastolic BP to targets that are less than 140/90 mm Hg", but "because most patients with hypertension, especially those aged at least 50 years, will reach the diastolic BP goal once systolic BP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the systolic blood BP goal" . "In patients with hypertension with diabetes or renal disease, the BP goal is less than 130/80 mm Hg".</P>
<P>2- The 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) / International Society of Hypertension (ISH) (<LINK REF="REF-WHO_x002f_ISH-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO/ISH 2003</LINK>) states that "the primary goal of therapy is to lower systolic blood pressure, and the pragmatic target of below 140 mmHg is reaffirmed", and "the diastolic blood pressure to about 90 mmHg". There is also a small section entitled "Targets for blood pressure lowering in hypertensive patients at high risk" referring to patients with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal insufficiency; for them the conclusion is that "a target of &lt;130/80 mmHg seems appropriate".</P>
<P>3- Similar to the two previous guidelines, the Kidney Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) clinical practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-K_x002f_DOQI-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">K/DOQI 2004</LINK>) recommends a blood pressure goal lower than in uncomplicated hypertension, below 130/80 mmHg rather than 140/90 mmHg, in order to better preserve renal function in patients with renal disease.</P>
<P>4- The British Hypertension Society guidelines for hypertension management 2004 (<LINK REF="REF-BHS-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">BHS 2004</LINK>) states that "for most patients a target of less than or equal to 140 mmHg systolic blood pressure and less than or equal to 85 mmHg diastolic blood pressure is recommended. For patients with diabetes, renal impairment or established cardiovascular disease a lower target of less than or equal to 130/80 mmHg is recommended".</P>
<P>5- The 2007 European Society of Hypertension - European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-ESH_x002d_ESC-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESH-ESC 2007</LINK>) recommends that "blood pressure should be reduced to at least below 140/90 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and to lower values, if tolerated, in all hypertensive patients", and "target BP should be at least &lt; 130/80 mm Hg in diabetics and in high risk patients, such as those with associated clinical conditions (stroke, myocardial infarction, renal dysfunction, proteinuria)".</P>
<P>6- The 2007 guidelines for the Treatment of Hypertension in the Prevention and Management of Ischemic Heart Disease from The American Heart Association "recommend a target BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg for individuals with demonstrated coronary artery disease or risk equivalents (carotid artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm), and for high-risk individuals, defined as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, or a 10-year Framingham risk score of more than 10%" based on epidemiological data, despite recognizing that "epidemiological correlations cannot be used as proof of the value of treatment" (<LINK REF="REF-AHA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">AHA 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>7- Finally, the 2008 American Diabetes Association (<LINK REF="REF-ADA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">ADA 2008</LINK>) standards of medical care states that "patients with diabetes should be treated to a systolic blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg", and "to a diastolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg".</P>
<P>Attempting to achieve lower blood pressure targets has several consequences. The most obvious is the need for large doses and increased number of antihypertensive drugs. This has inconvenience and economic costs to patients. More drugs and higher doses will also increase adverse drug effects, which if serious could negate any potential benefit associated with any achieved lower blood pressure. There is also the potential that lowering blood pressure too much may cause adverse cardiovascular events. Some observations have suggested that excessive lowering of the diastolic blood pressure with drugs is associated with an increased number of deaths due to coronary heart disease (<LINK REF="REF-Farnett-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farnett 1991</LINK>). This relationship, called the "J-curve phenomenon", was initially described in hypertensive patients with ischaemic heart disease, and the curve's inflection point was said to be around 85 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Cruickshank-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cruickshank 1988</LINK>). An increased risk of stroke was described with treated diastolic blood pressure lower than 65 mmHg as compared with higher pressures (<LINK REF="REF-Voko-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voko 1999</LINK>). More recently, a post-hoc subgroup analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial has raised concern about the possibility that a J-shaped curve exists in smokers with elevated blood pressure due to a significantly increased risk of total and cardiovascular deaths, major cardiovascular events and stroke in smokers randomized to diastolic blood pressures in the two lower blood pressure target groups as compared with a target of less than or equal to 90 mmHg (<LINK REF="REF-Zanchetti-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zanchetti 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lund_x002d_Johansen-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lund-Johansen 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>In summary, the ideal blood pressure target in the treatment of patients with elevated blood pressure has not been established. Furthermore, the assumption that lowering blood pressure by pharmacological means results in the same cardiovascular risk reduction as that associated with similarly lower blood pressures recorded in epidemiological studies needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials. The only way to prove that a lower target is beneficial is a trial where patients are randomized to different treatment targets.</P>
<P>Our goal therefore was to identify all randomized controlled trials where patients were randomized to blood pressure targets lower than standard as compared with standard blood pressure targets. The "lower target" category is defined as any systolic blood pressure target less than or equal to 135 mmHg, and any diastolic blood pressure target less than or equal to 85 mmHg. The "standard target" category is defined as a systolic blood pressure target less than or equal to 140-160 mmHg, and a diastolic blood pressure target less than or equal to 90-100 mmHg. We have chosen a range for both target categories to be inclusive and made sure that the two treatment groups are mutually exclusiv. Treatment targets higher than 160 mmHg systolic and higher than 100 mmHg diastolic are not eligible because they are considered to be inappropriately high. The specific aim of this systematic review is to determine whether treatment of patients with elevated blood pressure to "lower target" blood pressures is associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with treatment to "standard target" blood pressures.</P>

<P>The outcomes to be compared and the trial eligibility criteria were specified before the result of any contributing trial was known. Two independent reviewers (JAA, MIP) assessed and determined which trials were included or excluded. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or by a third individual if necessary.</P>
<P>Data from the trials was extracted independently by 2 reviewers (JAA, MIP) from the included trials. For the synthesis and analysis of the data, Cochrane review manager software, RevMan 5, was used. Quantitative analyses of outcomes were based on intention-to-treat principle. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials. A standard chi-square statistic was used to test for heterogeneity of treatment effect between the trials (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>). An I<SUP>2</SUP> value &gt;50% was considered indicative of significant heterogeneity. A random effects model was used to test for statistical significance when significant heterogeneity existed (<LINK REF="REF-Lau-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lau 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whitehead-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whitehead 1991</LINK>). An alpha value of &lt; 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant for the primary outcomes, however, in order to avoid an inflated chance of a type I error due to the multiple comparisons performed, an alpha value of &lt; 0.01 was required for all secondary outcomes and sensitivity analyses.</P>
<P>The assessment of risk of bias of the trials was based on considering the six potential sources of systematic bias in trials that need to be assessed for a review according to the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, loss to followup, selective reporting and other.</P>
<P>The following sensitivity analyses were performed:</P>
<P>a.To increase the difference in blood pressure between the "lower" and the "standard" targets, a sensitivity analysis was performed comparing only those trials where the difference in the targets was at least 10 mmHg.</P>
<P>b.Based on the guidelines recommending lower blood pressure targets in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease a sensitivity analysis was performed in patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline and in patients with chronic renal disease at baseline.</P>

<B>1. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease trial (</B>
<LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>
<B>):</B>
</P>
<P>a. Methods:</P>
<P>Randomized, open label, controlled trial. Patients were randomized to two different blood pressure targets and also to two different protein diets.</P>
<P>Blood pressure was measured monthly. The time of day when blood pressure was measured was not provided. The same nurse or technician took the sitting blood pressure three times in a quiet room, and the average of the last two was used as the blood pressure for the visit.<BR/>
<BR/>The recommended antihypertensive regimen was an ACE inhibitor with or without a diuretic agent. A calcium channel blocker and other medications could be added as needed.</P>
<P>The mean follow-up was 2.2 years.</P>
<P>b. Participants:</P>
<P>840 patients with various chronic renal diseases were included. Chronic renal disease was established as a creatinine clearance of less than 70 ml per minute per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP> of body surface area. To be included the participants had to be between 18 and 70 years old, and have a mean arterial pressure of 125 mmHg or less. Mean arterial pressure was calculated as one third of systolic blood pressure plus two thirds of diastolic blood pressure. Arterial hypertension was not an inclusion criterion, but 86% of included participants were described as hypertensives; how hypertension was defined was not provided.</P>
<P>The main exclusion criteria were pregnancy, insulin requiring diabetes mellitus, weight severely over or under normal, and urinary protein excretion exceeding 10 grams per day.</P>
<P>c. Interventions:</P>
<P>Patients were randomly assigned to a "usual"- or "low-blood pressure" group. "Usual blood pressure" was defined as a mean arterial pressure &#8804; 107 mmHg (approximately 140/90 mmHg) for patients &lt; 60 years of age and &#8804; 113 mmHg (approximately &#8804; 160/90 mmHg) for patients &gt; 60 years, whereas "low blood pressure" was defined as a mean arterial pressure &#8804; 92 mmHg (approximately &#8804; 125/75 mmHg) for patients &lt; 60 years and &#8804; 98 mmHg (approximately &#8804; 135/80 mmHg) for &gt; 60 years.</P>
<P>d. Outcomes:</P>
<P>The rate of change in glomerular filtration rate was the primary outcome measure. Other recorded outcomes were death, end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or transplantation, and other serious medical conditions.</P>
<P>e. Additional notes:</P>
<P>Patients were also randomized to usual- or low-protein diet.</P>

<B>):</B>
</P>
<P>a. Methods:</P>
<P>The study was a 2 X 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to either placebo or enalapril and to either "strict" or "conventional" blood pressure ranges. Before randomization, diastolic blood pressure was lowered to 80 mmHg or less over a 3 to 6 months initial assessment period. Patients able to achieve that target were randomized and included in the study.</P>
<P>Blood pressure was measured in the supine position with a mercury sphygmomanometer after a minimum of 5 minutes rest. The time of day when blood pressure was measured was not provided. Three measurements were taken at 2-minute intervals. The mean of those measurements was used.</P>
<P>Patients were randomly assigned to receive enalapril or placebo. In addition, to achieve the target diastolic blood pressure a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications was used: a diuretic was the initial drug, followed by a beta-blocker, hydralazine or minoxidil, and clonidine, alpha-methyldopa or an alpha-1 blocker. With the exception of the diuretic, the maximum dose of each agent was used before moving to the next step. In patients assigned to "conventional" group, diastolic blood pressure was allowed to increase to the 85 to 95 mmHg range, whereas it had to be maintained between 65 and 80 mmHg in those assigned to the "strict" group.<BR/>
<BR/>Mean follow-up was 40.5 ± 1.8 months in the "strict" group, and 42.2 ± 2.1 months in the "conventional" group.</P>
<P>b. Participants:</P>
<P>87 patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis were initially considered for the trial. Their age ranged from 25 to 73 years. The inclusion criteria were a diastolic blood pressure higher than or equal to 95 mmHg, a serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL but lower than 7.0 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 70 ml/min/1.73m<SUP>2</SUP>, history of long-standing hypertension, an inactive urine sediment, a urinary protein excretion rate lower than 2 grams per day, and no physical or biochemical evidence for a humoral-mediated cause for hypertension. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, a recent history (in the previous 4 months) of malignant hypertension, stroke or myocardial infarction, acute renal failure of any cause, analgesic abuse, polycystic kidney disease and other causes of chronic renal disease, evidence of significant hepatic impairment, mental incapacity, pregnancy or lactation, primary hyperaldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, pheochromocytoma.</P>
<P>Based on the initial assessment period, 77 patients were classified as "responders" and 10 patients were "non-responders". Since they were not randomized, "non-responder" patients were not included in this study.</P>
<P>c. Interventions:</P>
<P>"Responder" patients were randomized to either placebo or enalapril, in a double-blind design. They were also randomized to either "strict" or "conventional" blood pressure ranges in an open label design. "Strict" was defined as a diastolic blood pressure lower than 80 mm Hg, whereas "conventional" was defined as a diastolic pressure between 85 and 95 mm Hg.</P>
<P>After randomization, the blinded study drug was titrated to maximum allowable dose and the unblinded antihypertensive agents were back-titrated as needed to achieve and maintain blood pressure control.</P>
<P>d. Outcomes:</P>
<P>The primary outcome was the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate, measured by the renal clearance of I<SUP>125</SUP> -iothalamate. Other outcomes were death, end-stage renal disease and 50% decline in glomerular filtration rate or doubled serum creatinine (from baseline).</P>
<P>e. Additional notes:</P>
<P>Assignment to enalapril versus placebo did not change the results of the blood pressure control.</P>
<P>The exclusion of patients not able to achieve the lower target during the pre-randomization period is a limitation of the trial as the results are only relevant to "responders" as defined in this study.</P>

<B>3. Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial (</B>
<LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK>
<B>):<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>a. Methods:</P>
<P>Randomized, open label, 3 X 2 factorial design controlled trial, with blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design. An Independent Clinical Event Committee, masked to the group allocation, evaluated all clinical events.</P>
<P>Blood pressure was measured three times, by an oscillometric semiautomatic device, with the patient in the sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. The time of day when blood pressure was measured was not specified.</P>
<P>Patients were randomly assigned to one of three diastolic blood pressure target groups. Block randomization was performed taking into consideration the following baseline variables: age, sex, previous antihypertensive therapy, smoking, previous myocardial infarction, previous coronary heart disease, previous stroke and diabetes mellitus.</P>
<P>All patients were treated with the same drugs in the same order. The following were the required steps allowed to attempt to achieve the target blood pressure:<BR/>Step 1- felodipine 5 mg once a day<BR/>Step 2- a starting dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or beta-blocker was added<BR/>Step 3- the dose of felodipine was increased to 10 mg once a day<BR/>Step 4- the dose of the ACE inhibitor or the beta-blocker was doubled<BR/>Step 5- a diuretic was added</P>
<P>The average follow-up was 3.8 years.</P>
<P>b. Participants:</P>
<P>19193 patients with elevated blood pressure, aged 50-80 years, were initially included, but the study population was composed of 18790 patients. Four hundred and three patients were excluded early in the trial because of the suspicion of incorrect inclusion.</P>
<P>Baseline diastolic blood pressure between 100 mmHg and 115 mmHg on two occasions, at least one week apart, was an inclusion criterion.</P>
<P>The main exclusion criteria were malignant hypertension, secondary hypertension, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 115 mmHg, stroke or myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to randomization, decompensated congestive heart failure, other serious concomitant diseases which could affect survival during the next 2-3 years, patients who required a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor or diuretic for reasons other than hypertension, patients who required antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, and insulin treated diabetics.</P>
<P>c. Interventions:</P>
<P>Patients were randomly assigned to one of three diastolic blood pressure target groups: &#8804; 90 mmHg, &#8804; 85 mmHg, or &#8804; 80 mmHg and to low dose acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg or placebo.</P>
<P>d. Outcomes:</P>
<P>The outcomes measured were: total and cardiovascular mortality, all (fatal and non-fatal) myocardial infarctions including silent infarctions, all (fatal and non-fatal) strokes, and major cardiovascular events (all myocardial infarctions plus all strokes plus other cardiovascular deaths).</P>

<B>4. Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial H </B>(<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK>)</P>
<P>a. Methods:</P>
<P>Randomized, open label clinical trial. Patients were randomized to "intensive" versus "moderate" blood pressure control. They were also allocated to either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive medication. If the target blood pressure was not achieved with increasing doses, then open-label antihypertensive medications were added in a step-wise fashion, initially with metoprolol, then hydrochlorothiazide or additional drugs, but neither a calcium channel blocker nor an ACE inhibitor.<BR/>Blood pressure recordings were obtained at the time when peak drug levels were expected and were an average of three seated readings obtained at each visit.</P>
<P>An independent end point committee, which was blinded to the study intervention arms, reviewed all cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>The follow-up period was 5 years.</P>
<P>b. Participants:</P>
<P>Four hundred and seventy patients, between the ages of 40 and 74 years, with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a diastolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 90 mm Hg were included.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria included myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident within the previous 6 months, coronary artery bypass surgery within the previous 3 months, unstable angina pectoris within the previous 6 months, congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV, a demonstrated absolute need for ACE inhibitors or CCB, and a serum creatinine level &gt; 3 mg/dL.</P>
<P>c. Interventions:</P>
<P>Patients were randomized into two treatment arms consisting of "intensive" treatment with a diastolic blood pressure goal of 75 mmHg, and "moderate" treatment with a diastolic blood pressure goal of 80-89 mmHg.</P>
<P>d. Outcomes:</P>
<P>The primary end point was the change in 24-hour creatinine clearance. Secondary end points included cardiovascular events, retinopathy, clinical neuropathy, and urinary albumin excretion.</P>
<P>e. Additional notes:</P>
<P>Patients were also randomized to either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive medication. A test for interaction between study-drug assignment and blood-pressure-control strategy showed that no interaction was present.</P>
<P>
<B>5. Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes trial N</B> (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK>)</P>
<P>a. Methods:</P>
<P>Randomized, open label controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to "intensive" (10 mm Hg below the baseline diastolic blood pressure) versus "moderate" (80-89 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure control.</P>
<P>Patients in the "moderate" therapy group were given placebo, whereas patients randomized to "intensive" therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril in a blinded manner as the initial antihypertensive medication. If the target blood pressure was not achieved with increasing doses, then open-label antihypertensive medications were added in a step-wise fashion, initially with metoprolol, then hydrochlorothiazide or additional drugs, but not a calcium channel blocker nor ACE inhibitor.</P>
<P>Blood pressure recordings were obtained at the time when peak drug levels were expected and were an average of three seated readings obtained at each visit.<BR/>
<BR/>An independent end point committee, which was blinded to the study intervention arms, reviewed all cardiovascular events. The follow-up period was 5 years.</P>
<P>b. Participants:</P>
<P>Four hundred and eighty patients, between the ages of 40 and 74 years, with type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. All of them had a baseline diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg and were not receiving antihypertensive medications at the randomization visit.</P>
<P>The main exclusion criteria were: myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the previous 6 months, coronary artery bypass surgery within the previous 3 months, unstable angina pectoris within the previous 6 months, congestive heart failure NYHA class III or IV, a demonstrated absolute need for ACE inhibitors or CCB, and a serum creatinine level &gt; 3 mg/dl.</P>
<P>c. Interventions:</P>
<P>Patients were randomized into two treatment arms consisting of "intensive" or "moderate" treatment. The goal in the "intensive" treatment group was to achieve a decrease of 10 mmHg below baseline in diastolic blood pressure (i.e. 70 to 79 mmHg), whereas the goal in the "moderate" treatment group was to maintain a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg.</P>
<P>d. Outcomes:</P>
<P>The primary end point was the change in 24-hour creatinine clearance. Secondary end points included cardiovascular events, retinopathy, clinical neuropathy, and urinary albumin excretion.</P>
<P>e. Additional notes:</P>
<P>Patients randomized to intensive therapy received either nisoldipine or enalapril in a blinded manner as the initial antihypertensive medication. Patients in the moderate group were given placebo. However, by the end of the study 117 patients (48%) initially randomized to moderate therapy required treatment (systolic blood pressure &gt; 159 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 89 mmHg on two consecutive visits). These individuals were started on either nisoldipine or enalapril according to randomization at entry into the study with the goal of maintaining the systolic blood pressure &lt; 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg.</P>
<P>A test for interaction between study-drug assignment and blood-pressure-control strategy showed that no interaction was present</P>
<P>
<B>6. African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension trial</B> (<LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK>)</P>
<P>a. Methods</P>
<P>Randomized 3 x 2 factorial trial. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 mean arterial pressure goals, and to initial treatment with a beta-blocker (metoprolol), an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). Open-label agents were added sequentially to achieve the blood pressure goal.</P>
<P>Three consecutive seated blood pressure readings were measured with a sphygmomanometer after at least 5 minutes rest, with the mean of the last 2 readings recorded. The time of day when blood pressure was measured was not reported.<BR/>
<BR/>All cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular deaths and hospitalizations for myocardial infarctions, strokes, heart failure, revascularization procedures, and other hospitalized cardiovascular events were reviewed and classified by a blinded end points committee.</P>
<P>The follow-up was 3 to 6.4 years.</P>
<P>b. Participants</P>
<P>One thousand and ninety four participants (18 to 70 years old), self-identified as African-Americans, with diastolic blood pressure higher than 94 mmHg were included in the study. They also had to have a glomerular filtration rate between 20 and 65 ml/min per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>, and no identified cause of renal disease other than elevated blood pressure.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were known history of diabetes mellitus, urinary protein to creatinine ratio of more than 2.5, accelerated or malignant hypertension within 6 months, secondary hypertension, evidence of non-BP-related causes of chronic kidney disease, serious systemic disease, clinical congestive heart failure, or specific indication for or contraindication to a study drug procedure.</P>
<P>c. Interventions</P>
<P>Participants were randomized to a "usual" mean arterial pressure goal of 102 mmHg (approximately 135/85 mmHg) to 107 mmHg (approximately 140/90 mmHg) or to a "lower" mean arterial pressure goal of less than or equal to 92 mmHg (approximately &lt;125/75 mmHg).</P>
<P>d. Outcomes</P>
<P>The primary analysis in the trial was based on the rate of change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR slope), assessed by renal clearance of I<SUP>125</SUP> iothalamate.</P>
<P>The protocol also designated a main secondary composite outcome, which included any of the following: a confirmed reduction in GFR by 50% or by 25 mL/min per 1.72 m<SUP>2</SUP> from the mean of the two baseline GFRs; end stage renal disease (dialysis or transplantation); or death.</P>

<P>a. Methods<BR/>

<BR/>
Multicentre, randomized, controlled trial. Before randomization, patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs (apart from ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists, and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers) to maintain diastolic blood pressure at less than 90 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to either conventional blood-pressure control (diastolic &lt; 90 mm Hg, irrespective of systolic blood pressure) or intensified blood-pressure control . To achieve the intensified blood-pressure level, patients received add-on therapy with the dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker felodipine 5 mg/day, and up-titrated the dose after a week to 10 mg/day according to blood-pressure response. In both arms up- and down-titration of concomitant drugs was allowed to maintain the target blood pressure and to avoid symptomatic hypotension. 
<BR/>

<BR/>Blood pressure was measured 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after randomization, and every 3 months thereafter. Additional measurements were done within 1 week after any change in antihypertensive therapy.</P>
<P>The blood pressure was the mean of three values taken 2 minutes apart, after 5 minutes rest in the sitting position, on the same arm by a standard sphygmomanometer. The time of day when blood pressure was measured was not reported.
<BR/>

<BR/>The median follow-up was 19 months.
<BR/>

<BR/>b. Participants</P>
<P>Three hundred and thirty eight patients, who had non-diabetic nephropathy and persistent proteinuria, and who had not received ACE-inhibition therapy for at least 6 weeks. Persistent proteinuria was defined as urinary protein excretion exceeding 1 g per 24 h for at least 3 months without evidence of urinary-tract infection or overt heart failure (NYHA class III-IV). Patients with proteinuria of 1-3 g per 24 h were included if their creatinine clearance was less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>; those with a proteinuria of 3 g per 24 h or more were included if their creatinine clearance was less than 70 mL/min per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>.</P>
<P>Exclusion criteria were treatment with corticosteroids, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or immunosupressive drugs; acute myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the previous 6 months, severe uncontrolled hypertension, evidence or suspicion of renovascular disease, obstructive uropathy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, collagen disease, cancer, higher serum aminotransferase concentrations, or chronic cough, history of allergy, or poor tolerance to ACE inhibitors or dihydropiridine calcium-channel blockers, pregnancy, breastfeeding.<BR/>

<BR/>
c. Interventions</P>
<P>Participants were randomly assigned to either "conventional" (diastolic &lt; 90 mm Hg) or intensified (systolic/diastolic &lt; 130/80 mm Hg) blood-pressure control.
<BR/>

<BR/>d. Outcomes</P>
<P>The primary outcome was progression to end-stage renal disease. Other outcomes were GFR decline, residual proteinuria, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.</P>
<P>e. Additional notes</P>
<P>After the first interim analysis, done as per protocol, an independent adjudicating panel stated that the study had to be stopped for futility because the outcomes were similar in both arms despite more effective blood-pressure reduction in the intensified blood-pressure control arm.</P>

<B>Treat Blood Pressure Better Study or BBB for Behandla Blodtryck Bättre in Swedish </B>(<LINK REF="STD-BBB" TYPE="STUDY">BBB</LINK>)</P>
<P>Randomized, open label, controlled trial. Two thousand one hundred and twenty seven hypertensive patients aged 45-67 years were included. To be included, they had to be receiving antihypertensive treatment, and their treated diastolic blood pressures on at least three consecutive visits were in the range between 90 and 100 mmHg.</P>
<P>Patients were randomized to "intensified" or "unchanged" therapy. In the group allocated to "intensified" treatment, the purpose was to reduce the diastolic blood pressure to less than or equal to 80 mmHg. In the group allocated to "unchanged" therapy, the aim was to maintain the diastolic blood pressure in the range of 90-100 mmHg.</P>
<P>This study, which showed no difference in morbidity or mortality outcomes between the target groups, was excluded from this meta-analysis because the number of patients randomized to each treatment arm was not reported and an attempt to obtain the information from the authors was unsuccessful.</P>
<P>
<B>Hypertension in Diabetes Study IV</B> (<LINK REF="STD-HDS" TYPE="STUDY">HDS</LINK>)</P>
<P>Seven hundred and fifty eight hypertensive diabetic patients were included in this randomized controlled trial. The mean blood pressure at entry was 160/94 mmHg. This trial compared "tight control" of blood pressure aiming at a blood pressure of &lt; 150/85 mmHg, with "less tight control" aiming at a blood pressure of &lt; 180/105 mmHg.</P>
<P>This study was excluded from the meta-analysis because the target for systolic blood pressure in the "tight control" group was higher than that stated in our protocol. In addition and more importantly the targets for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the "less tight control group" were much higher than specified in the protocol for this systematic review. These "less tight" pressures are similar to the escape criteria in most placebo or no treatment controlled antihypertensive trials, and much higher than conventional treatment goals prevalent since the 1970's.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is likely that participants in this trial represent a subgroup of patients included in UKPDS 38, because the study design is similar and the authors are the same.</P>
<P>
<B>United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study</B> (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS</LINK>)</P>
<P>One thousand one hundred and eighty four hypertensive diabetic patients were included in this randomized controlled trial comparing "tight control" of blood pressure with "less tight control". The "tight control"group aimed at a blood pressure of &lt; 150/85 mmHg. In the "less tight control" group the target was originally set at &lt; 200/105 mmHg, but was reduced to &lt; 180/105 mmHg 5 years after the start of the study.</P>
<P>This study was excluded from the meta-analysis because the target for systolic blood pressure in the "tight control" group was higher than that stated in our protocol. In addition and more importantly the targets for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the "less tight control group" were much higher than specified in the protocol for this systematic review. These "less tight" pressures are similar to the escape criteria in most placebo or no treatment controlled antihypertensive trials, and much higher than conventional treatment goals prevalent since the 1970's.</P>

<B>Lewis et al </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Lewis" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis</LINK>)</P>
<P>Randomized controlled trial. 129 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy were randomly assigned to a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) goal less than or equal to 92 mmHg or a MAP goal between 100 and 107 mmHg.</P>
<P>The primary outcomes in this trial were surrogate markers of renal function in order to determine the impact of assignment to different levels of blood pressure control on the course of type 1 diabetic nephropathy.</P>
<P>It was excluded because it did not provide data on any of the outcomes defined for this systematic review. The only reported clinical event was end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Twelve patients reached ESRD, but the distribution of those patients according to the blood pressure target assigned was not provided. It also reported achieved blood pressure but as mean arterial pressure, not as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure achieved. The authors did not respond to written requests for the additional information required for this review.</P>

<B>Steno-2 study </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Steno_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">Steno-2</LINK>)</P>
<P>This study was a randomized, open, parallel study. Eighty patients with type-2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive conventional treatment in accordance with national guidelines in Denmark, and 80 patients to receive intensive treatment. The intensive treatment arm included stepwise implementation of behavior modification and pharmacologic therapy that targeted more strict values for systolic blood pressure (&lt; 140 mmHg during the initial 7 years and &lt; 130 mmHg during the last 2 years in the intensive treatment arm vs &lt; 160 mmHg and &lt; 135 mmHg respectively in the conventional treatment arm) and diastolic blood pressure (&lt; 85 mmHg during the initial 7 years and &lt; 80 mmHg during the last 2 years in the intensive treatment arm vs &lt; 95 mmHg and 85 mmHg respectively in the conventional treatment arm), but also more strict targets for glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting total serum cholesterol and fasting serum triglycerides, treatment with an ACE inhibitor irrespective of blood pressure, and aspirin therapy for patients with peripheral artery disease, and also aspirin therapy for patients without coronary artery disease or without peripheral artery disease during the last 2 years.</P>
<P>This trial was not included because the multifactorial intervention prevented any inference as to whether any difference in clinical outcomes could be attributed to a lower blood pressure target or to any of the other combined interventions.</P>

<BR/>This was a randomized, open-label, blinded-to-end-point study performed in 499 American Indians with diabetes and no prior cardiovascular events. The primary end point was progression of atherosclerosis determined by ultrasonographic measurement of the common carotid artery intimal medial thickness. The incidence of clinical events was a secondary outcome. Patients were randomized to standard or aggressive treatment groups. The standard treatment was designed as a systolic blood pressure target of 130 mm Hg or lower and LDL-C target of 100 mg/dL or lower, whereas aggressive treatment was defined as a systolic blood pressure target of 115 mm Hg or lower and LDL-C target of 70 mg/dL or lower.</P>
<P>This trial was not included because the dual intervention would not allow discrimination of events specifically associated with a lower blood pressure target. Besides, both systolic blood pressure targets in this trial were within the values considered as "lower targets" in our systematic review.</P>

<P>The results are discussed according to the hierarchy of outcomes previously mentioned. Several outcomes were not reported in the published trials. Missing information was requested by e-mail sent to the main authors of each trial, but it was not obtained. The authors of the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> trial replied that they are going to include the missing information in a paper they are preparing to submit for publication. There was no reply from the authors of the remaining trials.</P>
<P>Some additional information, not included in the original published reports, was provided by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2003</LINK>). That information is described for each outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Primary outcomes </B>
</P>
<P>
<B>1.1 Mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<B>1.1.1 Total mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Information from 6 of the 7 trials was available for this outcome. The mortality data from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (<LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>) could not be included for the following reasons. The original publication of the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial mentioned 30 deaths, without specifying to which group they belonged (<LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>). An additional publication of the same trial (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 1997</LINK>) provided the distribution, according to blood pressure goal, of 16 patients who died before reaching a study point, but not for 14 patients who died after a stop point but before their scheduled close-out visit.</P>
<P>The data on mortality from the <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> trial deserve an explanation. The first publication of the trial (<LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK>) mentioned 30 deaths in total, but it did not provide details on the distribution according to blood pressure targets, because it focused on the comparison between the antihypertensive drugs used. A later publication stated that "patients randomized to intensive therapy had a lower incidence of all-cause mortality when compared to moderate therapy, 5.5% vs 10.7%, p= 0.037" (<LINK REF="REF-Estacio-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Estacio 2000</LINK>), without providing absolute numbers. Given that 237 patients were assigned to the intensive treatment group, and 233 patients to the moderate treatment group, the absolute numbers of deaths calculated from the reported percentages would be 13 and 25 respectively, for a total of 38 deaths, which differs from the total mortality mentioned in the first report. Finally, the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2003</LINK>) reported 32 deaths in the same trial, 10 in the intensive treatment group and 22 in the moderate treatment group. Due to the lack of concordance, the information from BPLTTC was used for this analysis, because it was the only one providing absolute numbers and because they were closer to the figures mentioned in the original report.</P>
<P>In the meta-analysis there was no difference in total mortality between the two blood pressure target groups: RR 0.99, 95% CI (0.86, 1.15), p= 0.93. The decrease in total mortality reported in the <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> trial was not seen in the other trials.</P>
<P>
<B>1.1.2 Cardiovascular mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The comparison for cardiovascular mortality does not include the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al, since cause of death was not given for the single patient who died in that trial. The information from the <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> trial was provided by the BPLTTC.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis showed no difference in cardiovascular mortality between the two blood pressure target groups: RR 1.03, 95% CI (0.83, 1.28), p= 0.8.</P>
<P>
<B>1.1.3 Non-cardiovascular mortality<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Likewise the meta-analysis showed no difference in non-cardiovascular mortality: RR 0.96, 95% CI (0.78, 1.18), p= 0.69. The comparison does not include the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al for the previously specified reason.</P>
<P>
<B>1.2 Total serious adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>Only the <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> trial reported total serious adverse events, and there was no difference between the groups: RR 1.39, 95% CI (0.90, 2.15), p= 0.14.</P>
<P>
<B>1.3 Other cardiovascular serious adverse events</B>
</P>
<P>Each trial reported separately several cardiovascular serious adverse events. However, none of the events was reported in every trial. Fatal and non-fatal events were reported combined.</P>
<P>Data from <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> are missing because they did not report the number of specific serious adverse events separately.</P>
<P>
<B>1.3.1 Myocardial infarction<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Only 3 trials reported the rates for myocardial infarction. To maintain homogeneity with the other trials for the purpose of this analysis, data extracted from <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> do not include silent myocardial infarctions. The meta-analysis showed no difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction: RR 0.84, 95% CI (0.74, 1.09), p= 0.15.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the incidence of silent myocardial infarctions reported in the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial was not different between the lower (89/12526) and the traditional target groups (43/6264): RR 1.04, 99% CI (0.64, 1.67), p= 0.9.</P>
<P>
<B>1.3.2 Stroke<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The information on stroke is available from only 3 trials. Data from <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> was provided by the BPLTTC.</P>
<P>A lower incidence of stroke was reported in <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK>, but not in the other trials. There was no difference in the pooled analysis for this outcome: RR 0.99, 95% CI (0.79, 1.25), p= 0.96.<BR/>

<BR/>

<B>1.3.3 Congestive heart failure<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>The only trial reporting data on congestive heart failure was the <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK> trial. It was defined as congestive heart failure requiring hospital admission. Data from <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> was provided by <LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2003</LINK>. There was no difference in the pooled analysis for this outcome: RR 0.88, 95% CI (0.59, 1.32), p= 0.55<BR/>

<BR/>

<B>1.3.4 End-stage renal disease<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>End-stage renal disease, defined as the requirement of dialysis or kidney transplantation, was reported in the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> trial, in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al, and in the <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> trial. An additional 106 patients included in the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial developed end-stage renal disease, but they could not be included in this analysis because their distribution between "usual" or "lower" blood pressure was not provided. An additional publication of the trial (<LINK REF="REF-Sarnak-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarnak 2005</LINK>) reported kidney failure during long term follow-up (7 years after the end of the trial), but it was not included because no specific target blood pressure was recommended after completion of the trial.<BR/>
<BR/>The incidence of end-stage renal disease was similar between patients randomized to "lower" or "standard" blood pressure targets: RR 1.01, 95% CI (0.81, 1.27), p= 0.92</P>
<P>
<B>1.3.5 Major cardiovascular events<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Information regarding major cardiovascular events, a composite outcome including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or any cardiovascular death, was available from 4 trials. The BPLTTC's authors provided additional information for this outcome in the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK> trials. The <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial reported major cardiovascular events, but did not include hospital admissions due to heart failure. As mentioned before, that information was provided by <LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2003</LINK>. The effect size does not change whether or not the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial is included in the analysis.</P>
<P>There was no difference between the lower or standard target blood pressure for this outcome: RR 0.94, 95% CI (0.83, 1.07), p= 0.35.</P>
<P>
<B>1.3.6 All other serious adverse events<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>None of the trials reported the number of other serious adverse events.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Secondary outcomes<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Some secondary outcomes were not available in several trials. Each of the outcomes is briefly described below.</P>
<P>
<B>2.1 Systolic blood pressure achieved<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Six trials reported the mean systolic blood pressure achieved. The <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial was not included in the analysis because it reported mean arterial pressure, but not systolic blood pressure achieved. In <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK>, achieved blood pressure was defined as the mean of all blood pressures from 6 months of follow-up to end of study. In <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK> and in <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK>, the achieved blood pressure was defined as the average blood pressure for the last four years of follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> included blood pressure measurements after 3 months of follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> considered blood pressure throughout follow-up. <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al did not describe the method used to estimate achieved blood pressure.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity between trials for this outcome was high. However, using the random effects model the achieved BP was statistically significantly lower in the lower target group than the standard target group: p= 0.003. The fixed effects model provides the best estimate of average magnitude of the difference between the systolic BP in the two groups, 3.9 mmHg lower in the lower target group (see <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>2.2 Diastolic blood pressure achieved<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Six trials reported the mean diastolic blood pressure achieved, as defined above. The <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial was not included because it reported mean arterial pressure achieved, but not diastolic blood pressure. Using the fixed effects model as the best estimate of the weighted mean change, the weighted mean diastolic blood pressure was 3.4 mmHg lower in the lower target group. Heterogeneity was also high for this outcome; the random effects model demonstrated that the blood pressure was statistically significantly lower in the lower target group p = 0.001.</P>
<P>
<B>2.3 Proportion of patients not achieving the blood pressure targets<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Only three trials, the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK>, the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trials, reported the number of patients who did not achieve the target blood pressure levels. Data from the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial was obtained from an interim analysis reporting results on blood pressure at 24 months of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1997</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> was excluded from this analysis, as in <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> the higher target was a range of values rather than as any value below the target. In the other two trials there was a statistically significantly larger proportion of patients not achieving the lower blood pressure target: RR 2.36, 99% CI (2.17, 2.56), p&lt;0.00001.</P>
<P>
<B>2.4 Withdrawals due to adverse effects<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Only the <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> trial reported the total number of withdrawals specifically due to the treatment adverse effects in each treatment arm, and there was no statistical difference between the groups: RR 2.00, 99% CI (0.33, 12.10), p=0.32.</P>
<P>Only fragmented information regarding adverse effects was provided in 3 of the remaining 6 trials. For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial, in 14 (3.2%) of patients in the lower blood pressure group and in 3 (0.7%) of patients in the higher blood pressure group, a reduction in antihypertensive medications was required due to persistent symptoms of hypotension (p=0.01 for the comparison between groups) (<LINK REF="REF-Lazarus-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lazarus 1997</LINK>). Furthermore, the blood pressure had to be raised because of persistent symptoms of hypotension in 17 patients, but their distribution according to blood pressure target was not provided (<LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>). However, the authors mentioned that no patient reached a stopping point in the study because of complications of hypotension (<LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>). The main report of the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial did not provide information regarding withdrawals due to adverse effects. A preliminary publication of the same trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1997</LINK>) described tolerability at 24 months and reported that there was no difference in overall incidence of side effects between the three target groups. However, according to the protocol, treatment was titrated in up to five steps, and the already cited preliminary publication mentioned that "more patients needed step 5 medication in the less than or equal to 80 mmHg target group than in the less than or equal to 90 mmHg target group", and "with increasing dose titration steps there was a gradual increase in the total number of side effects" (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1997</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> trial it is stated that "proportions of patients reporting adverse symptoms, including hypotensive symptoms, were similar in the 2 blood pressure groups". However, according to Table 5 in the same report, cough occurred more frequently in patients assigned to the lower blood pressure target (54.6% vs 47.0, p&lt;0.05).</P>
<P>
<B>2.5 Number of antihypertensive drugs needed per patient<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Only the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> trials reported the number of drugs needed in each group in order to try to achieve the target blood pressure. When those trials were combined 0.53 99% CI (0.22, 0.84) more pharmacological antihypertensive agents were needed per patient in the groups randomized to the lower blood pressure target (p= 0.00001).</P>
<P>The following information from the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial was estimated from a figure provided in an interim publication reporting results after 24 months of follow-up (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1997</LINK>). Due to these limitations, the data were not combined with the other trials. The estimated mean number of antihypertensive drugs per patient was 1.87 in the lower target groups combined (DBP &lt; 80 mmHg and &lt; 85 mmHg) and 1.68 in the traditional target group (DBP &lt; 90 mmHg): p&lt; 0.00001. The proportion of patients requiring a high dose of one or more antihypertensive drugs (step 3 or higher), was larger in the lower target groups (44.9%) than in the standard target group (31.4%): p&lt; 0.0001.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-05-11 07:26:50 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="Ciprian D Jauca">
<P>The objective in the treatment of patients with elevated blood pressure is to reduce morbidity and mortality and not simply to lower blood pressure. Many epidemiological studies have shown a continuous direct linear relationship between blood pressure and the incidence of cardiovascular events. The lower threshold for this relationship has not been established (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Prospective-Studies" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prospective Studies</LINK>). More aggressive treatment in patients with elevated blood pressure aiming at lower blood pressure targets assumes that the benefits of attempting to achieve lowering blood pressure targets using antihypertensive drugs outweigh the harms caused by the drugs. This hypothesis needs to be tested and validated by specifically designed randomized controlled trials (<LINK REF="REF-Gueyffier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueyffier 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials summarizes the presently available evidence from the trials that have tested blood pressure targets and includes more than 22,000 patients, with a mean follow-up period of 3.8 years. It includes all trials measuring clinical outcomes in patients randomized to "lower blood pressure targets" as compared with "standard blood pressure targets", according to our definitions. The important observations from this systematic review are as follows.</P>
<P>
<B>Summary of main results<BR/>
</B>In patients randomized to the "lower targets" the weighted mean systolic blood pressure was 3.9 mmHg lower and the weighted mean diastolic blood pressure was 3.4 mmHg lower than patients randomized to the "standard target" (139.3 mmHg vs 143.2 mmHg systolic, and 81.7 mmHg vs 85.1 mmHg diastolic respectively). However, despite these clinically significant reductions in blood pressure over a 4 year period, trying to achieve the "lower targets", instead of the "standard target", did not result in any change in total, cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular mortality. In addition it did not result in any change in cardiovascular or renal morbidity expressed as the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, the composite outcome of major cardiovascular events, or end-stage renal disease. Thus at present there is no randomised controlled trial evidence justifying blood pressure targets lower than standard targets.</P>
<P>The lack of a difference in mortality and morbidity is robust as evidenced by the two most important measures: total mortality (RR=1.0, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16) and total major cardiovascular events (RR= 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08). Those numbers mean that we have acceptable confidence that the relative risk for total mortality is between a 14% decrease and a 16% increase, and that the relative risk for major cardiovascular events is between a 16% decrease and 8% increase. As can be appreciated, these ranges rule out a &#8805;20% reduction or &#8805;20% increase. They do not, however, exclude the possibility of a small benefit or small harm associated with attempting to achieve lower diastolic blood pressure targets.</P>
<P>One possible argument against the findings of this review is that the minimum difference in the targets chosen in this review, 5 mmHg, was not great enough to demonstrate mortality and morbidity benefits. This argument can be tested in this meta-analysis by including only those trials where the difference in the targets was at least 10 mmHg. In fact placing this restriction on the review only excludes the middle group ( lower than 85 mmHg) of the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial. A re-analysis with exclusion of the &lt; 85 mmHg diastolic blood pressure group leads to a greater weighted mean difference in target diastolic blood pressure (10.3 mmHg) between the two groups and a greater difference in the mean achieved blood pressures of 5/4 mmHg. More importantly it led to no appreciable changes in the RR for mortality nor for any of the primary morbidity outcomes, and the conclusions remain the same as described above.</P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MELLITUS</P>
<P>The main meta-analysis in this review combines all trials performed in all types of patients. Doing it in this way makes the assumption that there are no significant differences in blood pressure targets for the different subgroups of the populations included. This is a reasonable assumption and in fact it would be unexpected if lower targets were beneficial in one subgroup of patients and not beneficial or harmful in another. However, as mentioned previously, experts preparing guidelines for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease have suggested that lower blood pressure targets are indicated in these groups. Therefore, we have performed sensitivity analyses in these two subgroups of patients.</P>
<P>Diabetes was an exclusion criterion in the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al, and <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK>. In the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial, diabetic patients were excluded if they required insulin; 25 of the included patients had Type 2 diabetes mellitus, but they could not be included in this analysis because outcomes were not reported separately for the diabetics. Therefore, this sensitivity analysis is limited to two trials in which all patients had diabetes mellitus at baseline, <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK>, and a sub-group analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial, which separately reported outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus at baseline. Several issues regarding the design and the characteristics of these 3 trials must be mentioned. Although not clearly specified, the subgroup analysis of diabetic patients in the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial appears to be a post-hoc analysis, because it was not mentioned in any of the preliminary descriptions or reports of the trial published in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997 (<LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK>). In terms of baseline diastolic blood pressure, one of the trials, <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK>, included only normotensive diabetic patients, defined as a diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg. Twenty-six patients (5.4%) with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 80 and 89 mmHg) were enrolled during the first year of recruitment, but none thereafter. On the other hand, both <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> only included patients with elevated blood pressure, but the criteria for inclusion were different. In <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK>, patients had a baseline diastolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 90 mmHg, whereas the blood pressure inclusion criterion in <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> was a baseline diastolic blood pressure between 100 mmHg and 115 mmHg. Finally, it must be mentioned that when these three trials were performed the diagnostic criterion for diabetes mellitus was two fasting plasma glucose levels, measured on different days, higher than 7.7 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), instead of greater than 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) as currently defined.</P>
<P>The analysis in diabetics demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure of 5/5 mmHg but no statistically significant difference p &lt; 0.01, for any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes in diabetics randomized to "lower target" ( &#8804;85 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure) as compared with a "standard target" (&#8804; 90 mmHg). The results for the two composite outcomes, mortality RR = 0.72 [99%CI, 0.47, 1.10] and total cardiovascular events RR = 0.80 [99%CI, 0.59, 1.09] demonstrates a trend towards a benefit for the lower target and wide confidence intervals. This provides a strong rationale for performing further trials comparing lower blood pressure targets with standard targets in patients with diabetes mellitus. It does not provide sufficient evidence for recommending lower blood pressure targets in this patient population.</P>
<P>SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE<BR/>Four trials were included in this sensitivity analysis. Clinical trials commonly define chronic renal disease based solely on a glomerular filtration rate lower than 70 mL/min/1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP> of body surface area. Using that definition alone, three trials were included: <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al, and <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> required patients with proteinuria 1-3 g per 24 hours if their creatinine clearance was less than 45 mL/min per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP> and patients with proteinuria of 3 g per 24 hours or more if their creatinine clearance was less than 70 mL/min per 1.73 m<SUP>2</SUP>. Derangement in renal function was not an exclusion criterion in the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial; however, <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> data could not be included because no outcomes in patients with chronic renal disease were reported. <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_H_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (H)</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-ABCD-_x0028_N_x0029_" TYPE="STUDY">ABCD (N)</LINK> excluded patients receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 265 mol per liter (3 mg/dL). Many outcomes were not reported, because the reports focused mainly on surrogate markers of renal function. Most of the information comes from the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> trials.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al, the <LINK REF="STD-AASK" TYPE="STUDY">AASK</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-REIN_x002d_2" TYPE="STUDY">REIN-2</LINK> trial reported achieved systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial could not be included because it only reported achieved mean arterial pressure. The weighted mean blood pressure was substantially lower, 128.6 /78.3 mmHg, in the "lower target" group than in the "standard target" group, 139.2/84.5 mmHg.<BR/>In order to achieve the greater reduction in blood pressure, 0.5 more pharmacological antihypertensive agents were needed per patient in the lower blood pressure target group. Despite the lower achieved blood pressure no statistically significant reductions in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes was found for the lower blood pressure target group as compared to the standard blood pressure target group. The two outcomes where it was possible to pool data from three trials were total mortality RR 0.89 [99%CI 0.52, 1.52] and end stage renal disease RR 1.01 [99%CI 0.75, 1.36].</P>
<P>Although it is a surrogate marker, we also pooled the mean decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), because it was the main objective of the four trials included in this sensitivity analysis, and also because preserving renal function is promoted as one of the main benefits from lower target blood pressures in patients with chronic renal disease. There was no difference in mean annual decline in GFR between patients randomized to lower as compared with traditional blood pressure targets: WMD -0.09, CI 95% (-0.51, 0.32), p= 0.55. Therefore, at present there is no evidence for any benefits associated with trying to achieve lower than standard blood pressure targets in patients with chronic renal disease.<BR/>
<B>
<BR/>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence. </B>
<BR/>All of the identified trials assessed diastolic or mean blood pressure targets, and none of the trials compared different targets for systolic blood pressure. Therefore, at present we have no information regarding the benefits or harms of trying to achieve "lower systolic blood pressure targets" as compared with "standard systolic blood pressure targets". The ACCORD trial, which is currently underway, is comparing clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes randomized to systolic targets of lower than 120 mmHg or systolic targets of lower than 140 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-ACCORD-2007" TYPE="STUDY">ACCORD 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), was used as the target in some trials included in this review, MAP is not a good estimate of systolic blood pressure because every single value of MAP can be the result of many different combinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. For example, defining MAP as equal to 2/3 diastolic blood pressure plus 1/3 systolic blood pressure, a MAP equal to 107 mmHg could be the result of both 140/90 mmHg and 180/70 mmHg, among many other possible combinations of systolic/diastolic values. The assumption that the mortality and morbidty implications of blood pressure measurements of 140/90 mmHg and 180/70 mmHg are the same based on the same estimated mean arterial pressure is likely to be wrong. Observational data suggest that pulse pressure is an independent and better predictor of cardiovascular risk than either systolic or diastolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Franklin-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Franklin 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Millar-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millar 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Benetos-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benetos 2000</LINK>). 
<BR/>

<BR/>Six of the seven included RCTs compared diastolic or estimated diastolic BP targets of less than or equal to 85 mmHg with a diastolic or estimated diastolic BP target of less than or equal to 90 mmHg. In the only exception (<LINK REF="STD-Toto" TYPE="STUDY">Toto</LINK> et al) the "standard target" diastolic blood pressure was less than or equal to 95 mmHg, but still within the range of "standard targets" specified in this systematic review. This trial was small and a sensitivity analysis excluding it does not change the results. Therefore, the results of this systematic review are generalizable to physicians prescribing antihypertensive drugs to attempt to achieve diastolic targets.</P>
<P>The mean reduction in achieved diastolic blood pressure of 3.4 mmHg was not as great as the weighted mean difference in target goals in the 7 trials, a reduction of 8.2 mmHg diastolic blood pressure. This inability to achieve the difference in target probably reflects a real limitation in the ability to achieve the lower targets plus a possible flaw in the design of the trials. By defining each BP target as less than or equal to a particular number, physicians may tend to over-treat the higher target group, while experiencing difficulty achieving the targets in the lower target groups. This possible flaw could be corrected if the targets were defined as a range of blood pressure for each group, in which case a greater difference in blood pressure between the groups may be achievable. What is clear is that an increased number of antihypertensive drugs, and consequently increased inconvenience and economic costs to the patient or society, were a consequence of using the lower blood pressure target as a goal of therapy.</P>
<P>
<B>Potential biases in the review process</B>
<BR/>The main potential bias in this meta-analysis is inevitable because the intervention of trying to achieve a target blood pressure cannot be blinded. Such open trials are subject to investigator bias for both efficacy and safety outcomes. In this particular case the bias would be in favour of the lower blood pressure target intervention as most of the trials were funded by drug companies and the lower blood pressure target would lead to increased sales of antihypertensive drugs. In 4 of the trials attempts to minimize this potential bias was done by ensuring that the outcomes were well defined and that investigators performing the outcome evaluation were blinded to the randomized group (<LINK REF="REF-Hansson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansson 1992</LINK>). In that regard, it is noteworthy that in the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial the blinded Clinical Event Committee rejected 24% of all investigator-reported events.</P>
<P>Another limitation of this meta-analysis is the fact that one single trial (<LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK>) provides most of the participants and outcomes. Others have expressed concern regarding performing a meta-analysis in such cases, especially when the results from the pooled small trials and the large trial are contradictory (<LINK REF="REF-Borzak-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Borzak 1995</LINK>). This is not the case in this meta-analysis since the results are congruent whether or not the large trial is included.</P>
<P>The differences between trials in the definition of outcomes are also a source of bias. For example, the <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial did not include congestive heart failure in the definition of major cardiovascular events. <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK>, but not the remaining trials, also reported silent myocardial infarctions. Silent myocardial infarcts were not included in this meta-analysis. However, their inclusion would not change any of the estimates of treatment effect nor any of the conclusions.</P>
<P>Selective reporting bias is a significant source of bias in this meta-analysis, as in some trials certain outcomes were not reported. The magnitude of this bias can be appreciated in the metaview. None of the outcomes included data from all 7 trials. The information on mortality and on end-stage renal disease from the <LINK REF="STD-MDRD" TYPE="STUDY">MDRD</LINK> trial could not be included for the reasons already mentioned. The most blatant example of potential selective reporting bias is total serious adverse events, which was reported in only one trial. If results from this trial were supplemented by data likely to have been collected during the other trials, it would be possible to test whether total SAEs are increased or decreased by lower BP targets. In spite of repeated specific requests to the trials' main authors, the missing SAE information was not provided.</P>
<P>
<B>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</B>
<BR/>This review was originally completed and published as a Master's Thesis (<LINK REF="REF-Arguedas-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arguedas 2004</LINK>). Despite the potential biases in the RCTs making up this review, the results do not demonstrate evidence of benefit for attempting to acheive a blood pressure target that is lower than the accepted standard blood pressure target in any patient population. This conclusion leads to a recommendation that physicians aim for standard blood pressure targets and this differs from recommendations provided by several currently used clinical guidelines for the treatment of high blood pressure. Why is that the case? We suggest the main reason for this difference it that the guidelines are based either on the results of observational cohort studies or on the interpretation of results in randomized controlled trials (RCT) as if they were observational studies. Due to the prevalent misunderstanding of this issue, it deserves a more detailed explanation.</P>
<P>Although observational studies can provide very interesting and useful information, these studies have limitations (<LINK REF="REF-Gueyffier-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueyffier 2001</LINK>). Observational studies are always subject to confounding by variables that cannot be accounted for because they are unknown. They are also susceptible to selection bias, which means that there is differential assignment of subjects to treatment groups based on subject characteristics (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 2001</LINK>). This is particularly true for treatment targets. Therefore, findings from observational studies must be limited to generation of hypotheses, which can be tested in properly designed, conducted and reported RCTs (<LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-HOT" TYPE="STUDY">HOT</LINK> trial is an excellent example to demonstrate how observational data can lead to wrong conclusions. This trial was designed as a randomized trial to measure outcomes based on 3 different target diastolic blood pressures. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity were not different in the 3 different target groups. However, instead of accepting the findings of the randomized trial as designed, the authors did a further analysis of the trial, as if it was a prospective observational study and made the bulk of their conclusions based on that analysis. In this design they combined all randomized groups into one and reported outcomes based on the blood pressures achieved during follow-up. That analysis led to an interpretation and conclusions that were the opposite of the interpretation and conclusions from the randomized trial. The achieved blood pressure approach is inappropriate, confounded and biased. It is surprising that this flawed approach, interpretation and conclusions passed the peer review and editorial process of the Lancet (<LINK REF="REF-Kunz-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kunz 1998</LINK>). The following explanation may help to better understand this important concept. The cohort of patients with low blood pressure as identified by achieved blood pressure selects for patients who did not have sustained elevated blood pressure in the first place (incorrectly identified as having baseline BP &gt; 100 mmHg), for patients in whom the blood pressure is most easily reduced with low doses of antihypertensive drugs, for patients with the lowest baseline blood pressure, and for patients who are most compliant with drug and non-drug therapy to lower blood pressure (healthy user effect, <LINK REF="REF-Dormuth-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dormuth 2009</LINK>). All of these factors are also most likely associated with a lower risk of having an adverse cardiovascular event. The approach is thus heavily biased for finding less cardiovascular events in the patients with lower blood pressure, and thus must not be encouraged. The biases mentioned above are prevented when results from a RCT are analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle, such as we used in this meta-analysis, because then the only difference between groups is the treatment strategy under consideration. Consequently any difference in outcomes can be attributed to the allocated treatment strategy (<LINK REF="REF-Peto-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peto 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results of this systematic review also differ from those reported in another meta-analysis performed by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-BPLTTC-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BPLTTC 2003</LINK>). In their study, the BPLTTC compared "less intensive" with "more intensive" blood pressure lowering regimens, without defining any specific blood pressure target values for that grouping. The most important difference between BPLTTC analysis and this one is the handling of the UKPDS-38 trial (<LINK REF="STD-UKPDS" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS</LINK>). They included it and we excluded it. The BPLTTC meta-analysis showed a decreased incidence in stroke and major cardiovascular events, and no significant difference in the incidence of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, death due to cardiovascular causes, or total mortality with "more intensive" blood-pressure-lowering regimens compared with "less intensive" regimens. However, it was possible to demonstrate from detailed information available at the BPLTTC web site (<A HREF="http://www.iih.org/bplttc">http://www.iih.org/bplttc</A>) that the reduction in stroke and major cardiovascular events was due to the inclusion of the UKPDS-38 trial. As mentioned before, the reasons for excluding UKPDS-38 in this review were two-fold. Firstly, the target for the "low target" group was 150/85 mmHg. This target is in the mid-range for the "traditional target" for systolic blood pressure. Secondly, the blood pressure target in the less intensive treatment group was initially &lt; 200/105 mmHg, and after 5 years it was reduced to &lt; 180/105 mmHg. These high targets are very similar to the safety cutoffs for the no treatment group in trials comparing treatment with no treatment. For these reasons, it is clear that this trial is not relevant to a comparison between "lower" and "standard" blood pressure treatment targets. The inclusion of UKPDS-38 by BPLTTC to suggest benefits of more intensive blood pressure lowering regimens is misleading and inappropriate.</P>

<OL>
<LI>The optimal target for systolic blood pressure has not been tested in randomized controlled trials. This is particularly important because current trends in clinical practice emphasize the control of elevated systolic blood pressure. In the absence of any evidence, systolic blood pressure targets should be the standard targets that have been demonstrated to be better than placebo or no treatment in randomized controlled trials (&#8804; 140 - 160 mmHg).</LI>
<LI>The optimal target for diastolic blood pressure was adequately tested in this review and demonstrated that "lower targets" of &#8804; 85 mmHg achieved lower blood pressures but were not associated with a reduction in mortality or morbidity when compared with the standard target of &#8804; 90 - 100 mmHg. The same conclusion is true if one limits the lower target group to trials with a target of &#8804; 80 mmHg. Therefore, for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure, the diastolic target should be equal to or lower than 90 mmHg and there is no RCT evidence supporting attempting to treat to lower targets.</LI>
<LI>This review was not designed to test subgroups of populations, but sensitivity analyses in patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease did not demonstrate statistically significant benefits for treating to targets lower than 135/85 mm Hg.  However, in these two populations the evidence for a lack of benefit is less robust.  We are going to perform separate systematic reviews in these two populations to test, as suggested in clinical guidelines, if targets lower than 130/80 mm Hg change morbidity or mortality as compared to standard targets.</LI>
<LI>Because of the paucity of reported data on harms (non-fatal serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects) in this review, it is possible that the failure to demonstrate harms associated with "lower targets", is due to selective reporting bias.</LI>
<LI>Conclusions and recommendations for blood pressure targets based on achieved blood pressures whether from randomized controlled trials or observational studies are misleading and inappropriate.</LI>

<LI>Properly conducted randomized controlled trials are needed comparing lower systolic blood pressure targets with standard blood pressure targets in the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure and in subgroups of patients (see below).

<LI>Because guidelines are presently recommending unproven lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure targets in the following subgroups of patients: diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, RCTs comparing the benefits and harms associated with recommended lower targets as compared to standard targets are urgently needed in those subgroups.</LI>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>The study was a 2 X 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to either placebo or enalapril and to either "strict" or "conventional" blood pressure ranges. Before randomization, diastolic blood pressure was lowered to 80 mmHg or less over a 3 to 6 months initial assessment period. Patients able to achieve that target were randomized and included in the study. <BR/>To achieve the target diastolic blood pressure, a stepped-care approach with antihypertensive medications was used: a diuretic was the initial drug, followed by a beta-blocker, hydralazine or minoxidil, and clonidine, alpha-methyldopa or a alpha-1 blocker. With the exception of the diuretic, the maximum dose of each agent was used before moving to the next step. In patients assigned to "conventional" group, diastolic blood pressure was allowed to increase to the 85 to 95 mmHg range, whereas in patients assigned to the "strict" group the intention was to maintain diastolic blood pressure in the 65 to 80 mmHg range. <BR/>Blood pressure was measured in the supine position with a mercury sphygmomanometer after a minimum of 5 minutes rest. Three measurements were taken at 2-minute intervals. The mean of those measurements was used. <BR/>Mean follow-up was 40.5 ± 1.8 months in the "strict" group, and 42.2 ± 2.1 months in the "conventional" group.<BR/>
