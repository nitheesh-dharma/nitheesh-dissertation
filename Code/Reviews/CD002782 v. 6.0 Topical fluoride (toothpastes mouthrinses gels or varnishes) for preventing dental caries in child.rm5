<P>The use of fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes reduces tooth decay in children and adolescents.<BR/>Tooth decay (dental caries) is painful, expensive to treat and can seriously damage teeth. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. The review of trials found that children aged 5 to 16 years who applied fluoride in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes had fewer decayed, missing and filled teeth regardless of whether their drinking water was fluoridated. Supervised use of self applied fluoride increases the benefit. Fluoride varnishes may have a greater effect but more high quality research is needed to be sure of how big a difference these treatments make, and whether they have adverse effects.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of fluoride varnishes, gels, mouthrinses, and toothpastes in the prevention of dental caries in children and to examine factors potentially modifying their effect.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:00:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2000, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000), plus several other databases. We handsearched journals, reference lists of articles and contacted selected authors and manufacturers.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:04:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials with blind outcome assessment, comparing fluoride varnish, gel, mouthrinse, or toothpaste with placebo or no treatment in children up to 16 years during at least 1 year. The main outcome was caries increment measured by the change in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:00:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inclusion decisions, quality assessment and data extraction were duplicated in a random sample of one third of studies, and consensus achieved by discussion or a third party. Authors were contacted for missing data. The primary measure of effect was the prevented fraction (PF) that is the difference in mean caries increments between the treatment and control groups expressed as a percentage of the mean increment in the control group. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed where data could be pooled. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined in random-effects metaregression analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:01:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There were 144 studies included. For the 133 that contributed data for meta-analysis (involving 65,169 children) the D(M)FS pooled prevented fraction estimate was 26% (95% CI, 24% to 29%; P &lt; 0.0001). There was substantial heterogeneity, confirmed statistically (P &lt; 0.0001), but the direction of effect was consistent. The effect of topical fluoride varied according to type of control group used, type of TFT used, mode/setting of TFT use, initial caries levels and intensity of TFT application, but was not influenced by exposure to water fluoridation or other fluoride sources. D(M)FS PF was on average 14% (95% CI, 5% to 23%; P = 0.002) higher in non-placebo controlled trials, 14% (95% CI, 2% to 26%; P = 0.25) higher in fluoride varnish trials compared with all others, and 10% (95% CI, -17% to -3%; P = 0.003) lower in trials of unsupervised home use compared with self applied supervised and operator-applied. There was a 0.7% increase in the PF per unit increase in baseline caries (95% CI, 0.2% to 1.2%; P = 0.004).</P>

<P>The benefits of topical fluorides have been firmly established on a sizeable body of evidence from randomized controlled trials. While the formal examination of sources of heterogeneity between studies has been important in the overall conclusions reached, these should be interpreted with caution. We were unable to reach definite conclusions about any adverse effects that might result from the use of topical fluorides, because data reported in the trials are scarce.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:06:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dental caries and its consequences pose important and uncomfortable problems in all industrialized societies and in a large number of developing countries. Although the prevalence and severity of dental caries in most industrialized countries have decreased substantially in the past 2 decades, reaching averages as low as 1.1 decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in 12 year olds, nearly half of those without any tooth decay or fillings (<LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>), this largely preventable disease is still common, increases significantly with age, and remains a public health problem for a significant proportion of the world population (<LINK REF="REF-Burt-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burt 1998</LINK>). In the United Kingdom, 30% of 3.5 to 4.5 year olds (<LINK REF="REF-Moynihan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moynihan 1996</LINK>), and 50% of 12 year olds (<LINK REF="REF-Downer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Downer 1995</LINK>) had experienced caries in 1993. In 2000, the figures were 40% for 5 year olds in Great Britain (<LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2001</LINK>) and 38% for 12 year olds in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-Pitts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitts 2002</LINK>). These findings demonstrate the continuing need for effective preventive strategies and treatment services for these age groups in a country that has experienced a substantial caries decline. In general, dental caries levels vary considerably between and within different countries, but children in the lower socio-economic status (SES) groups have higher caries levels than those in the upper SES groups, and these differences are consistent in industrialized and in urbanized developing countries (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fluoride therapy has been the cornerstone of caries-preventive strategies since the introduction of water fluoridation schemes over 5 decades ago (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991</LINK>). Fluoride controls the initiation and progression of carious lesions. Intensive laboratory and epidemiologic research on the mechanism of action of fluoride in preventing caries indicates that fluoride's predominant effect is topical, which occurs mainly through promotion of remineralization of early caries lesions and by reducing sound tooth enamel demineralization (<LINK REF="REF-Featherstone-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Featherstone 1988</LINK>). Various modes of fluoride use have evolved, each with its own recommended concentration, frequency of use, and dosage schedule. The use of topically applied fluorides in particular, which are much more concentrated than the fluoride in drinking water, has increased over recent decades and fluoride containing toothpastes (dentifrices), mouthrinses, gels and varnishes are the modalities most widely used at present, either alone or in different combinations. By definition, the term 'topically applied fluoride' describes those delivery systems which provide fluoride to exposed surfaces of the dentition, at elevated concentrations, for a local protective effect and are therefore not intended for ingestion. Fluoride gels and varnishes are typical methods of professional topical fluoride application and both delivery systems have been used in preventive programs. Fluoride gels have also been used as a self applied intervention in such programs. Fluoride rinses and toothpastes are the main forms of self applied fluoride therapy. The intensive use of fluoride mouthrinsing in school programs has been discontinued in many developed countries because of doubts regarding its cost-effectiveness at a low prevalence of dental caries and are being replaced by selective fluoride therapy directed to high risk children. Such procedures usually involve the combined use of fluoride toothpastes with gels or varnishes. Toothpaste is by far the most widespread form of fluoride usage (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1991a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>) and the decline in the prevalence of dental caries in developed countries has been mainly attributed to its increased use (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rolla-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolla 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_-Mullane-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O' Mullane 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marthaler-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marthaler 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, there is currently a debate regarding the appropriate use of fluorides. The questions being asked relate to the actual effectiveness and the potential risks (mainly in terms of fluorosis) that may be expected from the various fluoride-based caries preventive measures in an era of decreased caries prevalence and widespread availability of fluoride from multiple sources (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1991</LINK>). In this context, even the need for selective professional fluoride applications has been questioned (<LINK REF="REF-Seppa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seppa 1998</LINK>). The persistence of this debate and the variations in the use of the main forms of topically applied fluorides suggest the need to search for meaningful ways to summarize the empirical findings on this topic systematically.</P>
<P>Much of the experimental research on the effectiveness of individual fluoride modalities in preventing dental caries was conducted before the 1990s, when dental caries was more common and more severe. Modalities were usually tested separately and with the assumption that the method would provide the main source of fluoride. The studies have been extensively reviewed and synthesized in a number of traditional narrative reviews which often provide very different estimates of effectiveness, probably due to differences in how the literature to be included was selected, and rarely explore the causes of variability in reported effectiveness in a formal way. To date, a few published reviews focusing mainly on the evaluation of specific fluoride active agents within specific delivery systems have used a quantitative meta-analytical approach to synthesize studies' results (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helfenstein-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helfenstein 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bartizek-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartizek 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Strohmenger-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strohmenger 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Chaves-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chaves 2002</LINK>). However, there has been no systematic investigation evaluating and comparing the overall effectiveness of the main forms of topical fluoride therapy currently used in caries prevention and examining formally the main factors that may influence their effectiveness. Moreover, none of the existing reviews have attempted to identify all relevant experimental research.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective of this review is to determine the effects of topical fluoride therapy (TFT) in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels and varnishes in the prevention of dental caries in children and adolescents. The secondary objective is to examine whether the effectiveness of TFT is influenced by the initial level of caries severity, the background exposure to other fluoride sources, the mode/setting of TFT use, and the form of TFT used.</P>
<P>The specific objectives are:<BR/>(1) To determine the effectiveness and safety of topical fluoride therapy in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels and varnishes in preventing dental caries in the child/adolescent population. <BR/>(2) To examine whether the effect of TFT is influenced by the level of caries severity.<BR/>(3) To examine whether the effect of TFT is influenced by the background exposure to ambient levels of fluoride in water (or salt), or reported fluoride sources other than the study option(s).<BR/>(4) To examine whether the effect of TFT is influenced by the mode/setting of use (self applied supervised use of TFT in preventive programmes, self applied 'unsupervised' use of TFT at home, and operator-applied use of TFT), and if this does occur, whether there is a differential effect on caries prevention among the different forms of TFT used in each mode/setting.<BR/>(5) To examine whether the effect of TFT is influenced by the form of TFT used.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:22:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials using or indicating blind outcome assessment, in which one form of topical fluoride therapy (TFT) (either as toothpaste, mouthrinse, gel or varnish) is compared concurrently to a placebo or no TFT group during at least 1 year/school year.<BR/>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials using within-group paired comparison designs (e.g. split-mouth trials of fluoride varnish, as the effect of the varnish could spread across the mouth leading to contamination of control sites), or with open outcome assessment or no indication of blind assessment, or lasting less than 1 year/school year, or controlled trials where random or quasi-random allocation was not used or indicated were excluded. </P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Children or adolescents aged 16 or less at the start of the study (irrespective of initial level of dental caries, background exposure to fluorides, dental treatment level, nationality, setting where intervention is received or time when it started).<BR/>Studies where participants were selected on the basis of special (general or oral) health conditions were excluded.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Topical fluoride therapy in the form of toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels or varnishes only, using any fluoride agent (which may be formulated with any compatible abrasive system, in the case of fluoride toothpastes), at any concentration (ppm F), amount or duration of application, and with any technique or method of application, provided the frequency of application was at least once a year. The control group is placebo (for any method of fluoride application) or no treatment (except for brushing or flossing methods of application) resulting in the following comparison: Any single TFT described above compared with a placebo or no TFT. <BR/>Studies where the intervention consisted of any caries preventive agent/procedure in addition to any of the forms of TFT described above were excluded (e.g. fluoride-based measures used in combination, anti-plaque or anti-calculus agents, sealants, oral hygiene interventions, xylitol chewing gums, glass ionomers).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES>
<P>The primary outcome measure in this review is caries increment, as measured by change from baseline in the decayed, (missing) and filled surface (D(M)FS) index, in all permanent teeth erupted at start and erupting over the course of the study. For studies in younger children the outcome measure of interest is caries increment in deciduous tooth surfaces, as measured by change in the decayed, (missing/extraction indicated), and filled surface d(e/m)fs index. Dental caries is defined here as being clinically and radiographically recorded at the dentin level of diagnosis. (<I>See</I> 'Methods of the review' for the different ways of reporting the decayed, (missing) and filled teeth or surfaces (D(M)FT/S) scores in clinical trials of caries preventives.)<BR/>The following outcomes were considered relevant: coronal dental caries and dental fillings, in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions; tooth loss; proportion of children developing new caries; dental pain/discomfort; specific side effects (fluorosis, tooth staining/discoloration, oral allergic reactions, adverse symptoms such as nausea, vomiting); unacceptability of preventive treatment as measured by drop outs during the trial (in non-placebo controlled studies); use of health service resources (such as visits to dental care units, length of dental treatment time).<BR/>Studies reporting only on changes in plaque/calculus formation, plaque regrowth/vitality, plaque/salivary bacterial counts, or gingival bleeding/gingivitis, dentin hypersensitivity or fluoride physiological outcome measures (fluoride uptake by enamel or dentin, salivary secretion levels, etc.) were excluded.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Electronic searching</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Up to 1998</HEADING>
<P>Relevant studies were identified (for the series of topical fluoride reviews) by searching several databases from date of inception: MEDLINE (1966 to 1997), EMBASE (1980 to 1997), SCISEARCH (1981 to 1997), SSCISEARCH (1981 to 1997), ISTP (1982 to 1997), BIOSIS (1982 to 1997), CINAHL (1982 to 1997), ERIC (1966 to 1996), DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS (1981 to 1997) and LILACS/BBO (1982 to 1997). Two overlapping but complementary subject search phrases (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) with low specificity (but high sensitivity), using 'free text 'and 'controlled vocabulary', were formulated within Silverplatter MEDLINE around two main concepts, fluoride and caries, and combined with all three levels of the Cochrane Optimal Search Strategy for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). These subject search phrases were customised for searching EMBASE and the other databases.<BR/>
</P>
<P>RCT filters were also adapted to search EMBASE, BIOSIS, SCISEARCH, DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS, and LILACS/BBO. All the strategies (subject search and methodological filters) developed to search each database are fully described in a report produced for the Systematic Reviews Training Unit (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 1997</LINK>), and are available on request. These were used for the development of a register of topical fluoride clinical trials for the systematic reviews, as the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register was not yet developed in 1997/98.</P>
<P>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 1997, Issue 1), the Community of Science database (1998), which included ongoing trials funded by the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR), the System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) database (1980 to 1997), and OLDMEDLINE (1963 to 1965) were searched using the terms 'fluor' and 'carie' truncated.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">From 1999 to 2001</HEADING>
<P>The strategy included in <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> was used to search LILACS/BBO in 1999 (1982 to 1998), where free text subject search terms were combined with a methodological filter for RCTs.</P>
<P>Four supplementary and more specific subject search phrases (including 'free text' and 'controlled vocabulary' terms), refined exclusively for the reviews on the effects of individual fluoride modalities, formulated around three concepts each (the relevant topical fluoride therapy (TFT), fluoride and caries) were used to search Silverplatter MEDLINE (up to January 2000) without methodological filters (<LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>). These strategies were adapted to search the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (up to May 2000), and have also been run on CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2000, Issue 2) to double check.</P>
<P>The <I>meta</I>Register of Current Controlled Trials was searched in October 2001 for ongoing RCTs using the terms 'fluoride' and 'caries'.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Reference searching</HEADING>
<P>All eligible trials retrieved from the searches, meta-analyses and review articles located up to January 2000 were checked for relevant references. Reviews had been identified mainly by a MEDLINE search strategy specifically carried out to provide information on available systematic reviews or meta-analyses and on the scope of the literature on the topic, when the <I>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</I> (CDSR), and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED), were also searched. Reference lists of relevant chapters from preventive dentistry textbooks on topically applied fluoride interventions were also consulted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Full text searching</HEADING>
<P>Prospective handsearching of the seven journals identified as having the highest yield of eligible RCTs/controlled clinical trials (CCTs) was carried out, from January 1999 until January 2000: <I>British Dental Journal</I>, <I>Caries</I> <I>Research</I>, <I>Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology</I>, <I>Journal of the American Dental Association</I>, <I>Journal of Dental Research</I>, <I>Journal of Public Health Dentistry</I> and <I>European Journal of Oral Sciences</I>. The handsearch of <I>Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology</I> was undertaken (1990 to December 1999), as this was the journal with the highest yield of eligible reports.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Personal contact</HEADING>
<P>Searching for unpublished studies (or 'grey' literature such as technical reports and dissertations, or studies published in languages other than English which may not have been indexed to major databases) started by contacting experts in the field of preventive dentistry. A letter was sent to the author(s) of each included study published during the last two decades in order to obtain information on possible unpublished studies eligible for inclusion. All the authors of studies who had been contacted in order to clarify reported information to enable assessment of eligibility or obtain missing data were also asked for unpublished studies.</P>
<P>Based on information extracted mainly from included studies, a list of manufacturers of fluoride toothpastes, mouthrinses, gels and varnishes was created for locating unpublished trials. Letters to manufacturers were sent out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, in the hope that companies might be more responsive to contact from the editorial base than from individual reviewers. Fourteen manufacturers were contacted (October 2000) and information on any unpublished trials requested: Bristol-Myers Co, Colgate-Palmolive, Davies Rose-Hoyt Pharmaceutical Division, Gaba AG, Ivoclar North America, John O Butler Company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Oral-B Laboratories, Pharmascience, Procter &amp; Gamble, Smithkline Beecham, Synthelabo, Unilever/Gibbs, Warner-Lambert.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Management of records produced by the searches</HEADING>
<P>Because multiple databases were searched, the downloaded set of records from each database, starting with MEDLINE, was imported to the bibliographic software package Reference Manager and merged into one core database to remove duplicate records and to facilitate retrieval of relevant articles. The records yielded from LILACS, BBO, CENTRAL, SIGLE and NIDR databases were not imported to Reference Manager and were checked without the benefit of eliminating duplicates. The records produced by OLDMEDLINE and by the specific MEDLINE search performed without methodological filter were imported to Reference Manager for inspection, in a database separate from the core database. The records produced by searching the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register and the <I>meta</I>Register of Current Controlled Trials were also checked outside Reference Manager. In order to facilitate importing of all records located from searching other (non-electronic) sources to Reference Manager, we tried to locate these in MEDLINE as well. Those references that could not be downloaded in this way were entered manually. (Reports that might be identified by contacting manufacturers will be obtained to feature in updates of this review.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relevance assessment</HEADING>
<P>All records identified by the searches were printed off and checked on the basis of title first, then by abstract (when this was available in English or in languages known by the reviewer) and/or keywords by one reviewer, Valeria Marinho (VM). Records that were obviously irrelevant were discarded and the full text of all remaining records was obtained. Records were considered irrelevant according to study design/duration, participants, or interventions/comparisons (if it could be determined that the article was not a report of a randomized/quasi-randomized controlled trial; or the trial was of less than 6 to 8 months duration; or the trial was exclusively in adults; or the trial did not address one of the four topical fluoride therapies (TFTs); or the trial did not compare a TFT to placebo or no treatment).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies for inclusion</HEADING>
<P>With the inclusion criteria form previously prepared and pilot tested, one reviewer (VM) assessed all studies for inclusion in the review, and a second reviewer, Julian Higgins (JH), independently duplicated the process for a sample of those (approximately 30%). In addition, any study that could not be classified by the first reviewer was independently assessed by the second. A third reviewer was consulted, Stuart Logan (SL) or Aubrey Sheiham (AS), to resolve any disagreement. It was decided in advance to exclude any trial where agreement could not be reached (but this did not occur). Trial reports thought to be potentially relevant in languages not known by the reviewers were translated and the reviewer (VM) completed the inclusion form with reference to the translator. Attempts were made to contact authors of trials that could not be classified in order to ascertain whether inclusion criteria were met.</P>
<P>It was considered essential to identify and check all reports related to the same study; in case of any discrepancy, authors were contacted.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Data from all included studies were extracted by one reviewer (VM) using a pilot tested data extraction form. A second reviewer (JH) extracted data from a random sample of approximately one third of included studies. Again, data that could not be coded by the first reviewer were independently coded by the second, any disagreements were discussed and a third reviewer consulted to achieve consensus where necessary. (In future updates all reports will be data extracted and quality assessed in duplicate.) Data presented only in graphs and figures were extracted whenever possible, but were included only if two reviewers independently had the same result. Attempts were made to contact authors through an open-ended request in order to obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary. Papers in languages not known by the reviewers were data extracted with help from appropriate translators.</P>
<P>Additional information related to study methodology or quality that was extracted included: study duration (years of follow up); comparability of baseline characteristics: methods used pre-randomization in sizing/balancing (stratification based on relevant variables) or used post-randomization in analysing/adjusting for possible differences in prognostic factors between groups; objectivity/reliability of primary outcome measurement (diagnostic methods and thresholds/definitions used and included, and monitoring of diagnostic errors); any co-intervention and/or contamination. Information on sponsoring institutions and manufacturers involved was also recorded.</P>
<P>Characteristics related to participants that were extracted included: age (range) at start, caries severity at start (average DMFS, DFS, or other measure), background exposure to fluoride sources other than the study option(s) (in water, topical applications, etc.), year study began, place where study was conducted (country), setting where participants were recruited, and dental treatment level (F/DMF). Characteristics of the interventions that were extracted included: fluoride modality(s), mode of application (how the intervention was delivered), methods (technique/device) of application, prior- and post-application, fluoride active agents and concentrations used, frequency and duration of application, and amount applied.</P>
<P>Different ways of assessing/reporting caries increment in the trials (change from baseline as measured by the DMF index) were recorded separately and/or combined according to the components of the index chosen and units of measurement (DMFT/S, or DFT/S, or DT/S, or FT/S), types of tooth/surface considered (permanent/deciduous teeth/surfaces, first molar teeth, approximal surfaces, etc.), state of tooth eruption considered (erupted and/or erupting teeth or surface), diagnostic thresholds used (cavitated/dentin lesions, non-cavitated incipient lesions), methods of examination adopted (clinical and/or radiographical), and approaches to account or not for reversals in caries increment adopted (in a net or observed/crude caries increment respectively). In addition, caries increments have been recorded whenever the authors reported them (various follow ups), and where assessments of caries increments were made during a post-intervention follow-up period, the length of time over which outcomes were measured after the intervention ended was noted.</P>
<P>As we were aware that caries increment could be reported differently in different trials we developed a set of a priori rules to choose the primary outcome data for analysis from each study: data on permanent teeth would be chosen over data on deciduous teeth; data on surface level would be chosen over data on tooth level; DFS data would be chosen over DMFS data, and this would be chosen over DS or FS; data for 'all surface types combined' would be chosen over data for 'specific types' only; data for 'all erupted and erupting teeth combined' would be chosen over data for 'erupted' only, and this over data for 'erupting' only; data from 'clinical and radiological examinations combined' would be chosen over data from 'clinical' only, and this over 'radiological' only; data for dentinal/cavitated caries lesions would be chosen over data for enamel/non-cavitated lesions; net caries increment data would be chosen over crude (observed) increment data; and follow up nearest to 3 years (often the one at the end of the treatment period) would be chosen over all other lengths of follow up, unless otherwise stated. When no specification was provided with regard to the methods of examination adopted, diagnostic thresholds used, groups of teeth and types of tooth eruption recorded, and approaches for reversals adopted, the primary choices described above were assumed.</P>
<P>All other relevant outcomes assessed/reported in the trials were also recorded/listed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality assessment</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed according to the criteria for concealment of treatment allocation described in the <I>Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2000</LINK>) used in the Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan). Allocation concealment for each trial was rated as belonging to one of three categories.<BR/>(A) Adequately concealed (an adequate method to conceal allocation is described).<BR/>(B) Concealment unclear ('random' allocation stated/indicated but the actual allocation concealment method is not described or an apparently adequate concealment scheme is reported but there is uncertainty about whether allocation is adequately concealed).<BR/>(C) Inadequately concealed (an inadequate method of allocation concealment is described).<BR/>Excluded: random (or quasi-random) allocation clearly not used in the trial, or 'random' allocation not stated and not implied/possible.</P>
<P>Blinding of main outcome assessment was also rated according to the following three categories defined for the topical fluoride reviews.<BR/>(A) Double-blind (blind outcome assessment and use of placebo described).<BR/>(B) Single-blind (blind outcome assessment stated and no placebo used).<BR/>(C) Blinding indicated (blind outcome assessment not stated but likely in any element/phase of outcome assessment, e.g. clinical and/or radiographic examinations performed independently of previous results, or radiographic examinations performed independently of clinical examinations with results reported separately/added later, or examiners clearly not involved in giving treatment, or use of placebo described) or reported but unclear (blind outcome assessment reported but there is information that leads to suspicion/uncertainty about whether the examination was blind).<BR/>Excluded: clearly open outcome assessment used or blind outcome assessment not reported and unlikely (no description of an examination performed independently of previous results, of x-rays registered independently of clinical examination, of use of a placebo, and of examiners clearly not involved in giving treatment).</P>
<P>One reviewer (VM) assessed the quality of all included studies. A second reviewer (JH) duplicated the process for a random sample of approximately one third. Any disagreement was discussed and where necessary a third reviewer was consulted to achieve consensus. Where uncertainty could not be resolved an effort was made to contact authors directly to clarify the method used to conceal allocation or whether assessment of the main outcome had been carried out blind.</P>
<P>Checking of interobserver reliability was limited to these validity assessments.</P>
<P>Other methodological characteristics of the trials such as completeness of follow up (proportion excluded) and handling of exclusions (extent to which reasons for attrition are explicitly reported, or losses are independent of treatment allocated) were not used as thresholds for inclusion. However, all assessments of study quality are described in the table of included studies, and were coded for possible use in metaregression or sensitivity analyses.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data analyses</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Handling of missing main outcome data</HEADING>
<P>It was decided that missing standard deviations for caries increments that were not revealed by contacting the original researchers would be imputed through linear regression of log standard deviations on log mean caries increments. This is a suitable approach for caries prevention studies since, as they follow an approximate Poisson distribution, caries increments are closely related (similar) to their standard deviations (<LINK REF="REF-van-Rijkom-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Rijkom 1998</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Handling of results of studies (main outcome) with more than one treatment arm</HEADING>
<P>In the studies with more than one relevant intervention group (but of the same modality of TFT) and a common control group, such as those comparing different concentrations of fluoride ions in a mouthrinse for example to a placebo/no treatment group, raw results (the numbers, mean caries increments and standard deviations) from all relevant experimental groups were combined in order to obtain a measure of treatment effect (this enables the inclusion of all relevant data for each form of TFT in the primary meta-analysis, although may slightly compromise any secondary investigations of dose response). In the studies comparing two or more relevant modalities of TFT to a common placebo/no treatment group, we have divided the control group into approximately equally sized smaller groups to provide a pairwise comparison for each modality. Means and standard deviations were unchanged.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Choice of measure of effect and meta-analyses of main outcome</HEADING>
<P>The chosen measure of treatment effect was the prevented fraction (PF), that is (mean increment in the controls minus mean increment in the treated group) divided by mean increment in the controls. For an outcome such as caries increment (where discrete counts are considered to approximate to a continuous scale and are treated as continuous data) this measure was considered more appropriate than the mean difference or standardised mean difference, since it allows combination of different ways of measuring caries increment and a meaningful investigation of heterogeneity between trials. It is also simple to interpret. The meta-analyses were conducted as inverse variance weighted averages. Within-study variances were estimated using the formula presented in <LINK REF="REF-Dubey-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dubey 1965</LINK> which was more suitable for use in a weighted average, and for large sample sizes the approximation should be reasonable. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed throughout in RevMan/RevMan Analyses.</P>
<P>Deciduous and permanent teeth were analysed separately throughout.</P>
<P>For illustrative purposes, when overall results were significant, the results were also presented as the number of children needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one carious teeth/surface. These were calculated by combining the overall prevented fraction with an estimate of the caries increment in the control groups of the individual studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Assessment of heterogeneity and investigation of reasons for heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Heterogeneity in the results of the trials was assessed by inspection of a graphical display of the estimated treatment effects from the trials along with their 95% confidence intervals and by formal tests of homogeneity (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition to aspects of study quality, four potential sources of heterogeneity were specified a priori as investigations of these formed part of the primary objectives of the review. We hypothesised that: (1) the effect of TFT differs according to the baseline levels of caries severity; (2) the effect of TFT differs according to exposure to other fluoride sources (in water, in toothpastes, etc.); (3) the effect of TFT differs according to mode of use; and (4) forms of TFT used. The association of these factors with estimated effects (D(M)FS PFs) were examined by performing random-effects metaregression analyses in Stata version 6.0 (Stata Corporation, USA) using the program Metareg (<LINK REF="REF-Sharp-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sharp 1998</LINK>). The random-effects regression model described in detail elsewhere (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>) relates treatment effect to study characteristics assuming a normal distribution for the residual errors with both a within- and an additive between-study component of variance. The between-studies variance was estimated by an iterative procedure, using an estimate that is based on a restricted maximum likelihood method.</P>
<P>To allow such investigation, relevant data were dealt with as follows: data on 'baseline levels of caries' were calculated from the study sample analysed (final sample) and in connection with the caries increment index chosen, unless otherwise stated, and were averaged among all relevant study groups.<BR/>Data on 'background exposure to other fluoride sources' combined data on the use of fluoride toothpaste or any fluoride other than the study option(s) and the consumption of fluoridated water (or salt) and were grouped into two categories: one for studies which were based on samples provided with non-fluoride toothpaste/reporting no/low use of other fluorides and which were from non-fluoridated areas (non exposed), and another for studies based on samples using any fluoride other than the study option(s) or studies in fluoridated communities or both. When background exposure to fluoride toothpaste was not clearly indicated in studies carried out in developed countries, it was assumed that fluoride toothpaste was widely used from the middle of the 1970s (<LINK REF="REF-Ripa-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ripa 1989</LINK>); this information was sought from authors (or obtained from other sources) when missing from studies carried out in other locations. When data on the year a study had begun was not provided this was calculated as a 'probable date' by subtracting the duration of the study (in years) plus one extra year, from the publication date of the study. Background exposure to fluoride rinses, gels, tablets, etc. should be reported to be involving the majority in a study to be considered as such, otherwise it was assumed these had not been used. Exposure to water fluoridation should be above 0.3 ppm F; when information on the fluoridation status of a site was not available/obtainable, no assumptions were made.<BR/>Data on the 'fluoride application mode of use and forms of TFT' were classified as self applied unsupervised use (of toothpaste or mouthrinse at home), self applied supervised use (of gel, mouthrinse or toothpaste in school-based programmes), and operator-applied use (of gel or varnish). The four modalities of TFT were categorised as such.</P>
<P>Further potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated by metaregression based on previous investigations of covariates carried out in the individual TFT reviews. These included investigations of the potential influence of fluoride concentration and frequency of use. (Data on 'concentration applied' and 'frequency of use' have not been categorised, but a 'total intensity of application per year' covariate was produced by multiplying frequency of application (per year) by fluoride concentration (in ppm F).) In multiple arm studies we have averaged this intensity score over fluoride treatment groups. These 'post hoc' analyses are clearly identified and the results should be treated with caution. Sensitivity analyses were performed as appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Investigation of publication and other biases</HEADING>
<P>A funnel plot (plots of effect estimates versus the inverse of their standard errors) was drawn. Asymmetry of the funnel plot may indicate publication bias and other biases related to sample size, though may also represent a true relationship between trial size and effect size. A formal investigation of the degree of asymmetry was performed using the method proposed by Egger et al (<LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Measures of effect and meta-analysis of other outcomes</HEADING>
<P>For outcomes other than caries increment, continuous data were to be analysed according to differences in mean treatment effects and their standard deviations. Dichotomous outcome data were to be analysed by calculating risk ratios (RR) or, for adverse effects of fluoride treatment, risk differences (RD). RevMan was used for estimation of overall treatment effects. Again, a random-effects model was used to calculate a pooled estimate of effect. As a general rule only (relevant) outcomes with useable data were shown in the analyses tables.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Search results</HEADING>
<P>Our initial multiple database search (1997/98) produced the following total number of records, according to database searched: MEDLINE, 4599; EMBASE, 5052; BIOSIS, 421; SCISEARCH, 514; SSCISEARCH, 169; ISTP, 66; CINAHL, 133; ERIC, 60; DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS, 95; LILACS, 48; BBO, 47; CENTRAL, 86; SIGLE, 6. Searching OLDMEDLINE produced 545 records, and the Community of Science database, 24 records. In the second stage of searches (1999), searching LILACS and BBO with a modified search strategy produced 210 records (142 and 68 records respectively). The more specific MEDLINE searches (by individual modalities of topical fluoride therapy (TFT)) performed without a randomized controlled trial (RCT) filter produced 2441 records, and the searches performed in the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (May 2000) produced 479 records. Searching the <I>meta</I>Register of Current Controlled Trials for ongoing studies produced 5 records. Many records retrieved through electronic search were duplicates merged later in the core database, and many appeared more than once in different databases and/or searches performed (overlapped). Searching other non-electronic sources (reference lists of potentially relevant reports, review articles or book chapters, relevant journals, and contacting authors) produced 171 additional records for inspection. (Any search results produced by contacting manufacturers will feature in updates of this review.)</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Relevance assessment results</HEADING>
<P>When the records produced from all the above searches were screened, a total of 713 reports were considered potentially eligible and further assessment was sought.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study selection results</HEADING>
<P>Seven hundred and thirteen reports were sought for detailed assessment for inclusion, of which 19 full text reports could not be obtained (most of these were incomplete references to non-English reports and unpublished studies conducted decades ago by toothpaste manufacturers). Two hundred and ninety-three reports (293) were considered immediately irrelevant for this review, largely as a result of the types of intervention compared with, or used in addition to the relevant topical fluoride treatments (including head to head studies without a placebo or no treatment group), and due to the types of study design described (historical controls or other non-experimental designs).</P>
<P>Thus, 287 studies (401 reports) are considered/cited in this review. These comprise 214 reports relating to 144 included studies, 157 reports relating to 115 excluded studies, two reports relating to two ongoing (fluoride varnish) studies, and 28 reports relating to 26 studies waiting assessment (either because they require translation, because translation and contact with the authors have not ascertained whether all inclusion criteria have been met, or because additional information has not been obtained yet for two studies in abstract form).</P>
<P>Listed either under excluded or included studies are 91 reports (25%) in languages other than English: 39 in German, 14 in Portuguese, seven in Spanish, seven in Russian, five in Japanese, four in French, three in Hungarian, three in Danish, two in Dutch, two in Italian, two in Polish, one in Czech, one in Bulgarian, one in Norwegian. The reports in Portuguese, Spanish and Italian have been assessed by the contact reviewer, and the others by the reviewer with a translator (some reports have not been translated due to the availability of a full text English report of the same study, or because sufficient information was available in the English abstract to exclude the study).</P>

<P>
<I>See</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> table for the description of reasons for rejecting each study.</P>
<P>We have excluded 33 fluoride varnish studies, 11 fluoride gel studies, 38 fluoride mouthrinse studies, and 33 fluoride toothpaste studies.<BR/>All 115 studies were excluded for a variety of reasons. Twenty-eight studies had non-fluoride or other fluoride-based interventions, or active agents in addition to the ones considered in this review. In one study a fluoride intervention was associated to the control group, and in two studies the fluoride rinsing solution was supposed to be swallowed. Five studies involved children with specific health problems, and eight studies included participants older than 16 years of age. In two studies, the length of follow up was 6 months (and relevant outcomes were not reported in one of these). Ten (fluoride varnish) studies used the within-subject paired design, or 'split-mouth' design. The remaining studies were excluded for reasons related to random allocation or blind assessment of outcome as described in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK> section.</P>

<P>
<I>See</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for details of each study.</P>
<P>There are 144 trials included. The studies conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Forsman-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Forsman 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Horowitz-1971a" TYPE="STUDY">Horowitz 1971a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967c" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967c</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970b" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zacherl-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Zacherl 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1965</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Torell-1965" TYPE="STUDY">Torell 1965</LINK> have been treated as two (or more) independent trials each, because the results for the two (or more) age groups, and/or study sites, and/or comparisons involved were reported separately as distinct studies. There were also completely distinct studies published as such in the same year by the same author: <LINK REF="STD-Zacherl-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Zacherl 1972</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Zacherl-1972a" TYPE="STUDY">Zacherl 1972a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967a" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967a</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967b" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967e" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967e</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Koch-1967f" TYPE="STUDY">Koch 1967f</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1967</LINK>/<LINK REF="STD-Slack-1967a" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1967a</LINK>. All 214 reports were published between 1955 and 1999. The 144 trials were conducted between 1954 and 1996: three in the 1950s, the great majority in the 1960s and 1970s, 16 in the 1980s, and four in the 1990s. The majority of studies were conducted in industrialized countries, especially USA, UK, European and Scandinavian countries, but there were at least 14 conducted in other countries. Twenty-two studies had at least one report published in languages other than English and 12 studies had only non-English publications (one of these, <LINK REF="STD-Treide-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Treide 1988</LINK>, reported data for deciduous teeth only).</P>
<P>There are 74 toothpaste trials included, followed by 36 mouthrinse trials, 25 gel trials, and nine varnish trials.<BR/>Fifty-eight studies had more than one topical fluoride treatment group compared to a control. Forty-six studies compared different characteristics of the same modality of TFT (e.g. different concentrations of fluoride ions in a mouthrinse) and eight studies (which have been entered as 16 comparisons/studies) compared two or more relevant modalities of TFT to a common control group (in two of these, entered as four studies, different features of each modality were compared concomitantly). One hundred and twenty-five trials used a placebo control group and the remaining 19 used a no treatment control group. Study duration ranged from 1 to 6 years, with the great majority of studies lasting 2 or 3 years. Studies were generally large with only 15 allocating less than 100 children to relevant study groups, nearly all recruited from school settings.</P>
<P>There was substantial variation in the characteristics of participants and interventions in the trials included. While the majority of studies reported on exposure or not to fluoridation, background exposure to fluoride toothpaste (or other fluoride sources) was clearly reported in very few studies. Caries prevalence at baseline was generally reported. All fluoride varnish and gel trials reported whether or not applications were carried out by professionals, and with two exceptions, all fluoride toothpaste, mouthrinse and gel trials (of self applied gel) reported whether or not TFT use was carried out under supervision (by dental personnel, trained non-dental personnel, or by mothers and dental personnel in preventive programmes; or 'unsupervised' at home). Fluoride concentrations and application frequencies varied greatly among TFT modalities and within each modality, and were reported in the great majority of studies.</P>
<P>All but five of the 144 trials reported caries increment data (or data from which these could be derived) at the tooth surface level (D(M)FS was reported in 135 trials, defs in one of these, and d(e/m)fs in the other four trials). Data at the tooth level for the permanent dentition (D(M)FT) were reported in 79 of the 139 trials that reported any caries increment data; only one of the five trials that reported caries increment data for deciduous teeth (dmfs) reported these data at the tooth level (dmft). With regard to the components of the DMFS index used, 92 trials reported DMFS data and 56 trials reported DFS data. Sixty-five trials presented D(M)FS data at more than one follow-up time. Clinical and radiographic examinations provided the definition of different stages or grades of caries lesions. These have been grouped into two basic grades for each method of examination: NCA = non-cavitated incipient enamel lesions clinically visible as white spots or discoloured fissures; CA = lesions showing loss of enamel continuity that can be recorded clinically (undermined enamel, softened floor/walls) or showing frank cavitation; ER = any radiolucency in enamel/enamel-dentin junction; DR = radiolucency into dentin. Many trials presented results using one caries grade only (usually CA/ER or CA/DR), others either did not report the grade, or reported caries increment data at both levels of diagnosis, in which case CA was chosen. Data on the state of tooth eruption considered were not clearly specified in many trials. The seven studies of Marthaler used partial recording as opposed to the full mouth recording used in all others.</P>

<P>Other dental caries data reported in a few trials: caries incidence/attack rate, caries progression, proportion of children developing new caries, proportion of children not remaining caries-free, proportion of teeth developing new caries and failures (carious teeth) over time, proportion of caries-free teeth/surfaces which developed caries.</P>
<P>Data on adverse effects were reported in a few trials (partially reported or unusable data in many of these): stain score, proportion of children with tooth staining, signs of sensitivity in oral soft tissue, adverse symptoms (nausea/vomiting), etching of enamel. Fluorosis data have not been reported in any of the trials. Data for unacceptability of treatment (as measured by dropouts/exclusions) were reported in 10 non-placebo controlled trials.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:44:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Based on 28 studies included in the topical fluoride reviews and randomly selected for assessment of reproducibility and agreement between two reviewers, interrater reliability was excellent (89%) for both allocation concealment and blinding, and agreement was good for allocation (Kappa = 0.61) and very good for blinding (Kappa = 0.73).</P>
<P>As expected, there was a considerable variation in the quality of the studies in this review (using the reported information and additional information obtained from investigators). One hundred and nine trials included in this review were described as randomized but provided no sufficient description on how the 'random' allocation was done, and 21 trials were considered to be quasi-randomized. Double-blinding was described in 118 trials, single-blinding (blind outcome assessment but no placebo used) was described in 14 trials, and blind outcome assessment was indicated in 12 trials.</P>
<P>Seventy-two per cent (72%) of the participants originally enrolled in these studies were included in the final analysis (60,423 analysed out of 85,093 initially randomized). These data exclude 27 of the 144 included studies which provided no information on the number of participants randomized to relevant groups. Drop-out rates were obtained from all but 11 of the 144 included studies and ranged from 4% at 2 years to 66% at 3 years. The most common reason for attrition was that participants were not available for follow-up examination at the end of the study.</P>
<P>Cluster randomization was used in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>) where school classes (in the first trial) and schools (in the second trial) were used as units of randomization and children used as units of analysis. Individuals were allocated to study arms in all other trials, and each participant's caries incidence, over a period of time was used as the unit of analysis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Effect of topical fluorides on dental caries increment</HEADING>
<P>The effects of fluoride toothpaste, mouthrinse, gel and varnish on dental caries increment (as measured by the DMF index) were reported in a variety of ways in the included studies. Where appropriate and possible these have been combined to produce pooled estimates as described in the Methods section. The results are reported separately here for:<BR/>(1) Decayed, (Missing) and Filled Surfaces Prevented Fraction (D(M)FS PF), with results from analyses of associations between this and study characteristics;<BR/>(2) Decayed, (Missing) and Filled Teeth Prevented Fraction (D(M)FT PF);<BR/>(3) decayed, (missing/extraction indicated), and filled surfaces Prevented Fraction (d(m/e)fs PF).<BR/>Estimates of the effects of topical fluoride therapy (TFT) are therefore presented for caries increment in the permanent and in the deciduous dentitions.</P>
<P>Five included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Brandt-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Brandt 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Liefde-1989" TYPE="STUDY">de Liefde 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Homan-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Homan 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Powell-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Powell 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Slack-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Slack 1964</LINK>) did not contribute (caries increment) data suitable for meta-analysis, although they are retained in the review (characteristics of each are described in the 'Table of included studies' and the basic findings reported or obtained from the authors are described below). Standard deviations (SD) of mean caries increment data in the permanent dentition (new D(M)FS) were (partly) missing in 34 of the 135 studies which contributed data (<LINK REF="STD-Abadia-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Abadia 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bijella-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bijella 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1977" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dolles-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Dolles 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Driscoll-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Driscoll 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogels-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Fogels 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsman-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Forsman 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Forsman-1974a" TYPE="STUDY">Forsman 1974a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gallagher-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gallagher 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973a" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973b" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Heidmann-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Heidmann 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968a" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968b" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-James-1977" TYPE="STUDY">James 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kinkel-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Kinkel 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Laswell-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Laswell 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConchie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McConchie 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mestrinho-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mestrinho 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modeer-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Modeer 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moreira-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Moreira 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muhler-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Muhler 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Poulsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Poulsen 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ran-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ran 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ran-1991a" TYPE="STUDY">Ran 1991a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Segal-1967" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Wyk-1986" TYPE="STUDY">van Wyk 1986</LINK>). From the analysis of the 179 available treatment arms for the topical fluoride reviews with complete information (as of October 1999) we derived a regression equation log (SD caries increment) = 0.64 + 0.55 log (mean caries increment), (R<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%). This equation was used to estimate missing standard deviations from mean D(M)FS increments for the meta-analyses. Similarly, this regression equation was used to estimate missing standard deviation data for 15 of the 79 trials reporting D(M)FT data (<LINK REF="STD-Abrams-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Abrams 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bastos-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Bastos 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bijella-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Bijella 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Finn-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Finn 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Fogels-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Fogels 1979</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973a" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hargreaves-1973b" TYPE="STUDY">Hargreaves 1973b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968a" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Held-1968b" TYPE="STUDY">Held 1968b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Holm-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Holm 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McConchie-1977" TYPE="STUDY">McConchie 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mestrinho-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Mestrinho 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muhler-1955" TYPE="STUDY">Muhler 1955</LINK>). Standard deviation data were missing in four of the five trials reporting mean caries increment data in the deciduous dentition (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Englander-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Englander 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frostell-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Frostell 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Treide-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Treide 1988</LINK>). The 'd(e/m)fs' for these trials were also estimated with the regression equation. Only one of the studies reporting d(e/m)fs data is also included in the analysis of D(M)FS PF (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>There were eight included studies that had a common control group and tested two different modalities of TFT (<LINK REF="STD-Ashley-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Ashley 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Blinkhorn-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Blinkhorn 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-DePaola-1980" TYPE="STUDY">DePaola 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mainwaring-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Mainwaring 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marthaler-1970a" TYPE="STUDY">Marthaler 1970a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ran-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Ran 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ringelberg-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Ringelberg 1979</LINK>). These have been entered as 16 comparisons/studies (dividing up the control groups into approximately equally sized smaller groups to provide a pairwise comparison for each modality; means and standard deviations were unchanged).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Effect on permanent tooth surfaces: D(M)FS PF</HEADING>
<P>The random-effects meta-analysis of all 133 trials combined suggested a clear benefit from the use of topical fluorides. The D(M)FS PF pooled estimate was 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.23 to 0.29; P &lt; 0.00001). However, substantial heterogeneity in results could be observed graphically and statistically (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> = 745.25 on 132 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.00001). The [method of moments-based] estimate of among-trial variance in the random-effects meta-analysis was 0.018, corresponding to a standard deviation of 0.134. Thus, an approximate, though anti-conservative, interval in which at most 95% of underlying PFs might lie is from 0.262 - 1.96*0.134 to 0.262 + 1.96*0.134, that is from 0.00 to 0.53. This provides strong evidence of a generalizable beneficial effect of topical fluoride therapy.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">(a) Metaregression, subgroup and sensitivity analyses: D(M)FS PF</HEADING>
<P>Metaregression analyses were performed to examine potential associations between study factors and the estimated treatment effect of topical fluorides. Univariate metaregression suggested a significant association between estimates of D(M)FS PFs and the following pre-specified trial characteristics: baseline caries levels, mode/setting of TFT use (unsupervised self applied home use/supervised self applied use in school-based programmes/operator-applied use), and type of TFT used (fluoride varnish/gel/mouthrinse/toothpaste). Further univariate metaregression analyses showed a significant association between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and type of control group (placebo/no treatment), language of publication (English/other than English only), method of application (paint or tray/brush or rinse), fluoride concentration, and 'total intensity of application', but statistical significance for 'intensity of application' (frequency x concentration) was lost when the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK>, a study with an unusually large PF, and hence of high influence, was excluded, in a sensitivity analysis. Univariate metaregression did not reveal any statistically significant associations between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and the pre-specified factors background exposure to fluoridated water or background exposure to other fluoride sources. In addition, no statistically significant associations were revealed in univariate metaregression between estimates of D(M)FS PFs and allocation concealment (random/quasi-random), blinding of outcome assessment (blind/blind likely or unclear), drop-out rate, length of follow up, frequency of use, mode of use (operator/self applied) or fluoride agent used (APF/AmF/NaF/SMFP/SnF2).</P>
<P>The difference between TFT types (indirect comparisons) shown in the univariate analysis relates to a greater benefit of TFT with the use of fluoride varnish. This modality has been found to be significantly different (coefficient, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; P = 0.001) from the other three types of TFT (fluoride gel/mouthrinse/toothpaste), while differences among these three modalities were not obvious. The analysis involved all 133 included trials (seven fluoride varnish trials, 22 fluoride gel trials, 34 fluoride rinse trials and 70 toothpaste trials). When the analysis was restricted to 126 trials of fluoride gel, mouthrinse and toothpaste, no significant differences among these or between each and the others were indicated either, although failure to identify such differences may be due to low power. The unadjusted pooled estimate of treatment effects from the seven fluoride varnish trials was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.63; P &lt; 0.0001); from the 22 fluoride gel trials was 0.28 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.37; P &lt; 0.0001), from the 34 fluoride mouthrinse trials was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.30; P &lt; 0.0001), and from the 70 fluoride toothpaste trials was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.0001). These results have been reported and examined in detail in separate component reviews in this series focusing on the effectiveness of each TFT modality.</P>
<P>Metaregression results also clearly indicated a greater treatment effect in trials with no treatment rather than placebo control groups (coefficient, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.23; P &lt; 0.0001). The strong evidence on differences in effect estimates by type of control group has been shown in a previous review in this series, which focused on the effectiveness of fluoride gels (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>). The pooled estimate of treatment effect on D(M)FS PF from the 17 trials with a no treatment control group was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.49; P &lt; 0.0001), while that from the 116 placebo-controlled trials was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.27; P &lt; 0.0001). However, heterogeneity among the 116 trials with placebo control groups was not substantially less (Q = 575.336 on 115 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.0001) than that observed when all trials were included in the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>Statistical significance was not lost when both factors, TFT types and type of control group, were used in the metaregression model; i.e. greater treatment effects were still shown for fluoride varnish trials compared with the other modalities of topical fluorides (coefficient, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.26; p = 0.025) and in trials with no treatment rather than placebo control groups (coefficient, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.23; p = 0.002). In addition, little change could be observed in the metaregression results when all univariate metaregression analyses were performed in the subset of 117 placebo controlled trials. Because both these covariates have been identified as strong predictors of treatment effect, we decided to adjust all metaregression analyses for type of TFT (all four levels) and type of control group. In addition, we have decided to present the results of the D(M)FS PF meta-analyses subgrouped by type of control group and TFT types.</P>
<P>The random-effects meta-analyses of D(M)FS PFs, subgrouped by type of control group and TFT types, are presented in RevMan Analyses. The pooled estimate of treatment effect on D(M)FS PF from the three placebo-controlled fluoride varnish trials was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.72; P = 0.01), from the 13 placebo-controlled fluoride gel trials was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.00001), from the 30 placebo-controlled fluoride mouthrinse trials was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.29; P &lt; 0.00001), and from the 70 placebo-controlled fluoride toothpaste trials was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.00001). Pooled estimates from the trials with no treatment control groups were: 0.52 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.69; P &lt; 0.00001) for fluoride varnish, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.53; P &lt; 0.00001) for fluoride gel, and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.40; P &lt; 0.00001) for fluoride rinse; there were no non-placebo controlled fluoride toothpaste trials. (Differences between the subgroup results from metaregression may differ from differences between the results of separate meta-analyses in separate subgroups due to an assumption of similar residual heterogeneity among PFs made in the metaregression analyses.)</P>
<P>We repeated the metaregression analyses adjusting for type of control group and all four levels of TFT types. The association between baseline caries and D(M)FS PF remained significant (and the regression coefficients almost unchanged) when both factors were included in the model (coefficient, 0.007; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.01; P = 0.004). Lack of statistically significant associations remained between estimates of D(M)FS prevented fractions and background exposure to fluoridated water (coefficient, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.09; P = 0.36) or background exposure to any fluoride source (coefficient, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.04; P = 0.56). For the three modes/settings of TFT use categories, univariate metaregression analysis had indicated a lower treatment effect with unsupervised home use of TFT (some toothpaste trials only) (coefficient, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.03; P = 0.002) compared with self applied supervised use or operator-applied use, and no significant differences between these two. This association (unsupervised use of TFT and D(M)FS PF) remained when adjusted first by type of control group (coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.01; P = 0.025), and then by TFT type (coefficient, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03; P = 0.003). A higher treatment effect with supervised use of self applied TFT in school programmes (virtually all mouthrinse trials, and some toothpaste and gel trials) compared with unsupervised use and operator-applied TFT, not shown in the univariate analysis, appeared when adjusting for type of control group (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.11; P = 0.015) and increased and became highly significant when TFT types were added to the model (coefficient, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.17; P &lt; 0.0001). A lower treatment effect with operator-applied TFT also appeared in the model (coefficient, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.00; P = 0.049). Within each subgroup, statistically significant differences in treatment effect between fluoride varnishes and gels remained in the operator-applied mode of TFT use, and no statistically significant differences were shown among the three TFT types in the self applied supervised mode of use, or between fluoride rinse and toothpaste in the unsupervised mode of use (only two fluoride mouthrinse trials in this subgroup however). Associations between prevented fraction and language of publication remained when adjusting for type of control group and TFT types, where a higher PF was shown for trials reported only in languages other than English (coefficient, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.19; P = 0.02), but associations of D(M)FS PFs with method of application or with fluoride concentration became non-significant when adjusted by type of control group and TFT types. The associations between D(M)FS PFs with frequency of application and intensity of application became significant when type of control group and TFT types were included in the metaregression (with or without the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK>).</P>
<P>The association between type of control group and D(M)FS prevented fraction remained significant when each investigated potential effect modifier was included in all bivariate or multivariate metaregression analyses (with or without the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK>). The associations seen between TFT types (differences in treatment effect between fluoride varnish and that of other TFTs) and D(M)FS prevented fraction also remained significant throughout, except when adjusted by background exposure to fluorides (association between PF and exposure to other fluoride sources remaining non-significant in the model), or by fluoride concentration (association between PF and fluoride concentration becoming non-significant in the model), irrespective of exclusion or not of the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK>. However, associations between language of publication and prevented fraction did not remain after excluding the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK> from the analyses (in univariate and multivariate metaregression). Further sensitivity analysis removing all but the 12 trials published only in languages other than English produced a D(M)FS pooled estimate of 0.34 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.48; P &lt; 0.0001), with substantial heterogeneity in results (Q = 122.181 on 11 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>When the effect of each relevant covariate (type of control group, all four levels of TFT types, all three levels of mode/setting of TFT use, background exposure to any fluoride, baseline caries, and intensity of application) was controlled for all others in the metaregression model there remained strong associations between DM(F)S PF and type of control group (0.13 higher PF with no treatment control, 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.21; P = 0.002), baseline caries (0.008 increase in PF per unit increase in caries, 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.012; P &lt; 0.0001), total intensity of application (0.00002 increase in PF per extra equivalent to 100 more applications 1000 ppmF higher, 95% CI, 0.000008 to 0.00004; P = 0.002), mode/setting of TFT use (-0.08 lower PF with unsupervised home use compared with supervised use in preventive programs, 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.02; P = 0.01; and both not significantly different from operator-applied use), and TFT type (-0.20 lower PF with toothpaste compared to fluoride varnish, 95% CI, -0.39 to -0.02; P = 0.033; and both not significantly different from mouthrinse or gel).</P>
<P>All metaregression results, in each case adjusting for type of control group and all four levels of TFT types, are provided in Additional <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>: Random-effects metaregression analyses of prevented fractions: D(M)FS. The influential study by <LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK> is omitted from three analyses: intensity of application and frequency of application with prevented fraction, and language of publication with prevented fraction.</P>
<P>It should be noted that although the number of data points (comparisons) in this review is unusually high, reducing the possibility of spurious claims of association, all metaregression results should be interpreted with a degree of caution given the large number of comparisons made and the observational nature of the comparisons.</P>
<P>The additional uncertainty we should have about the cluster randomized trials by <LINK REF="STD-Bravo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bravo 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ruiken-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Ruiken 1987</LINK> had been taken account of in sensitivity analyses performed in previous component reviews, where the variances of the prevented fraction estimates were inflated (using a conservative value for the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)). The adjusted results were virtually identical to the analyses, ignoring the cluster randomized design, since the estimates for the trials were similar to the meta-analyses results and altering their weight had minimal effect.</P>
<P>In order to illustrate the magnitude of the overall effect of topical fluorides, numbers of children needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one D(M)FS were calculated based on the pooled D(M)FS PF and on the caries increments in the control groups of the trials that contributed data to the meta-analysis. The overall caries-inhibiting effect (% PF) derived from the pooled results of the 133 trials was 26% (95% CI, 23% to 29%); the caries increments in the included trials ranged from 0.2 to 7.7 D(M)FS per year. In populations with a caries increment of 0.2 D(M)FS per year (at the lowest end of the results seen in the included studies), this implies an absolute caries reduction of 0.052 D(M)FS per year, equivalent to an NNT of 20 (95% CI, 18 to 22): i.e. 20 children need to use topical fluorides to avoid one D(M)FS. In populations with a caries increment of 2.5 D(M)FS per year (at the mid range of the results seen in the included studies), this implies an absolute caries reduction of 0.65 D(M)FS per year, equivalent to an NNT of 2 (95% CI, 2 to 2): i.e. 2 children need to use TFT to avoid one D(M)FS.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Effect on permanent teeth: D(M)FT PF</HEADING>
<P>Seventy-nine trials reported data which allowed the calculation of the D(M)FT prevented fraction. All 79 are also included in the analysis of D(M)FS PF. The pooled estimate of D(M)FT prevented fraction was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.30; P &lt; 0.00001). There was substantial heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 845.06 on 78 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.00001). The results of this analysis are very similar to those reported in the analysis of D(M)FS PF.</P>
<P>As with the estimates of the effects of TFT on D(M)FS PF, univariate metaregression suggested that the estimates from trials using no treatment as opposed to placebo controls were substantially higher (coefficient, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.34; P = 0.001). The pooled estimate of the D(M)FT prevented fraction from the seven trials with a no treatment control group (fluoride gel and varnish trials only) was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.58; P &lt; 0.0001), while that from the 72 placebo-controlled trials (all four modalities) was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.0001). When the meta-analysis was confined to those trials with placebo controls, there remained substantial heterogeneity (Q = 591.33 on 71 degrees of freedom, P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Differences between TFT types (indirect comparisons) shown for D(M)FS PF in metaregression analyses were also suggested for D(M)FT PF. Fluoride varnish has been found to be significantly different from the other types of TFT (coefficient, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.33; P = 0.01); differences among the other three modalities (fluoride gel/mouthrinse/toothpaste) were not obvious. Although no significant differences between fluoride varnish and gel were shown when all TFT types were in the model, these became significant when adjusted for type of control group (in which case, differences between fluoride varnish and mouthrinse became non-significant). The pooled estimate of treatment effect from the three fluoride varnish trials was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.82; P &lt; 0.0001); from the 10 fluoride gel trials was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.46; P &lt; 0.0001), from the 13 fluoride mouthrinse trials was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.30; P &lt; 0.0001), and from the 53 fluoride toothpaste trials was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.28; P &lt; 0.0001). It should be noted that there were only placebo-controlled fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse trials reporting DMFT data.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Effect on deciduous tooth surfaces: d(e)fs PF</HEADING>
<P>Five trials reported data which allowed the calculation of the 'd(e/m)fs' prevented fraction. Only one of these (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 1985</LINK>) is also included in the analysis of D(M)FS PF. The pooled estimate of d(m/e)fs prevented fraction was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.44; P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting a substantial benefit of TFT in the deciduous dentition. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between trials (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 6.13 on 4 degrees of freedom, P = 0.19). These results should be viewed with a degree of caution given the fact that standard deviations (SDs) were imputed (regression equation) in four of the five trials. In addition, the test for heterogeneity has low power to detect excess variability between the results of the trials when only a few trials are included.</P>
<P>Univariate metaregression suggested no significant association between estimates of d(e/m)fs prevented fractions and type of control group (placebo/no treatment). Because the meta-analysis included only five trials (three fluoride varnish trials and two fluoride gel trials), no further exploration of competing explanations for heterogeneity in treatment effects was considered. Metaregression would have had very limited power to detect any association under these circumstances. However, we have decided to present the meta-analysis results stratified by type of control group and TFT type, since there is clear evidence for the influence of these factors on treatment effects. In fact, the pooled estimate of the d(e/m)fs prevented fraction from the two trials with a no treatment control group was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.55; P &lt; 0.0001) while that from the three placebo-controlled trials was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.8 to 0.48; P &lt; 0.004); and the pooled estimate of treatment effect from the three fluoride varnish trials was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.48; P &lt; 0.0001) while that from the two fluoride gel trials was 0.26 (95% CI, -0.11 to 0.63; P = 0.18).</P>
<P>The random-effects meta-analyses of d(e/m)fs prevented fractions are presented in RevMan Analyses, subgrouped by type of control group and TFT types.</P>
<P>Numbers of children needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one defs were calculated based on the pooled d(e/m)fs prevented fraction and on the caries increments in the control groups of the five trials in the meta-analysis. In populations with a caries increment of 0.8 defs per year (at the lowest end of the results seen in the included studies), this implies an absolute caries reduction of 0.26 defs per year, equivalent to an NNT of 3.8 (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.7): i.e. 4 children need to use topical fluorides to avoid one defs. In populations with a caries increment of 1.9 defs per year (at the highest range of the results seen in the included studies), this implies an absolute caries reduction of 0.63 defs per year, equivalent to an NNT of 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4); i.e. 2 children need to use topical fluorides to avoid one defs.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-08-29 10:59:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The first question addressed by this review was whether the use of topical fluoride therapy (TFT) in the form of toothpaste, mouthrinse, gel or varnish for the prevention of dental caries in children is overall better than not using a topical fluoride intervention. The review as a whole contains information from over 65,000 children included in the trials comparing a topical fluoride intervention with a placebo or no treatment, and suggests that the use of topical fluorides is associated with a clear reduction in caries increment in both the permanent and the deciduous dentition. For the great majority of children (approximately two thirds) the topical fluoride modality they used was toothpaste, followed by mouthrinse, gel and varnish applications.</P>
<P>There is strong evidence of a generalizable beneficial effect of topical fluoride therapy. The random-effects meta-analysis of 133 trials combined assessing the effect of topical fluorides on the permanent dentition suggests a caries inhibiting effect of 26% on average; an approximate, though anti-conservative, interval in which at most 95% of underlying effects might lie is from 0% to 53%. The average caries reduction of 26% would correspond to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2 to avoid one decayed, filled or missing tooth surface (DMFS) per year in a child population with a caries increment of 2.5 D(M)FS per year (in the middle range of control group rates for included studies), or an NNT of 20 for children from a population with a caries increment of 0.2 D(M)FS per year (at the lowest end of the observed range). Only five studies reported the effects of topical fluoride therapy on caries increment in deciduous tooth surfaces, two of these tested self applications of fluoride gel with a toothbrush and three studies tested fluoride varnish applications. The random-effects meta-analysis of the five studies combined suggests that the use of topical fluoride applications is associated on average with a 33% (95% confidence interval (CI), 22% to 44%) reduction in decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces. This would correspond to an NNT of 2 to avoid one defs per year in a child population with a caries increment of 1.9 defs per year (at the highest end of the control group rates), or an NNT of 4 for children from a population with a caries increment of 0.8 defs per year (at the lowest end of the observed range). It should be noted that although the variation among the results of the 133 studies assessing the effectiveness of topical fluoride on the permanent dentition is substantial, the results of the few studies on the effectiveness of topical fluoride on deciduous tooth surfaces are less heterogeneous. On the other hand, the confidence intervals are relatively wide for the effect on deciduous tooth surfaces, since relatively few trials were included in the meta-analysis (1685 participants).</P>
<P>A secondary objective of this review was to exploit power to look at potential sources of heterogeneity between studies across all four types of topical fluoride interventions and at indirect comparisons of the different TFT types. It was examined extensively whether there was any relationship between the caries-preventive effectiveness of topical fluoride therapy and a number of factors, including initial level of caries, background exposure to extraneous fluoride sources, mode/setting of TFT use and type of topical fluoride intervention used. A significant influence of the pre-specified factors/variables initial level of caries, mode/setting of use, and type of topical fluoride on the prevented fraction (PF) was shown in the metaregression analyses performed. Among the other potential sources of heterogeneity investigated, a significant influence of type of control group was shown.</P>
<P>We have detected a constant relative increase in the PF of 1% on average as trials involved children with higher initial D(M)FS scores (baseline risk of the study population). Although the magnitude of the effect was small, this implies that as the caries levels of a community decline, the percentage caries reductions will decrease. On the other hand, we were unable to detect a clear relationship between background exposure to other fluoride sources and the magnitude of the treatment effect. Although this may have been partly influenced by potential misclassification, especially due to the incomplete reporting of data for exposure to fluorides other than water, the lack of association between background exposure to water fluoridation and treatment effect, based on analysis including 116 trials (20 of which were in fluoridated areas), implies that estimates of treatment effect were similar between trials conducted in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas i.e. use of topical fluoride may provide additional caries reduction in subjects from fluoridated areas.</P>
<P>There is evidence of a 14% greater caries inhibiting effect with the use of fluoride varnish compared with the other TFT types (gels, mouthrinses and toothpastes), while no significant differences in treatment effects among these or between any one of these and the others were suggested. However, relatively few fluoride varnish trials were included and very few among these were placebo-controlled trials, making it difficult to rule out the possibility of an overestimation of the size of the effect, due to the preponderance of no treatment control studies of lower methodological quality in this subgroup. Further, conclusions about differences in effect due to differences between topical fluoride interventions are on a strongest ground if participants are randomized to one type of TFT or another within a study and a consistent relationship is found across similar studies, but surely such investigations could not be performed in a review including only placebo/no-treatment comparisons. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution since the investigation of differences between subgroups is effectively a non-randomized comparison, and is prone to all the difficulties in inferring causality in observational studies. Nevertheless, the adjusted indirect comparisons resulting from the metaregression analyses performed in this review had the advantage that other possible explanations for heterogeneity in different trials, including prognostic factors of participants (such as baseline caries levels and background exposure to fluorides), intervention and actual trial characteristics, could be partially taken into account. Another advantage was that uncertainty could be incorporated in the analyses results by providing wider confidence intervals.</P>
<P>We observed a 10% decrease in the PF with the unsupervised home use of topical fluoride interventions (basically toothpaste) compared with supervised and with operator-applied use in the adjusted metaregression analysis. In addition, the effect of self applied supervised use of TFT appeared to be 11% greater than that of operator-applied and unsupervised home use of TFT. These differences in treatment effect between trials of supervised use and both unsupervised use and operator-applied use are perhaps unsurprising. They are likely to reflect the more intensive use of topical fluoride interventions under supervised schemes. As regards the suggested greater treatment effect with increased frequency and intensity of topical fluoride application in this review, this had been indicated in two other reviews in this series (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2003</LINK>) and should probably be more relevant in the context of each specific review. It should be pointed out that metaregression analyses including 130 trials should have sufficient power to detect such relationships, but more robust investigations of these aspects of the topical fluoride interventions also require direct, head to head comparisons of different frequencies/intensities of application, which were not within the scope of this review.</P>
<P>Treatment effects estimates from the trials that employed a no-treatment control group were on average 14% more beneficial than from those with a placebo control group. The strong evidence on differences in effect estimates by type of control group shown in this review (which included 116 placebo controlled trials and 17 no-treatment control comparisons in the analysis) was also indicated in a previous systematic review in this series (<LINK REF="REF-Marinho-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marinho 2002</LINK>). Blind assessment of outcome was an inclusion criterion used across all reviews but clearly participants could not have been blinded in trials with no treatment controls. Although it is unclear why this should have been associated with differences in outcome in these particular circumstances, type of control group can be considered a useful 'proxy' for the use or not of double-blinding in included studies, a key methodological feature that may represent the best indicator of study quality in these reviews. With regards to the key quality domain of allocation concealment, no association with treatment effect could be demonstrated for this, possibly due to the fact that the randomization process was poorly described in the studies included.</P>
<P>We observed a significantly greater treatment effect in non-English language trials in the post hoc metaregression analyses performed. Although plausible (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2002</LINK>), this relationship was dependent on the inclusion of one study with particularly powerful effects (<LINK REF="STD-Di-Maggio-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Di Maggio 1980</LINK>). After exclusion of this study in a sensitivity analysis no significant association was seen with this factor. It should be noted however that comprehensive searching and data extraction from as many trials as possible published in any language was an important component of this review in an attempt to reduce biases and imprecision. Although the exclusion of trials published in languages other than English may have little impact on the summary effect estimate of a review that includes so many trials, such studies carried out in a variety of countries should maximise the ability of users of the review to judge its applicability for specific decisions on the appropriate use of topical fluorides.</P>
<P>Although visual inspection of the funnel plot may suggest a degree of asymmetry, the Egger formal test for asymmetry provided no evidence of a significant relationship between trial size and effect estimate. Therefore, there is no evidence that the smaller studies in the meta-analysis of D(M)FS PFs tend to show larger treatment effects in this review.</P>
<P>We found little useful information about the risk of adverse effects in the topical fluoride reviews, and the few results available are discussed in the context of each relevant separate review in this series.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The use of topical fluoride therapy is associated with a clear reduction in caries increment in children. While we found evidence that the relative effect of topical fluoride may be greater in those who have higher baseline levels of decayed, missing and filled tooth surfaces (D(M)FS), we found no evidence that the effect of topical fluoride was dependent on background exposure to fluoridated water or other fluoride sources. In addition, a higher D(M)FS prevented fraction was shown with increased total intensity of fluoride application, with self applied supervised use (where a higher compliance with topical fluoride interventions as recommended should be expected), and with the use of fluoride varnishes compared with the other topical fluoride modalities. Research on the effects of fluoride varnish has been of lower methodological quality however. The effect of topical fluoride also varied according to type of control group used; the D(M)FS prevented fraction was higher with no treatment compared with placebo. Unfortunately, little information is available on the effects of topical fluoride therapy on outcomes such as caries incidence in the deciduous dentition and on the likelihood of adverse effects. The general lack of evidence on outcomes other than caries increment in children's permanent teeth makes it more difficult for policy makers to weigh the benefits of topical fluoride use in preventing caries against potential negative effects.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>This systematic review included placebo controlled trials as well as trials with no treatment controls on the effects of topical fluoride therapy (TFT) on dental caries in children. There is sufficient evidence to establish that this factor (type of control group) represents an important source of heterogeneity and a strong indicator of study quality in the topical fluoride reviews. Although many reports lacked important methodological details, the review findings are quite strong, based on a sizeable body of randomized evidence. In this review, the meta-analyses were stratified by both type of control group and type of topical fluoride intervention (all four levels). Here, a test of differences between subgroups in multivariate metaregression analyses was effectively an indirect comparison of the effects of the various topical fluoride interventions. Although such a test can provide indirect evidence of relative treatment effects, it may be less reliable than evidence from randomized controlled trials that compare the interventions directly (head to head comparisons). We need therefore to be cautious about drawing conclusions about the relative efficacy of the TFT interventions based on such evaluation of the magnitude of treatment effects across studies. Fortunately, direct evidence from head to head comparisons is available for the various topical fluoride interventions and this will be the subject of the next systematic review in this series. </P>
