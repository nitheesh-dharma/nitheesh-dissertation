<P>The use of inhaled nebulized epinephrine after extubation in newborn infants is not supported or refuted by evidence from randomised controlled trials. Following mechanical ventilation, airway swelling and obstruction can occur in newborn infants (especially after prolonged, traumatic or multiple intubations). This may compromise breathing and cause failure of extubation. Because epinephrine can decrease swelling and its effect has been proven in the treatment of croup in infants, it has been used immediately after extubation to prevent breathing problems. The reviewers did not identify any studies that examined clinically relevant outcomes following the use of nebulized epinephrine in newborn infants. They concluded that there is no evidence either supporting or refuting the use of inhaled nebulized epinephrine in newborn infants.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:56:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Following a period of mechanical ventilation, post-extubation upper airway obstruction can occur in newborn infants, especially after prolonged, traumatic or multiple intubations. The subsequent increase in upper airway resistance may lead to respiratory insufficiency and failure of extubation. The vasoconstrictive properties of epinephrine, and its proven efficacy in the treatment of croup in infants, has led to the routine use of inhaled nebulized epinephrine immediately post-extubation in some neonatal units. It is also recommended for neonates with post-extubation tracheal obstruction and stridor in neonatal and respiratory textbooks and reviews.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The primary objective was to assess whether nebulized epinephrine administered immediately after extubation in neonates weaned from IPPV decreases the need for subsequent additional respiratory support.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:56:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Searches were of: MEDLINE from 1966 to September 2000; CINAHL from 1982 to September 2000; Current Contents from 1994 to September 2000; and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2000). These searches were updated to September 2001 for this review update. Previous searches up to March 1999 included the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, expert informants and journal hand searching mainly in the English language, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, and conference and symposia proceedings.<BR/>This search was updated in December 2009.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised and quasi-randomised control trials in which nebulized epinephrine was compared with placebo immediately post-extubation in newborn infants who have been weaned from IPPV and extubated, with regard to clinically important outcomes (i.e. need for additional respiratory support, increase in oxygen requirement, respiratory distress, stridor or the occurrence of side effects).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>No studies met our criteria for inclusion in this review.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>No studies were identified which looked at the effect of inhaled nebulized epinephrine on clinically important outcomes in infants being extubated.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-03-15 16:05:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Implications for practice: There is no evidence either supporting or refuting the use of inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine in newborn infants.</P>
<P>Implications for research: randomised controlled trials are needed comparing inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine with placebo in neonates post-extubation. This should be looked at both as a routine treatment post-extubation and as specific treatment for post-extubation upper airway obstruction. Study populations should include the group of infants at highest risk for upper airway obstruction from mucosal swelling because of their small glottic and subglottic diameters (i.e. those infants with birth weights less than 1000 grams).</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:53:45 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Assisted ventilation via an endotracheal tube (ETT) is a common therapy in neonates with respiratory insufficiency in the first few weeks of life. The presence of a foreign body in contact with mucosal surfaces of the larynx and sub-glottis may damage those upper airway surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 1994</LINK>). The delicate mucosal lining of the infant airway readily becomes edematous in response to irritation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1995</LINK>). Prolonged intubation, traumatic intubations and multiple intubations have been associated with a greater risk of developing post-extubation upper respiratory tract inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Joshi-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Joshi 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva 1999</LINK>) and obstruction (<LINK REF="REF-Koka-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koka 1977</LINK>). Direct visualisation using both flexible and rigid endoscopy has demonstrated laryngeal and sub-glottic swelling and erythema in neonates post-extubation (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>The subglottis is the narrowest portion of the upper airway in infants (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willging-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willging 1995</LINK>). In neonates the upper airways contribute more to total airway resistance than peripheral airways (<LINK REF="REF-Wohl-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wohl 1990</LINK>). Whilst the specific contribution of the glottis and sub-glottis to total airway resistance is largely unknown, it is thought to be substantial (<LINK REF="REF-Wohl-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wohl 1990</LINK>). The most important determinant of resistance in airways (particularly in the small calibre upper airways in neonates) is the radius of the airway lumen (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1990</LINK>). Even mild oedema in these narrowest portions of the upper respiratory tract will reduce the intra-luminal cross-sectional area by more than 50% (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Connor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Connor 1995</LINK>) and result in a significant increase in airway resistance (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brodovich-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brodovich 1990</LINK>). Increased airway resistance after the infant is extubated may lead to respiratory insufficiency and failure of extubation.</P>
<P>Four prospective series have looked at post-extubation stridor in neonates. <LINK REF="REF-Laing-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laing 1986</LINK> found an incidence of post-extubation stridor in neonates of 14%. The study population included all ventilated neonates in a neonatal intensive care nursery from 1978 to the mid 1980's, intubated with Cole type, 'shouldered' ETTs. The incidence of stridor post-extubation leading to reintubation was 2% - none of the infants in this series had permanent subglottic stenosis. Albert (<LINK REF="REF-Albert-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 1990</LINK>) studied 30 consecutive infants who had been ventilated for &gt;24 hours, intubated with Cole type ETTs, and found an incidence of stridor post-extubation of 30%. Fan (<LINK REF="REF-Fan-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fan 1982</LINK>) described an incidence of stridor post-extubation of 16% in 73 consecutive neonates who required intubation. These infants were intubated with McGill ETTs (i.e. with a constant external diameter). The most recent study (<LINK REF="REF-da-Silva-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">da Silva 1999</LINK>) of ETT complications in very low birthweight infants gives an incidence of post-extubation stridor of 4.8% (11/227). Infants in this study had all been intubated with ETTs with a constant external diameter. It is also noted that some of the 227 infants had been pretreated with systemic corticosteroids.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:53:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Epinephrine stimulates both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and is a potent inotrope and chronotrope. It acts on vascular smooth muscle to produce vasoconstriction which markedly decreases blood flow to capillary beds, especially in the skin and mucosal surfaces. The decrease in blood flow to the surfaces of the upper respiratory tract shrinks the mucosa and reduces oedema (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Remington-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Remington 1986</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>When epinephrine is nebulized and inhaled the actions of the drug are largely restricted to the respiratory tract, however, systemic reactions can occur (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1996</LINK>). Side effects of epinephrine include tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension, peripheral vasoconstriction, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis and leucocytosis with left shift (<LINK REF="REF-Hoffman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoffman 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Solomon-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solomon 1984</LINK>).</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:54:28 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Inhaled nebulized epinephrine is widely used in the treatment of infective croup in children (<LINK REF="REF-Couriel-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Couriel 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Skolnik-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skolnik 1989</LINK>) and its efficacy has been well demonstrated in randomised control trials (<LINK REF="REF-Kuusela-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuusela 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kristj_x00e1_nsson-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kristjánsson 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fanconi-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fanconi 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corkey-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corkey 1981</LINK>). There is also anecdotal evidence that nebulized epinephrine can alleviate obstruction caused by laryngeal or tracheal oedema from other causes in infants (<LINK REF="REF-Gwinnutt-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gwinnutt 1987</LINK>) and children (<LINK REF="REF-ASC-of-NYSSA-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">ASC of NYSSA 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jordan-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jordan 1970</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of the problem of post-extubation upper airway obstruction and the vasoconstrictive properties of epinephrine, inhaled nebulized epinephrine administered immediately post-extubation is used routinely in some neonatal units (<LINK REF="REF-Bancalari-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bancalari 1992</LINK>). Its effects have been studied in neonates in small, uncontrolled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Koren-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Koren 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marshall-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Marshall 1984</LINK>). It is recommended for neonates with post-extubation tracheal obstruction and stridor in neonatal and respiratory textbooks (<LINK REF="REF-Phelan-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Phelan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenough-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenough 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbet-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbet 1990</LINK>) and reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Pransky-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pransky 1989</LINK>).</P>

<P>We planned to assess the methodological quality of the trials using the standard method of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group.</P>
<P>The two review authors worked independently to search for and assess trials for inclusion and methodological quality. If studies were identified for inclusion, we planned to assess the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. We planned to enter this information in the Characteristics of Included Studies Table.</P>
<P>If studies were identified at the time of the update (December 2009), we planned to evaluate the following issues and enter the data in the Risk of Bias Table:</P>
<P>1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? </P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to generate the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator); </P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); </P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); </P>
<P>- unclear. </P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we planned to categorize the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We planned to categorize the methods as: </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel; </P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors. </P>
<P>In some situations there may be partial blinding e.g. where outcomes are self-reported by unblinded participants but they are recorded by blinded personnel without knowledge of group assignment.  If needed, we planned to add &#8220;partial&#8221; to the list of options for assessing quality of blinding. </P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we planned to describe the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We planned to note whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-03-30 15:57:31 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As of September 2001 this review has found only two randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Echevarria_x002d_Ybar-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Echevarria-Ybar 1986</LINK>) in which inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine was used immediately post-extubation in neonates.</P>
<P>Courtney et al (<LINK REF="STD-Courtney-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Courtney 1987</LINK>) compared nebulized racemic epinephrine with warm humidified gases in infants immediately after extubation. The primary study outcome was ventilatory function in the first hour post-extubation. The method of randomisation was not stated. 45 infants were randomised. Neither the investigators nor attending medical and nursing staff were blinded to the treatment.</P>
<P>Outcomes measured in this study were ventilatory function (pulmonary mechanics) measured up to one hour post-extubation, continuous respiratory and heart rate monitoring and continuous Holter monitoring of heart rate for arrhythmias (duration not stated).</P>
<P>There was a statistically significant - and clinically significant - difference in mean ±SD weight at extubation between the treatment and control groups (treatment 1.43 kg ± 0.36 versus control 1.81 ± 0.69).</P>
<P>The authors found that, whilst there was a statistically significant difference in airway resistance between the groups in males, this difference was not of any physiological significance as all measurements were still within normal range for a preterm population. This difference was not shown in the females. The authors felt that there was no consistent pattern of overall treatment effect and concluded that racemic epinephrine is not indicated as a routine in the infant post-extubation.</P>
<P>Whilst an attempt was made to monitor for arrhythmias with Holter monitoring, this was only possible in 16 out of 44 infants. Six infants experienced abnormalities of brief duration (2 treatment and 4 control) and no conclusions could be drawn regarding the impact of epinephrine on this side effect.</P>
<P>One infant who had been randomised to the control group experienced respiratory distress and stridor immediately post-extubation. The infant was withdrawn from the study, racemic epinephrine was given and no further respiratory support was required. The authors state in their discussion that no other infants developed symptoms post-extubation within 24 hours of extubation. It is unclear whether or not these symptoms were being looked for prospectively and, if so, how monitoring was performed.</P>
<P>This study was excluded because it did not address clinically important outcomes: the need for additional respiratory support up to a week post-extubation, an increase in oxygen requirement, or the development of stridor or respiratory distress post-extubation. In addition there was no systematic evaluation of infants for possible adverse effects of racemic epinephrine. We wrote to the first author (SEC) to see if there were any unpublished data relevant to clinically important outcome measures (as stated in our selection criteria - 'types of outcome measures'). Unfortunately there were no additional data available.</P>
<P>Echevarria-Ybarguengoitia et al (<LINK REF="STD-Echevarria_x002d_Ybar-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Echevarria-Ybar 1986</LINK>) aimed to evaluate the effect of nebulized racemic epinephrine on the incidence of post-extubation atelectasis in infants weaned from ventilation and extubated. Because this study randomised infants to nebulized epinephrine at the time of extubation, we considered it for inclusion in our review despite the fact that its aim was specifically to study other outcomes.</P>
<P>43 infants (32 preterm, 11 term) were randomised to a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group received nebulized racemic epinephrine twice pre-extubation and six times post-extubation at intervals of four hours. There was no placebo used in the control group. All patients were "monitored electronically for vital signs, looking for tachycardia".</P>
<P>Only two of the reported outcomes were relevant to our review. Tachycardia was looked for in all patients and in the results section the authors state that "none of the 20 neonates in the treatment group presented with any clinical signs of intoxication due to racemic epinephrine".</P>
<P>Figures are also quoted for the number of patients re-intubated due to post-extubation atelectasis: 6/23 in the control group and 5/20 in the treatment group. It is specifically stated in both the text and the tables that the infants were re-intubated due to post-extubation atelectasis. It is not clear whether there were any other infants who were re-intubated (or required any other form of respiratory support) for other reasons.</P>
<P>Because the exact number of infants needing to be re-intubated is unknown and no other relevant outcomes were given we have excluded this study from our review. We have written to the authors to see if there were any unpublished data relevant to clinically important outcome measures, but we have not received a reply.</P>
<P>Both the above studies failed to meet our inclusion criteria mainly because no clinically important outcome measures were looked for or completely reported. No unpublished data is available from either study. Therefore, neither study can help the clinician decide whether using inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine, as routine treatment for infants being extubated, is an efficacious treatment in preventing morbidity post-extubation.</P>
<P>While inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine has a theoretical basis for decreasing any laryngeal and sub-glottic swelling present post-extubation, this does not translate to proven efficacy in neonatal intensive care. Two important questions remain unanswered. Firstly, does the routine use of inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine post-extubation prevent failure of extubation? Secondly, does inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine successfully treat post-extubation upper airway obstruction? In addition, if the answer to these questions is yes, then do the benefits outweigh any risks of administration?</P>
<P>Failure of extubation may result from a number of factors including alveolar atelectasis, decreased respiratory drive associated with prematurity, or inadequate pulmonary mechanics associated with a compliant chest wall. A further factor is the increased airway resistance associated with laryngeal and sub-glottic oedema. The increased airway resistance alone may be enough to cause failure of extubation (this may be obvious in an infant with post-extubation respiratory distress and stridor) or may act in addition to other factors. The use of inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine in the infant without any overt symptoms of upper airway obstruction may therefore decrease airway resistance sufficiently to allow successful extubation. This may be particularly important in the in VLBW infant where a very small decrease in internal diameter of the upper airway can result in large increases in resistance.</P>
<P>The use of inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine is of proven efficacy in infective croup in older children. However, it remains unstudied in neonates with upper airway obstruction post-extubation.</P>
<P>Given the theoretical basis for using inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine as routine treatment in neonates post-extubation and the fact that it is currently used routinely in some neonatal units, the next step should be a randomised controlled trial comparing inhaled nebulized racemic epinephrine with placebo. This should be looked at both as a routine treatment post-extubation and as specific treatment for post-extubation upper airway obstruction. Study populations should include the group of infants at highest risk for upper airway obstruction from mucosal swelling because of their small glottic and sub-glottic diameters (i.e. those infants with birth weights less than 1000 grams).</P>
