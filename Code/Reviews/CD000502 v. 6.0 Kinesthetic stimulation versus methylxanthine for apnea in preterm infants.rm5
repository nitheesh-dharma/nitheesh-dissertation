<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:53:35 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is some evidence that theophylline may be more effective for apnea in preterm babies than kinesthetic stimulation, but more research is needed.</P>
<P>Apnea is a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds. It may occur repeatedly in preterm babies (born before 34 weeks). Immaturity alone can cause apnea, but so can infections. Apnea may be harmful to the developing brain or organs if it continues. Various methods have been tried to reduce apnea in premature babies including drugs, physical stimulation by nurses and kinesthetic stimulation (using an oscillating mattress which moves from side to side). The review of trials found some evidence that the drug theophylline may be more effective than kinesthetic stimulation for apnea but more research is needed.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:51:04 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apnea of prematurity may lead to hypoxemia and bradycardia requiring resuscitative measures being instituted. Many treatments have been used in infants with apnea of prematurity including methylxanthines. Physical stimulation is often used to restart breathing and it is possible that repeated stimulation such as with an oscillating mattress or other kinesthetic stimulation, might also be used to treat infants with apnea and prevent its consequences.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:44:10 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine if kinesthetic stimulation is more effective than a methylxanthine in preventing clinically important apnea in preterm infants with apnea.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-04 09:40:31 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>, Issue 4, 2009), the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE in October 2009. Searches were performed of previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal handsearches mainly in the English language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:52:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation in which kinesthetic stimulation was compared to methylxanthine therapy for apnea of prematurity were eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used with separate evaluation of trial quality, data extraction by both authors and synthesis of data using relative risk and weighted mean difference. Measures of severity of apnea as well as the response to treatment were consistent with an evaluation of 'clinical apnea' as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:53:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A single study of 20 infants (<A HREF="Saigal 1986">Saigal 1986</A>) demonstrated a significant benefit to the infants receiving theophylline compared to those on an oscillating water bed (OWB) in terms of mean rates of clinically important apnea (apnea &gt; 14 seconds associated with bradycardia &lt; 100 or cyanosis or receiving stimulation). There were no significant differences in adverse effects (death, sleep states, the Albert Einstein Neurobehavioral Index, adverse neurological outcomes, and the Bayley Mental Development Index at six and 12 months) although the infants on the OWB had a higher psychomotor index at six but not 12 months.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>The results of this review should be treated with caution. Theophylline has been shown in one small study to be superior to kinesthetic stimulation at treating clinically important apnea of prematurity. There are currently no clear research questions regarding the comparison of methylxanthines and kinesthetic stimulation to treat apnea of prematurity.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:54:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-10-14 21:16:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Apnea in infants has been defined as a pause in breathing of greater than 20 seconds or an apneic event less than 20 seconds associated with bradycardia and/or cyanosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1978</LINK>). Recurrent episodes of apnea are common in preterm infants and the incidence and severity increases at lower gestational ages. Although it can occur spontaneously and be attributed to prematurity alone, it can also be provoked or made more severe if there is some additional insult such as infection, hypoxemia or intracranial pathology (<LINK REF="REF-Henderson_x002d_Smart-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson-Smart 1995</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-10-28 18:54:05 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Various treatments for apnea in preterm infants have been used including physical stimulation by nursing staff, pharmacological stimulation including methylxanthines (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005a</LINK>) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005b</LINK>). Kinesthetic stimulation using various forms of oscillating mattress has been used in both prevention and treatment for apnea which are the subject of other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>). This review compares the effects of kinesthetic stimulation and methylxanthines for the treatment of preterm infants with apnea.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-10-14 21:17:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Physical stimulation by nursing staff is commonly used to arouse the apneic infant and so stimulate breathing. This raises the question of whether frequent physical stimuli might reduce the number of apneic events. Furthermore, some believe that the preterm infant is deprived of the frequent stimuli that would be felt in utero and that substituting these with an oscillating mattress to provide kinesthetic stimulation might improve growth and development. </P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-10-14 21:16:50 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>If prolonged, apnea can lead to hypoxemia and reflex bradycardia which may require active resuscitative efforts to reverse. There are clinical concerns that these episodes might be harmful to the developing brain or cause dysfunction to the gut or developing organs, although there are no data to support this. Frequent episodes may be accompanied by respiratory failure of sufficient severity as to lead to intubation and the use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). </P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saigal-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saigal 1986</LINK> reported that infants in the theophylline group had slightly more respiratory distress syndrome at study entry than infants on the oscillating water bed (OWB). They also had different rates of baseline apnea (higher in the infants on the OWB). No significant differences were seen between the groups in demographic and other neonatal data.</P>
<P>Categorical data on apnea/bradycardic episodes could not be obtained as original data could not be located by the author. Data could not be extracted to determine: 1) persisting apneas with or without bradycardia (&gt; 4 and &gt; 10 episodes /day) and 2) greater than a 50% reduction in the daily rates of apnea with or without bradycardia. Daily rates of clinically important apnea (nursing observation) were available for episodes of apnea (&gt; 14 seconds) with bradycardia (&lt; 100 bpm) and cyanosis OR receiving stimulation, as well as for episodes of apnea (&gt; 14 seconds) with bradycardia (&lt; 100 bpm) and cyanosis AND receiving stimulation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Saigal-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Saigal 1986</LINK> reported no significant difference in apnea defined as daily episodes of apnea associated with bradycardia and cyanosis and receiving stimulation (MD 3.36, 95%B CI -0.07, 6.79) (Outcome 1.1). However, infants on an OWB compared to those receiving theophylline had a significant increase in daily episodes of apnea defined as apnea and bradycardia and cyanosis or receiving stimulation (MD 4.88, 95% CI 0.33, 9.43) (Outcome 1.2). Blinded polygraphic recordings also supported the finding of a significant benefit of theophylline as compared to the OWB in mean frequencies of apnea and bradycardia. Saigal also reported blinded polygraphic recordings of apnea &gt; 15 seconds and bradycardia &lt; 80 bpm. Saigal found baseline differences in rates of apnea between the two groups. Using analysis of co-variance to correct for these differences, Saigal reported a significantly lower incidence of both apnea &gt; 15 seconds and bradycardia &lt; 80 bpm in the theophylline group.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference in terms of sleep states, death, neurological abnormality, neurological abnormality or death, the Einstein Neurodevelopmental Scale at term corrected age, or the Bayley Mental Development Index at six or 12 months corrected age (Outcomes 1.3 - 1.9). A difference in psychomotor performance was found with infants on the OWB performing better at six months, but not 12 months corrected age (Outcome 1.10).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-14 21:52:24 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The single trial in this review suggests that theophylline is significantly better than the oscillating water bed (OWB) at reducing clinically significant apnea without important adverse effects in terms of sleep states, neurological abnormality and abnormal neurodevelopment. </P>
<P>Although a previous review has suggested a lack of effect of prophylactic kinesthetic stimulation at preventing apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-HendersonSmart-2005c" TYPE="REFERENCE">HendersonSmart 2005c</LINK>), this does not preclude a possible benefit of kinesthetic stimulation in the treatment of infants with established apnea of prematurity (<LINK REF="REF-Osborn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Osborn 2005</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results of this review should be treated with caution. Theophylline has been shown in one small study to be superior to kinesthetic stimulation at treating clinically important apnea of prematurity.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There are currently no clear research questions regarding the comparison of methylxanthines and kinesthetic stimulation to treat apnea of prematurity.</P>
