<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:55:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve which goes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. It causes tingling, numbness and pain, mostly in the hand. Treatment is controversial. This review aimed to compare surgical decompression with non-surgical treatments such as splinting or corticosteroid injections. Four trials were found and included, while three are awaiting assessment. The results suggest that surgical treatment is probably better than splinting but it is unclear whether it is better than steroid injection. Further research is needed for those with mild symptoms.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-13 10:29:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>In this update we found four randomised controlled trials involving 317 participants in total. Three of them including 295 participants, 148 allocated to surgery and 147 to non-surgical treatment reported information on our primary outcome (improvement at three months of follow-up). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). Two trials including 245 participants described outcome at six month follow-up, also favouring surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39).</P>
<P>Two trials reported clinical improvement at one year follow-up. They included 198 patients favouring surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53). The only trial describing changes in neurophysiological parameters in both groups also favoured surgery (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97). Two trials described need for surgery during follow-up, including 198 patients. The pooled estimate for this outcome indicates that a significant proportion of people treated medically will require surgery while the risk of re-operation in surgically treated people is low (RR 0.04 favouring surgery, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.17). Complications of surgery and medical treatment were described by two trials with 226 participants. Although the incidence of complications was high in both groups, they were significantly more common in the surgical arm (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome relieves symptoms significantly better than splinting. Further research is needed to discover whether this conclusion applies to people with mild symptoms and whether surgical treatment is better than steroid injection.<BR/>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-13 12:05:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:35:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the clinical condition resulting from entrapment of the median nerve where it passes under the transverse carpal ligament in the wrist. This region is a closed space within which pressure may rise. Thickening of tendon sheaths or encroachment by other structures leads to a sustained rise in pressure within the canal. This pressure is further increased by flexion or extension of the wrist (<LINK REF="REF-Dawson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 1999</LINK>). Carpal tunnel syndrome has been accepted as the most common entrapment neuropathy (<LINK REF="REF-Stewart-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stewart 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Martyn-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martyn 1997</LINK>). Cross-sectional studies in the Netherlands suggest a prevalence of 9.2% in the female and 0.6% in the male population (<LINK REF="REF-de-Krom-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Krom 1992</LINK>). It has an important economic impact, affecting active people and may occur as a work-related disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Rossignol-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rossignol 1997</LINK>) leading to compensation claims (<LINK REF="REF-Leigh-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leigh 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The most common symptoms are tingling, numbness and pain within the median nerve distribution (particularly the thumb, index and middle fingers) worsening at night. Pain may radiate proximally to the forearm or shoulder. On examination, there may be weakness and atrophy of the thenar muscles associated with sensory loss in the affected fingers.</P>
<P>In spite of the public health importance of CTS, there are no universally accepted diagnostic clinical and laboratory criteria. However, it is agreed that certain electrophysiological abnormalities support the diagnosis. The most frequently used parameters are distal motor and sensory latencies as well as the sensory conduction velocity across the carpal tunnel (<LINK REF="REF-Stevens-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stevens 1997</LINK>). Other techniques such as a comparison between the distal sensory or motor latencies stimulating the ulnar and median nerve (<LINK REF="REF-Felsenthal-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Felsenthal 1977</LINK>) or the radial and median nerves (<LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1987</LINK>) have been used. The 'inching technique' (<LINK REF="REF-Kimura-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kimura 1979</LINK>) allows a precise localisation of the site of entrapment, but its clinical relevance is under debate (<LINK REF="REF-Geiringer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Geiringer 1998</LINK>). There is no universally accepted therapy for CTS (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenbaum-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenbaum 1993</LINK>) although clinical guidelines have been suggested (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>). For symptomatic patients a range of treatment is offered varying widely around the world, within individual countries, and even hospitals. Most patients are treated non surgically (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>This is an update of a systematic review aiming at discovering whether the evidence supports the assumed therapeutic benefit of surgery over non-surgical treatment. Due to the lack of agreement regarding the criteria for diagnosis of CTS, all studies of symptomatic patients including a control group were to be considered regardless of the diagnostic criteria applied. Subgroup analysis of those trials using the American Academy of Neurology practice parameter for the diagnosis of CTS (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>) were to be performed if data had been available. Non-surgical therapies such as wrist splints, modification of activities, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics and steroid injection into the carpal tunnel (<LINK REF="REF-AAN-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAN 1993</LINK>), were to be considered as valid comparisons with the surgical group. Because there is no universally accepted surgical technique for the treatment of this condition, all procedures such as open or endoscopic section of transverse carpal ligament, with or without neurolysis were to be included. The comparison of the therapeutic effect of different surgical techniques is the subject of a parallel systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Scholten-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Scholten 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>A search was conducted to identify new trials not included previously, to update this review. The abstracts were read by two authors independently (RS and RV). Any disagreement about inclusion of a study would have been discussed with a third author (JGC) and a consensus reached. Data were extracted independently by three authors (RV, RS and JGC) using a structured sheet. Any disagreement would have been discussed by the complete group of authors to reach a consensus. Statistical analysis was performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Both proportional and absolute risk reductions were calculated for each outcome. Heterogeneity between trial results was tested with a standard Chi squared test. The main analysis was based on consideration of all included trials. Trials with good allocation concealment would also have been analysed separately (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). We also planned a priori sensitivity analyses based on:</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>We found four randomised controlled trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>). One of them (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) included 22 women diagnosed with CTS based on clinical evaluation and distal motor latency of the median nerve greater than 4.5 milliseconds, although the distance between distal stimulating and recording sites was not given. Participants were allocated to one of two groups by a secretary, using 'a previously prepared random list'. One group had open section of the anterior carpal ligament; the other had splinting 'of the hand, wrist and arm for one month'. Eleven participants were allocated to each arm. One participant allocated to the surgical arm refused surgery, but was included by us in the originally allocated group. The other 11 participants underwent splinting. Both groups of participants 'were reviewed clinically and electromyographically at regular intervals for up to one year,' and outcomes were given for the end of this period of follow-up. Another study (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) included 143 women and 33 men out of 326 participants examined for eligibility. The diagnosis of CTS was based on clinical evaluation and electrophysiological findings (decreased sensory conduction velocity in the median nerve or an increased median-ulnar distal sensory latency difference). Participants were allocated to overnight splinting of the wrist for at least six weeks, or open surgical release of the carpal tunnel ligament, using a block randomisation method stratified by centre. The sequence was generated using random number tables. Eighty-seven participants were allocated to surgery and 89 to splinting. Fourteen participants allocated to surgery and 13 participants allocated to splinting did not receive the treatment as assigned. Both groups of participants were evaluated by a physiotherapist at baseline and at three, six and twelve months after randomisation. Clinical improvement was evaluated using a six-point ordinal scale. Two further primary outcomes were considered: number of nights that the participant awoke due to the symptoms during the past week and the severity of the main complaint. A third study (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) included 93 women and 8 men. This study considered wrists, rather than patients, as the unit of randomisation. Patients with bilateral CTS were included, undergoing separate randomisation for each wrist. They thus report that 163 out of 217 "wrists" eligible for randomisation, were included. In the published paper they report a subgroup analysis of outcome in 69 patients with either unilateral CTS or in the most symptomatic wrist in patients with bilateral CTS. These are the patients included in our statistical analysis. Patients were 18 years old or older. Inclusion criteria were symptoms of CTS of at least three months, unresponsive to a course of at least two weeks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and splinting. They were enrolled only if clinical and electrophysiological features of CTS were present (distal motor latency in the median nerve above 4.2 msec or a decrease in the sensory conduction velocity at the carpal tunnel below 44 m/sec.). Patients were allocated to open surgery or steroid injection beneath the transverse carpal ligament from the ulnar side of the wrist. For the subgroup of patients included in our meta-analysis, the authors reported a 70% improvement in nocturnal paraesthesias at three, six and twelve months. They reported that "results for 20% and 50% improvement in the three domains were similar". The fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) included 48 women and 2 men out of 63 patients examined for eligibility. Patients with newly diagnosed CTS of more than three months but less than one year of duration were enrolled if clinical and electrophysiological features of CTS were present. The electrophysiological criteria were: median-ulnar palmar sensory latency difference greater than 0.5 msec. or distal motor latency (DML) greater than 4.0 msec. Severe CTS with thenar atrophy or unobtainable DML were excluded. Patients were randomly allocated by a computer-generated code to surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel (by one experienced neurosurgeon), under local anaesthesia or steroid injection. The primary outcome considered was improvement in symptoms as measured by the global symptom score (GSS) 20 weeks after intervention. GSS rates symptoms on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (severe) in five categories: pain, numbness, paraesthesia, weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>). They considered as secondary outcomes, electrophysiological measures (DML and sensory nerve conduction velocity) and grip strength measurements using a dynamometer. </P>

<P>The four included studies stated that participants were allocated randomly, although in one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) it is not clear how the randomisation sequence was generated, or if it was properly concealed. The fact that the 22 participants turned out to be distributed in even sets of eleven, raises doubts about the quality of the randomisation and allocation concealment but we do not have evidence to support this suspicion. No losses to follow-up were reported. The other three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) had adequate allocation concealment since the allocated treatment was included in a coded and sealed opaque envelope. In the surgical arm of one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) there were nine participants (10.3 %) not included in the analysis at three months of follow-up and 14 (16 %) at one year. In the non-surgical arm three participants (3.3 %) were not included in the analysis at three months and six (6.6%) at twelve months. In the third study (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) there were no losses to follow-up at three months, which is the time of our primary outcome, while they reported in the surgical group one "wrist" loss at six months and four additional "wrists" at twelve months of follow-up. In the injection wrist group they reported two "wrists" lost to follow-up at twelve months. The authors of the fourth study (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported no losses to follow up.</P>
<P>Two of the four studies were not blinded (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>). Two of them (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) attempted to hide the scar from the evaluators with a plaster.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary outcome</HEADING>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) considered relevant clinical improvement after three months. In one of them (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) treatment success was defined as completely recovered or much improved using the ordinal scale mentioned above. Out of 87 participants allocated to surgery, 62 (71%) were in these categories at three months. Out of 89 participants allocated to splinting, 46 (51.6%) qualified for treatment success. The confidence interval favoured the surgical group (relative risk (RR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.75). In the second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>), out of 33 patients allocated to injection, 29 (87.9%) had 70% improvement in nocturnal paraesthesiae while out of 36 patients allocated to surgery 21 (58.3%) obtained the same result, at three months (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.90). A third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported clinical improvement publishing averages at baseline, 6 and 20 weeks after intervention. At 20 weeks they published an improvement in the GSS from 25.2 to 16.6 in the injection group, and from 28.6 to 4.3 in the surgical group. The corresponding author sent us the raw data showing that in the injection group 11 out 25 patients improved by at least 50% in the GSS while in the surgical group 24 out of 25 improved by 50% or more at 20 weeks (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.42). The meta-analysis gave a pooled estimate of RR 1.23, CI 1.04 to 1.46 favouring surgery (see Analysis 01.01).</P>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) also considered clinical improvement at six months. In the first (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) seventy-two participants (82.7%) from the surgical group showed significant clinical improvement while 57 participants (64%) in the non-surgical group did so. The CI favoured the surgical group (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.55). In the second (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) 24 patients (72.7%) in the injection group and 25 (69.4%) in the surgical group achieved a 70% response in nocturnal paraesthesiae (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.29). The pooled estimate from all three trials was RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.39, again favouring surgery (see Analysis 01.02).</P>

<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) all the patients operated upon in the trial were completely relieved of symptoms for at least one year,' while only two participants allocated to the non-surgical group 'were relieved temporarily'. Although for these two participants an exact time period was not given, we considered them as being relieved of symptoms for at least one year. The result favoured the surgical group (RR 5.00, 95% CI 1.41 to 17.76). The other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) reported significant improvement at one year in 67 out of 87 patients (77%) in the surgical group, and 60 out of 89 (67.4%) in the non-surgical group, favouring surgery (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37). The pooled estimate favoured surgery (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53) (see Analysis 02.01). A third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) reported a non significant difference favouring surgery, in nocturnal paraesthesiae, at 12-month follow-up (63.6% of wrists in the injection group and 69.4% in the surgery group achieved a 70% response).</P>

<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported improvement in grip strength at 20-week as measured by a trained occupational therapist using a JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer. The results favoured the non-surgical group without reaching statistical significance (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.15) (see Analysis 02.02).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Improvement of neurophysiological parameters</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) described complete reversal of the neurophysiological abnormalities in all operated participants but this outcome was not described in the non-operated participants, preventing the comparison between the two groups. A second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) reported improvement in distal sensory latency in the median nerve, median-ulnar distal sensory latency difference, and distal motor latency in the distal nerve in both treatments groups. However, only average figures were given, preventing us from calculating the differences in risks between both groups. A third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported improvement in DML and sensory nerve conduction after both interventions greater in the surgical group. In the surgical group 23 out of 25 patients showed improvement in amplitude of sensory potential while 16 out of 25 in the injection group did so (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.97) (see Analysis 02.06).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(4) Need for surgery during follow-up in participants treated medically or secondary surgery in those treated surgically</HEADING>
<P>In one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) among the 11 participants treated medically, eight underwent surgery during follow-up. Apparently no operated participant required re-operation, although no information was given regarding secondary surgeries. The result favoured the surgical group (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.91). In other series (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) one out of 87 participants in the surgical group underwent re-operation and 35 out of 89 participants in the splinting group underwent surgery (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.21). The pooled estimate indicated that a significant proportion of medically treated people required surgery while the risk of re-operation in the surgically treated people is low: RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.17 (see Analysis 02.03). The other two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) did not report need for surgery in the injection group or need for a second surgery in the surgical group.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(5) Clinical improvement at less than three months of follow-up</HEADING>
<P>One trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) reported relevant clinical improvement at one month of follow-up. Twenty-three out of 87 participants (26.4%) assigned to undergo surgery, and 37 out of 89 participants in the non-surgical group (41.5%) showed significant improvement. This outcome favoured non-surgical treatment (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98) (see Analysis 02.04).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(6) Complications of surgery and medical treatment</HEADING>
<P>Secondary outcomes (5) and (6), as stated in the methods, were merged for the purpose of this analysis. One of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) reported adverse effects during the follow-up period. Adverse effects include painful or hypertrophic scar; wound haematoma and infection; stiffness, swelling or discomfort of the wrist and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Fifty-eight out of 87 participants (56.6%) allocated to surgery and 46 out of 89 participants (51.7%) in the non-surgical group had at least one adverse effect. The authors did not describe major complications such as damage to a nerve and a significant proportion of complications in the group assigned to splinting were attributed to surgery needed during the follow-up. Another series (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported no major surgical complications; there were two wound haematomas and nine cases of mild to moderate wound pain in the surgical group while in the injection group there were one case of cellulitis and four cases of pain at the injection site. The pooled results favoured non-surgical treatment (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76) (see Analysis 02.05).</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 11:41:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>In this update, we included four randomised controlled trials comparing surgical and non-surgical therapies in people diagnosed as suffering carpal tunnel syndrome. These trials indicate that there is a better response from people undergoing surgical treatment compared with splinting (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) but it is unclear whether there is a better response from surgical treatment compared with steroid injection (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>). The difference is statistically significant. Detection bias could not be ruled out because of the lack of blinding of the outcome assessment in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) while the other two (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) attempted to hide the scar with a plaster. In one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) it is not clear if selection bias was avoided due to the lack of information about the randomisation procedure. Apparently there was a high level of heterogeneity among the participants admitted to this trial, judging from the period of time of symptoms, ranging from one month to twenty years. As there is no information on the baseline clinical and electrophysiological status of the two groups, we cannot be sure that the risk of both groups was similar in this trial. The other three trials had adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>). Significant improvement after three months, defined as the primary outcome in this review, was reported by three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) favouring surgery with a RR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.46). However, significant statistical heterogeneity exists among the included trials (test for heterogeneity Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>= 22.96, df = 2 p &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 91.3%), that may be explained by clinical diversity among trials. Two of these trials favoured surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) and one favoured steroid injection (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>). A possible cause for the heterogeneity is the fact that in the trial that reported a better outcome for non surgical treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>), only the subgroup with unilateral STC was included in our analysis. Furthermore this trial considered as inclusion criteria non-respondent patients to medical treatment including splinting. In these trials the participants allocated to surgical and non-surgical groups showed no significant differences in relevant features.</P>
<P>The pooled number of participants included in these trials was adequate to detect differences in improvements between both arms. At the time of collecting data for the primary outcome analysis the losses were 6.08% (9 out of 148 participants) in the surgical group and 2.04% (3 out of 147 participants) in the non-surgical group. A sensitivity analysis assuming that all participants lost to follow-up in the surgical group did not improve and all participants lost in the splinting group improved, did not change the significance of the primary outcome analysis, although the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the RR was 1.01. Both treatment groups had a good success rate in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) although it should be noted that a large number of patients allocated to splinting in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) underwent surgery during follow-up and the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>) did not report need for surgery during follow up in the injection group. A third trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) reported good recovery rate in the surgical group but only 44% of patients improving with steroid injection. Even though a subgroup analysis was not specified for different non-surgical treatments, it should be noted that when surgery is compared with steroid injection, the combined results do not clearly favour one intervention over the other, at least for a short-term outcome such as three months symptomatic response.</P>
<P>Only two trials reported adverse effects during the follow up period (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hui-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Hui 2005</LINK>) and these were common in both groups, although a significant number of adverse events reported in the non-surgical group was caused by surgery during follow-up. This pooled estimate was based on the intention-to-treat analysis which was confounded by the fact that many participants in the non surgical group had received surgery before the one year follow-up visit. Most adverse effects in the non surgical group were reported by one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>). The frequency of adverse events must be considered by the treating physician when advising on the choice of surgical or non-surgical therapies.</P>
<P>There is insufficient information in the paper reporting better outcome in the splinting group at one month of follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) to draw any meaningful conclusion. The results after one year of follow-up could be analysed including only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>). Both of them suggest that choosing surgery improves the chance of a good outcome. One of them (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) shows a statistically significant improvement while the other does not (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>). The pooled results show an overall better outcome for surgery by about 14%, but it should be noted that the statistical heterogeneity between trials is significant. This heterogeneity may be explained by the clinical and methodological diversity existing among trials. The inclusion of more severely affected patients may explain the better results in the surgical group in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>). In the earlier trial (<LINK REF="STD-Garland-1964" TYPE="STUDY">Garland 1964</LINK>) the neurophysiological criterion used was a distal motor latency of the median nerve greater than 4.5 msecs, while in the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>) electrophysiological criteria included decreased sensory conduction velocity in the median nerve or an increase median to ulnar sensory latency. These different criteria might have resulted in the inclusion of patients with a lesser degree of severity in the Gerritsen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>). A further possible reason for the significant heterogeneity between the trials may reside in the high proportion of patients allocated to splinting that ended up undergoing surgery within one year of follow-up in one of the trials (<LINK REF="STD-Gerritsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gerritsen 2002</LINK>). Furthermore, the trial whose outcomes at one year were not included in the analysis due to the way in which the results were presented (<LINK REF="STD-Ly-Pen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ly Pen 2005</LINK>), reported no significant difference between surgical and non-surgical treatments at one year of follow up.</P>
<P>Although the better results in the surgical group are statistically significant, the lower limit of the CI is close to the non significant threshold. The high incidence of adverse events indicates the need to identify subgroups of participants who would be most likely to benefit from surgery. Therefore there is still a need for well designed clinical trials addressing the question of the efficacy of surgery in CTS. These studies should consider age, occupation, duration of symptoms and severity of the entrapment, among others, as criteria to identify subgroups in advance.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Surgical treatment seems to be better than non-surgical treatment for relieving symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. The superiority of surgery over splinting seems evident, but this not so clear with steroid injection. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a need for further research to assess the effect of operation on functional outcome and in subgroups such as those with mild symptoms. Further studies are also necessary comparing surgery with steroid injection. </P>
