<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Current treatments for destructive periodontal (gum) disease are not able to restore damaged bone and connective tissue support for teeth. There are therefore limitations in treating patients with advanced disease. The surgical technique, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) may be able to achieve regeneration and therefore improve upon conventional surgical results. The results of this review have shown some advantage to using GTR in infra-bony defects but with wide variations in the benefits achievable compared with conventional surgery. We were unable to identify conclusively factors responsible for this variability. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Adverse effects of treatment were generally minor and similar between groups although with an increased treatment time for GTR. We recommend further research to address the issue of variability and to identify which characteristics of the disease or the patient are more clearly associated with a beneficial outcome.<B>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Conventional treatment of destructive periodontal (gum) disease arrests the disease but does not usually regain the bone support or connective tissue lost in the disease process. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is a surgical procedure that specifically aims to regenerate the periodontal tissues when the disease is advanced and could overcome some of the limitations of conventional therapy. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the efficacy of GTR in the treatment of periodontal infra-bony defects measured against conventional surgery (open flap debridement (OFD)) and factors affecting outcomes.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We conducted an electronic search of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to April 2004. Handsearching included <I>Journal of Periodontology, Journal of Clinical Periodontology, Journal of Periodontal Research </I>and bibliographies of all relevant papers and review articles up to April 2004. In addition, we contacted experts/groups/companies involved in surgical research to find other trials or unpublished material or to clarify ambiguous or missing data and posted requests for data on two periodontal electronic discussion groups.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 months duration comparing guided tissue regeneration (with or without graft materials) with open flap debridement for the treatment of periodontal infra-bony defects. Furcation involvements and studies specifically treating aggressive periodontitis were excluded. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:38:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Screening of possible studies and data extraction was conducted independently. The methodological quality of studies was assessed in duplicate using individual components and agreement determined by Kappa scores. Methodological quality was used in sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the conclusions. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed and the results expressed as mean differences (MD and 95% CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR and 95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes calculated using random-effects models. Any heterogeneity was investigated. The primary outcome measure was change in clinical attachment.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:40:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search produced 626 titles, of these 596 were clearly not relevant to the review. The full text of 32 studies of possible relevance was obtained and 15 studies were excluded. Therefore 17 RCTs were included in this review, 16 studies testing GTR alone and two testing GTR + bone substitutes (one study had both test treatment arms).</P>
<P>No tooth loss was reported in any study although these data are incomplete where patient follow up was not complete. For attachment level change, the mean difference between GTR and OFD was 1.22 mm (95% CI Random Effects: 0.80 to 1.64, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 69.1 (df = 15), P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%) and for GTR + bone substitutes was 1.25 mm (95% CI 0.89 to 1.61, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.01 (df = 1), P = 0.91). GTR showed a significant benefit when comparing the numbers of sites failing to gain 2 mm attachment with risk ratio 0.54 (95% CI Random Effects: 0.31 to 0.96, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 8.9 (df = 5), P = 0.11). The number needed to treat (NNT) for GTR to achieve one extra site gaining 2 mm or more attachment over open flap debridement was therefore 8 (95% CI 5 to 33), based on an incidence of 28% of sites in the control group failing to gain 2 mm or more of attachment. For baseline incidences in the range of the control groups of 3% and 55% the NNTs are 71 and 4.</P>
<P>Probing depth reduction was greater for GTR than OFD: 1.21 mm (95% CI 0.53 to 1.88, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 62.9 (df = 10), P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 84%) or GTR + bone substitutes, weighted mean difference 1.24 mm (95% CI 0.89 to 1.59, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.03 (df = 1), P = 0.85).</P>
<P>For gingival recession, a statistically significant difference between GTR and open flap debridement controls was evident (mean difference 0.26 mm (95% CI Random Effects: 0.08, 0.43, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 2.7 (df = 8), P = 0.95), with a greater change in recession from baseline for the control group.</P>
<P>Regarding hard tissue probing at surgical re-entry, a statistically significant greater gain was found for GTR compared with open flap debridement. This amounted to a weighted mean difference of 1.39 mm (95% CI 1.08 to 1.71, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.85 (df = 2), P = 0.65). For GTR + bone substitutes the difference was greater, with mean difference 3.37 mm (95% CI 3.14 to 3.61).</P>
<P>Adverse effects were generally minor although with an increased treatment time for GTR. Exposure of the barrier membrane was frequently reported with a lack of evidence of an effect on healing.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>GTR has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. </P>
<P>There is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. Types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. Open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Chronic periodontitis</HEADING>
<P>Chronic periodontitis (CP) is a destructive gum condition, which is estimated to affect 10 to 30% of the world-wide population (<LINK REF="REF-Baelum-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baelum 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-L_x00f6_e-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Löe 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Oliver-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oliver 1991</LINK>). CP is caused by the bacteria within dental plaque, stimulating inflammation within the periodontal tissues. In the susceptible individual, the result will be a breakdown of both the connective tissues which attach to the tooth and the supporting bone around the root. This usually results in the formation of a periodontal pocket around the root which acts as a reservoir for bacteria. The morbidity of this condition can be underestimated and may include an uncomfortable loosening of the teeth (which may impair eating), cosmetic problems (as teeth drift or gums recede), a tendency to abscess formation within the pocket and eventual tooth loss.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Treatment of periodontitis</HEADING>
<P>The objectives for treating periodontitis are mainly concerned with stabilising or arresting the condition and the crucial role of the patient's home care plaque control is well recognised (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhe-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhe 1975</LINK>). The debridement of bacterial deposits coating the surface of the root, deep within the periodontal pocket is also essential and is achieved in the first instance, by scaling techniques. In addition, periodontal surgery is used where the depth of the deposits within the pocket, prevents adequate access for debridement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The infra-bony defect and its treatment</HEADING>
<P>Often, the bony destruction in periodontitis forms a crater-like defect around the root and this is called an infra-bony defect when the base of the periodontal pocket projects into and is surrounded by the jaw bone. Infra-bony defects present major challenges to periodontal treatment. Following treatment, healing occurs by repair but without the formation of new supporting tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Caton-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caton 1976</LINK>). In addition, residual periodontal pockets may remain after treatment of deep defects and are a risk factor for further deterioration (<LINK REF="REF-Claffey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Claffey 1990</LINK>). A particular concern for many patients is that conventional surgery tends to increase gum recession, which can cause cosmetic problems.</P>
<P>In an attempt to overcome some of these limitations, surgical techniques have been developed to regenerate the tissues lost in the disease process. The most documented of these is guided tissue regeneration (GTR) and case reports have shown healing with the formation of new attachment (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1996</LINK>). In this procedure, a biocompatible barrier membrane (either resorbable or non-resorbable) is surgically implanted to cover and protect the bone defect. If non-resorbable, the barrier is surgically removed 4 to 6 weeks after implantation. Connective tissue and bone regeneration may then occur within the bone defect protected by the barrier.</P>
<P>The biological explanation for this procedure is the prevention of migration of the epithelial periodontal tissues into the crater, allowing time for bone and other attachment tissues to heal. During normal healing, it appears that the epithelial tissues migrate rapidly into the wound, preventing regeneration (<LINK REF="REF-Karring-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Karring 1993</LINK>). However understanding of this process is incomplete.</P>
<P>Although GTR is accepted into clinical practice, a systematic review of its effectiveness is important since the procedure is technically demanding and financially costly, in view of the expense of the barrier membranes (approximately US$100 to $300).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess the effect of GTR in the treatment of periodontal infra-bony defects measured against conventional access flap surgery (open flap debridement), with respect to clinical, radiographic and patient-centred outcomes.</P>

<P>A search of the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, EMBASE and MEDLINE was conducted up to and including April 2004. We used the strategy: "guided tissue regeneration" OR "guided-tissue-regeneration" OR "GTR" OR "periodontal regeneration" OR "periodontal-regeneration" OR "intra bony defect*" OR "intrabony defect*" OR "intra-bony defect*" OR "infra bony defect*" OR "infrabony defect*" OR "infra-bony defect*" OR "intra osseous" OR "intraosseous" OR "intra-osseous". For MEDLINE this also included the first two phases of the sensitive search strategy for randomised controlled trials of the Cochrane Oral Health group and was adapted for other databases. Handsearching included a complete search of <I>Journal of Periodontology, Journal of Clinical Periodontology</I> and <I>Journal of Periodontal Research </I>up to April 2004 and bibliographies of all relevant papers and review articles. In addition, for the original review we contacted experts/groups/companies involved in surgical research to find other trials or unpublished material or to clarify ambiguous or missing data and posted requests for data on two periodontal electronic discussion groups: International Association for Dental Research - Dental Faculty, Periodontal Research Group website (<A HREF="http://www.iadr-dentalfaculty.org/sigs/index.html">www.iadr-dentalfaculty.org/sigs/index.html</A>) and the Periodont electronic newsletter (periodont@spallek.com) up to September 2000.</P>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-13 15:44:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Titles and abstracts of the search results, were screened by two independent review authors (Richard Tucker (RT), Ian Needleman (IN)). The full text of all studies of possible relevance were obtained for independent assessment by three review authors (RT, IN and Elaine Giedrys-Leeper ( EGL)) against the stated inclusion criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion amongst the review authors and authors of the trials were contacted to provide missing data where possible. Data entry on to a computer was performed by two review authors (RT and Helen Worthington (HW)).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality (protection from bias)</HEADING>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using components shown to affect study outcomes (typically by exaggeration of treatment effect) including, allocation concealment (concealment of the randomisation code from those recruiting patients to avoid selection bias) and blinding of examiners and therapists (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Methodological quality was used in sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the conclusions but was not used to exclude studies qualifying for the review on the basis of their inclusion criteria. Agreement between investigators in the review for these components was checked using Kappa statistics.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data synthesis</HEADING>
<P>A weighted treatment effect was calculated and the results were expressed as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. The analysis for the continuous outcome variables was conducted using the generic inverse variance statistical method where the mean differences and standard errors are entered for all studies so that the parallel group studies and intra-individual (split-mouth) studies could be combined (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK>). Variance imputation methods were used to estimate appropriate variance estimates in some split-mouth studies, where the appropriate standard deviation of the differences was not included in study reports (<LINK REF="REF-Follmann-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Follmann 1992</LINK>). The primary outcome measure was gain in attachment. Random-effects models were used for analyses and the significance of discrepancies in the estimates of the treatment effects from the different trials were assessed by means of Cochran's test for heterogeneity. If any significant heterogeneity (P &lt; 0.1) was detected it was planned to investigate this. Publication bias was examined using both the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test and the Egger regression asymmetry test (<LINK REF="REF-Begg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Begg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Egger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Egger 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis was conducted for the eight parallel group and eight split-mouth studies for attachment change to see whether it is appropriate to combine these study designs in the meta-analysis. Only one of the five split-mouth studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 1998</LINK>) stated the standard deviation of the mean difference for two of the outcomes (change in attachment and change in probing depth). It was possible to calculate this for these two outcomes from the raw data in another split-mouth study (<LINK REF="STD-Chung-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1990</LINK>) and to estimate this from P-values in a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Mora-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1996</LINK>). The intra-patient correlations from these studies ranged from 0.14 to 0.43. An intra-patient correlation of 0.25 was used throughout this review to estimate the standard errors for the other five split-mouth studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Loos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pontoriero-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pontoriero 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pritlove_x002d_Carson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pritlove-Carson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratka_x002d_Kruger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratka-Kruger 2000</LINK>). Sensitivity analyses were conducted imputing standard errors for the intra-patient correlation of zero, which would provide a very conservative estimate of the standard error.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned to investigate the effects of factors thought to be most influential on periodontal outcomes including smoking status, barrier membrane type (resorbable versus non-resorbable) and surgical technique (conventional flap versus papilla preservation flap). A further sensitivity analysis examined periodontal outcomes with exclusion of studies providing more frequent post-operative maintenance than is practicable in clinical practice (defined as maintenance visits more frequent than every 3 months, commencing 3 months post-surgery).</P>

<P>A subgroup analysis was conducted for the eight parallel group and eight split-mouth studies for attachment change to see whether it is appropriate to combine these study designs in the meta-analysis (Subgroups 1.1.1 and 1.1.2).

The intra-patient correlations from these studies ranged from 0.14 to 0.43. An intra-patient correlation of 0.25 was used throughout this review to estimate the standard errors for the other five split-mouth studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Loos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pontoriero-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pontoriero 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pritlove_x002d_Carson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pritlove-Carson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratka_x002d_Kruger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratka-Kruger 2000</LINK>).

For GTR the weighted mean difference between test and control was 1.22 mm (95% CI Random Effects 0.80 to 1.64, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 69.1 (df = 15), P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 78%) There appeared to be a difference between the two subgroups based on the study design with the subgroup of split-mouth studies having a lower treatment effect 0.79 mm (95% CI Random Effects 0.37 to 1.21, compared to that for the parallel group studies 1.71 mm (95% CI Random Effects 1.02 to 2.40). This difference was statistically significant (metaregression slope coefficient -0.91, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.11, P = 0.026). The sensitivity analysis imputing an intra-patient correlation of zero only made a small difference to the estimate for the split-mouth studies, with weighted mean difference 0.82 mm (95% CI Random Effects 0.40 to 1.24).</P>
<P>There were two studies for GTR + bone substitutes (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998</LINK>) and the weighted mean difference for these two studies was 1.25 mm (95% CI 0.89 to 1.61, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.01 (df = 1), P = 0.91), similar to the overall result for GTR alone.</P>
<P>From an additional (post-hoc) analysis for GTR, in six parallel group studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tonetti 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchelli 2002</LINK>) it was possible to extract data for number of sites gaining less than 2 mm of attachment. This again showed a significant benefit for GTR, risk ratio 0.54 (95% CI Random Effects 0.31 to 0.96, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 8.91 (df = 5), P = 0.11) (Comparison 1, Outcome 1.2). The number needed to treat (NNT) for GTR to achieve one extra site gaining 2 mm or more attachment over open flap debridement was therefore 8 (95% CI 5 to 33), based on an incidence of 28% of sites in the control group failing to gain 2 mm or more of attachment. For baseline incidences in the range of the control groups of 3% and 55% the NNTs are 71 and 4. It should be noted that the calculation of NNT values based on arbitrary cut-thresholds derived from continuous data may not be appropriate. We are currently examining this phenomenon.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Sensitivity analysis</HEADING>
<P>In order to investigate the robustness of the results with respect to very frequent maintenance that may be impractical to provide in many clinics (&lt; 3 monthly after the first 3 months post-surgery), we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding seven studies with very frequent follow up (included studies: <LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Loos 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pritlove_x002d_Carson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Pritlove-Carson 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Silvestri-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Silvestri 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ratka_x002d_Kruger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratka-Kruger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tonetti 1998</LINK>. This showed a small reduction of the weighted mean difference to 0.95 mm (95% CI Random Effects 0.4960 to 1.40) which was not significant (metaregression slope coefficient -0.62 (se = 0.43), P = 0.15) (<LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis was also conducted comparing the six studies with papilla preservation with the 10 studies where the papilla was not fully preserved. Although a higher attachment change was found for papilla preservation this subgroup analysis was not statistically significant (P = 0.09, <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). Comparison of studies using an absorbable versus non-absorbable membrane type also gave rise to a non-significant difference between the subgroups (P = 0.11; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses for attachment level change which excluded poorer quality studies resulted in reduced numbers of incorporated studies although heterogeneity remained statistically significant (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). When studies without surgeon blinding were excluded, the summary estimate was similar and heterogeneity was still significant. When studies without both surgeon blinding and examiner blinding were excluded, the difference between GTR and OFD became non-statistically significant and with no significant heterogeneity (three studies: mean difference 0.41mm 95% CI -0.33 to 1.08, heterogeneity P = 0.11). Caution should be exercised here as the number of studies in these comparisons was also much lower which in itself could reduce heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis of parallel group and split-mouth studies reduced the heterogeneity, although there was still a great deal of unexplained heterogeneity. However as all the findings for each outcomes were in the same direction we felt it was appropriate to undertake the meta-analyses as shown.</P>

The standard errors for one split-mouth study was given in the report (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 1998</LINK>) and could be estimated for a further study (<LINK REF="STD-Mora-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1996</LINK>). The intra-patient correlations were 0.11 and 0.1224 and so a value of 0.1 was used to calculate the standard errors for the other split-mouth studies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted imputing standard errors for the intra-patient correlation of zero, which would provide a very conservative estimate of the standard error.</P>
<P>The results demonstrated a significantly greater probing depth reduction for GTR, mean difference of 1.21 mm (95% CI 0.53 to 1.88, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 62.9 (df = 10), P &lt; 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 84%). Although the treatment effect for split mouth studies was lower, this was not statistically significant (metaregression slope coefficient -0.72, 95% CI -2.21 to 0.78, P = 0.35).</P>
<P>There were also two studies for GTR + bone substitutes (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998</LINK>) with weighted mean difference 1.24 mm (95% CI 0.89 to 1.59, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.03 (df = 1), P = 0.85) similar to that for the GTR alone.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gingival recession (Comparison 1, Outcome 1.4)</HEADING>
<P>Nine studies for GTR had gingival recession as an outcome, four with a parallel group design (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sculean-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sculean 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchelli 2002</LINK>) and five with a split-mouth design (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Loos-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Loos 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pontoriero-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pontoriero 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratka_x002d_Kruger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratka-Kruger 2000</LINK>) and for GTR + bone substitutes one study (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>). We were unable to estimate any of the intra-patient correlations and we decided to use a value of 0.25 for the split-mouth studies for this outcome. A statistically significant difference between GTR and open flap debridement controls was evident (weighted mean difference 0.26 mm (95% CI Random Effects 0.08 to 0.43, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 2.7 (df = 8), P = 0.95), with a greater change in recession from baseline for the control group.</P>
<P>The single study of GTR + bone substitutes showed slightly greater recession for test than controls, with mean difference -0.33 mm (95% CI -0.43 to -0.23).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bone change</HEADING>
<P>Radiographic data was contained in two studies. One used intra-oral radiographs and customised stents to aid reproducibility of radiographic geometry (<LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>). This showed 0.6 mm gain in bone from the base of the defect in both test and control groups. The other study reported using 'standardised radiographs' (<LINK REF="STD-Ratka_x002d_Kruger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ratka-Kruger 2000</LINK>). Descriptive data only were reported indicating 'only minute changes in bone structure were noticeable'. Regarding surgical re-entry, three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chung-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Chung 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mora-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Mora 1996</LINK>) reported data for GTR alone and one study for the combination of GTR + bone substitute (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>). For GTR, a statistically significant greater gain in hard tissue probing was found for GTR compared with open flap debridement. This amounted to a weighted mean difference of 1.39 mm (95% CI 1.08 to 1.71, Chi<SUP>2</SUP> for heterogeneity 0.85 (df = 2), P = 0.65). For GTR + bone substitutes the difference was greater, with a mean difference 3.37 mm (95% CI 3.14 to 3.61).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Adverse effects and patient-reported outcomes </HEADING>
<P>There were only limited data on these outcomes (<LINK REF="TBL-04" TYPE="TABLE">Table 4</LINK>). Healing was generally reported to be uneventful for both test and control groups. Exposure of the GTR barrier membrane was widely reported and ranged from 20% of sites treated with the non-resorbable titanium-reinforced material (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 1995</LINK>) to 68% for non-resorbable ePTFE barriers (<LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>). There seemed little difference on membrane exposure between the different materials, particularly comparing resorbable versus non-resorbable. The effect of membrane exposure was generally reported to be modest although such an event could result in the need for more rigorous maintenance (and therefore appointments) or the use of systemic antibiotics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Time for procedure</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>) measured time taken for the procedures. The average surgical time for GTR procedures was 98.8 minutes (SD 45.7) and for access flap surgery 74.9 minutes (SD 33.6) and this was highly statistically significant (P = 0.001).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Heterogeneity</HEADING>
<P>Sensitivity analyses for attachment level change which excluded poorer quality studies resulted in reduced numbers of incorporated studies although heterogeneity remained statistically significant (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>). Although subgroup analysis of parallel group and split-mouth studies reduced the heterogeneity there was still a great deal of unexplained heterogeneity, however as all the findings for each outcomes were going in the same direction we felt it was appropriate to undertake the meta-analyses as shown.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Prognostic factors</HEADING>
<P>The variability in reporting data on prognostic factors such as initial defect depth, plaque levels and smoking prevented a meaningful comparison. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>) presented a subgroup analysis comparing clinical changes in smokers and non-smokers. This showed reduced benefits in smokers for attachment gain (GTR group: non-smokers 1.9 mm SD 1.5, smokers 0.8 mm SD 0.8) although with little effect on probing depth change. However, this result should be viewed with some caution as the groups were not intentionally balanced with respect to disease levels.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Publication bias</HEADING>
<P>We tested publication bias using the Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test, which found no evidence of a correlation between the effect estimates and their variances, indicating no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.53). The results of the Egger regression asymmetry test also suggested no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.43).

<HEADING LEVEL="2">Guided tissue regeneration alone</HEADING>
<P>This systematic review has shown an overall mean increase in attachment gain for GTR over open flap debridement (mean difference 1.22 mm, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.64). However, this value may not be a valid estimate of effect since the difference between study outcomes (heterogeneity) is substantial and statistically significant. Therefore, the value should not be quoted to demonstrate the magnitude of difference between the two therapies. It should be noted that 11/16 trials produced a statistically significant greater gain in attachment with GTR than OFD and with no statistically significant publication bias (<I>see</I> below). Therefore, we suggest that the data indicate that GTR can produce a statistically significant greater gain in attachment however, the magnitude of this superiority is not clear.</P>
<P>Tooth loss values did not give evidence of a difference between studies. Since the studies were of no more than 12 months duration, such a finding is not surprising and may not be helpful in distinguishing between treatments. Progression of attachment loss may proceed at rates from 0.1 to 3mm per year (<LINK REF="REF-Cobb-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cobb 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhe 1989</LINK>). Therefore, multi-year studies are likely to be needed to evaluate tooth loss adequately.</P>
<P>The results of the 16 randomised controlled trials included in this review show a substantial variation in their results. The mean additional attachment gain from GTR over that achieved by open flap debridement surgery ranged between studies from 0.02 to 3.60 mm. This range is large and the differences are difficult to reconcile. We have attempted to explore some of the possible causes of this heterogeneity and these analyses should be viewed as exploratory observations. These investigations included analyses of protection from bias as well as factors affecting clinical heterogeneity.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Protection from bias</HEADING>
<P>Since study quality has been shown to have a direct impact on the size of the effect of treatment we explored this effect with sensitivity analyses including allocation concealment, examiner and therapist blinding. The results of these analyses were not consistent. For attachment gain, excluding studies without adequate concealment of the randomisation code or examiner blinding did not substantially affect the estimate or reduce heterogeneity.</P>
<P>However, when studies without both surgeon blinding and examiner blinding were excluded, the difference between GTR and OFD became non-statistically significant and with no significant heterogeneity (three studies: mean difference 0.41 mm 95% CI -0.33 to 1.08, heterogeneity P = 0.41). Caution should be exercised here as the number of studies in these comparisons was also much lower which in itself could reduce heterogeneity. However, the trend to a reduction of the magnitude of effect with greater protection from bias is in line with previous studies of the impact of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Juni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Juni 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moher-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). If further studies are to be conducted on GTR, it is critical that they employ greater methodological rigour and in particular in their protection against these biases.</P>
<P>Publication bias was investigated and found not to be statistically significant. Whilst these tests are conservative in their ability to demonstrate such bias, the number of studies included (16) should be adequate to identify publication bias if it was present. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no evidence of an effect of publication bias on the summary values.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical heterogeneity </HEADING>
<P>Available data allowed the investigation of several clinical aspects that we hypothesised, a priori, could affect heterogeneity. These included, frequency of supportive maintenance care (more than every 3 months versus 3-monthly after the first 3 months of healing), type of GTR barrier membrane (resorbable versus non-resorbable) and surgical technique (papilla preservation technique versus conventional approach). Random-effects metaregression analyses were conducted to compare each of these subgroups.</P>
<P>The hypothesis for excluding studies with frequent maintenance was based on the finding that frequency of maintenance care can affect periodontal surgical results (<LINK REF="REF-Westfelt-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Westfelt 1983</LINK>). However, the analysis for this review showed neither a statistically significant effect on the summary estimate nor an elimination of heterogeneity (P = 0.15). Membrane type might be important. The difference between GTR and OFD for attachment gain was greater for non-absorbable barriers than absorbable barriers. However this difference was not statistically significant by metaregression (P = 0.11).</P>
<P>Surgical techniques aiming to retain the interdental soft tissue have been proposed with the potential to achieve and maintain primary closure during wound healing. It has been suggested that such methods could therefore produce greater clinical improvements (<LINK REF="REF-Cortellini-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortellini 1999</LINK>). The meta-analysis for the six studies with papilla preservation did not show a statistically significant difference compared with the overall estimate despite the apparent greater attachment gain (0.75 mm, 95% CI -0.10 to 1.59, P = 0.09) and therefore the heterogeneity remained highly statistically significant. However, the 95% confidence interval only just includes a value of no difference suggesting that papilla preservation might be important and should be examined in future studies.</P>
<P>Another explanation for the heterogeneity might be variability between studies in prognostic factors that have been documented to affect the outcome of regenerative surgery. These include; plaque levels, cigarette smoking and defect severity as expressed by baseline probing depth, attachment level and bone defect depth at baseline. Regarding plaque and smoking, it is apparent that differences in the way that both factors are reported between studies prevent sensible comparison. For instance, some studies present full mouth plaque scores, others measure plaque at the experimental sites only and other studies present plaque index values or no plaque data. The effect of smoking on reducing the gain in attachment following surgery is reported in only one subgroup analysis of an RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Mayfield-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mayfield 1998</LINK>). This result highlights the need for more research into prognostic factors to help explain heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Therefore, the extent to which we have been successful in explaining the troubling extent of the heterogeneity has been limited. It should be noted however, that heterogeneity existed not only between studies but also within them. In two large multicentre trials (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tonetti-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Tonetti 1998</LINK>) the results between centres within each study showed a substantial variability (from best to worst) in attachment gain of between 1.73 mm and 2.1 mm respectively. Therefore, although efficacy of GTR has been demonstrated in some studies, the effectiveness and generalisability of such a technique has not been demonstrated.</P>
<P>Variability of results is clearly an important issue when considering the relevance of a treatment to clinical practice. Although we have explored some of the possible causes of heterogeneity in this systematic review, we have been unable to determine definitively what factors account for this. The number and characteristics of studies currently available is insufficient to answer this clinically relevant problem.</P>
<P>In terms of clinical significance, mean difference values are difficult to interpret. However, the risk ratio for sites gaining less than 2 mm attachment demonstrated that sites treated with GTR were 38% less likely to fail to attain a gain of 2 mm of attachment or more than those treated by open flap debridement (risk ratio 0.54 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.96). There was no significant heterogeneity between the studies. The number needed to treat (NNT) for GTR to achieve one extra site gaining 2 mm or more attachment over open flap debridement was 8 (95% CI 5 to 33) i.e. 8 patients need to be treated for one to achieve this benefit over OFD. This is unchanged from the original review despite the inclusion of data from two further studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zucchelli-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Zucchelli 2002</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>Other clinical outcomes indicate statistically greater improvements with GTR compared with OFD. As with attachment level gain, heterogeneity with probing depth hampers a conclusion of the size of this improvement. The analysis of recession indicated more recession following the use of OFD compared with GTR and with no heterogeneity (0.26 mm, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.43, heterogeneity P = 0.96, n = 9). The result for gingival recession is interesting since although 7 of the 9 studies produced more recession with OFD, this difference was statistically significant in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Pontoriero-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pontoriero 1999</LINK>). However, the greater precision that is achievable when multiple studies are combined with meta-analysis means that overall, statistically significantly more recession can be shown to occur following OFD.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse effects and patient-reported outcomes</HEADING>
<P>Adverse effects were generally minor and similar between GTR and access flap surgery. Membrane exposure was a common finding and represents the main difference in postoperative healing between groups. Whilst membrane exposure has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Selvig-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Selvig 1992</LINK>) one study in this series of trials did not find a negative effect on clinical attachment level (<LINK REF="STD-Cortellini-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cortellini 2001</LINK>). A further possible implication with membrane exposure is an increase in need for professional plaque removal visits or the provision of systemic antibiotics as reported in these studies, either for prevention or treatment of infection around the membrane. However, there is no clear evidence of how such a situation is best managed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Effect of study design</HEADING>
<P>This analysis has demonstrated a statistically significant difference between parallel group and split-mouth studies with respect to attachment level change. Split-mouth studies produced a more conservative estimate of attachment level gain. Whilst there remained statistically significant heterogeneity in both subgroups, the difference between split-mouth and parallel group was statistically significant by metaregression. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a difference has been demonstrated and underlines the importance of analysing by study design. The reasons leading to smaller differences between two interventions can only be speculated upon. This might be a chance finding as a result of producing two subgroups of studies. Possibly, protection from bias could be more straightforward in split-mouth studies. For instance, selection bias might be at less risk as the patient provides both experimental groups. Furthermore, split-mouth studies might facilitate the maintenance of masking for patient, examiner and therapist if the patient provides both groups. Alternatively it may be possible that there is some cross-over benefit, either local or systemic as has been previously suggested, and this effect could reduce the difference in outcome between interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Hujoel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hujoel 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">GTR plus bone grafts</HEADING>
<P>Only two studies could be located examining the combination of GTR and bone grafts versus open flap debridement in a randomised, 12 month design (<LINK REF="STD-Blumenthal-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Blumenthal 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kim-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Kim 1998</LINK>). The effects of the combination treatment were similar to GTR alone for attachment gain, but with slightly more probing depth reduction (1.2 mm), greater gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery (3.4 mm) in one study and a gain in gingival recession in a further study.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Reporting quality</HEADING>
<P>We found that many study reports were incomplete in their presentation of methods or results. We contacted 19 authors to clarify missing or ambiguous data. However, we would recommend that authors of RCTs follow the CONSORT statement (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org">www.consort-statement.org</A>) which provide clear guidance on presentation of trial reports and would help systematic reviewing of the literature.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Statistical methods</HEADING>
<P>This review considered parallel group and split-mouth studies. In theory the combining of the treatment effects from these studies should be straightforward, however, due to the poor reporting of the data from the split-mouth studies, the standard deviation of the difference had to be estimated. This was achieved by using the results of the split-mouth studies that presented the necessary data to calculate the intra-patient correlation for the other split-mouth studies. Sensitivity analyses were carried out imputing different values for the intra-patient correlation and the results of these were very similar to the results presented in this review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Comparison with previous thorough reviews and meta-analyses</HEADING>
<P>Two recent meta-analyses have reported greater benefits to GTR than found in the present systematic review. One review indicated a difference in attachment gain between GTR and open flap debridement of 2.7 mm (<LINK REF="REF-Laurell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurell 1998</LINK>) and a second review reported 1.6 mm difference (<LINK REF="REF-Cortellini-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cortellini 2000</LINK>). Differences in the methods of these reviews that may help to explain the results include the incorporation of uncontrolled and unblinded studies in one (<LINK REF="REF-Laurell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laurell 1998</LINK>) and unclear selection criteria for randomised controlled trials in the second, including the inclusion of studies of shorter duration (16). A recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Murphy-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murphy 2003</LINK>) on GTR produced broadly similar findings to our present review. In terms of gain in clinical attachment, GTR produced 0.81 mm greater gain than OFD (P &lt; 0.001) (no confidence interval presented for the difference). The result contained highly statistically significant heterogeneity. This group did not find a statistically significant difference between different types of barrier material. Differences in search strategy, inclusion of both randomised and non-randomised studies and of studies of shorter duration of follow up, may have accounted for these differences.</P>
<P>The results of this update are similar to those of the original review, even though six more trials have been included. The major difference was found for gingival recession which is now significant. This shows a greater increase in gingival recession from baseline with the control group of access flap. In addition, further exploration of heterogeneity has now been possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Eleven out of 16 studies showed greater attachment gain for guided tissue regeneration (GTR) over open flap debridement. However, this systematic review has shown that the outcomes following GTR are highly variable, both between and within studies. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis comparing GTR with open flap debridement indicates greater clinical attachment gain of 1.22 mm (95% CI 0.80 to 1.64) and probing depth reduction of 1.21 mm (95% CI 0.53 to 1.88) for GTR over open flap debridement. However, the highly statistically significant heterogeneity between studies indicates that these summary values may be not reliable summary values for the magnitude of probing changes. </P>
<P>Statistically significantly greater gingival recession occurs following access flap surgery than following the use of guided tissue regeneration (mean difference 0.26 mm 95% CI 0.08 to 0.43) and with no statistically significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>There are few data from controlled studies of 12 months duration on the combination of bone substitutes with guided tissue regeneration but the results suggest little added benefit beyond a gain in hard tissue probing at surgical re-entry. </P>
<P>Few data exist to answer important questions such as patient evaluation of outcomes. </P>
<P>The use of papilla preservation flaps versus conventional flap designs should be further evaluated in randomised controlled trials.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is little value in future research repeating, small efficacy studies. Studies of sufficient size to examine the effect of possible prognostic or technical factors on outcomes are needed. These might include, type of infra-bony defect, type of barrier membrane and type of surgical flap design. Types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. Open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.</P>
<P>Control of bias (especially randomisation, concealment of allocation and blinding of examiner and operator where possible) needs to be more rigorously employed in study designs and this might be an important factor in explaining heterogeneity. </P>
<P>Greater attention in designing and reporting studies should be given to study quality issues as set out in the CONSORT statement. This will help to facilitate the evaluation of these studies. </P>
<P>Greater consideration in study design should be given to outcomes that capture the boarder patient experience including patient centred and economic outcomes and evaluation of adverse effects. Two treatments that produce similar clinical changes may be quite different from the patient or economic perspective.</P>

<P>Pain: No significant difference for postoperative pain between groups (VAS scale). Morbidity: 36% test patients reported that the procedure interfered with daily activity for an average of 2.7 days, 32% controls reported that procedure interfered with daily activity for an average of 2.4 days. Post-operative oedema was most frequent complication: GTR 62% patients, acces flap 40% (estimated from figure 3) statistically greater for GTR P = 0.01.
