<TITLE>Artificial limb rehabilitation for older people with a leg amputated at or above the knee because of blood circulation problems</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-08 09:17:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Problems with inadequate circulation in the legs (dysvascularity), particularly in people over the age of 60 years, can be so severe that they need a leg amputated. This may be as high as at or above the knee. Accompanying medical conditions (co-morbidities) such as diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease can affect a person's rehabilitation. When an above or through knee artificial limb (prosthesis) is fitted, it is hard to regain mobility and function and some people choose to use a wheelchair. Motivation, comfort, cosmetic appearance, functionality, reliability, ease of use, previous mobility and the extra exertion needed to use an artificial leg are all potentially important factors that affect a person's independence and their use of the prosthesis. Fear of falling, number of falls, social circumstances, help and support from other people are also important influences. The review authors searched for trials comparing different types of rehabilitation that may benefit the mobility or function in older people using an artificial limb.</P>
<P>Only one controlled trial was found. This had a crossover design and each of the 10 participants had three seemingly identical prosthetic weights added to the prosthesis below the knee in a random order. The participants, nine men and one woman, were over 50 years of age and eight were over 60 years. Over the few hours of the trial, four participants preferred the lightest weight (150 g), five preferred the medium weight (770 g) and one preferred the heaviest weight (1625 g). Seven of the 10 people successfully ranked the weights from lightest to heaviest. The weights did not alter the participant's walking speed in a two-minute walk test.</P>
<P>The small number of participants, short exposure to the different weights in a laboratory setting and the fact that there were differences in weight between people and also their prosthesis limits the usefulness of these findings. The artificial limbs were all modular style prostheses.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2015-01-08 09:16:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Dysvascularity accounts for 75% of all lower limb amputations in the UK. Around 37% of these are at transfemoral level (mid-thigh), with the majority of people being over the age of 60 and having existing co-morbidities. A significant number of these amputees will be prescribed a lower limb prosthesis for walking. However, many amputees do not achieve a high level of function following prosthetic rehabilitation. This is the second update of the review first published in 2005.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>We aimed to identify and summarise the evidence from randomised controlled trials evaluating rehabilitation interventions for prosthetic ambulation following unilateral transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people, whether community dwelling or institutionalised. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-01-06 09:46:22 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Karen Welch">
<P>For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched July 2014) and Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (last searched 2014 Issue 6). No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials testing prosthetic rehabilitation interventions following a unilateral transfemoral or transgenicular amputation in older (aged 60 years or above) dysvascular people. </P>

<P>Two authors independently scanned the search results for potentially eligible studies and on obtaining full reports of these, selected studies for inclusion and exclusion. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. No data pooling was possible.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-01-20 11:08:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No new studies were identified for inclusion in this update. Of the full reports obtained for consideration, one trial was included and four excluded. The included trial was a short-term crossover randomised trial which tested the effects of adding three seemingly identical prosthetic weights (150 g versus 770 g versus 1625 g) to the prostheses of 10 participants with unilateral dysvascular transfemoral amputation. Eight participants were over 60 years of age. The trial found that four participants preferred the lightest weight (150 g), five preferred the middle weight (770 g) and one preferred the addition of the heaviest weight (1625 g).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choice of prosthetic rehabilitation, including the optimum weight of prosthesis, after unilateral transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people. A programme of research, including randomised controlled trials to examine key interventions, is urgently required in this area.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2015-01-20 11:07:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-27 16:40:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Each year, in excess of 6000 leg amputations are performed in the United Kingdom (UK) (<LINK REF="REF-ISD-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ISD 2004</LINK>); there were over 148,000 reported hospital discharges in 1996 for limb loss in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-LLRSP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">LLRSP 2000</LINK>). The number of amputees worldwide is not currently tracked by any organization. The incidence of dysvascularity (poor circulation) increases with age and the presence of co-morbidities (other medical conditions) such as diabetes. In the UK, dysvascularity accounts for 75% of all lower limb amputations, of which 37% are transfemoral (through the thigh). Similarly, dysvascularity accounts for 87% of all amputations in the USA.</P>
<P>Following amputation of the lower limb, a prosthesis (artificial leg) is frequently prescribed. It is reported that older dysvascular unilateral transfemoral amputees do not achieve a high level of prosthetic mobility or function, particularly in comparison with transtibial (through the calf) amputees. However, success rates for prosthetic rehabilitation in this population differ markedly. A recent study found that only 25% of transfemoral amputees over the age of 50 years achieved community mobility and this figure reduced with advancing age (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 2003</LINK>). In contrast an earlier study found that only 4% of this population were community ambulators (<LINK REF="REF-Houghton-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Houghton 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Some studies have attempted to identify factors that contribute to functional outcomes for amputees. These factors include psychological and social aspects, presence of co-morbidities and age. There has also been an attempt to use such factors to predict successful rehabilitation (<LINK REF="REF-Munin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munin 2001</LINK>). Clinical guidelines in the UK (<LINK REF="REF-Broomhead-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broomhead 2003</LINK>) recommend that patients should be made aware that concurrent pathologies and previous mobility affect realistic goal setting and the outcomes of prosthetic rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Success of prosthetic provision is frequently judged in terms of clinical measures of impairment or function, for example walking 45 m with the prosthesis (<LINK REF="REF-Munin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Munin 2001</LINK>). However, the relationship between the amputee and their prosthesis is potentially more complex, involving motivation, comfort, cosmetic appearance, functionality, reliability, ease of use and degree of energy expenditure during use. Transfemoral amputees have a greater level of disability and use 65% more energy than bipedal (normal) walking (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 1976</LINK>). The prevalence of co-existing cardiovascular disease in patients with dysvascular amputation may be as high as 75% and co-morbid heart disease may prevent patients from achieving maximum functional independence (<LINK REF="REF-Roth-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roth 1998</LINK>). Therefore, older dysvascular transfemoral amputees with cardiac abnormalities may be at increased risk of an adverse event, such as heart failure, by being exercised during prosthetic rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Patients referred to the 42 prosthetics (artificial limb) centres in Britain and Northern Ireland are assessed for physical and psychological capabilities by a multi-disciplinary team of healthcare professionals. Patients' and carers' wishes are taken into account. The outcome of the visit is a decision to prescribe a functional or cosmetic prosthesis or to recommend an alternative form of functional independence, for example a powered wheelchair. Under the UK's National Health Service all older amputees are issued with a wheelchair for mobility as standard service. However, current UK clinical guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Broomhead-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Broomhead 2003</LINK>) indicate that evidence underpinning the clinical decision path is sparse.</P>
<P>Older people with a unilateral transfemoral amputation are an increasingly important subgroup of amputees that has been identified as having a low success rate with a prosthesis, in terms of functional mobility and usage. Healthcare professionals involved in amputee rehabilitation require more evidence to support clinical decisions regarding a patient in this age group's suitability for prosthetic rehabilitation, especially when patient expectations do not match clinical decisions. Furthermore, patients and carers have a right to good, evidence-based information on which to base their decisions regarding living either independently or with care in the community. This includes whether mobility or function will be achievable with a prosthesis, a wheelchair or a combination of both. It is a professional's duty to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each path and also to inform of any clinical risk. It is important to review interventions to improve rehabilitation prospects. Therefore, there was a need for a systematic review of the evidence relating to prosthetic rehabilitation in older dysvascular unilateral transfemoral amputees to inform clinical practice</P>

<P>For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched July 2014) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (<A HREF="http://www.metaxis.com/CRSWeb/Index.asp">http://www.metaxis.com/CRSWeb/Index.asp</A>) (last searched 2014 Issue 6) for publications describing randomised controlled trials of prosthetic rehabilitation for older dysvascular people following a unilateral transfemoral amputation. See (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>) for details of the search strategy used to search the CRS. The Specialised Register is maintained by the TSC and is constructed from weekly electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, and through handsearching relevant journals. The full list of the databases, journals and conference proceedings which have been searched, as well as the search strategies used are described in the (<A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PVD/frame.html">Specialised Register</A>) section of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group module in <I>The Cochrane Library </I>(<A HREF="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">www.thecochranelibrary.com</A>).</P>

<P>In MEDLINE (OVID-WEB), three levels of the optimal trial search strategy developed by Robinson (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 2002</LINK>) were combined with the subject-specific search. See <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK> for details of the search strategy used for MEDLINE and EMBASE (Datastar). Similar searches adapted for each database were run for CINAHL, AMED, PSYCINFO, BNI and ASSIA. Searches on the remaining databases, were based on a few key words (for example, AMPUTEE OR AMPUTATION) or specific categories within the individual databases. Key words included Physio*, Phys* therap*, AND Amput*, prosthe*, Lower limb OR lower extremity.</P>

<B>Selecting trials for inclusion<BR/>
</B>From the title, abstract and descriptors, two authors (JC and SB) independently reviewed the results of the literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. From the full text, trials that met the selection criteria were independently selected for inclusion by the same two authors. Any disagreement not resolved by consensus would have been put forward for third party adjudication by TH.</P>
<P>
<B>Data collection<BR/>
</B>Two authors (JC and SB) independently extracted data using a customised data extraction tool that was tested prior to use. Contacting authors of studies was not necessary.</P>
<P>
<B>Assessment of methodological quality<BR/>
</B>Two authors (JC and SB) independently assessed 15 aspects of methodological quality using a scoring scheme (see 
<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>) that included items from the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's generic quality assessment scheme (denoted by 'M'), items from the Delphi list (denoted by 'D') (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 1998</LINK>) and items from the Maastricht-Amsterdam consensus list for Methodological Quality Assessment (denoted by 'MAC') (<LINK REF="REF-Bellamy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bellamy 1997</LINK>). Any disagreement not resolved by consensus would have been put forward for third party adjudication by TH.</P>
<P>
<B>Data analysis<BR/>
</B>Where available and appropriate, we planned to present quantitative data for the outcomes listed in the inclusion criteria. We planned to present risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes. Where appropriate, we planned to pool results of comparable groups of trials using the fixed-effect model and 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity between comparable trials was to be tested using a standard chi-squared test and considered statistically significant at P &lt; 0.1, after due consideration of the value of the I² result. If pooling were not possible we stipulated that appropriate or narrative description of results would be presented.</P>
<P>
<B>Sensitivity and subgroup analyses<BR/>
</B>We planned to perform sensitivity analyses, where indicated and appropriate, to investigate the effects of allocation concealment, methodological quality, and intention-to-treat analysis. Where the data allowed, we also planned separate outcome analyses to test the following hypotheses:</P>
<UL>
<LI>prosthetic rehabilitation is equally successful in males and females;</LI>
<LI>success does not depend on the duration and (or) intensity of prosthetic rehabilitation;</LI>
<LI>success does not depend on the setting in which the prosthetic rehabilitation is delivered;</LI>
<LI>success does not depend on the level or type of supervision of prosthetic rehabilitation.</LI>

<P>The only included study (<LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK>) was a crossover randomised trial which tested the effects of adding three seemingly identical prosthetic weights (150 g versus 770 g versus 1625 g) in a randomised order to the prostheses of 10 amputees. All the participants had undergone transfemoral amputations for vascular reasons. The mean age was 65 years although two participants were aged between 50 and 60 years. One participant was female. All participants were community ambulators, with at least three months since their amputation, and had similar activity levels. The study compared the effects of adding three different weights below the knee joint to each participant's prosthesis during a single session. The primary outcome measure was participant preference, which was based on the rank order of preference of the participant for the three different weights. This was interpreted as equating to user satisfaction. The other main outcome measure of the trial was participant gait speed as measured by the two minute walk test (2MWT). This is a laboratory-based measure of mobility that does not satisfy the inclusion criteria of this review. Also investigated was the participant's ability to identify the weight that had been added.</P>

<P>See <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for details of the quality assessment of the single included study (<LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK>). The interventions applied to each participant were in randomised order but the procedure of randomisation was not described. During the study, effective measures were taken to blind both the assessor and the study participants to each intervention, that is the weight added to the prosthesis. There were no participant withdrawals as this was a single-session laboratory-based study with no follow up. The inclusion and exclusion criteria and participant characteristics were all clearly described.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-27 16:40:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Only one study was included (<LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK>). Of the 10 participants in the trial four preferred the placebo weight (150 g), five preferred the 770 g weight and one preferred the 1625 g weight. Seven participants successfully ranked the weights from lightest to heaviest. <LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK> reported there was no significant difference in participant gait speed with the addition of the three different weights to the prosthesis.</P>
<P>The authors in this study used the term weight rather than the more correct mass to describe the additions to the prosthesis. The authors' terminology has been retained in this review as it is more commonly used outside the scientific community.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-27 16:40:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Older people with a unilateral transfemoral amputation are an increasingly important subgroup of amputees that is identified as having a low success rate with a prosthesis, in terms of functional mobility and usage. It is disappointing, therefore, that there is a paucity of good quality and reliable research evidence that can be used to inform clinical practice.</P>
<P>Only one randomised trial satisfied the eligibility criteria for this review. This trial (<LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK>) was judged to be of moderate methodological quality and hence the results should be interpreted with caution. A deficiency of evidence may also apply to other transfemoral amputee groups as only one randomised controlled trial was identified investigating the effects of a therapeutic intervention within prosthetic rehabilitation in young traumatic transfemoral amputees (<LINK REF="REF-Yigiter-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yigiter 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Although the weight of an amputee's prosthetic limb is clinically important, particularly from the point of view of amputee satisfaction, the included study provided only minimal evidence of effect. Indeed, the small number of participants, limitations of the crossover design, the short duration of the intervention, the laboratory nature of the trial, the absence of follow up and limited nature of outcome assessment prevent such a trial from providing adequate evidence to inform the prescription of prosthetic limbs. As acknowledged by the trial authors, the most the trial results do is to challenge an assumption, if made, that patients will always prefer the lightest prosthesis. Even this assertion needs to be seen in the context of the very short-term nature of the intervention (a few hours). Other issues also merit consideration. The interventions in this study were all identical (weight added to a prosthesis) and were absolute values that were identical between participants. However, the body weight of the individual participants varied from 52 kg to 112 kg and thus the relative mass (weight) was different between participants. The pre-intervention weight of the prosthesis used by each participant also differed, from 2.8 to 4.2 kg. Therefore, in both cases the perceived weight that was added to the prosthesis may have been different. Participants were only permitted 5 to 10 minutes to familiarise themselves with the new prosthetic weight before taking the walk test. It may have been that in this population participants would have benefited from a longer period to acclimatise to the added weight of the prosthetic limb. Participants used their own prosthetic limbs; these were all endoskeletal prostheses with modified quadrilateral sockets and the same types of suspension. However, the knee and foot prosthetic components were not standardised between participants. These factors, either individually or in combination, could potentially confound the results of this study. The authors (<LINK REF="STD-Meikle-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Meikle 2003</LINK>) also acknowledge the difficulties in performing trials in rehabilitation where the question and the interpretation of the findings may not be quite as straightforward as they initially appear.</P>
<P>Certainly, research on the optimum weight of a prosthetic limb in this population would be useful. Such research should include assessment of the known high energy expenditure costs that older unilateral dysvascular transfemoral amputees experience in the presence of co-morbidities. A much larger sample size, standardisation of prosthetic components, randomisation into separate treatment groups, longer trial duration and appropriate follow up may provide the necessary clinically relevant data on the optimum weight of a prosthetic limb for this population.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to inform the choice of prosthetic rehabilitation, including the optimum weight of a prosthesis, after unilateral transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Most of the research in this area of clinical practice has been through cohort studies based upon prognostic indicators of success. These have included psychological and cognitive aspects, co-morbidities, functional abilities, compliance and the use of assessment tools. This is not enough to inform practice. There is an urgent need for reliable evidence from high quality and sufficiently powered randomised controlled trials on the success (for example, user satisfaction based on comfort, cosmetic appearance, frequency of prosthetic use, satisfaction for purpose, levels of function and independence) of key prosthetic rehabilitation interventions following transfemoral amputation in older dysvascular people. Research topic priorities informed by clinicians and amputees need to be ascertained beforehand in order to set up a research programme to address the important questions in this clinical area.</P>
