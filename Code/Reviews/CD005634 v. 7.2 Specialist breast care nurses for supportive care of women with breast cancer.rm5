<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Specialist breast care nurses for supportive care of women with breast cancer</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Breast cancer is a complex disease which has seen survival for women improve over the last 20 years. Many of these improvements are linked to treatment advances, improved screening and a multiprofessional approach to its management. Breast Care Nurses (BCNs) work within this multiprofessional environment providing a range of interventions including support, information, patient advocacy and general liaison among the various members of the healthcare team. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of individual interventions carried out by BCNs on quality of life outcomes for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer. We reviewed five studies which met the criteria for this systematic review. These involved a range of interventions and outcome measurements, and included women of various ages and in various stages of breast cancer assessment and treatment. These studies also used many different methods of reporting statistical findings and for this reason, the results of the studies could not be combined. Despite limited evidence to support their BCN role, one study which looked at follow up by the BCN compared to a doctor concluded that there were no differences for either group in terms of satisfaction with care or the ability of the healthcare provider to identify anxiety and depression. Another study showed that specific BCN interventions can alleviate perceived distress for women undergoing radiotherapy treatment however this did not have any impact on coping skills, mood or overall quality of life. </P>
<P>Generally speaking, this review found limited evidence to identify the components of the BCNs role which impact on a woman's quality of life but acknowledge that the nature of their work, provided within a multiprofessional team, serves to complement the team as a whole rather than highlighting the impact of the BCN alone. Further research is, however, needed which addresses the impact that BCNs may have on aspects of quality of life for women with breast cancer.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-06-19 12:00:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Breast Care Nurses (BCNs) are now established internationally, predominantly in well resourced healthcare systems. The role of BCNs has expanded to reflect the diversity of the population in which they work, and the improvements in survival of women with breast cancer. Interventions by BCNs aim to support women and help them cope with the impact of the disease on their quality of life.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness of individual interventions carried out by BCN's on quality of life outcomes for women with breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (15 January 2007). We also searched MEDLINE (1966 to September 2006), CINAHL (1982 to September 2006), EMBASE (1980 to September 2006), British Nursing Index (1984 to September 2006), CancerLit (1961 to September 2006), PsycInfo (1967 to September 2006), Library and Info Science Abstracts (LISA) (1969 to September 2006), Dissertation Abstracts International (only available 2005 to September 2006). We contacted authors as appropriate.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of interventions carried out by BCN's on quality of life outcomes, for women with breast cancer.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two authors independently assessed relevant studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction and quality assessment of included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 12:00:54 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>We included five studies, categorised into three groups. Three studies assessing psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment found that the BCN could affect some components of quality of life, such as anxiety and early recognition of depressive symptoms. However, their impact on social and functional aspects of the disease trajectory was inconclusive. Supportive care interventions during radiotherapy was assessed by one study which showed that specific BCN interventions can alleviate perceived distress during radiotherapy treatment, but did not improve coping skills, mood or overall quality of life. One study assessed nurse-led follow-up interventions in which no statistically significant difference was identified for main demographic variables, satisfaction with care, access to medical care or anxiety and depression.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is limited evidence at this time to support the contention that interventions by BCNs assist in the short-term with the recognition and management of psychological distress for women with breast cancer. Further research is required before the impact of BCNs on aspects of quality of life for women with breast cancer can be known.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-06-19 13:25:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Breast cancer is a significant health problem worldwide, and a complex disease both physically and psychologically (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>). Dealing with the many challenges relating to a diagnosis of breast cancer, such as lengthy treatments and trying to combine recovery with family and work commitments, can have a significant and negative impact on women ( <LINK REF="REF-Fallowfield-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fallowfield 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schultz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schultz 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spagnola-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spagnola 2003</LINK>). Following diagnosis of breast cancer an individual's quality of life can be challenged physically, psychologically and functionally. Depression and anxiety may result from the distress of diagnosis, fear of a life-threatening disease and tumour recurrence. Breast surgery may impact psychologically on a woman's body image and sexuality. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting: hair loss and fatigue; secondary lymphoedema; symptoms associated with therapy-induced menopause, such as hot flushes and emotional lability are just some of the physical consequences of breast cancer treatments. To the individual patient, therefore, breast cancer is not only a medical problem, but also one which has serious psychological, emotional and social impact. Effective management requires a professional and holistic approach. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Maguire-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maguire 1978</LINK> and Maguire 1983 were the first to identify the specific emotional and psychological needs of women diagnosed with breast cancer and the need to offer both psychological as well as physical care to aid recovery. Their work laid the foundation for the development of the role of Breast Care Nurses (BCNs) in the United Kingdom. Other countries have also embraced this role. In North America, Australia and Scandinavia, BCNs or Specialist Breast Care Nurses (SBCNs) have been developing their roles over the past 20 years. Various educational models and postgraduate programmes have evolved to prepare BCNs for their role (<LINK REF="REF-Eicher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eicher 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-EUSOMA-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">EUSOMA 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCN-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>The roles and titles of BCNs can vary across continents, and some work has been done to define the role better. <LINK REF="REF-Yates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 2007</LINK> consulted stakeholders and undertook a focussed review of existing literature to develop competency standards for Australian BCNs. They define the BCN as:</P>
<P>"a registered nurse who applies advanced knowledge of the health needs, preferences and circumstances of women with breast cancer to optimise the individual's health and well-being at various stages across the continuum of care, including diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care"</P>
<P>Illuminating and quantifying what the BCNs do is difficult due to the variations in practice settings in which they are employed and training opportunities available. <LINK REF="REF-Yates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 2007</LINK> identified five main domains of competency for BCNs. These are supportive care, collaborative care, co-ordinated care, information provision and education and clinical leadership.</P>
<P>Interventions which provide supportive care are not exclusive to nursing, hence the difficulties in establishing the impact of nurse-led interventions on patient outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Corner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corner 2003</LINK>). Despite this, there is research evidence that the BCN contributes to improvements in outcomes for women by providing information and support which promote continuity of care (<LINK REF="REF-Redman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redman 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 2007</LINK>). Women themselves have reported positive outcomes from their interactions with the BCN. In the study by <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2002</LINK>, women found supportive care by the BCN to be paramount in improving their illness experience and quality of life. Likewise, in interviews with women with breast cancer conducted by <LINK REF="REF-Halkett--2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halkett 2006</LINK>, interviewees repeatedly emphasised the importance of the role of the BCN in providing support through communication, establishing rapport and an awareness of their needs. The availability of the BCN and the provision of reassurance and practical information was seen to be particularly useful. The Specialist Breast Nurse Project Team (<LINK REF="REF-NBCCSBNPT-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCCSBNPT 2003</LINK>) interviewed 176 women and found that they viewed BCNs as good communicators who were skilled in explaining issues and who provided a significant link between them and their doctors (96%) and community health workers (86%). Continuity of care was rated as a major benefit by 88% of these women and 97% reported that they benefited from ongoing contact with the BCN. </P>
<P>Supportive care can be variously defined and is frequently interpreted as a vague umbrella term including anything from an evidence-based intervention to a bedside conversation. In terms of the BCN role, supportive care interventions are aimed at improving women's quality of life. This supportive role reflects the ability of the BCN to identify multiple physical, psychological, social, sexual, cultural and spiritual needs of individual breast cancer patients. Needs identification at all stages of the illness, implementation of evidence-based interventions and psychosocial support in a responsive and flexible manner, provided in conjunction with anti-cancer treatment, are key (<LINK REF="REF-NBCCSBNPT-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">NBCCSBNPT 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCN-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCN-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCN 2002a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yates-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 2007</LINK>). </P>
<P>Currently, BCNs are mainly supported within better resourced healthcare systems where they are often the primary contact for women following a diagnosis of breast cancer. Working as part of a breast team is central to the work of BCNs and, as such, they are a regular feature of the multidisciplinary healthcare team (<LINK REF="REF-Amir-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Amir 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN 2005</LINK>). National and clinical guidelines recommend multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) as the best way to manage breast cancer and maximise outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Grunfeld-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grunfeld 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2002</LINK>). The effectiveness of these teams comes from common goals and understanding among members as to the impact of the illness on each woman, recognising her circumstances, feelings, concerns and preferences for treatment and the contribution each can make (<LINK REF="REF-Mileshkin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mileshkin 2006</LINK>). The BCN is a well respected and well established entity within these teams, and has been shown to impact positively on the overall quality of clinical care provided to women (P=0.003) and to exert a positive influence on the work of their teams and their medical colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Haward-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haward 2003</LINK>)</P>
<P>The aim of this systematic review was to examine a range of quality of life outcome indicators (physical, psychological and psychosocial) in order to establish changes in outcomes for women which can be attributed to BCN supportive care interventions thereby informing the future development of the BCN role.</P>

<P>We categorised the included studies into three groups, according to the intervention assessed.</P>
<P>1. Psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment (three studies, 654 breast cancer patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK>).<BR/>2. Supportive Care interventions during radiotherapy (one study, 134 breast cancer patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK>).<BR/>3. Nurse-led follow-up interventions (one study, 264 breast cancer patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>1. Psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment</B>
</P>
<P>Psychological morbidity is recognised as a significant consequence of a diagnosis of breast cancer <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2005</LINK>. BCNs are widely involved in supporting women with breast cancer from the point of diagnosis throughout the disease trajectory. These roles have become fully established and embedded in many practices.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK> conducted a RCT to determine whether counselling by a specialist nurse prevented the psychiatric morbidity associated with mastectomy and breast cancer. This study randomised 172 women with breast cancer, who had a modified radical mastectomy and full axillary clearance, to receive a counselling intervention carried out by the nurse within a few days of surgery and thereafter every two months at home for 12-18 months, or routine care from a surgical unit doctor. They also wanted to determine if a specialist nurse improved the physical and social recovery of women and helped them to adapt to the breast loss following mastectomy for breast cancer. These early studies sought to identify the problems encountered by women with breast cancer, and the role of the nurse in helping to alleviate them. They report data relating to the role of the specialist nurse in preventing psychiatric morbidity following mastectomy (<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK>) and the role of the specialist nurse in reducing physical disability and improving social recovery after mastectomy (Maguire 1983).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK> conducted a prospective RCT to evaluate the effect of support from a nurse specialising in breast care and a voluntary support organisation on prevalence of psychological morbidity after surgery for breast cancer. This study randomly assigned 272 women prior to surgery to one of four groups:<BR/>a) routine support from ward staff and an information booklet (Understanding cancer of the breast: BACUP);<BR/>b) as per group A plus support from (BCN);<BR/>c) as per group A plus support from a voluntary organisation (Tak Tent);<BR/>d) as per group A plus support from BCN and the voluntary organisation. </P>
<P>Prevalence of psychological morbidity was assessed using self rating scales: a 28-item general health questionnaire and its subscales, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Measurements were made at the first postoperative clinic visit and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK> compared whether standard medical care (SMC) or SMC plus the additional input from an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) could improve quality of life outcomes while decreasing overall costs. In this study, 210 women were randomly assigned to one of two possible groups.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> SMC </LI>
<LI> SMC plus an intervention delivered by an APN within two weeks of diagnosis of breast cancer and up to 12 months. The APN was qualified with a Masters' degree in nursing and had in-depth knowledge and skills in the care of this group. The intervention following diagnosis provided written and verbal information about breast cancer, what to expect in consultations with physicians, decision-making support, answering questions and the presence of the APN at consultation to support the women. Subsequent contact was provided in a variety of settings, including hospital, telephone and community, to reinforce information, provide continuity and offer ongoing support.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>2. Supportive Care interventions during radiotherapy<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>We found one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK>) which assessed the effect of a nursing intervention for women receiving curative radiotherapy on their subjective distress, side effects and quality of life. The goals of the intervention were to enhance and restore the women's ability for self-care.<BR/> <BR/>This study randomised 134 women with breast cancer to standard nursing care (SNC) or SNC plus a structured nursing intervention.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> SNC: This included a group information session for women containing information about treatment, routines and side effects, and contact with a nurse during the treatment period (approx. 15 minutes was spent with each woman). </LI>
<LI> SNC plus a structured nursing care intervention: This involved an additional individual session for each woman focusing on encouraging self care actions to minimise, prevent or alleviate side effects of therapy, psychological support, education and guidance, and referral to the wider multi-professional team. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
<B>3. Nursing led follow-up interventions<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="REF-Rojas-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rojas 2000</LINK> questioned the value of routine follow ups with frequent visits to a breast cancer medical specialist. Specialist nurses working in the field of breast cancer are increasingly involved in this type of intervention. We found one RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK>) which compared routine follow up of breast cancer patients by a specialist oncologist/surgeon within a hospital setting to follow up by demand, managed by an experienced nurse specialist, working within a hospital setting. </P>
<P>This study randomly assigned 264 breast cancer patients with stage 1 or 2 disease to one of two possible follow-up practices within a large cancer centre.<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI> Standard follow-up care: The patient was examined by an oncologist or surgeon four times per year for the first two years, bi-annually for five years and yearly thereafter, plus yearly mammography.</LI>
<LI> Intervention: A Nurse Specialist saw the patient three months post-surgery. The Nurse Specialist worked within a large cancer centre and had in-depth knowledge and skills in the care of this patient group. The Nurse Specialist gave the women information about recurrence, advice, and contact details, and they were asked to contact the nurse if there were concerns or symptoms related to the breast cancer. The Nurse also co-ordinated yearly mammography. </LI>

<BR/>The Jadad framework and the assigning of a quantitative score were not representative of the overall quality of a paper, particularly as it is not possible to blind these types of interventions. Despite this, none of the studies could be considered high quality. </P>

<B>1. Psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment </B> </P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK> graded 2<BR/>The authors claim the groups were closely matched on variables including pre-operative psychological morbidity, stage of disease, other treatments, age, marital status, social class and other stressful events, although no specific details were given. Assessments were completed on 152 women; of the 20 remaining, drop out was explained for eight.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK> graded 1<BR/>The authors reported levels of attrition (95), but it was unclear if those who dropped out were included in the analysis. This was an important consideration, particularly as their was inequality of loss to follow up between the different groups. At 12 months, the loss was 24% for routine care compared to 6% (nurse only), 8% (voluntary organisation only) and 16% (combined). There may have been differences between these groups and those who remained in the study. Consent was not obtained prior to randomisation, with some women unwilling to receive the support offered, and this may have contributed to the large attrition rate. No one refused to see the nurse, but 12 participants did not want to be approached by the voluntary organisation (VO). Of those who did have contact with the VO, a further 17 did not wish further contact. It is important to acknowledge that the timing of the interventions and, indeed, the function of Tak Tent differed from the norm, whereby women would be expected to self-refer rather then be referred to the organisation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK> graded 1. <BR/>The authors claim the groups were similar but with two exceptions: women in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have a lower histology ( p = 0.04) and to receive adjuvant hormone therapy ( p = 0.03) then the women in the control group. There is no evidence that this has been addressed in the analysis. Levels of attrition were significant in both arms between baseline and 24 months (Intervention group: baseline 95%, to 76% at 24months; Control group 76% at baseline to 52% at 24 months) and data is presented up to and including12 months only. This was explained as a reflection of decreased patient need between 12 and 24 months. Cost outcome data were complete for 141 ( intervention 74, control 64). A further 11 particiapants had some data missing which was adjusted using the mean cost data for simialr participants. The remaining 58 ( intervention 28, control 30) for whom cost data were incomplete were excluded from the analysis. Missing cost data were attributed to different referral patterns, changes in the participants' insurance and transfer to a different setting. </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK> was graded 2.<BR/>The authors reported that the randomisation procedure at baseline failed to select groups with equal quality of life variables. They acknowledge that this may be attributable to either a failure in the randomisation procedure or a chance occurrence.

They claim that in one centre the control and intervention groups were too similar to include in the final analysis. This therefore excluded 135 women from the final results. There are no specific details reported about withdrawals or dropouts other then death. </P>
<P>Some limitations in using the <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> quality scoring scale to assess quality of life research are noted. Papers which give details of methods of randomisation and double blinding could score artificially high despite the quality of these assessed components being poor.

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-06-19 11:18:55 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>The five studies in this review assessed the impact of the breast care nurse on various aspects of quality of life, and indicators of psychological, psychiatric and physical morbidity. <LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK> measured anxiety and depression, physical and social well-being and coping at different stages. <LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK> focused on coping, subjective distress and physical side effects of radiotherapy treatment and <LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK> considered well-being during follow-up. Many of the studies used multiple instruments administered at numerous time points to assess these outcomes. Some studies relied on patient reporting, while others assessed the rate of referral between the BCN and other health professionals. Many statistical methods to assess results were used by the studies. Reporting of results was generally poor with some studies providing little in the way of quantative results. </P>
<P>Therefore, this review presents a narrative synthesis of the main results according to the different interventions identified. See Additional <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> 'Study results' for more information.</P>
<P>
<B>1. Psychosocial nursing interventions around diagnosis and early treatment <BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Three studies with a total of 634 women assessed the effects of a nursing intervention on psychological morbidity and quality of life (<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK> randomised 172 women post-mastectomy to usual care (not explained) or counselling by a nurse specialist. Seventy five patients were counselled by the nurse and 77 patients received only the care normally provided by the surgical unit. Three months after mastectomy there was no difference between the counselled group (29, 39%) and control group ( 33, 43%) in anxiety state, depressive illness, sexual problems or a combination. Twelve to eighteen months after mastectomy, 69 (92%) women in counselled group were anxiety free as compared to 54 (70%) in the control group. Depression was also less in the counselled group, absent in 71 (95%) compared to 54 (70%) in the control group. Consequently , 12-18 months after mastectomy there was much less psychiatric morbidity in the counselled group (12%), compared to 39% in the control group. The nursing intervention led to recognition of psychiatric morbidity and prompted referral of 76% of those who required help, as opposed to 15% in the control group. </P>
<P>The study only rated sexual problems in counselled patients and 48 controls who had reported a satisfactory sex life prior to surgery. Sexual problems were identified in 15 of the control group and in 4 in the counselled group. </P>
<P>Recovery after surgery<BR/>Significantly more counselled (54, 72%) than control group (42, 55%) were satisfied with scar versus neutral or dissatisfied (chi-squared+4.97, p&gt;0.05); More of the control group (23, 33%) were dissatisfied with their prosthesis than in the counselled group (11, 15%) (chi-squared = 6.66, p&gt;0.02). More counselled (51, 68%) than control group (40, 52%) had adapted to breast loss (chi-squared = 4.07, p&gt;0.05) although women in both counseled (8, 11%) and control (7, 9%) groups were unable to accept the loss of a breast.</P>
<P>Differences in housework, social adjustment and return to work were all improved in the counselled as opposed to control groups. Nil versus some problems with housework (chi-squared+2.95, p&gt;0.05); for nil versus some problems in social adjustment (chi-squared=5.01, p&gt;0.05) and for return to work versus not (chi-squared=4.59, p&gt;0.05).</P>
<P>Counselled and control groups both had a small but important minority (12%) who suffered from moderately severe or severe swelling in a limb 12 - 18 months after surgery.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-McArdle-1996" TYPE="STUDY">McArdle 1996</LINK> carried out a prospective RCT with 272 women. The results indicate a reduction in psychological morbidity in the group receiving care from the BCN. The data were summarised using means and standard deviations despite an acknowledgment of skewed data. Summary measure for each woman were taken using the average value over the four assessments (postoperative clinic visit and follow up at three, six and twelve months) and compared measures using the Kruskal-Wallis test, with correction for ties. This was followed with pairwise multiple comparisons among the four treatment groups using Mann-Whitney tests. These are reported as unadjusted P values set at a significance level of 0.05. A Bonferroni adjustment gave a significance level of 0.008 but these adjusted levels are not presented. These results should be viewed with caution as the authors acknowledged that the data was skewed.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK> reported a RCT of 210 women randomised to receive an intervention provided by an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) versus usual care on aspects of quality of life. This study indicated that the intervention provided by an Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) (American designation which meets criteria for BCN) was beneficial in reducing levels of uncertainty of illness up to six months following diagnosis but this was not the case at 12 months where they were comparable. The beneficial effects of the APN were greater for unmarried women than for married women (p = 0.017). Differences in mood disturbance and well-being were not statistically significant, apart from in the sub-group analysis, which demonstrated a greater beneficial effect in the intervention group for unmarried women.</P>
<P>The results of this study indicate that beneficial effects of intervention by APNs are significant in the immediate six months following diagnosis, but are not sustained beyond this. Women who are unmarried appeared to benefit more from APN interventions than married women. These findings may support the implementation of APN support for some individuals during the initial adjustment stages immediately following a diagnosis of breast cancer.</P>
<P>
<B>2. Supportive care interventions during radiotherapy</B>
</P>
<P>One study, (<LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK>) measured the effects of a nursing intervention on subjective distress, side effects, coping and quality of life of breast cancer patients receiving curative radiotherapy. In this study,134 women from a total of 175 consecutive patients agreed to be randomised to the intervention group (standard nursing care plus intensive nurse led intervention at weeks 1, 3, and 5 and three months) or control group (standard nursing care). No significant differences were found between the two groups comparing baseline data, however a significant difference in QOL (p&lt;0.05) indicated that women in the experimental group had a poorer QOL than in the control group.</P>
<P>The intervention had a significant effect on perceived distress. The women in the intervention group rated fewer distress reactions than those in the control group (p&lt;0.05). The intervention had no measurable effect on global QOL or in perceived side effects.</P>
<P>Results from this study suggest that specific BCN interventions can alleviate perceived distress during radiotherapy treatment but may not improve coping skills, mood or overall quality of life. In this study, the wide age range and different life stages of the women may have impacted on perceived effects of the intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>3. Nurse-led follow-up interventions </B>
</P>
<P>One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK>), compared routine follow up by a specialist oncology surgeon (including clinical examination) to follow up by demand ( without clinical examination) managed by an experienced nurse specialist on quality of life. In this study, 264 women were recruited from two hospitals. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the main demographic variables, satisfaction with care, access to medical care and anxiety and depression. For anxiety and depression reported problems varied between 4.4% and 11.6% for anxiety and 0.8% and 5.2% for depression. Satisfaction in both group was ranked highly over the follow-up period (93%-100%), suggesting that the women found each model acceptable.</P>
<P>Access to medical care<BR/>There were 21% more primary contacts in the specialist group. In the nursing group there was a higher rate of mammaographies but a similar rate of other imaging and laboratory tests. <BR/>The women's experiences of accessibility and phone service use, showed there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. </P>
<P>
<B>4. Cost data</B>
<BR/>This review was also interested in cost data however only one of the five included studies provided any information relating to cost (<LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK>). In this study cost data were collected from hospital and the clinic billing system for two years following the date of diagnosis for each woman. The study was unable to collect some costs such as anesthesiologists, emergency room physicians and radiation oncologists but collected data on the length of hospitalisation and number of visits to a healthcare provider. Full cost data were available for 141 women. Missing cost data for 11 women were imputed using the mean cost data for similar women. The remaining 58 women for whom cost data were incomplete (28 in intervention group; 30 in control) were excluded from the analysis. The results indicated that the interventions by the APN did not decrease cost of care but also identified fixed costs associated with clinic appointments, treatments and hospital admissions that the APN could not influence. </P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>This review of the effectiveness of individual interventions carried out by BCNs on quality of life outcomes for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer identified five RCTs for inclusion. No quantitative analysis could be done due to heterogeneity among interventions employed and the large numbers of, and diversity of outcome measurements used, the variation in stages of breast cancer among the participants and the variations in the methods of reporting statistical findings within studies. All studies included participants with a wide age range and stage of disease. The inclusion criteria, particularly in <LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Wengstrom-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wengstrom 1999</LINK>, did not differentiate between the different needs of age groups and life stages. This added to the difficulties in combining data. Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Ritz-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Ritz 2000</LINK>) considered costs and it was not possible to attribute cost reduction to nursing interventions. </P>
<P>There is therefore limited evidence from RCTs to support some of the BCN interventions at this time. The findings of this review do however, lead us to the following discussion. </P>
<P>In categorising the studies according to the disease trajectory, it became clear that there were limited assessments of BCN interventions beyond the diagnosis and treatment phase. The work by <LINK REF="STD-Maguire-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Maguire 1980</LINK> initially set the precedent for the introduction of BCNs in the United Kingdom. Since this time, there have been few international trials building on this early work, although many countries now utilise BCNs. This review identified four RCTs in addition to Maguire's work which met the criteria. All of these recognised the difficulties nurses experience in conducting RCTs within practice. We also identified (but excluded) a number of studies which assessed supportive interventions provided by a psychologist. This indicates some blurring and overlapping of the roles for these two disciplines.</P>
<P>We recognised that restricting the review to RCTs limits the possibility of assessing the evidence relating to the effectiveness of BCN interventions. The nature of the work, provided within a multidisciplinary team, serves to complement the work of the team as a whole rather than highlighting the impact of the BCN alone. This was clear in the study by <LINK REF="STD-Koinberg-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Koinberg 2004</LINK>, where the women were equally satisfied with the care by the doctor and the nurse. BCNs remain an integrated and respected part of the multidisciplinary team.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<UL>
<LI>The studies of interventions carried out by BCNs indicate that they may provide some benefit to women with breast cancer, particularly in the identification of anxiety and depression. BCNs should ensure all aspects of quality of life are regularly assessed as part of routine care.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The findings suggest that the interventions had a short-term, rather than a long-term benefit for women. BCNs may need to provide focused interventions that reflect different stages of a woman's disease and treatment pathway, to provide maximum supportive care. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Supportive care interventions are not exclusively delivered by BCNs. The provision of education and training should reflect their work within multi-professional teams.</LI>
</UL>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<UL>
<LI>A wide range of research is still required in this field, encompassing both BCN specific outcomes and their contribution to multi-professional working. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>In the future, RCTs with clearly identified outcomes and a multi-centred approach are needed to ensure women receive the optimum care from BCN interventions. This should include cost analysis.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We did not find the studies in this area to be of a high overall quality and it is essential that in the future this is addressed to ensure questions are answered in a rigorous and valid manner.</LI>

<BR/>No significant differences between groups in levels of mood (p=0.953) however, unmarried women showed a decrease in mood disturbance in the intervention group at 1 month (p=0.011) and 3 month (p=0.043). Additionally, women with no family history of breast cancer showed a decrease in mood disturbance at 1 month (p=0.002), 3 month (p=0.010) and 6 month (p=0.004).<BR/>
<BR/>There was no statistical difference between intervention and control groups for well-being but unmarried women in intervention group reported higher levels of well-being at 1 month (p=0.036).<BR/>
<BR/>Cost data:<BR/>No significant difference in costs between groups existed. The costs of the APN intervention averaged at $629 per patient. <BR/>Data collection relating to costs appeared to be problematic with full cost data only available for 141. The study imputed missing cost data for 11 participants using the mean cost data for similar participants. The study excluded the remaining 58 participants for whom cost data were incomplete (28 in intervention group; 30 in control) from the analysis.<BR/>

Oncology Treatment Toxicity Assessment Tool (OTTAT) a self reported instrument containing 37 items to assess cancer related symptoms including side effects of treatments. Every item is rated on a 5 point scale from none to intolerable.<BR/>Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System <BR/>3. (CARES-sf) was used to measure Quality of Life and is a shortened version of a standardised and comprehensive rehabilitation and QoL questionnaire used for cancer patients. <BR/>This consisted of 59 items and patients were asked to complete a minimum of 37 to a max of 57 items. The ratings change on this from a 5-point scale from 0 does not apply to 4 applies very much.

<BR/>3. Quality of life<BR/>While the EG scored higher at baseline on the CARES - sf global score, the intervention had no measurable effect on global QOL - p value and CI not provided<BR/>
<BR/>The authors carried out a multiple regression analysis to control for differences in treatment dose and type of surgery, however the difference in treatment dose could not explain why the intervention and control groups were similar in perceived side effects.<BR/>
