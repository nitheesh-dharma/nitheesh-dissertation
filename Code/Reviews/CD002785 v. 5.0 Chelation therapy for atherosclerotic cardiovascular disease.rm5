<P>Not enough evidence about the effects of chelation therapy to reduce blockages in the blood vessels of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease. Atherosclerosis is caused by fatty deposits sticking to the inside of people's arteries and restricting blood flow. People with blocked arteries are more likely to have strokes and heart attacks, and can often only walk short distances before their legs begin to ache. Chelation therapy involves infusions into the bloodstream of substances believed to remove metals from the blood. This is promoted to people with atherosclerotic heart and circulation disease as a way of breaking down the blockages in their blood vessels. However, the review found there is not enough evidence from trials about the effects of this treatment.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chelation therapy is being promoted and practiced all over the world as a form of alternative medicine in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Register was searched, (last searched May 2005), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE and EMBASE for published articles and other relevant articles.

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials of EDTA chelation therapy versus placebo or no treatment in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

<P>Two authors (MVV, FT) extracted data and assessed trial quality independently. Unresolved issues were considered by a third author (ALD). Discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. Authors were contacted for additional information.<BR/> </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>A total of five studies were included in the review. Mortality, non-fatal events, and cerebrovascular events were not reported in any of the studies. Four of the studies, with a total recruitment rate of 250 participants, showed no significant difference in the following outcomes: direct or indirect measurement of disease severity and subjective measures of improvement. One of the studies, which included only 10 participants, was interrupted prematurely, because of an apparent treatment effect.

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>At present, there is insufficient evidence to decide on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of chelation therapy in improving clinical outcomes of people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-05-29 17:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Chelation therapy is being promoted and practiced as a form of alternative medicine to treat atherosclerosis and relieve symptoms of cardiovascular disease (<LINK REF="REF-Hiatt-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hiatt 1997</LINK>). It has been recommended as a safe, relatively inexpensive and non-surgical method of restoring blood flow in atherosclerotic vessels, thus preventing chronic symptoms such as angina pectoris and claudication, or acute symptoms such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Several clinics have been set up worldwide advocating its use in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. </P>
<P>Chelation therapy consists of a series of intravenous infusions containing disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in combination with other substances. EDTA, a water soluble compound, has been found to be effective in chelating and removing toxic metals from the blood (<LINK REF="REF-Green-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1993</LINK>). It is capable of combining with polyvalent cations, such as calcium ions, to form a soluble non-ionic complex that can be excreted (<LINK REF="REF-Wilder-1962" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilder 1962</LINK>). Proponents of chelation believe that this mechanism, taking place at the arterial wall, can lead to regression of atherosclerotic plaques (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1960</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Green-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Green 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1960</LINK>). There have been case reports suggesting that EDTA chelation therapy in people with angina may lead to alleviation of symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1956</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meltzer-1960" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meltzer 1960</LINK>). On the other hand, a recent review on chelation therapy for peripheral arterial occlusive disease has shown that chelation therapy is not superior to placebo and is associated with considerable risks (<LINK REF="REF-Ernst-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ernst 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>At present, the benefit of chelation therapy in people with atherosclerosis has not been fully documented. In a book by Drs. Walker and Shah on chelation therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Walker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 1997</LINK>), the authors correctly noted that, "all possible mechanisms of action of chelation therapy for producing the observed beneficial effects are still incompletely documented. And this incomplete understanding of why and how it works becomes a useful argument employed by medical opponents of the method....There has, in fact, been no full-scale study of the technique." </P>
<P>Thus, the authors decided to perform a systematic review of available information on this treatment in order to discuss implications for clinical practice and research.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine whether EDTA chelation therapy is better than no treatment or placebo in terms of improving clinical outcomes in people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</P>

<SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2008-05-29 17:07:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched their Specialised Register (last searched May 2005) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (last searched Issue 2, 2005) for publications describing (or which might describe) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of chelation therapy against placebo, or reference medications, for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. See <LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK> for details of the search strategy used to search CENTRAL.<BR/>The Specialised Register is constructed from electronic searches of MEDLINE (1966 to date), EMBASE (1980 to date), and CINAHL (1982 to date), and through handsearching relevant journals. The full list of journals that have been handsearched, as well as the search strategies used are described in the 'Search strategies for the identification of studies' section within the editorial information about the Cochrane PVD Group in <I>The Cochrane Library,</I>

</P>
<P>Other terms were sought by visiting chelation clinics and determining the names of the manufactured agents used, particularly for chelation therapy on people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Studies were also requested through correspondence with known Filipino "experts" in the procedure, and through reading of other published materials such as books and conference proceedings. The bibliographies of the studies thus retrieved were searched for further trials. There were no restrictions on language.</P>
</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>
<B>Selection of trials</B>
<BR/>All identified trials were checked by two authors (MVV, FT), to determine relevant articles for full text retrieval. Retrieved studies were then assessed for eligibility by the same two authors, according to the inclusion criteria specified. Issues that were unresolved in the assessment and data extraction process were passed on to the third author (ALD). Discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. </P>
<P>
<B>Quality of trials</B>
<BR/>For each trial fulfilling the inclusion requirements, an assessment of methodological quality was undertaken independently by two authors (MVV, FT). A quality assessment instrument developed by the Philippine Cardiovascular Research Group was used. This instrument classifies study quality according to selection, detection, performance and exclusion biases. Specific features evaluated in this instrument were allocation concealment, balance in baseline characteristics, blinding, drop-out rates, and analysis by intention-to-treat. Issues that were unresolved in the assessment and data extraction process were passed on to the third author (ALD). Discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>Data for the specified outcomes were extracted independently by two authors (MVV, FT). The information collected from each trial included study design, participant characteristics, interventions compared and outcomes measured. Discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached. </P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis</B>
<BR/>Statistical pooling of outcomes was conducted. Heterogeneity between trials was tested. Analysis was performed using the statistical guidelines set by the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Disease Group. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of effect. Continuous scales of measurements used were analysed as weighted mean difference (WMD).</P>
</DATA_COLLECTION>
</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>A total of seven randomized controlled trials were retrieved (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Guldager-_x0028_Dan_x0029_-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guldager (Dan) 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olszewer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olszewer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sloth_x002d_Nielsen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sloth-Nielsen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>). None of the studies evaluated people with coronary or cerebrovascular disease. All seven studies recruited participants with peripheral vascular disease, particularly those with intermittent claudication. A double publication was noted as the Guldager study in 1992 was also published in Danish (<LINK REF="REF-Guldager-_x0028_Dan_x0029_-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guldager (Dan) 1992</LINK>). Two of the seven studies (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1996</LINK>), were actually substudies of another (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>). One of the substudies (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1996</LINK>), focused on mechanistic outcomes such as urinary metal excretion and magnesium retention and was eventually excluded. Thus, only five studies eventually underwent appraisal and data extraction. </P>
<P>The following outcomes were monitored: digital subtraction angiogram, walking distance based on onset of pain or disabling claudication, subjective walking distance, ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), lifestyle measures (i.e. quality of life and physical well-being), blood lipid levels, pain-free maximal walking distance measured on treadmill, or walking and bicycle stress tests.</P>
<P>Mortality was not reported in any of the trials. Non-fatal events such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris and cerebrovascular events were not included as endpoints in any of the studies.</P>
<P>All studies compared EDTA to placebo. The placebo was either an isotonic solution or distilled water.</P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>The quality of the included studies ranged from A to C, based on the Philippine Cardiovascular Research Group assessment scale. Allocation concealment and double-blinding were stated or implied in all of the studies. However, in the study by Olszewer (<LINK REF="STD-Olszewer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olszewer 1990</LINK>), the code was broken before the study's completion, thereby opening the study to performance, exclusion, and allocation bias. Only the study by Van Rij (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>) described an intention-to-treat type of analysis at three months follow-up.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>All the studies evaluated the use of EDTA on people with peripheral arterial disease. The study by Sloth-Nielsen analyzed a group of 30 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Sloth_x002d_Nielsen-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Sloth-Nielsen 1991</LINK>). The outcome reported focused on digital subtraction angiograms. The result showed no significant difference between EDTA chelation and placebo. Other outcomes were measured such as walking distance, ABPI and transcutaneous tension of oxygen diffusion on the skin. Exact data for analysis could not be extracted from the article. Further information was requested but none has been forthcoming. However, the trial authors concluded that EDTA chelation therapy has no beneficial effect on objective parameters or on subjective evaluations on participants with claudication in the lower extremities caused by arteriosclerosis.</P>
<P>Van Rij recruited 32 participants in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>). Fifteen participants were randomized to chelation and 17 to the control group. The major endpoints monitored were walking distance (based on onset of pain or disabling claudication), subjective walking distance, or ABPI at rest, and on exertion. There was no significant difference between the control and treatment groups for these major endpoints. Other endpoints included lifestyle measures (i.e. quality of life and physical well-being). Again, results showed no significant difference. </P>
<P>There were two studies authored by Guldager et al that recruited participants with intermittent claudication (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1993</LINK>). However, one of these was a substudy that monitored the effect of EDTA on blood lipids (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1993</LINK>). In this study, treatment with EDTA did not alter total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) or triglycerides. Guldager's main trial of 153 participants monitored pain-free and maximal walking distance measured on treadmill, as well as ABPI (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>). The results failed to demonstrate any significant effect. There was no significant difference as well, in terms of subjective evaluation by participants. Adverse events were reported but not subjected to statistical analysis. These potential side effects were as follows: stroke, hypocalcemic symptoms, fatigue, faintness, gastrointestinal symptoms, serum creatinine increase, proteinuria, phlebitis at infusion site, pain at infusion site, headache, Raynaud's phenomenon, metallic taste and dermatitis. </P>
<P>Only one article reported improvement in the application of chelation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Olszewer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olszewer 1990</LINK>). The study by Olszewer, et al. started with a randomized, double-blind method, but was eventually completed as a single-blind study with no control group. Ten participants were recruited and initially received either EDTA or placebo. The study was arbitrarily stopped because, according to the investigators, "after 10 treatments it was apparent that some participants were improving substantially but others were not ..... we therefore, decided to break the code." The investigators then decided to finish the study on a single-blind basis with no control group, convinced with the improvements obtained from EDTA treatment. Data from this study cannot be included in the statistical analysis as standard deviations were not reported in the article. We asked the trial authors for more data but have not received any response to date.</P>
<P>Overall, there were no significant changes in ABPI, walking distance, or pain-free walking distance. Weighted mean difference (WMD) for ABPI was 0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.06) at the 20th infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>), and 0.02 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.06) at three months post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>). WMD for walking distance was -37.93 (95% CI -90.32 to 14.45) at the 20th infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>), and -31.46 (95% CI -87.63 to 24.71) at three months post-treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>). Lastly, WMD for pain-free walking distance was -16.4 (95% CI -31.99 to -0.81) at the 20th infusion (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Rij-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Van Rij 1994</LINK>) and -7.73 (95% CI -22.59 to 7.13) at three months post-treatment. </P>
<P>The side effects of chelation noted included faintness, relative risk (RR) 11.44 (95% CI 1.51 to 86.45) and possibly gastrointestinal symptoms, RR 1.63 (95% CI 0.67 to 3.99), proteinuria RR 2.60 (95% CI 0.85 to 7.93), and hypocalcemia, RR 3.12 (95% CI 0.65 to 14.98) (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>). Procedure-related side effects were also noted including phlebitis and pain at the infusion site (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Treatment with EDTA for metal poisoning has been established for decades (<LINK REF="STD-Guldager-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Guldager 1996</LINK>). However, since the 1950s chelation therapy has been suggested for the treatment of coronary disease and other vascular diseases (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1955" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1955</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1956</LINK>). Based on the premise that since metastatic calcium deposits can be removed by this technique, the calcium involved in atheromata could be evacuated in a similar way. This mechanism would eventually lead to an improvement in outcome of participants with coronary disease. Initial claims on the effect of EDTA in lowering serum calcium levels were based on animal experiments (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-1956" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 1956</LINK>). However, it was the result of active administration of EDTA to people at that time that provided encouragement for the use of this form of therapy. The continued use and promotion of chelation therapy, however, is hampered by the limited availability of randomized controlled trials that have shown benefit. </P>
<P>The studies published to date have failed to demonstrate significant benefit with the use of EDTA chelation therapy in people with peripheral vascular disease. A single study showed benefit, but conclusions were weak because of serious methodological flaws seen upon review (<LINK REF="STD-Olszewer-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Olszewer 1990</LINK>). Although a meta-analysis of unpublished data reported a high correlation between improvement in cardiovascular function and treatment with EDTA, a randomized controlled method was not used by the various investigators in their recruitment of participants (<LINK REF="REF-Chappel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappel 1994</LINK>). Therefore, contrary to circulating claims, no published randomized controlled trials have evaluated the use of EDTA in participants with coronary or cerebrovascular disease. The meta-analysis by Chappel (<LINK REF="REF-Chappel-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chappel 1994</LINK>) may be indicative of a treatment effect, however, benefit is still questionable in the absence of a large randomized controlled trial.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At the present time, there is insufficient evidence to decide on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of chelation therapy in improving clinical outcomes among people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Wider acceptance of this treatment in clinical practice must be preceded by conducting more randomized clinical trials, especially among people at risk for coronary or cerebrovascular disease. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>To date, there are no trials on the effectiveness of chelation therapy on coronary and cerebrovascular disease. Trials have centered on peripheral vascular disease, more specifically treatment of intermittent claudication. Therefore, it is important that randomized trials be conducted in people for whom the treatment is intended and supposed to benefit, i.e. people with coronary and cerebrovascular disease. It is also important that future trials using chelation therapy include endpoints that show its effects on longevity and quality of life rather than monitoring mechanistic outcomes. </P>
