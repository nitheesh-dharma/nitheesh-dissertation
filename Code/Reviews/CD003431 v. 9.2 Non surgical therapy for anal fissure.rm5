<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-08-28 17:08:34 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anal fissure is a painful ulcer usually occurring in the posterior midline of the skin just outside the entry to the rectum. Its persistence is due to spasm of the internal sphincter muscle. The typical pain of this condition is pain on moving one's bowels that persists for some time afterward. Relief with healing of chronic fissures until very recently has been achieved by surgical procedures aimed at ablation of the sphincter spasm. Because of the risk of incontinence resulting from surgery, medical alternatives for surgery have been sought. Among the older medications, bran is effective in preventing recurrence of acute fissure. Local application of muscle relaxing therapy is effective in healing chronic anal fissure, though not as well as surgery, and with considerable risk of adverse events during therapy. There is a Cochrane review related to this review dealing only with surgical procedures.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Because of the disability associated with surgery for anal fissure and the risk of incontinence, medical alternatives for surgery have been sought. Most recently, pharmacologic methods that relax the anal smooth muscle, to accomplish reversibly what occurs in surgery, have been used to obtain fissure healing.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-07-13 02:51:59 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Search terms include "anal fissure randomized". Timing from 1966 to August 2010. Further details of the search below.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Studies in which participants were randomized to a non-surgical therapy for anal fissure. Comparison groups may include an operative procedure, an alternate medical therapy or placebo. Chronic fissure, acute fissure and fissure in children are included in the review. Atypical fissures associated with inflammatory bowel disease or cancer or anal infection are excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were abstracted from published reports and meeting abstracts, assessing method of randomization, blinding, "intention to treat" and drop-outs, therapies, supportive measures (applied to both groups), dosing and frequency and cross-overs. Dichotomous outcome measures included Non-healing of the fissure (a combination of persistence and recurrence), and Adverse events (including incontinence, headache, infection, anaphylaxis). Continuous outcome measures included measures of pain relief and anorectal manometry.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:08:22 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>In this update 23 studies including 1236 participants is added to the 54 studies and 3904 participants in the 2008 publication, however 2 studies were from the last version reclassified as un included, so the final number of participants is 5031.</P>
<P>49 different comparisons of the ability of medical therapies to heal anal fissure have been reported in 75 RCTs. Seventeen agents were used (nitroglycerin ointment (GTN), isosorbide mono &amp; dinitrate, Botulinum toxin (Botox), diltiazem, nifedipine (Calcium channel blockers or CCBs), hydrocortisone, lignocaine, bran, minoxidil, indoramin, clove oil, L-arginine, sitz baths, sildenafil, "healer cream" and placebo) as well as Sitz baths, anal dilators and surgical sphincterotomy.<BR/>GTN was found to be marginally but significantly better than placebo in healing anal fissure (48.9% vs. 35.5%, p &lt; 0.0009), but late recurrence of fissure was common, in the range of 50% of those initially cured. Botox and CCBs were equivalent to GTN in efficacy with fewer adverse events. No medical therapy came close to the efficacy of surgical sphincterotomy, though none of the medical therapies in these RCTs were associated with the risk of incontinence.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:09:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical therapy for chronic anal fissure, currently consisting of topical glyceryl trinitrate, botulinum toxin injection or the topical calcium channel blockers nifedipine or diltiazem in acute and chronic fissure and fissure in children may be applied with a chance of cure that is marginally better than placebo. For chronic fissure in adults all medical therapies are far less effective than surgery. A few of the newer agents investigated show promise based only upon single studies (clove oil, sildenifil and a "healer cream") but lack comparison to more established medications.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-06-20 22:54:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anal fissure is an ulcer in the squamous epithelium of the anus located just distal to the muco-cutaneous junction and usually in the posterior midline. It typically causes pain during defecation and for one to two hours afterwards (<LINK REF="REF-Goligher-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goligher 1975</LINK>). Atypical fissures may be multiple or off the midline, or be large and or irregular. These may be caused by inflammatory bowel disease, local or systemic malignancy, venereal infection, trauma, tuberculosis, or chemotherapy. The etiology of the typical or benign fissure is not so clear, nor are there accepted methods for fissure prevention. The most consistent finding in typical fissures is hypertonia of the internal anal sphincter, which is so severe that the pain caused by fissure is thought to be due to ischemia (<LINK REF="REF-Schouten-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schouten 1994</LINK>). Relief of the spasm has been associated with relief of pain and healing of the fissure without recurrence. Historically the most common approach for relieving the spasm is surgical. Operative techniques commonly used for fissure in ano include: anal stretch, open lateral sphincterotomy, closed lateral sphincterotomy, posterior midline sphincterotomy and to a lesser extent dermal flap coverage of the fissure. Morbidity from these procedures, being principally incontinence, was once thought to be extremely rare (<LINK REF="REF-Abcarian-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abcarian 1980</LINK>), but has been substantial in some recent reports (<LINK REF="REF-Garcia_x002d_Aguilar-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garcia-Aguilar 1996</LINK>), generating enthusiasm for therapies that do not involve sphincter division. A recent Cochrane review has assessed the efficacy and morbidity of operative therapy for anal fissure <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2006</LINK>. In this review non-operative approaches will be addressed and assessed.</P>

<P>Participants in this review are principally adult patients with chronic anal fissure. Patients with acute fissures and fissure in children are also included in some reports, and are the exclusive focus of others, but atypical fissures (multiple, irregular, off the midline or not associated with hypertonia of the anal sphincter, often associated with inflammatory bowel disease and cancer), were not included in any RCT and will not be included in this analysis. Chronic fissure has both anatomic and temporal definitions. Chronicity is inferred with a history of pain lasting more than 4 weeks or with pain of less duration but similar episodes in the past. Physical findings of chronicity include a sentinel pile at the distal margin of the fissure, heaped up edges of the fissure, visible sphincter fibers at the base of the fissure, or an inflammatory polyp at the inner margin of the fissure. Any single sign or symptom of chronicity is sufficient to define chronicity. It is not certain whether fissure in children is exactly comparable to chronic fissure in adults, or that chronic hypertonia of the anal sphincter, hypertrophy and ischemia play a role in its persistence. For that reason surgery has rarely been applied to children with anal fissure and, until recently, laxatives and lubricants have formed the basis of therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Goligher-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goligher 1975</LINK>). The failure of these medications has led to the investigation of newer therapies in children (<LINK REF="STD-Kenny-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oglesby-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oglesby 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonmez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sonmez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tander 1999</LINK>). Acute anal fissure in adults is thought to precede chronic fissure, to be more analogous to pediatric anal fissure in its pathologic anatomy and, if treated aggressively medically, can be healed preventing the development of chronic fissure. The differentiation between acute and chronic anal fissure is in fact a bit problematic, without much data to support those methods of telling acute from chronic fissure. It may depend largely on how carefully a patient is asked about past episodes of anal pain. Six reports focused exclusively on acute fissure (<LINK REF="STD-Antropoli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Antropoli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gaj-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gaj 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2006</LINK>) and four more report included both patients with acute and chronic fissure (<LINK REF="STD-Bacher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bacher 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ahmad-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmad 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Eshghi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eshghi 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yakoot-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yakoot 2009</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2011-06-20 23:05:23 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The specific non-surgical therapies tested in the identified studies, reviewed in this study, include nitroglycerin ointment or dermal patch - also known as NTG, GTN or glyceryl trinitrate (or analogues such as isosorbide dinitrate), botulinum toxin injection (Botox), anal dilators, calcium channel inhibitors (CCBs) delivered as ointment or tablets (diltiazem or nifedipine), bulk aperients (bran or other forms of fiber), hydrocortisone or topical anaesthetic ointments, principally lignocaine and clove oil, an amino acid (L-arginine), sitz baths and three additional smooth muscle relaxants, indoramin, sildenafil and minoxidil. In some reports the medical therapy was compared to the outcome of the gold standard therapy for anal fissure, partial lateral internal sphincterotomy. In some cases the comparisons were to placebo, others to standard palliative medical therapy and in others two new therapies were directly compared. Placebo therapy in most reports meant "best supportive care", which might include fiber supplements, Sitz baths or lubricants, applied sometimes equally to both groups (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Chaudhuri-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Chaudhuri 2001</LINK>), and sometimes only to the control group (<LINK REF="STD-Perrotti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrotti 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antropoli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Antropoli 1999</LINK>).</P>
</CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-08-28 17:09:07 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The two most broadly used outcomes of therapy were persistence of the fissure (which is used synonymously with persistence of anal pain, the measure of efficacy) and post treatment minor incontinence (the most commonly reported morbidity of operations for anal fissure; used synonymously with incontinence to flatus or anal seepage). Several authors have treated persistence and recurrence as separate outcomes. The natural history of anal fissure makes this a difficult distinction. Anal fissures typically wax and wane, even with morphologic healing occurring between "attacks". So a recurrence of pain and the anatomic finding of a fissure after a period of healing and amelioration of symptoms following treatment may be a "recurrence" or "persistence". The differentiation seems trivial and in either case amounts to treatment failure. In addition, more major defecation dysfunction was assessed, including incontinence to liquid and solid stool. Other adverse events analysed specific to the medical therapies included headache with nitroglycerin, allergy or anaphylaxis in patients having repeated botulinum toxin injection or pain or infection at the injection site. Though mortality or haemorrhage have not been reported in this condition, these were sought.<BR/>Additional endpoints frequently reported are relief of pain and anorectal manometric measurement of sphincter resting and squeeze pressure. Both these endpoints are difficult to compare between studies since different scales, equipment and standards of observation were used in each of the studies in which they were employed. Since anal fissure has such a distinctive appearance, its healing is the most objective and standardizable measure of efficacy available and will be the principal measure of effect in the meta-analysis. The timing of the observation is problematic because of the cyclical nature of fissure described above. The best studies had follow-up periods that lasted over a year, though it was unusual for 100% of study participants to be followed that long in any study.</P>

<P>The National Library of Medicine online PubMed search engine (www.nlm.nih.gov) was used to locate all published reports using the key words: "anal fissure, randomized". English language was not a restriction in the search. In this review PubMed was searched from 1966 to January, 2010. The list of cited references in all included reports also were used to find additional comparative studies. The Cochrane Library was searched in May 2010 (issue 2), and the CCCG specialised trials register was searched in May 2010.<BR/>In addition proceedings of relevant meetings were screened for presentations not yet in print, focusing on the last three years and prospectively. Such meetings included the annual meetings of the American Society of Colon &amp; Rectal Surgeons, The Int. Soc. of Univ. Colon &amp; Rectal Surgeons, Digestive Disease Week and other regional colorectal surgical societies.<BR/>Authors of some published reports were contacted, querying their awareness of ongoing studies.</P>

<P>75 randomized controlled trials were included in this review. The data available from some of these studies were sparse since they exist so far only in abstract from medical meeting booklets (<LINK REF="STD-Gecim-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Gecim 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oglesby-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oglesby 2001</LINK>). True cross-over designs were rare and were usually limited to treatment failures (<LINK REF="STD-Bassotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassotti 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 1999</LINK>). More frequently, treatment failures received partial lateral internal sphincterotomy, the gold standard therapy for anal fissure whether (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Libertiny-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Libertiny 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Oettle-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Oettle 1997</LINK>) , or not (<LINK REF="STD-Altomare-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Altomare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gough 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zuberi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zuberi 2000</LINK>), if sphincterotomy was an arm of the protocol. The total number of patients encompassed by these 75 RCTs was 5031. This is the second update of this review,which is rapidly growing. Of the 23 new studies, 15 are GTN based. Insofar as GTN may be considered the gold standard medical therapy, this is appropriate, though its superiority to placebo is marginal enough that placebo controlled trials of new medications are justifiable. Six of the trials repeat previously published comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Jawaid-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jawaid 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Suknaic-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Suknaic 2008</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Shrivastava-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Shrivastava 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nasr-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nasr 2010</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Siddique-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Siddique 2008</LINK>,).

<STUDY_QUALITY MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:22:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>By far the most prevalent quality problem encountered in this review was failure to analyze results of the investigations on an "intention to treat" basis. Authors' conclusions were based far more often on broken randomizations. Fortunately crude data were presented in almost all of the reports so that, in this meta-analysis, "intention to treat" will be used. It is noted when adherence to this technique is not possible in both situations when this occurs (<LINK REF="STD-Tander-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Tander 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kenny-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Kenny 2001</LINK>), both studies focused upon children.<BR/>The technique of randomization was specified in 46.7 % of the RCTs. Allocation concealment was specified in 74.7% of the studies. Blinding of the person rating outcome was used in 46.7 % of investigations, though it was clearly not possible when, for instance, surgery was compared to ointment (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).<BR/>Drop-outs were less frequent in this review than in some reports of the Surgery for Anal Fissure <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK> review, and when they occurred, they were counted as treatment failures in the meta-analysis. Two reports had them at a high frequency (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weinstein-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Weinstein 2004</LINK>). One major problem arose in two studies comparing surgery to GTN (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2000</LINK>) regarding estimates of the efficacy of surgical sphincterotomy in curing anal fissure. Using "intention to treat" and categorizing all unevaluated patients as treatment failures, a number of individuals were categorized as treatment failures because they did not get a sphincterotomy after randomization, due either to refusal or the fissures were found to be healed in these individuals. The surgical procedures therefore were terminated and they were excluded from follow-up. This was an error on both authors' parts. The individuals, if sphincterotomy could not be rationalized at the first setting, should have had continued follow-up and sphincterotomy applied if needed at a later date. Even if the operation were never done, their outcomes should have been recorded. To find a healed fissure at surgery is not an unexpected course of events, because of the waxing/waning nature of anal fissures, and indeed the rate at which this occurred in these reports (<LINK REF="STD-Evans-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Evans 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Richard-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Richard 2000</LINK>) approximates the expected placebo response rate (35%). The result of this error is an underestimate of the efficacy of surgery in curing fissure (71% and 74% respectively, compared to &gt; 95% in most reports) , though in the meta-analysis, surgery still fared much better than medical alternatives (Comparison &amp; Data Tables (CDT) 2-1, 16-1, 22-6, 29-1).<BR/>When, in some reports, placebo response rates for fissure healing were far below the expected level, quality concern also arose. This was especially true in four reports (<LINK REF="STD-Lund-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lund 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonmez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sonmez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Perrotti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrotti 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moghimi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moghimi 2006</LINK>), in which the placebo response rate was far less than 10%, more than two standard deviations below the mean response rate for the entire group in which they resided: placebo, or the overall placebo response rate for all studies - 34%. Exclusion of these reports did not have a significant effect on the outcome of GTN vs. Placebo in adults (13-1, 22-3) but it did in GTN vs. Placebo in children (12-1, 22-2). Both ends of the Perrotti comparison (<LINK REF="STD-Perrotti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrotti 2002</LINK>) (CDT 10-1) are outliers, nifedipine appearing far more efficacious than in other studies, and hydrocortisone falling well below the placebo response rate, and so this a result is not to be given any weight.</P>
<P>There are a number of interventions that have only been investigated in single trials, with few patients and short follow up. They include indoramine (<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 2001</LINK>), arginine (<LINK REF="STD-Eshghi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eshghi 2007</LINK>), sildenifil (<LINK REF="STD-Moghimi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moghimi 2006</LINK>), Sitrz baths (<LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2006</LINK>), "healer cream", the precise nature of which is not specified by the authors (<LINK REF="STD-Yakoot-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yakoot 2009</LINK>), oral diltiazem (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>), botox injection site (<LINK REF="STD-Maria-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maria 2000</LINK>), anal injectors for GTN (<LINK REF="STD-Torrabadella-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Torrabadella 2006</LINK>), minoxidil (<LINK REF="STD-Muthukumarassamy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Muthukumarassamy 2005</LINK>), home dilation (<LINK REF="STD-Gaj-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gaj 2006</LINK>), clove oil (<LINK REF="STD-Elwkeel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Elwkeel 2007</LINK>) The Moghimi trial was the only one to analyse the efficacy of sildenafil vs placebo.<BR/>Significant statistical heterogeneity was encountered in 4 primary analyses (CDTs 1-1 GTN vs. Placebo; 3-1 GTN vs. Botox; 7-1 Botox vs. Placebo; 16-1 Any Operation vs. Any Medical Therapy ). The sensitivity analyses described above were done to investigate the source of the heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Statistical heterogeneity was found in only four comparisons; GTN versus placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>), All medical therapies versus surgery (<LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>), GTN versus botox (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) and botox versus placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>). The first of these, being the most important comparison in this review, was investigated in a number of sensitivity analyses to locate possible clinical differences such as age, duration of follow up and study size (<LINK REF="CMP-012.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-022.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.3</LINK>,<LINK REF="CMP-022.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.4</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-022.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.7</LINK> ), with no success. A sensitivity analysis of (<LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>), eliminating (<LINK REF="STD-Mishra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mishra 2005</LINK>) resolved the heterogeneity without altering the summary statistics. In a sensitivity analysis of (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), eliminating studies with abnormally high non-healing rates (<LINK REF="CMP-022.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.5</LINK>) did not completely resolve the heterogeneity. The source of the heterogeneity in (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) is clearly the study by (<LINK REF="STD-Siproudhis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Siproudhis 2003</LINK>), though clinical justification for elimination of this study were not found.</P>
<P>Combining all CDTs in which a placebo is used as the comparison group, the healing rate in the placebo group is 33%, a level of response that is fairly uniform across studies (standard deviation &lt; 10%). The medications being tested in this meta-analysis must have their efficacy viewed in this context of placebo effect and also in the context of a cure rate of surgery that exceeds 95% (Nelson 2001). When a reported placebo cure rate (or inversely non-healing rates) is less than 10% (or exceeds 90%), the quality of that study must be questioned (<LINK REF="STD-Lund-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Lund 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sonmez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sonmez 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Perrotti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrotti 2002</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moghimi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moghimi 2006</LINK>) and analyses conducted both with and without (<LINK REF="CMP-022.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-022.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-022.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-022.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.4</LINK>) inclusion of these studies. The high reported placebo response rate is most likely due to the waxing/waning nature of anal fissure, so a reported fissure healing only 6 weeks after an intervention may have had little to do with the intervention. This effect is best demonstrated in the (<LINK REF="STD-Arroyo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arroyo 2005</LINK>) trial in which a botox group had in 40 patients, six recurrences at two months, six more at six months and 10 more at one year. Thus a cure rate of 85% at two months became 45% at one year. Duration of follow up therefore is a major quality issue in fissure trials and only 20% of the included trials reported follow-up data of 6 months or more (<LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>).</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2012-01-05 15:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A total of 75 different Forrest plots are contained in this meta-analysis to describe the ability of medical therapies to heal anal fissure that have been reported in 75 RCTs. The total number of pharmacologic agents employed includes 15 (glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide mono &amp; dinitrate, botulinum toxin (botox), the calcium channel blockers (CCB) diltiazem and nifedipine, hydrocortisone, lignocaine, bran, indoramin, minoxidil, clove oil, L-arginine, sildenafil, "healer cream" and placebo) as well as dilators, sitz baths and surgical sphincterotomy. One RCT compared different GTN preparations on a manometric assessment of the anal canal in patients with fissure without assessing healing (<LINK REF="STD-Bassotti-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Bassotti 2000</LINK>). Many of these RCTs can be divided temporally into two groups. The first are those published 1997 and before. In these the test medication principally lubricates, numbs or decreases inflammation in the anal canal. In those published 1997 and after medications that are thought to decrease the hypertonia of the anal canal muscles - specifically the internal anal sphincter, though comparisons in children lagged a bit beyond this date (<LINK REF="CMP-017.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 17.1</LINK>). Lignocaine, bran and hydrocortisone are generally regarded as no more curative than placebo today. Though they were investigated with some success, especially for acute fissure in the 1980s (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987</LINK>), they have fared no better than placebo in more recent trials (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-031.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 31.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-039.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 39.1</LINK> )</P>
<P>
<B>GTN vs. Placebo</B>
</P>
<P>The largest study group is GTN compared with placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>). There are 18 RCTs (1315 patients) of which 4 include only children (165 children). GTN is a vasodilator smooth muscle relaxant used traditional to dilate coronary arteries. In a diluted form, 0.2% - 0.4%, it is applied directly to the anus to dilate the internal sphincter two to three times daily for six to eight weeks.<BR/>GTN is found to be significantly better than placebo in healing anal fissure in the combined analysis and in all sensitivity analyses related to adults (13-1, 22-3), except when only the 3 largest studies are considered (<LINK REF="CMP-022.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.7</LINK>), the only comparison in adults that does not have statistical heterogeneity. In children the significant benefit of GTN therapy is lost when a study with an abnormally low placebo response rate is excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Sonmez-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sonmez 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-022.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.2</LINK>). The overall healing rate for GTN in these 18 studies is 48.9 % and the placebo healing rate reported is 35.5%, so the advantage of GTN, though significant, is not great. All studies looked only at chronic anal fissure and all studies were plagued by short follow up. Two case series with long follow up have reported recurrence rates of patients apparently cured of fissure by GTN of 51% (<LINK REF="REF-Jonas-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jonas 2002</LINK>) and 67% (<LINK REF="REF-Graziano-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graziano 2001</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<B>GTN vs. Other Comparisons: Botox, CCBs, Lignocaine, home dilators, Surgery</B>
</P>
<P>Six other comparisons are made with GTN in this review: vs. Botox, CCBs, Lignocaine, "healer cream", home dilators and partial lateral internal sphincterotomy. There was no statistical advantage to either Botox or CCBs (or disadvantage) when compared to GTN (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, 334 patients; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>, 365 patients) and the statistical heterogeneity seen in the Botox comparison (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>) diminishes a biy when a single outlier study is excluded, due to a response rate in excess of 90% (<LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-022.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.5</LINK>). The heterogeneity does not disappear unless all studies favoring botox are excluded (<LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Uluutku-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Uluutku 2001</LINK>) Comparing GTN to Lignocaine (<LINK REF="CMP-014.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 14.1</LINK>) there is a statistical advantage to GTN therapy, confirming the placebo status of lignocaine, i.e., pain relief alone is insufficient to heal a fissure (see below). Patients having an operation for anal fissure have a far greater likelihood of cure than after GTN therapy (6 studies, 343 patients: <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-022.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.6</LINK> ) a cure that will securely be maintained over time (<LINK REF="CMP-029.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 29.1</LINK>, 204 patients). Similarly all studies looked at chronic anal fissure and with short follow up, except for <LINK REF="STD-di-Visconte-2006" TYPE="STUDY">di Visconte 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Libertiny-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Libertiny 2002</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Parellada-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Parellada 2004</LINK> (<LINK REF="CMP-029.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 29.1</LINK>), and (<LINK REF="STD-deNardi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">deNardi 2006</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> ). In (<LINK REF="CMP-030.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 30.1</LINK>, 72 patients) GTN is compared to self anal dilation at home, not classified as anal dilator therapy in other studies (where it was done in surgery: <LINK REF="STD-Boschetto-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Boschetto 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gough-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Gough 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1983</LINK>). In this analysis there was statistical advantage to dilator therapy over GTN. Receiving both together also demonstrated a benefit (<LINK REF="CMP-043.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 43.1</LINK>). In addition, there was significantly more headaches in the GTN group and no reported minor incontinence in either group.</P>
<P>
<B>GTN Dose and location of application</B>
</P>
<P>Three studies looked at the ability of various doses of topical GTN ointment to cure anal fissure ( 278 patients; <LINK REF="CMP-027.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 27.1</LINK>) and found that dose made no difference in cure, doses varying between 0.05% and 0.4% GTN. One study compared topical vs intra-anal injection of GTN (<LINK REF="CMP-035.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 35.1</LINK>, 22patients) with no difference in results. Two studies compared GTN applied topical around the anus or by dermal patch at a distant location (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>, 131 patients). No difference was seen in efficacy or risk of adverse events (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>), being headache with GTN. This is a very significant analysis.</P>
<P>
<B>GTN Headache</B>
</P>
<P>The principal adverse event related to GTN use, besides lack of efficacy and recurrence of fissure, is headache; a headache so severe the it causes many patients to abandon therapy. In all comparison of GTN with other therapies, GTN was associated with a statistical increased risk of headache (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The risk of headache in the studies combined is 30%. Headache was also reported as a problem effecting compliance with Indoramin (<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 2001</LINK>), oral Nifedipine (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>) and oral Diltiazem (<LINK REF="STD-Jonas-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Jonas 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Botox</B>
</P>
<P>Botulinum toxin is thought of principally as a striated muscle relaxant, used to treat muscle hypertonia and cosmetic disorders. For fissure there are many published techniques involving injection of anywhere from 10 to 100 units at various locations around the anal canal, though it is usually applied on either side of the fissure directly into the internal sphincter, a smooth muscle. Botulinum toxin (botox) injection into the internal sphincter curiously was found in combined analyses to be no better or worse than GTN (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>, 334 patients), and surprisingly also no better than placebo (<LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>, 136 patients), though a sensitivity analysis of this comparison did favour Botox over placebo by excluding (<LINK REF="STD-Siproudhis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Siproudhis 2003</LINK>). There is however no clinical reason to exclude (<LINK REF="STD-Siproudhis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Siproudhis 2003</LINK>). Botox did not fare as well as surgery in curing fissure (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>, 365 patients, 5 studies). In addition it has been found that recurrence of healed fissure exceeds 50% after one year (<LINK REF="STD-Arroyo-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arroyo 2005</LINK>) in one RCT and 40% in a case series (<LINK REF="REF-Minguez-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Minguez 2002</LINK>). Neither the dose (<LINK REF="CMP-009.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 9.1</LINK>) or the type of Botox (<LINK REF="CMP-023.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 23.1</LINK>) injected has been found to alter healing rates. Both these latter analyses had healing rates far greater than 90%, a level not seen by most investigators, and greatly affected the overall healing rate related to Botox in all studies in which Botox formed one arm (76.8%). Without the studies in these two analyses the overall healing rate was 67.5%. Anaphylaxis has not been reported with repeated Botox use (<LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Botox is clearly problematic, working far better in some investigators' hands than others. This may in part be explained by what is perhaps the most interesting study in this update: (<LINK REF="STD-Maria-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Maria 2000</LINK>). This looks at the effect of injecting botox either posteriorly, where most fissures are located, or anteriorly in the anal canal, with the anterior site being more effective (<LINK REF="CMP-044.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 44.1</LINK>). This result is not widely known.</P>
<P>
<B>Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)</B>
</P>
<P>The two drugs used in this classification are diltiazem and nifedipine, both antihypertensive vasodilators, each given for fissure either orally or topically in different studies. In comparison to GTN there was no significant difference in efficacy, though this was a clinically heterogeneous group of studies (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>; 365 patients), with 4 using diltiazem, 1 using nifedipine topically and 2 using nifedipine orally. In a single report there was not a significant benefit to either Botox or CCB (oral nifedipine) (<LINK REF="CMP-028.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 28.1</LINK>; 50 patients). There were insignificant trends that favoured both Botox and GTN over CCBs in the above comparisons. CCBs fared far better in comparison to lignocaine (<LINK REF="CMP-015.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 15.1</LINK>; 283 patients) and hydrocortisone (<LINK REF="CMP-010.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 10.1</LINK>; 110 patients - a study with significant quality issues - see (<LINK REF="STD-Perrotti-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Perrotti 2002</LINK>)above in Risk of Bias) ointments. Both these latter studies had cure rates well above all other studies. Cure rates were on the other hand consistently far higher with surgical sphincterotomy than with CCBs (<LINK REF="CMP-024.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 24.1</LINK>, 196 patients), however quality issues are raised with the <LINK REF="STD-Katsinelos-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Katsinelos 2006</LINK> study, with its 100% cure rate for surgery and &gt;90% cure rate for topical nifedipine. If excluding this study for sensitivity analysis, we are left with only <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>, with a very high drop out rate (17/41) in the oral nifedipine group due to side effects and continued anal pain. There are no studies with follow-up over 1 year of CCBs to assess their recurrence rates accurately.</P>
<P>
<B>Surgery</B>
</P>
<P>Special aspects of surgery are the subject of a separate review. As noted above patients having an operation had a much higher cure rate than with any form of medical therapy, this being true in spite of the cure rate being understated in the combined analysis due to drop outs for the surgical group (see above). The combined healing rate is 89% in these analyses and one would expect it to be in excess of 95%. The risk of anal incontinence was 9% in the surgical group and not significantly different from the GTN group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; 384 patients). In the Botox comparison, incontinence occurred in 10% (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>), though in one report (<LINK REF="STD-Iswariah-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Iswariah 2005</LINK>) the incontinence rates were reported as equal between the Botox and surgery groups, though no numbers are given. In the comparison of Surgery to CCBs (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2005</LINK>) incontinence scores were lower (better) in the surgery group. Recurrence developed in 3/102 patients with follow-up more than 1 year (<LINK REF="CMP-029.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 29.1</LINK>) and in no patients in a case series (<LINK REF="REF-Rotholtz-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rotholtz 2005</LINK>) after 2 years. Statistical heterogeneity was not a great problem in the surgical comparisons. Where it did occur (<LINK REF="CMP-016.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 16.1</LINK>), exclusion of one small study resolved the heterogeneity (<LINK REF="STD-Mishra-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Mishra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-022.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 22.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Indoramin &amp; Minoxidil</B>
</P>
<P>These two smooth muscle relaxers were tested in small RCTs and neither found to be effective in healing fissure (<LINK REF="STD-Pitt-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Pitt 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Muthukumarassamy-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Muthukumarassamy 2005</LINK>). The same is true of arginine (<LINK REF="STD-Eshghi-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Eshghi 2007</LINK>), whereas results are strong enough for clove oil, sildenifil and healer cream to suggest that further studies of these agents may be worth doing (<LINK REF="STD-Elwkeel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Elwkeel 2007</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Moghimi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moghimi 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Yakoot-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Yakoot 2009</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-031.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 31.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-034.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 34.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-039.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 39.1</LINK>)</P>
<P>
<B>Acute Anal Fissure</B>
</P>
<P>Acute Fissure was the focus of five reports (<LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jensen-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Jensen 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1983" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1983</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gaj-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gaj 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Gupta-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gupta 2006</LINK>) and comprised 2/3rds of the patients in another (<LINK REF="STD-Bacher-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Bacher 1997</LINK>). These are for the most part older studies and/or involving pretty much obsolete therapies: lignocaine, bran, hydrocortisone, sitz baths and dilators (<LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-019.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 19.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-020.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 20.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-021.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 21.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-030.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 30.1</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-033.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 33.1</LINK>) . There is also the only prophylaxis study in this group (<LINK REF="CMP-018.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 18.1</LINK>, 60 patients), in which bran was found to be more effective than placebo in preventing acute fissure recurrence.</P>
<P>Additional outcomes were often presented, but in scales that differed between reports, making quantitative amalgamation and analyses of these endpoints inadvisable. The outcomes included amount of or time to pain relief, which generally correlated well with fissure healing, and anorectal manometry. The reason for inclusion of manometric measurement was to demonstrate that the test medication could lower sphincter pressure as well as heal the fissure. This test was employed at different times in the course of therapy in almost every report in which it was presented, usually without specifying equipment used or normal ranges or blinding of the investigators as to subject status. Further emphasizing the importance of the placebo effect in these trials, in the original report of medical therapy, 7 of 11 RCTs in which manometry was done (<LINK REF="STD-Altomare-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Altomare 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Antropoli-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Antropoli 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brisinda-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Brisinda 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kennedy-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Kennedy 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maria-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Maria 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Werre-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Werre 2001</LINK>), the resting pressure fell more than 10 millimetres of mercury in the control group during the trial. Significant pain relief was also noted in the control groups during most trials. A golden opportunity was missed in not presenting individual patient data of fissure outcome and manometric data. This could have served to validate a physiologic assessment that is broadly employed, but not previously well validated in this setting. That is, is there an absolute sphincter pressure that is associated with fissure presence and a specific pressure drop associated with fissure healing? Are similar individual pressures and responses encountered in acute fissure or in children?</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-01-05 15:29:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical therapies applied to anal fissure prior to the use of GTN, Botox and CCBs were generally thought of as short term palliation for fissure symptoms, inefficient in obtaining a long term cure, and were replaced by surgery for the long term management of anal fissure (<LINK REF="REF-Goligher-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goligher 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2001</LINK>), except for acute fissure and fissure in children. By the late 1990s, when alternatives to surgery were sought because of cost, time for recovery and risk of incontinence, rather than turn back to these older therapies, newer medications were therefore sought, in each case a medication that is known to relieve hypertonia of the anal sphincter muscle.</P>
<P>This has become a large and very complex review. Because of the large number of comparisons, with 75 Forest plots, an attempt has been made to summarize the results in (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). In some cases apparent outstanding results were found due to abberent results in the comparison group, as with sildenafil (<LINK REF="STD-Moghimi-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Moghimi 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>, <LINK REF="CMP-034.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 34.1</LINK> ) Because of the large number and diffuse nature of the comparisons in this review, the temptation exists to infer significant relationships by analogy, i.e., if "a" is better than "b" and "b" is better than or equivalent to "c", then "a" must be better than "c". So one might infer that GTN, CCBs, Botox, hydrocortisone and bran are all effective therapies for anal fissure because they have been found to be superior to lignocaine in a series of comparisons or equivalent to each other and lignocaine is reported to be nearly equivalent to a placebo. Yet placebo controlled examinations of GTN and Botox would suggest otherwise, and bran and hydrocortisone have not been examined in this regard in many years. In fact the mathematical basis for that assumption has been discussed and found to be lacking (<LINK REF="REF-Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Baker 2003</LINK>) Cost comparisons were not done in any study, though Botox is known to be quite expensive. In light of the efficacy demonstrated in these analyses, cost needs to be assessed, including the costs related to late recurrence.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:21:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-09-12 18:26:28 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Medical therapy for chronic anal fissure, acute fissure and fissure in children may be applied with a chance of cure that is marginally but significantly better than placebo. The risk of using such therapies is not great, being mainly headache during GTN, or oral CCB use, and without apparent long term adverse effect. But these adverse events can be debilitating during therapy. GTN, Botox or CCBs might therefore be used in individuals wanting to avoid surgical therapy, with surgery being reserved for treatment failures. Late recurrence after medical therapy is common. There is no evidence that surgery should be used as definitive therapy for fissure in children or acute anal fissure. It is worth noting that GTN applied as a dermal patch remote from the anus was as effective as GTN applied to the area of the fissure. Why do people have to apply GTN to their anus? Might it not be just as effective applied to the thigh or abdomen, and cleaner?</P>
<P>Despite an almost 50% increase in the number of included studies in this update, there is very little to suggest in clinical practice that differs from the previous review. The only possible change might be the location of Botox injection into the anterior anal canal, though this is based upon only one small study.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2012-01-04 15:21:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Botox and topical application of CCBs have been shown to be as effective as GTN in the treatment of anal fissure, usually without the risk of headache, which many patients find unacceptably painful. This is now a well studied field and it is unlikely that further placebo controlled trials of GTN will change its record of rather mediocre ability to cure fissure, nor is it likely that Botox or CCBs will be found in the future to be much more effective. Newer agents are being tested, but two of them have been found ineffective; minoxidil and indoramin. Does that mean the smooth muscle relaxation using pharmacologic agents will never be more than 50% effective in curing fissure? It would seem with the number and breadth of studies performed that this is the case and future research should be directed towards a different mechanism of fissure healing. This is especially true since the risk of incontinence related to surgery is declining in a recently updated Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2011</LINK>). Also, though more appropriately placed in the surgery review, the nature and optimal therapy of incontinence after partial lateral internal sphincterotomy for anal fissure needs to be investigated. There is too much disparity between reported incontinence rates cited above and quality of life assessments after sphincterotomy (<LINK REF="REF-Hyman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hyman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mentes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mentes 2006</LINK>) which demonstrates the high satisfaction patients have with surgery. .</P>

<FEEDBACK_SUMMARY>
<P>1. This large and complex review usefully assesses the efficacy of the various medical treatments for chronic anal fissure, but it omits some important details.<BR/> <BR/>2. The conclusion is too general to help clinicians or patients in choosing a medical treatment. The first sentence of the conclusion lumps together all the treatments for acute and chronic anal fissure in adults and children. I suggest that it would be better to discuss the trials in adults and children separately, because the natural history of CAF (and AAF) differs in these groups; they also concern different (though overlapping) groups of clinicians. The word 'marginally' seems grudging, and a personal value judgment. It would be desirable to use the best and most reliable trials of each treatment to calculate the Number Needed to Treat. This is especially important for the treatment tested in the largest number of trials, GTN ointment.<BR/> <BR/>The finding that GTN offers the possibility of avoiding surgery distinguishes it from other applications, which have only symptomatic lubricant, local anaesthetic, or anti-inflammatory effects. This deserves explicit discussion in the conclusion.<BR/> <BR/>3. Background This seems too compressed and could be written in a more logical sequence. The important factors in the causation of anal fissures and in their chronicity do not come out clearly: they are spasm, ischaemia, ulceration and inflammation.<BR/> <BR/>4. Methodological Quality The various important and interesting methodological shortcomings discussed pointed to heterogeneity among several groups of trials, but the review does not explore possible explanations for apparently discordant results. Some are obvious: CDT 1-1 GTN vs placebo includes two trials (Tankova and Werre) of isosorbide, which is not GTN and should be considered separately. There were other specific reasons for excluding a particular trial from a meta-analysis. For example the trial by Altomare (2000) found no difference between 4 weeks treatment with GTN 0.2% ointment 12-hourly and placebo. Two features which could explain this finding are that (1) the total quantity of ointment applied was much less than in other trials: 200mg twice a day; (2) the results were evaluated after 4 weeks of treatment, sooner than in the trials that found a difference. <BR/> <BR/>The identification of heterogeneity is only one step towards clarifying why trial results differ. <BR/>A further step is needed to find reasons for the differences that make some trials less reliable than others. If such reasons are found, then it seems justified to exclude the less reliable ones in estimating treatment effectiveness. Eg, in CDT 1 exclusion of the Altomare trial would raise the estimate of GTN effectiveness from the better quality trials.<BR/> <BR/>5. Headache is a well known effect of GTN and is dose-related. It is not adequately reported and discussed, partly because the included trials give little or no detail of when it occurred in the course of treatment, how it was managed, and with what results. Were any patients told, for example, that if headache was troublesome, they should reduce the dose for a day or two? Severe headache with GTN is largely avoidable if patients are helped to titrate the dose; the remark in the conclusions that "these adverse events can be debilitating" wrongly implies that nothing can be done to minimise them.<BR/> <BR/>6. The Perrotti study compared nifedipine ointment with 1% hydrocortisone ointment. The difference between them was extreme, but the review suggests no explanation, merely noting "this a result is not to be given any weight" [sic]. However it was unwise to use topical hydrocortisone for comparison because it is well known to inhibit healing: it is therefore not a suitable control treatment. The study would be better excluded from the review.<BR/> <BR/>[7a. The review contains no acknowledgements: did the author have no help from anyone?<BR/>7b. The text and tables of the review contain many typographical errors - I will send details to the CRG office.]</P>

<P>Some of the comments relate to writing style, and will be dealt with shortly.<BR/>Regarding the worries about heterogeneity, this is a large and unwieldy review with a tremendously heterogenious group of studies. A total of 48 Forest plots are presented, the vast majority of them being sub-group analyses and sensitivity analyses exploring many of the aspects of heterogeneity encountered in the review, both relating to clinical variations between groups and quality issues such as length of follow-up. None of these analyses change the basic findings: that GTN works some of the time, but not often achieves permanent cure. Botox and calcium channel blockers are no better nor have any studies carefully examined an ideal sequence of therapies in those people not wanting surgery.<BR/>Headache? As stated, it is briefly mentioned and never studied. There is much common practice, especially in the US directed at diminishing headache incidence or severity, none of it subjected to clinical trials.<BR/>Perotti? There have in the past been excellent rationales for using hydrocortisone for those that regarded fissure as having an inflammatory etiology.<BR/>Getting back to quality, there is not among these studies a nice dichotomous division between high and low quality studies. Most have significant flaws. In any case, though quality assessment is central to the Cochrane process, its implementation remains controversial. Again this review is replete (though many more subgroup analyses could have been depicted - and in fact are alluded to in the text) with subgroup analyses that explore how results might vary. And the results don't vary much.<BR/>I think the clinical guidelines offered at the end are crystal clear. The data certainly support the term "marginal" benefit of GTN, with less than a 50% early healing rate, compared to 37% healing with placebo and only a 25% long term healing rate.</P>
