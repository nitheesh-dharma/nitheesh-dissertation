<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-21 12:31:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Heparin in intravenous fluids may reduce IV tube changes needed for newborn babies in neonatal intensive care, but more research is needed to determine its safety. Babies in neonatal intensive care often need fluids intravenously (through a tube inserted into a vein). Sometimes the intravenous (IV) tube becomes blocked, as the blood clots and skin becomes swollen. Bacteria can also enter and cause serious infection. Regularly changing the tube (and which vein is used) can reduce some problems, but babies have few usable veins. The drug heparin used in the IV fluids could reduce blockages by thinning the blood, but it can have serious adverse effects. The review of trials found that more research is needed to determine whether heparin in IV fluids is advantageous for neonates without causing side effects.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-11-28 16:20:38 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Ten eligible studies were identified. Heparin was administered either as a flush solution or as an additive to the total parenteral nutrition solution. Five studies reported data on the duration of use of the first catheter. Two of these studies found no statistically significant effect of heparin; two studies showed a statistically significant increase and one study showed a statistically significant decrease in the duration of PIV catheter use in the heparin group. There were marked differences between the studies in terms of the methodological quality, the dose, the timing, the route of administration of heparin and the outcomes reported. The results were not combined for meta-analysis. Individual studies did not report any significant differences between the heparin and the placebo/no treatment groups in the risks of infiltration, phlebitis and intracranial haemorrhage.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:04:10 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Intravenous infusion of drugs, fluids and nutrients has become an indispensable practice in present day medical care (<LINK REF="REF-Maki-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maki 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tager-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tager 1983</LINK>). Venous cannulation via peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters is the simplest and most frequently used method for administration of an infusion. It is associated with inherent complications (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1991</LINK>) which can be mechanical or infectious (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tager-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tager 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bossert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bossert 1994</LINK>). Mechanical complications include thrombosis, dislodgement, extravasation, leakage, phlebitis and scar formation (<LINK REF="REF-Nieto_x002d_Rodrig-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nieto-Rodrig 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tomford-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomford 1984</LINK>). Infectious complications include bacterial or fungal sepsis (<LINK REF="REF-Graham-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Graham 1991</LINK>). Thrombosis or phlebitis at the catheter site can act as a nidus for infection. Factors associated with the risk of these complications include duration of infusion, site of infusion, size and type of catheter, rate of flow through catheter, turbulence of fluid flow and characteristics of patients and infusate (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Krafte_x002d_Jacobs-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krafte-Jacobs 1995</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:43:03 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There have been various attempts to prevent or reduce PIV catheter related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Hecker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hecker 1992</LINK>). These include designated intravenous therapy teams (<LINK REF="REF-Tomford-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomford 1984</LINK>), frequent change in the site of catheters, placement of in-line filters (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1994</LINK>), topical use of glyceryl trinitrate (<LINK REF="REF-Tighe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tighe 1995</LINK>), hydrocortisone (<LINK REF="REF-Tighe-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tighe 1995</LINK>) or heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Vilardell-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vilardell 1999</LINK>), intermittent heparinised saline flush or lock and continuous infusion of heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Tanner-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tanner 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Daniell-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniell 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnstone-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnstone 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a neonate, frequent change in catheter site at predetermined timings is technically challenging. In addition, repeated attempts at cannulation break the skin barrier and predispose these patients to infection by commensals in the skin such as coagulase negative staphylococcus. Such infections can be life threatening in neonates. PIV catheters are often left in situ in neonates until complications arise (<LINK REF="STD-Moclair-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moclair 1995</LINK>). Therefore, methods that can prolong the duration of viability of these catheters may be beneficial in this population.</P>
<P>Heparin, an anticoagulant, has been administered as intermittent injection or continuous infusion to prevent thrombus formation and consequently prolong catheter patency (<LINK REF="STD-Moclair-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moclair 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bossert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bossert 1994</LINK>). However, significant effects of heparin on coagulation profiles have been observed (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Neill-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Neill 1974</LINK>), even at low dose. Other adverse effects associated with heparin use include allergic reactions, bleeding complications due to dosing error, intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Malloy-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Malloy 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lesko-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesko 1986</LINK>) and heparin induced thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Potter-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Potter 1992</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:03:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The effectiveness of heparin for prolongation of PIV catheter life has been systemically reviewed previously. <LINK REF="REF-Goode-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goode 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Peterson-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Peterson 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK> compared the efficacy of heparin versus normal saline in patients of all age groups. These reviews concluded that normal saline was as efficacious in prolonging catheter patency as heparin. However, only one study from these reviews studied neonates, so that the efficacy and safety of heparin was not ascertained specifically in neonates. Neonates are unique in their sensitivity and resistance to heparin (<LINK REF="REF-Vieira-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vieira 1991</LINK>) and in their higher propensity to develop intracranial haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Lesko-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lesko 1986</LINK>).</P>

<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2010-12-06 11:37:17 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of heparin administered as continuous infusion or intermittent injections, via PIV catheter, versus placebo or no treatment, on duration of catheter patency (defined as number of hours of catheter use) in neonates.</P>
<P>Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of heparin on:</P>
<P>A. Complications relating to PIV catheters:</P>
<P>1. Catheter blockage (defined as inability to infuse fluid or medication);</P>
<P>2. Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis developing at the site of or above the catheter (defined as pain, swelling, erythema or induration at the site of catheter with or without a palpable venous cord above the catheter site);</P>
<P>3. Catheter related sepsis (defined as signs and symptoms suggestive of sepsis with positive blood culture growing the same organism in samples obtained from venipuncture at a different sterile site and from the catheter or catheter tip);</P>
<P>4. Number of additional PIV catheter insertions.</P>
<P>B. Complications relating to heparin:<BR/>
<BR/>1. Abnormality of coagulation profile;</P>
<P>2. Incidence of allergic reactions to heparin;</P>
<P>3. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (development of thrombocytopenia {platelet count &lt; 150,000 per cubic litre} after starting heparin in an infant with previously normal platelet count after exclusion of all other causes of thrombocytopenia and positive serotonin release test {<LINK REF="REF-Warkentin-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warkentin 1990</LINK>});</P>
<P>4. Intraventricular/intracranial haemorrhage (development of recent onset of haemorrhage or extension of preexisting haemorrhage after starting heparin, according to the classification of <LINK REF="REF-Papile-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Papile 1978</LINK>).</P>
<P>C. Mortality</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses were planned a priori according to the method of heparin administration (continuous versus intermittent), and gestational age [preterm (less than 37 weeks gestation) versus term (more than or equal to 37 weeks gestation)]. A comparison of effects of different heparin doses was also planned if sufficient numbers of studies or trials using different dosage regimens were identified.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-12-06 11:38:58 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using the following key criteria: allocation concealment (blinding of randomisation), blinding of intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement/assessment. For each criterion, assessment was yes, no, can't tell. Two review authors separately assessed each study. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. This information was added to the Characteristics of Included Studies table. </P>
<P>For the update in 2010, the following issues were evaluated and entered into the Risk of Bias table:</P>
<P> (1) Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias). Was the allocation sequence adequately generated? For each included study, we categorized the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- adequate (any truly random process e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</P>
<P>- inadequate (any non random process e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias). Was allocation adequately concealed?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</P>
<P>- adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</P>
<P>- inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(3) Blinding (checking for possible performance bias). Was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study? At study entry? At the time of outcome assessment?</P>
<P>For each included study, we categorized the methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Blinding was assessed separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for participants;</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for personnel;</P>
<P>- adequate, inadequate or unclear for outcome assessors.</P>
<P>(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations). Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?</P>
<P>For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorized the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate (&lt; 20% missing data);</P>
<P>- inadequate (&#8805; 20% missing data):</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(5) Selective reporting bias. Are reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as:</P>
<P>- adequate (where it is clear that all of the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</P>
<P>- inadequate (where not all the study&#8217;s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);</P>
<P>- unclear.</P>
<P>(6) Other sources of bias. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?</P>
<P>For each included study, we described any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias (for example, whether there was a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent process). We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias as:</P>
<P>- yes; no; or unclear. </P>
<P>If needed, we planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.</P>

<P>Because a catheter may be changed owing to blockage, because of routine practice to avoid blockage, or because it is no longer needed, analysis of number of catheters used may not reflect an effect due to heparin use. Accordingly, we developed three potential approaches to statistical analysis. 1) We attempted to assess duration of the first catheter used by each patient and the reasons for discontinuation. Duration of patency before occlusion is a valid measure of effect. These data can be analysed using mean difference in duration between the treated and untreated patients, or if hazard ratios are reported in the individual trials, these can be analysed using the relative risk statistical procedure for meta-analysis. 2) If there are several catheters per patient, with different durations of patency for each and they are known to have become occluded, the mean duration of all catheters for each patient were to be obtained and analysed as a mean of means. This procedure has the advantage of using more of each patient's data than simply relying on duration of the first catheter. 3) If trials report the number of occluded catheters for each patient, excluding those removed which were unoccluded, these data were to be analysed using the mean number of catheters used.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Alpan-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Alpan 1984</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial involving addition of heparin to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution in preterm infants. Preterm infants needing TPN were eligible for inclusion in the study. The treatment group received 1 IU/ml of heparin added to their TPN solution and the control group received no heparin in their TPN solution. All patients were cannulated using 22-gauge catheters. A total of 26 patients were enrolled, 13 infants in each group. These infants received 227 PIV catheters during the study period (105 in the heparin group and 122 in the control group) and all the catheters were managed according to the originally allocated policy. Baseline patient characteristics did not differ statistically significantly between the two groups. The duration of each catheter in situ was recorded. In addition, the incidences of phlebitis, local inflammation, intraventricular haemorrhage and septicaemia were reported. Only the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage was reported per patient and was used for this review; all other outcomes were reported per PIV catheter.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Golberg-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Golberg 1999</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial comparing intermittent flush of heparinized normal saline (4 IU/ml) with normal saline via PIV catheters in neonates. A total of 60 neonates were randomised; however, 13 infants were removed from the analysis because of possible contamination. Of the remaining 47 neonates 23 were randomised to the heparinised normal saline and 24 to normal saline group. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups. All patients received 24-gauge intravenous catheters. The duration of catheter patency and the incidence of phlebitis were the only outcomes used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Heilskov-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Heilskov 1998</LINK> performed a randomised double-blind controlled 3-arm trial in which neonates requiring PIV catheters were enrolled. Neonates who were receiving anticoagulant medication via another site were excluded. Ninety neonates were randomised to receive intermittent flush of low dose heparinised saline at 2 IU/ml (n = 28), high dose heparinized saline at 10 IU/ml (n = 35) or normal saline (n = 27) via PIV catheters. Only one catheter per patient was included in the study. Baseline patient characteristics were not statistically significantly different among groups. The duration of catheter patency and the incidence of PIV infiltration were reported in the study and were used for the purpose of this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Klenner-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Klenner 2003</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial involving addition of heparin to intravenous infusion fluids in neonates who were anticipated to need intravenous infusion for &gt; 5 days. Neonates &gt; 1 kg birth weight were eligible for inclusion in the study. The treatment group received 0.5 IU/ml of heparin added to their intravenous infusion solution and the control group received no heparin in their intravenous infusion solution. Patients were cannulated using 24 or 26 gauge catheters. A total of 296 patients were enrolled, 145 infants in heparin group and 151 patients in control group. These infants received 1257 PIV catheters during the study period (565 in the heparin group and 692 in the control group) and all the catheters were monitored carefully. The catheters were removed if there were signs of infection, phlebitis or extravasation. Baseline patient characteristics did not differ statistically significantly between the two groups. The duration of each catheter in situ was recorded. In addition, the incidences of phlebitis, infiltration/extravasation, thrombus formation and accidental dislodgement were reported. Patients were evaluated for heparin induced thrombocytopenia antibody assay at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days (108 patients from heparin group and 105 patients from the control group) and for intraventricular haemorrhage at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 days age if they were still in hospital. Outcomes were reported as per catheter. Additional outcomes on first catheter not reported were obtained from the study author.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Kotter-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kotter 1996</LINK> performed a randomised study comparing intermittent flush of heparinised saline (10 IU/ml) and normal saline via PIV catheters in neonates. Eighty-four neonates were enrolled, and data were collected for a total of 227 catheters. However, 109 of these catheters were excluded from the analysis because they were used for continuous infusion for a period of time before converting to intermittent use (heparin was not used for continuous infusion, so data from these catheters cannot be used for analysis), or were removed while patent. The authors reported data on the remaining 118 catheters from 51 patients. Each catheter was managed according to the patient's original group allocation. The primary outcome reported was duration (hours) of catheter patency. Other outcomes reported were incidence of catheter occlusion, phlebitis and leakage. All outcomes were reported per catheter and thus were not used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Moclair-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Moclair 1995</LINK> performed a randomised dose comparison study of heparin in neonates comparing the addition of various doses of heparin or no heparin to peripheral TPN solution. Patients receiving a central venous catheter during the study period were withdrawn from the study (the actual number not reported in the study). Ninety-seven neonates were randomised, but seven patients were excluded from analysis due to death or transfer to another hospital. The remaining 90 neonates were randomly allocated to one of five groups; 0.1 IU/ml heparin group (n = 15 with 35 PIV catheters), 0.25 IU/ml heparin group (n = 16 with 47 PIV catheters), 0.5 IU/ml heparin group (n = 23 with 61 PIV catheters), 1 IU/ml heparin group (n = 16 with 30 PIV catheters) and a heparin free control group (n = 20 with 72 PIV catheters). Subsequent catheters in the neonates were managed according to the original allocation. All neonates received 24-gauge catheters during the study. Baseline patient characteristics were not reported. Primary outcome was survival of PIV catheters, as indicated by number of PIV catheters required per neonate, duration of patency (hours) of each catheter, and the "survival curve" for catheter patency for each group. The duration of catheter patency was reported per number of catheters, and the authors were not able to provide the data on the first catheters only, so none of the outcome data were used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Mudge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mudge 1998</LINK> performed a quasi-randomised blinded trial comparing intermittent flush of heparinised saline (10 IU/ml) and normal saline via PIV catheters. Both neonatal and paediatric patients were included. A total of 61 patients with 134 PIV catheters were enrolled. Fifty-six catheters were flushed with heparinised saline and 78 with saline. The frequency of flushing was not controlled. The primary outcome was catheter duration, defined as the time from catheter insertion or conversion from continuous to intermittent infusion to catheter removal or conversion from intermittent to continuous infusion. Other outcomes reported were incidence of catheter-related complications (erythema, edema, occlusion, leakage, and discomfort). The author when contacted provided data on the 15 neonates in the heparin group and the 25 neonates in the saline group. Duration of catheter patency for the first catheter, incidence of catheter occlusion and incidence of phlebitis were used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Paisley-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Paisley 1997</LINK> performed a quasi-randomised study comparing heparinised saline flushes (0.6 ml of heparin solution containing 10 IU/ml of heparin) and 0.6 ml of normal saline via PIV catheters. Infants 32 weeks gestation or greater were eligible. Thirty-three infants received heparin and 54 patients received saline flushes. A total of 159 PIV catheters were studied. The data were reported per first PIV catheter and per all PIV catheters. Subsequent catheters in the same patient were managed according to the patient's original group allocation. The primary outcome was duration of catheter patency. Other outcomes reported were heparin induced thrombocytopenia, catheter blockade, phlebitis, infiltration and leaking. Duration of catheter patency and incidence of heparin induced thrombocytopenia were used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Schultz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schultz 2002</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial involving heparinised flushes vs normal saline flushes. Neonates &lt;30 days of age were eligible for inclusion in the study. Twenty patients received 0.5 ml of heparinised saline (2 IU/ml) flushes and twenty nine patients received 0.5 ml of normal saline flushes. All patients were cannulated using 24-gauge catheters. Only one catheter per patient were included in the study. Baseline patient characteristics did not differ statistically significantly between the two groups. The duration of each catheter in situ was recorded. In addition, the incidences of occlusion, phlebitis (redness and edema) and extravasation were reported and were used for this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Treas-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Treas 1992</LINK> performed a quasi-randomised study comparing heparinised saline (0.5 IU/ml) and normal saline via PIV catheters in neonates. All neonates were cannulated using size 24-gauge catheters. Only the first three catheters used in a neonate were included in the study. In the treatment group, heparin was added to a continuous infusion or as intermittent flush solution. In the control group, saline was used as intermittent flush solution. Sixty-three neonates with 131 PIV catheters were in the heparin group, and 49 neonates with 122 PIV catheters were in the control group. Subsequent catheters in the same patient were managed according to the patient's original group allocation. Baseline characteristics were not different between the two groups. The primary outcome was duration of catheter patency. Other outcomes reported were incidence of phlebitis, catheter-related infection, and bleeding. Outcomes were reported per catheter. The author (personal communication) provided data on the duration of patency for the first catheter and this was the only outcome used for this review.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:11:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is an extensive literature on the use of heparin to prolong the patency of PIV catheters. <LINK REF="REF-Randolph-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Randolph 1998</LINK> performed a systematic review on the use of heparin for PIV catheters in all age groups, and concluded that low dose heparin infusion was effective in prolonging patency of peripheral arterial catheters but not PIV catheters. The present review includes nine additional studies aiming to test the effectiveness of heparin use for PIV catheters in the neonatal population.</P>
<P>Two more studies were identified in this update in addition to eight studies identified in previous version (<LINK REF="REF-Shah-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shah 2002</LINK>). Despite large number of studies identified, the total number of neonatal patients included in this systematic review was 721. The methodology of the systematic review process was hampered by many studies reporting outcomes per catheter rather than per patient; this practice leads to non-independence of multiple measures of the same outcome in the same patients, and thus creates potential bias in data analysis. Therefore, in performing this review, only data from the first catheters were considered.</P>
<P>This review was further limited by the significant variability amongst included studies in clinical details, methodological quality, and outcomes reported, thus precluding the reviewers from combining data on the primary outcome to estimate an overall effect size. The dose and method of administration of heparin varied widely, with concentrations varying from 0.1 to 10 IU/ml of heparin administered as either intermittent flush solution or as an additive in parenteral nutrition solutions, and frequency of flush was not always specified by the investigators. Catheter size was not uniform across the studies and may have affected the duration of catheter patency or the likelihood of the complications. The methodological quality of studies were variable, from randomised, double-blinded controlled trials to quasi-randomised studies, with some studies having inadequate or no blinding of intervention or outcome assessment, and incomplete follow up. The outcomes reported were different among the studies. Although seven of the ten studies reported on the primary outcome of PIV catheter patency, few reported on secondary outcomes such as short and long term adverse effects of heparin, or complications related to PIV catheter insertions. It is noteworthy that none of the neonates developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia which was examined in two studies (n = 300).</P>
<P>It was not possible from the published reports to assess the effect of heparin among patients who had multiple catheter placements. Individual patient data, required for the planned analyses among patients having multiple catheters, were not available. Future studies should report the duration of catheter use separately for catheters removed because of occlusion, removed electively, or removed for other reasons. These data should be reported for the first catheter and for all catheters.</P>
<P>Because of heterogeneity among included studies, and despite the best effort of data collection and analysis, the question of the effectiveness and safety of heparin use in PIV catheters in neonates was unable to be definitively answered by this review.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:11:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No conclusive evidence is available from this systematic review on which to evaluate the effectiveness of heparin to prolong PIV catheter life in the neonatal population. Although limited data did not suggest significant adverse effects from heparin use, the safety of such practice has not been thoroughly investigated. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-11-23 20:11:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A randomised, controlled trials of sufficient power is needed to evaluate the efficacy of heparin in neonates with PIV catheters. Studies to identify the minimal effective dose of heparin and to evaluate the safety of heparin administration in this setting will also be necessary before routine use can be recommended in neonates, particularly in the preterm population. A detailed history of all catheters should be recorded, including the reason for catheter removal (blocked, suspected or proven infection, routine or elective replacement, no longer needed). Time until catheter blockage should be assessed by "survival" function analysis.</P>
