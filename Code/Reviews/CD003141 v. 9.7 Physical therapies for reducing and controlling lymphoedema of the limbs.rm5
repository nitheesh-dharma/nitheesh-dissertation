<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Lymphoedema is the build up of excess fluid in the body tissues because of obstruction of lymphatic drainage back into the bloodstream. The affected limb becomes swollen, distorted in shape with pain, discomfort all of which impair movement and daily activities. It can be caused by a congenital abnormality, chronic venous insufficiency, damage to the lymphatic system following treatment of cancer or filariasis, a parasitic infection endemic in parts of India and Africa. Skin care is important as the affected tissues gradually thicken and are susceptible to inflammation and infections. People are also encouraged to exercise regularly and control their weight. Different physical treatments aimed at improved lymph drainage include multi-layer bandaging, manual lymph drainage (MLD), self-administered massage and compression sleeves or hosiery.</P>
<P>The authors of this review, which aimed to assess the effect of physical treatment programmes on the long-term control of lymphoedema, identified only three controlled trials for inclusion. These randomised a total of 150 adults to different levels of physical treatment. One trial involved 42 women with unilateral lymphoedema of the upper limb following treatment for breast cancer. One group received eight sessions of MLD in two weeks and training in self-massage and both this group and the control group wore flat-knit compression sleeves. The reductions in excess arm volume and symptoms were similar in the two groups. </P>
<P>A second trial involved 25 women from a local follow-up breast clinic. They were trained in self-administered massage and randomised to wear an elastic compression sleeve or no additional treatment. The dropout rate was high, particularly in the control group, although the authors concluded that wearing a compression sleeve was beneficial. The third trial involved 83 mostly female participants from a lymphoedema clinic. Around two thirds had upper limb oedema. They were all taught self-administered massage. One group received a 19-day bandaging course before being fitted with hosiery. The other group wore hosiery from the start of the trial. The reduction in excess limb volume was consistently greater in those who started with multi-layer bandaging.</P>
<P>All three trials had methodological limitations, and as their data could not be combined, and they recruited only small numbers of participants, questions relating to the effect of this type of treatment could not be answered by this review.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lymphoedema is the accumulation of excess fluid in the body caused by obstruction of the lymphatic drainage mechanisms. Management involves decongesting the reduced lymphatic pathways in order to reduce the size of the limb. There is a great deal of debate as to which components of a physical treatment programme are the most crucial.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effect of physical treatment programmes on: <BR/>
</P>
<P>volume, shape, condition and long-term control of oedema in lymphoedematous limbs; <BR/>psycho-social benefits.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-05-08 10:52:45 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group trials register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the National Research Register (February 2008) and UnCover, PASCAL, SIGLE, reference lists produced by The British Lymphology Society and The International Society of Lymphology congress proceedings (September 2003).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled clinical trials that tested physical therapies with a follow-up period of at least six months.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Two blinded reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data . Meta-analysis was not performed due to the poor quality of the trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Only three studies involving 150 randomised patients were included. Since none studied the same intervention it was not possible to combine the data. One crossover study of manual lymph drainage (MLD) followed by self-administered massage versus no treatment, concluded that improvements seen in both groups were attributable to the use of compression sleeves and that MLD provided no extra benefit at any point during the trial. Another trial looked at hosiery versus no treatment and had a very high dropout rate, with only 3 out of 14 participants in the intervention group finishing the trial and only 1 out of 11 in the control group. The authors concluded that wearing a compression sleeve is beneficial. The bandage plus hosiery versus hosiery alone trial, concluded that in this mixed group of participants bandage plus hosiery resulted in a greater reduction in excess limb volume than hosiery alone and this difference in reduction was maintained long-term.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>All three trials have their limitations and have yet to be replicated, so their results must be viewed with caution. There is a clear need for well-designed, randomised trials of the whole range of physical therapies if the best approach to managing lymphoedema is to be determined.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-05-08 10:53:05 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Sharon  M Parker">
<P>Lymphoedema is a chronic and progressive condition resulting from an abnormality of, or damage to the lymphatic system. Any reduction in the capacity of the lymphatic system to drain fluid from the interstitium and return it to the blood circulation will cause fluid to build up in the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the affected part of the body (<LINK REF="REF-Levick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levick 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 1995</LINK>).<BR/>Lymphoedema has many causes but the main ones are:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cancer and its treatment - leading to secondary lymphoedema;</LI>
<LI>Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system - so called primary lymphoedema;</LI>
<LI>Chronic Venous Disease of the lower limb - lympho-venous oedema;</LI>
<LI>Filariasis, a parasitic infection - leading to secondary lymphoedema</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>The incidence of lymphoedema following breast cancer treatment is difficult to assess due to differences in assessments of diagnosis, measurement and follow up time. <LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2001</LINK> conducted systematic reviews to assess the incidence of breast cancer lymphoedema. The included studies assessed the incidence in Europe, Australia and North America. Using different search strategies <LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK> found eight studies which included incidence and <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2001</LINK> found ten including potentially two studies which were too recent to include in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK>. Four papers were included in both reviews although one paper was judged to be retrospective by <LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK> and prospective by <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2001</LINK>. Three methods of assessing lymphoedema were included; volume, limb circumference and self-report. The time scale used for follow up also varies. <LINK REF="REF-Petrek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Petrek 1998</LINK> report incidence figures of 6 to 30% however the table used to explain these figures is unclear. Only papers which covered axillary dissection were used in the review by <LINK REF="REF-Erickson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Erickson 2001</LINK> and a range of 2.4 to 56% is found. The range in follow up, if details were available at all, seems to result in this wide variety in findings. The figures for lymphoedema of the lower limb are even less reliable but it appears to be a major problem. In many other cancers (for example melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma and pelvic tumours) the treatment often compromises lymphatic drainage routes; chronic venous insufficiency is also a major contributory factor in the development of chronic lower limb oedema, as is filariasis, a parasitic infection endemic in parts of India and Africa. <LINK REF="REF-Moffatt-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moffatt 2003</LINK> surveyed healthcare providers in South West London and found a crude prevalence of lymphoedema from any cause of 1.33 per 100,000. The incidence of arm oedema was much higher in women, which reflects the large number of women developing lymphoedema following the development of breast cancer.</P>
<P>Lymphoedema can result in significant physical and psychological morbidity. Swelling causes a disproportion in the size of a part of the body and as such can interfere with mobility and affect the sufferers' perceptions of themselves (<LINK REF="REF-Tobin-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tobin 1993</LINK>). In addition to an increase in size, the affected subcutaneous tissues gradually thicken and fibrose forming a solid component to the swelling (<LINK REF="REF-Foldi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foldi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 1995</LINK>). Pain and discomfort feature among the physical problems associated with lymphoedema (<LINK REF="REF-Badger-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badger 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Carroll-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carroll 1992</LINK>), as do recurrent attacks of infection/inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 1995</LINK>); the latter are a result of reduced local immunity in the affected part of the body. The shape of the limb can become distorted (<LINK REF="REF-Badger-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badger 1997</LINK>). The impact of these physical and psychosocial difficulties on the patients' quality of life has attracted little research interest. As things stand, the pre-morbid state has not been identified so that the prevention of lymphoedema is not yet an option.</P>
<P>The management of this condition involves decongesting the reduced lymphatic pathways in order to reduce the size of the limb; encouraging the development of collateral drainage routes and stimulating the function of remaining patent routes so as to control the swelling long-term (Foldi 1985; <LINK REF="REF-Mortimer-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mortimer 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>Traditionally, treatment in continental Europe has followed a "two-phase" approach. In the first phase a collection of different physical treatments are employed simultaneously for a course of daily treatment; these usually include:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Multi-layer bandaging</LI>
<LI>Care of the skin</LI>
<LI>Manual lymph drainage (MLD)</LI>
<LI>Exercises to promote lymph drainage.</LI>
<LI>Pneumatic compression (is sometimes also included here).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<BR/>This phase aims to reduce the size of the limb, reverse any distortion in the shape of the limb and any hardening of the subcutaneous tissues and improve the health of the skin.<BR/>In the second phase of treatment patients are usually required to:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Wear strong compression hosiery to maintain the reduction in swelling;</LI>
<LI>Carry out regular daily exercise;</LI>
<LI>Have regular MLD, where possible.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The aim here is to maintain the improvements gained in the first phase.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of debate as to which components of a physical treatment programme are the most crucial and whether bandages are more effective at reducing oedema than compression hosiery. Outside continental Europe the lack of experienced therapists and inadequate resources mean that standard treatment is likely to consist of compression hosiery with advice on skin care and exercise. Where MLD is not available, patients are often taught to perform a simplified form known as "simple lymph drainage" (SLD) or "self-administered massage" (SAM) however as to which of these methods is the more effective, and what effect they have is the subject of much speculation by therapists. Pneumatic compression therapy (PCT) used both as a way of reducing oedema and of controlling it, is an approach on which opinion is also divided. While PCT has been demonstrated to reduce swelling, the way in which it does so and the possibility of the rapid displacement of fluid to elsewhere in the body have caused concern. PCT does not obviate the need to contain the limb with hosiery and it is not clear that it provides anything which movement, whilst wearing a short-stretch bandage or compression hosiery, does not also provide. The role of weight control and regular exercises in the management of lymphoedema is also thought to be important.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>1. To assess the effect of physical treatment programmes on the volume, shape, condition and long-term (six months) control of oedema in lymphoedematous limbs. <BR/>2. To assess the psycho-social benefits of physical treatment.</P>
</OBJECTIVES>
<METHODS>
<SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<CRIT_STUDIES>
<P>Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. If insufficient details were provided as to the randomisation procedure, authors were contacted for more details. However, due to the lack of detail obtained in relation to the randomisation method, those trials described as randomised were included in the review.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>Studies had to recruit adults (greater than 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of lymphoedema defined as clinically detectable oedema from a peripheral cause of greater than three months duration. Follow up had to be for at least six months. In patients with unilateral oedema, the increase in limb volume of the swollen limb had to be at least 10% above that of the contra-lateral normal limb volume. This cut-off point was based on information regarding the per cent difference in volume between left and right limbs in the normal population, which can be as high as 8 to 9% (<LINK REF="REF-Sitzia-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sitzia 1997</LINK>). All types of lymphoedema were included, non cancer-related and cancer- related. Cancer patients had to have completed their cancer treatment at least six months before entering the trial and could not have evidence of recurrent malignant disease when going into the trial. If multi-layer bandaging was the intervention being studied then the participants could not have already received a course of treatment involving bandaging in the six months preceding their entry into the trial.</P>

<P>2.

<P>Any psychological benefit such as changes in a sense of well-being/quality of life or improvement in body image had to be reported using validated scales. Other aspects of physical morbidity such as an improvement in the condition of the skin and the quality of the tissues in the limb, improvement in the shape of the limb and increased mobility had to be assessed objectively whenever possible. Long-term and short- term adverse effects related to the interventions were noted.</P>

<B>Selection</B>
<BR/>One reviewer scanned the titles and abstracts of the papers found through searches (CB). Those clearly not relevant based on reading of the abstract (for example if it was clear that they did not describe studies, or did not relate to lymphoedema) were excluded; if no abstract was available or if it was not immediately clear that the paper was not relevant then the full publication was retrieved for closer review. A second reviewer (NP) looked at a sample of those discarded to check that nothing relevant had been lost. This process was independently undertaken by two reviewers in the 2008 update (AL and JB) and differences resolved by consensus.</P>
<P>Two reviewers (CB and NP or AL and JB) independently read all the retrieved papers under consideration and independently assessed their eligibility for inclusion according to the criteria set out for trials above. An eligibility form was designed to aid the selection of papers and piloted before use. A third reviewer was designated to resolve any disagreement over the inclusion of any particular trial.</P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction</B>
<BR/>We designed and piloted a data extraction form before use on the selected papers. Data extraction was duplicated by the second reviewer (NP) and any disagreements resolved by the third reviewer (KS). Wherever possible the following data were extracted from the selected studies:<BR/>1. Details of participants including demographic characteristics, source of recruitment, site of oedema, cause of oedema, duration of oedema, relevant co-existing medical conditions, and details of the subjects' occupations.<BR/>2. Where relevant, details of the type and treatment of any cancer, including the patient's cancer status at the time of the trial.<BR/>3. Details of the experimental and control interventions, including the length of time they were applied for and confirmation that CDT had not been used in the 6 months before the trial.<BR/>4.

<B>Analysis</B>
<BR/>None of the studies identified compared the same intervention, therefore data were not combined. We did not perform sub-group analysis due to insufficient data. Analysis was by intention to treat. As no studies were found comparing the same interventions, the results of each study have been described in text form. Further statistical analysis was not possible.<BR/>There were insufficient data to retrieve information on infection and quality of life.</P>

<I>Search results<BR/>
</I>As a result of the 2003 search, we identified 195 papers for possible inclusion. Of these, 185 were found to be ineligible on the basis that they were not randomised controlled trials. Of the remaining 10 studies, all were described as randomised. For one study (<LINK REF="STD-Thiadens-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Thiadens 1999</LINK>) only the abstract was available and to date the review authors have been unable to obtain the full report; the design of a trial reported in another paper (<LINK REF="STD-Bergan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Bergan 1998</LINK>) remains uncertain and awaits clarification. These are listed in the Studies Awaiting Assessment Table. Of the remaining eight studies, data were only extracted from only three as the other five did not meet the inclusion criteria. Reasons for their exclusion are summarised in the Characteristics of Excluded Studies Table.</P>
<P>The 2006 search of the specialised register identified a further possible 33 studies and the 2007 search identified a further possible 21 studies. Of these, eight studies were retrieved as potentially eligible RCTs and read in full by two reviewers (AL and SE). Two studies are ongoing (<LINK REF="STD-Didem-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Didem 2008</LINK> (this is longer follow up of one of the publications excluded because of short follow up); <LINK REF="STD-Schmitz-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Schmitz 2006</LINK>) and are listed in the Ongoing Studies Table. Seven studies did not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the review and are listed in the Excluded Studies Table. The 2008 search of other electronic databases identified a further possible 477 studies. One study was retrieved for further inspection but was excluded as it did not meet the eligibility criteria (<LINK REF="STD-Irdesel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Irdesel 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the potentially relevant studies were excluded because follow up was less than 6 months. These short term trials included 2 studies of pneumatic compression (<LINK REF="STD-Dini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dini 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johansson-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 1998</LINK>), five studies comparing MLD with various types of control (<LINK REF="STD-Sitzia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sitzia 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Williams-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Williams 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Didem-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Didem 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wilburn-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Wilburn 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McNeely-2004" TYPE="STUDY">McNeely 2004</LINK>), one study of compression plus exercise vs exercise alone (<LINK REF="STD-Johansson-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Johansson 2005</LINK>) and one study of upper body exercise (<LINK REF="STD-McKenzie-2003" TYPE="STUDY">McKenzie 2003</LINK>). Another study had six month follow up but most participants continued with the experimental intervention, pneumatic compression, after 2 months follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Szuba-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Szuba 2002</LINK>). Two studies were excluded because limb size was not assessed using the volume measurement (<LINK REF="STD-Bertelli-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Bertelli 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Irdesel-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Irdesel 2007</LINK>) and one study was excluded because only a proportion of the participants (29%) had lymphedema at baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Ahmed-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Ahmed 2006</LINK>). Full details of all of the excluded studies are found in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Details of the included studies<BR/>
</I>The three eligible studies included a total of 150 participants. A summary of the participants, interventions and outcomes can be found in the Table of Included Studies and are also detailed here.<BR/>
<BR/>
<B>Manual Lymph drainage study (MLD)<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>
<B> </B>designed a 12 month parallel group trial, with crossover from the control group to the MLD group after three months, if participants felt their response was unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>All the participants were women with unilateral lymphoedema of the upper limb following treatment for breast cancer. Patients with recurrent cancer or who were receiving treatment for lymphoedema in the three months preceding the trial were excluded. Women with an excess limb volume of more than 30% were excluded and offered intensive treatment with bandages but, rather confusingly, those who did not want the intensive treatment were allowed back into the trial. The investigators defined the minimum level of oedema for inclusion not as the percentage excess volume but as an absolute excess volume of more than 200mls.</P>
<P>Participants were randomised to MLD followed by self-administered massage or no massage at all. The MLD group received eight sessions of MLD in two weeks and training in self-massage to be done daily for the remainder of the 12 month trial. Both control and MLD groups wore flat-knit compression sleeves daily, were instructed in exercises aimed at enhancing lymph flow and in skin care and prevention of infection.</P>
<P>The main outcome was a change in the percentage excess limb volume. Volume was calculated from surface measurements using "piecewise quadratic approximation, known as Simpson's rule of integration". The authors decided on a very complex approach to analysis of the data on volume. The investigators also assessed shoulder mobility on two planes: extension-flexion and adduction-abduction and asked patients to complete a questionnaire on symptoms related to lymphoedema and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ C30) questionnaire.</P>
<P>
<B>Hosiery Study<BR/>
</B>
<LINK REF="STD-Hornsby-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hornsby 1995</LINK> investigated the use of hosiery on its own, rather than in conjunction with another therapy such as MLD.<BR/>The study was described as a randomised trial but the method of randomisation was not stated nor was the length of the trial. It was of a parallel group design with two study groups.</P>
<P>Participants were recruited from patients attending a local follow-up breast clinic, who, if they complained of swelling in the arm, were referred on to a lymphoedema clinic set up especially for the trial.</P>
<P>Both groups were taught exercises, skin care and self-administered massage. The experimental group were fitted with elastic compression sleeves that were worn day and night.</P>
<P>The description of the method for assessing the main outcome, limb volume, is a little confusing. It would appear that limb volume was measured by water displacement in two stages, level with a mark 10 cms below the olecranon and then level with a mark 15 cms above the olecranon. The normal limb volume at 15 cms above the olecranon was subtracted from that of the swollen limb and recorded at each visit. It is not clear why two marks were needed or whether the final measurement was a combined total or was minus the volume up to the level of the first mark. At each visit participants were asked how much their swollen limb interfered with daily activities and whether they had any pain.</P>
<P>
<B>Bandage Study</B>
<I> </I>
<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Badger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badger 2000</LINK> investigated multi-layer bandaging. The trial took place in London and involved two of the authors of this review.</P>
<P>The trial was described as randomised and the method of randomisation was reported. There were two trial groups running in parallel and the trial lasted six months.<BR/>Participants were recruited from the patients attending the lymphoedema clinic and included those with unilateral lymphoedema of upper or lower limb, primary in origin as well as lymphoedema secondary to the treatment of cancer.</P>
<P>Participants in the bandage group received a 19 day course of multi-layer bandaging and were then fitted with hosiery which was worn daily for the remainder of the trial. Participants in the hosiery alone group wore hosiery daily from the start of the trial. Both groups received advice on skin care, were taught exercises and self-administered massage (SAM) which they were asked to perform daily.</P>
<P>The main outcome was reduction in excess volume that was either calculated from surface measurements or measured electronically using a Perometer(r). Body weight was also noted. Instances of infection and venous thrombosis were noted throughout the trial.</P>

<BR/>Methodological details of the three included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Badger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badger 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hornsby-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hornsby 1995</LINK>) can be found in the table 'Characteristics of Included Studies'. These studies were also assessed for risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2007</LINK>) (see Risk of Bias tables for each study).</P>
<P>
<B>Randomisation method<BR/>
</B>The method of randomisation was not described in 2 studies (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hornsby-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hornsby 1995</LINK>). In the other study, random allocation was by a centralised telephone system (<LINK REF="STD-Badger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badger 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment<BR/>
</B>None of the included studies provided details of allocation concealment.</P>
<P>
<B>Blinding<BR/>
</B>None of the included studies appeared to be blinded.</P>
<P>
<B>Incomplete data<BR/>
</B>All of the studies had withdrawals and loss to follow up after randomisation, but in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Badger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badger 2000</LINK>), this proportion was not considered great enough to cause major bias in the results. In this study, of the 90 patients randomised, seven were excluded or withdrawn, four from the bandage plus hosiery group and three from the hosiery alone group. One participant declined treatment with bandages, two did not complete the course of bandaging, one developed a recurrence of cancer, one insisted on regular MLD and two never attended for follow-up. In the Anderson study, 2/44, one from each trial group, were withdrawn because they were found to be ineligible. After three months, 10 participants in the control group crossed over to the MLD group. A further five participants were excluded: one died of a heart attack, two developed a recurrence of cancer, one withdrew due to her husband's illness and one participant withdrew due to depression. In the Hornsby study, no explicit report was given of the withdrawals or exclusions from the 25 participants. It is clear from the data table included in the paper that the number of patients in the control group had dropped by about half by the third visit (6/11 remained) and by the fourth only one participant remained. No reasons were provided for this reduction in numbers. In the treatment group, follow up went on for eight visits but there was a steady falling off of participants from the third visit. Out of 14 participants at the start of the trial, data are available for only three by the end; again no reasons are put forward for this reduction in numbers.</P>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting<BR/>
</B>None of the included studies provided details of their study protocols, so selective outcome reporting cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias<BR/>
</B>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Hornsby-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hornsby 1995</LINK>) did not provide details of the comparability of randomised groups at baseline. For the other 2 studies, there was no evidence of a difference in prognostic factors at baseline.<BR/>
</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>
<B>Manual Lymph Drainage Study</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 2000</LINK>)<BR/>Of the 42 participants included in the analysis 22 were randomised to MLD + hosiery and 20 to hosiery alone. Other than endocrine therapy, received by 10 participants in the hosiery alone group and only two in the MLD group, the groups were evenly balanced in other respects such as age, duration of oedema, at the start of the trial. </P>
<P>The median excess volume at the start of the trial is reported as the absolute volume rather than as a percentage so it is difficult to judge how bad the participants' oedema was. By the end of the trial, the mean percentage reduction in excess limb volume was 60% (95% CI 43 to 78%) in the hosiery alone group as against 48% (95% CI 32 to 65%) in the MLD group. This difference was not significant. No differences were found between the two groups in the symptom scores. </P>
<P>The authors concluded that improvements seen in both groups were attributable to the use of compression sleeves and that MLD provided no extra benefit at any point during the trial. </P>
<P>
<B>Hosiery Study </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Hornsby-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Hornsby 1995</LINK>)<BR/>There are problems with the reporting of this trial. From the text, it seems that the data in the tables represent the difference between swollen and normal limb volume at each visit. The raw data for each participant are tabulated but no means, standard deviations or confidence intervals are calculated. It is possible to work out the percentage reduction in excess limb volumes for each participant from these data. But the drop out rate is so high, particularly in the control group, that little information is available beyond the second month in the treated group and beyond the first month in the control group. Data concerning pain and how much swelling interfered with daily activities are not reported in any detail and not according to trial group. </P>
<P>The author concluded that, although this was a small study, the results suggest that wearing a compression sleeve is beneficial and that the high dropout rate in the control groups may have reflected the subjects' lack of progress. </P>
<P>
<B>Bandage Study </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Badger-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Badger 2000</LINK>)<BR/>Data were available for analysis on 83 participants, 34 in the bandage + hosiery group and 49 in the hosiery alone group. Around two thirds of participants had upper limb oedema and most were female. There was a satisfactory balance between the groups in terms of age, duration of oedema, site, gender, body weight and excess volume at the start. <BR/>Both groups achieved a reduction in percentage of excess limb volume but that achieved by the bandage + hosiery group was consistently greater than that of the hosiery alone group. On day 19, marking the end of the course of bandaging, the bandage + hosiery group achieved a mean reduction of 33.5% (SD 16.9) as against 9.6% (SD 20.4) in the hosiery alone group. Progress at week 12 was maintained at week 24 in both groups but that achieved by the bandage + hosiery group (mean 32.6% SD 33.2) was almost double that of the hosiery alone group (19.6% SD 28.5). </P>
<P>The authors concluded that in this mixed group of patients bandage + hosiery resulted in a greater reduction in excess limb volume than hosiery alone and this difference in reduction was maintained long-term.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Any oedema of the surface tissues that involves a fluid component is likely to be influenced by the application of external pressure, as clinical experience world-wide has demonstrated over many years. From a physiological point of view, difficulties are likely to arise if fluid is trapped in fatty tissues (since fat absorbs pressure) or in fibrotic tissues where it becomes difficult for fluid to be displaced. Both of these scenarios are common in lymphoedema but despite these problems few therapists specialising in the management of lymphoedema doubt that improvements can be obtained through treatment. The question is not so much 'can lymphoedema be treated?' but rather 'what treatments reduce swelling, and the morbidity associated with swelling, most effectively?' In addition to this question, we need to ask 'what treatments produce lasting improvements?' since short-term improvements satisfy no one. </P>
<P>It appears that at present there is no drug or surgery that will reduce chronic oedema and allow the reduction to be maintained. Physical therapies remain the most commonly used treatments for lymphoedema and are usually combined in a treatment programme, since the general view is that no one treatment is likely to be successful on its own. The difficulty lies in establishing which of these physical treatments plays the most critical part in reducing and controlling swelling and which, if any, can be safely left out of the treatment programme. </P>
<P>This systematic review extends the findings of earlier non-Cochrane systematic reviews of physical therapies for lymphoedema (<LINK REF="REF-Harris-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harris 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kligman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kligman 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2007</LINK>). All reviews were limited by the lack of adequately designed randomised controlled trials. Most of the studies conducted so far in this field are either designed poorly or are poorly reported. Most are too small and provide too little follow-up to be of any use. There is a tendency to concentrate on one section of the lymphoedema population (i.e. breast cancer patients) when the growing body of evidence on prevalence and incidence suggests that lower limb oedema, either of primary origin or secondary to cancer and other conditions, is also a significant problem. </P>
<P>Our objective in this review was to assess the impact of physical treatment programmes on the volume, shape, condition and long-term control of oedema in lymphoedematous limbs and in addition to establish the psycho-social benefits of physical treatment. We were not able to answer any questions relating to the effect of treatment on the incidence of infection. While it is accepted that assessing the effect of treatment on the patients' psycho-social well-being presents considerable challenges there is a significant body of literature on this subject, particularly in relation to other chronic conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, that could be drawn upon. The few studies included in this review offer little to increase our understanding in this area.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Of the three trials included here, only one studied lower as well as upper limb oedema. All three trials have their limitations and have yet to be replicated, so their results must be viewed with caution. There is weak evidence to support the use of multi-layer bandaging over hosiery alone.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There is a clear and pressing need for well-designed, randomised trials of the whole range of physical therapies if the best approach to managing lymphoedema is to be determined. Trials of complex physical therapy programmes, while not easy to conduct, are nevertheless possible.</P>
