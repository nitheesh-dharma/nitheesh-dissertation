<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-05-04 11:43:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vibrating devices (e.g. Flutter, acapella, cornet, Quake<SUP>®</SUP>, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, high frequency chest wall oscillators (e.g. Vest<SUP>®</SUP>), VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP> and MetaNeb<SUP>®</SUP>) to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways of mucus. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People with cystic fibrosis have too much sticky mucus in their lungs which can lead to constant infection and inflammation. This damages their airways and worsens lung function over time. People with cystic fibrosis use chest physiotherapy to clear the mucus from their lungs. They can use different methods alone or in combination with others - manual techniques, breathing techniques and mechanical devices. Vibrating devices (also sometimes known as oscillators) use pressure generated either inside or outside of the body to clear the mucus.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>Evidence is current to 26 April 2017.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The review included 35 studies with 1138 people with cystic fibrosis aged between 4 and 63 years of age<I>. </I>Studies compared different physiotherapy treatments and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. Not many studies looked at the same types of physiotherapy over the same period of time; studies ranged in duration from two days to 13 months.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>Given the differences in study design, it was difficult to combine the results from these studies in a useful way.</P>
<P>We did not find any clear evidence that vibrating devices were better than any other form of physiotherapy which they were compared to in these studies, or that one device was better than another. One study found that people using an vibrating device needed additional antibiotics for a chest infection more often than those using positive expiratory pressure. When recommending the most suitable method of airway clearance, physiotherapists should consider the needs of the people they are treating.</P>
<P>For the future, larger and longer trials are needed to measure the frequency of lung infections, preference, adherence to and general satisfaction with treatment, financial constraints should also be taken into consideration. We think adherence is important, because if people with cystic fibrosis are willing to stick to their physiotherapy regimen, there may be improvements in other outcomes such as exercise tolerance, respiratory function and mortality.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Overall, we thought most studies had some design problems which might affect our confidence in some of the results. In about a quarter of studies there were concerns that not all the results were reported clearly and in about a third of the studies the reasons for people withdrawing from a trial were not clearly explained. In comparisons of different types of physiotherapy, a person and their physiotherapist will always know which treatment they are receiving and this might affect their answers to some questions, such as which treatment makes them feel better, but we only thought this was a problem in a few studies. We used a scoring system called GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence, we then judged it to be either low or very low quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to affect our confidence in the results in this review for of any of the interventions analysed.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2017-06-12 08:40:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-05-23 13:01:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis. Oscillating devices generate intra- or extra-thoracic oscillations orally or external to the chest wall. Internally they create variable resistances within the airways, generating controlled oscillating positive pressure which mobilises mucus. Extra-thoracic oscillations are generated by forces outside the respiratory system, e.g. high frequency chest wall oscillation. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-05-22 12:21:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>To identify whether oscillatory devices, oral or chest wall, are effective for mucociliary clearance and whether they are equivalent or superior to other forms of airway clearance in the successful management of secretions in people with cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2017-05-03 10:06:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Latest search of the Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 27 April 2017.</P>
<P>In addition we searched the trials databases ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Latest search of trials databases: 26 April 2017.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-02-25 11:17:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Randomised controlled studies and controlled clinical studies of oscillating devices compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with cystic fibrosis. Single-treatment interventions (therapy technique used only once in the comparison) were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 09:58:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-06-12 08:40:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The searches identified 76 studies (302 references); 35 studies (total of 1138 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in duration from up to one week to one year; 20 of the studies were cross-over in design. The studies also varied in type of intervention and the outcomes measured, data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies, so meta-analysis was limited. Few studies were considered to have a low risk of bias in any domain. It is not possible to blind participants and clinicians to physiotherapy interventions, but 11 studies did blind the outcome assessors.</P>
<P>Forced expiratory volume in one second was the most frequently measured outcome and while many of the studies reported an improvement in those people using a vibrating device compared to before the study, there were few differences when comparing the different devices to each other or to other airway clearance techniques. One study identified an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using high frequency chest wall oscillation when compared to positive expiratory pressure. There were some small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables such as sputum volume or weight, but not wholly in favour of oscillating devices. Participant satisfaction was reported in 15 studies but this was not specifically in favour of an oscillating device, as some participants preferred breathing techniques or techniques used prior to the study interventions. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-04-25 17:27:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>There was no clear evidence that oscillation was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy; furthermore there was no evidence that one device is superior to another. The findings from one study showing an increase in frequency of exacerbations requiring antibiotics whilst using an oscillating device compared to positive expiratory pressure may have significant resource implications. More adequately-powered long-term randomised controlled trials are necessary and outcomes measured should include frequency of exacerbations, individual preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment. Increased adherence to therapy may then lead to improvements in other parameters, such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate whether oscillating devices combined with other forms of airway clearance is efficacious in people with cystic fibrosis.There may also be a requirement to consider the cost implication of devices over other forms of equally advantageous airway clearance techniques. Using the GRADE method to assess the quality of the evidence, we judged this to be low or very low quality, which suggests that further research is very likely to have an impact on confidence in any estimate of effect generated by future interventions.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:12:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2008-05-13 14:43:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited life-limiting genetic disorder. The genetic defect causes mucus hypersecretion within the airways leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging (<LINK REF="REF-Zach-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zach 1990</LINK>). Airway damage and progressive loss of respiratory function is a consequence of persistent infection and inflammation within the lungs (<LINK REF="REF-Cantin-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cantin 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Konstan-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Konstan 1997</LINK>). </P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2008-10-30 10:06:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Chest physiotherapy is currently implemented at initial diagnosis. It is recommended that it should be carried out for the maintenance of a clear chest with an additional recognition for altered or more aggressive therapies during times of respiratory exacerbation. Dependent on the age of the individual, chest physiotherapy will traditionally take the form of manual therapies. Conventional manual therapies would require the assistance of another person to perform the techniques of percussion and vibrations, with the addition of postural drainage when this was felt to add to the technique. With the advent of a more modern approach to physiotherapy, self-administered techniques are more frequently used. These self-administered techniques do not necessitate postural drainage or indeed the assistance of another person. They can be done in a sitting position (if preferred) and use different methods of breathing or different devices to assist mucus clearance. Oscillatory devices are designed to interrupt the expiratory airflow. These devices are either intra- or extra-thoracic. Intra-thoracic oscillatory devices are placed in the mouth and provide resistance during exhalation which results in the airways vibrating thus loosening the mucus. Extra-thoracic oscillatory devices, such as an inflatable vest attached to a machine, vibrate at variable frequencies and intensities as set by the operator to ensure the individual's comfort and associated concordance. Fuller descriptions of all the interventions to be compared in the review can be found below in <LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>. </P>
<P>In this review we have considered the use of oscillation and oscillatory devices as a means of airway clearance and the consequent impact this type of intervention has on the individual with CF and in particular when compared with other recognised forms of airway clearance.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2008-10-30 09:54:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Respiratory infections are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF and therefore chest physiotherapy is considered to be an important treatment for the assistance and clearance of the sticky mucus found within the airways of people with CF.</P>
<P>Oscillations, or interruptions in expiratory airflow have been postulated to mechanically reduce the viscoelasticity of sputum and enhance mucociliary clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). Oscillations, both internally and externally, have also been considered to improve airway patency by preventing spontaneous compression through the introduction of alternating positive pressure where the consequent vibration loosens mucus allowing ease of expectoration (<LINK REF="STD-Oermann-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oermann 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1994</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:12:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Other Cochrane Reviews have considered the benefits of different forms of chest physiotherapy in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2005</LINK>;; <LINK REF="REF-McIlwaine-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIlwaine 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McKoy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKoy 2016</LINK>). They compare oscillatory devices with another recognised single therapy; conventional chest physiotherapy (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2005</LINK>), positive expiratory pressure (PEP) (<LINK REF="REF-McIlwaine-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIlwaine 2015</LINK>) and active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) (<LINK REF="REF-McKoy-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKoy 2016</LINK>). It is the intention of this review to complement the information previously provided. This review will examine the effect and acceptability of oscillatory devices when compared to all other techniques including comparing types of oscillatory device currently used for airway clearance.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of previous reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Morrison-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 2014</LINK>).</P>

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2017-05-04 12:51:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Oscillatory devices, both oral and chest wall, for airway clearance compared with another recognised airway clearance technique either as a single technique (e.g. oscillation versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT)) or in conjunction with another recognised airway clearance technique (e.g. oscillation and ACBT versus ACBT alone).</P>
<P>Interventions of variable duration would be considered and separated according to term of intervention. Single treatment interventions (where the therapy technique was used only once in the comparison) were not considered.</P>
<P>Specific techniques considered for comparison are likely to fall in to one of the following categories:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1. Oscillatory devices</HEADING>
<P>Devices which have an oscillatory component which consider intra- or extra-thoracic oscillations.</P>
<P>Intra-thoracic oscillations are generated orally and created using variable resistances within the airways generating controlled oscillating positive pressure which mobilises respiratory secretions. When the oscillation frequency approximates the resonance frequency of the pulmonary system, endobronchial pressure oscillations are amplified and result in vibrations of the airways. These vibrations loosen mucus from the airway walls. The intermittent increases in endobronchial pressure reduce the collapsibility of the airways during exhalation, increasing the likelihood of clearing mucus from the tracheobronchial tract. The airflow accelerations increase the velocity of the air being exhaled, facilitating the movement of mucus up the airways (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1994</LINK>). Exhalation through these devices generates both oscillations of positive pressure in the airways and repeated accelerations of expiratory airflow that have been shown to result in improved sputum clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Rogers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rogers 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The devices frequently employed for this purpose are:</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Flutter</HEADING>
<P>A small plastic device containing a large ball bearing which repeatedly interrupts the outward flow of air (<LINK REF="STD-Konstan-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Konstan 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pryor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pryor 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">b. Acapella</HEADING>
<P>A flow operated oscillatory PEP device, which uses a counterweighted plug and magnet to generate the oscillatory resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Volsko-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volsko 2003</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">c. Cornet</HEADING>
<P>A horn-shaped tube which houses a rubber inner tube. The degree of rotation of this inner tube reflects the resistance generated. As the individual exhales through the horn the inner tube unfurls generating a rhythmic bending and unbending of the inner tube within the horn throughout the expiration phase (<LINK REF="REF-Pryor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pryor 1999</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">d. Quake<SUP>®</SUP> (Thayer Medical, Tucson, Arizona, USA)</HEADING>
<P>This device oscillates a column of air in both inspiratory and expiratory phases of respiration. It does not rely on an oscillating valve like the Flutter and the acapella, as it uses a manually turned cylinder that fits within another cylinder. Airflow occurs only when slots within the two cylinders line up. Therefore, the airflow is interrupted at regular intervals as the user turns the crank. The rate at which the device is cranked will determine the frequency of the flow interruption. Since the resulting vibration is not determined by the patients rate of flow, the Quake<SUP>®</SUP> theoretically may be more helpful for patients with severe obstructive lung disease who are unable to generate high peak expiratory flow rates.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">e. Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV)</HEADING>
<P>This provides continuous oscillation to the airways via the mouth (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1995</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">f. Extra- thoracic oscillations (HFCWO)</HEADING>
<P>Extra-thoracic oscillations are generated by forces external to the respiratory system, e.g. high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) (<LINK REF="REF-Warwick-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Warwick 1991</LINK>). External chest wall oscillations are applied using an inflatable vest attached to a machine which vibrates at a variable frequencies and intensities as set by the operator to ensure the individual's comfort and associated concordance. This type of device can also be called the Vest<SUP>®</SUP> or Hayek Oscillator.</P>
<P>
<B>g</B>. <B>The VibraLung</B>
<SUP>®</SUP>
</P>
<P>The VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP> is an acoustic percussor, where sound waves are applied directly to the tracheobronchial tract at frequencies that cover the range of resonant frequencies of the human tracheobronchial tract (5 to 1,200 Hz). This causes a vibration within the airways and mucus directly, instead of indirectly through the chest wall. Additionally, the VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP> incorporates positive expiratory pressure (PEP) through its mouthpiece design with the inclusion of two tiny holes to provide resistance to exhalation (<LINK REF="STD-Wheatley-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Wheatley 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<B>h. Metaneb</B>
<SUP>®</SUP>
</P>
<P>The MetaNeb<SUP>®</SUP> System is a pneumatic compressor system which delivers continuous high frequency oscillation (CHFO) and continuous positive expiratory pressure (CPEP) to facilitate the clearance of mucus from the lungs, provide aerosol delivery and lung expansion therapy. Flow, pressure and percussive rate are all adjustable (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2013</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP)</HEADING>
<P>Positive expiratory pressure is another well-recognised and well-utilised clearance method. Devices can be used to open up and recruit obstructed lung, allowing air to move behind secretions and assist in mobilising them. Breathing out against a slight resistance (10 to 20 cm H&#8322;O) prevents the smaller bronchial tubes from collapsing down and thus permits the continuing upward movement of any secretions (<LINK REF="REF-McIlwaine-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIlwaine 2015</LINK>). Masks, mouthpieces or a novel Bubble PEP system offer more choice when considering this approach.</P>
<P>Hi-PEP is a modification of PEP which involves the full forced expiration against a fixed mechanical resistance usually between 80 to 140 cm H&#8322;O (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1993</LINK>) .</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">3. Breathing techniques</HEADING>
<P>When the individual is considered to be moving toward independence and chooses not to use a device, the techniques frequently adopted are autogenic drainage (AD) and the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">a. Autogenic drainage</HEADING>
<P>This term describes a series of breathing exercises devised by the Belgian physiotherapist Jean Chevaillier. The aim is to dislodge and collect mucus from the lungs and then clear these secretions by breathing at various lung volumes (<LINK REF="REF-Chevaillier-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chevaillier 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00f6_ni-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schöni 1989</LINK>). There are three phases - the Unstick, Collect and Evacuate when breathing at low, mid and high lung volumes to mobilise, collect and expectorate secretions respectively.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">b. Active cycle of breathing technique</HEADING>
<P>(<LINK REF="REF-Pryor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pryor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webber-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webber 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webber-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webber 1990</LINK>)<BR/>This consists of three breathing techniques: breathing control is used between other techniques to allow relaxation; thoracic (chest) expansion exercises with the emphasis on inspiration, expiration being quiet and relaxed; and the forced expiration technique or huff is used to mobilise and clear secretions. One or two forced expirations are combined with a period of breathing control. A huff from high lung volume (when a breath has been taken in) will clear secretions from the upper airways and a huff from mid to low lung volume will clear secretions from the lower more peripheral airways.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">4. Conventional chest physiotherapy</HEADING>
<P>Conventional therapy techniques typically consisting of techniques such as modified postural drainage, percussion and manual vibrations or shakings are likely to have been introduced in infancy, or if the initial diagnosis was made in childhood (<LINK REF="REF-Prasad-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasad 1993</LINK>). They may also include huffing and directed cough (<LINK REF="REF-Main-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2005</LINK>). If the diagnosis of CF was made during adolescence or indeed adulthood, many people prefer to use techniques which enable independence from an operator and which can easily be fitted around an active lifestyle.</P>
<P>As a consequence of many different descriptions of therapy techniques it was considered by the authors that certain manual therapies could be combined and considered as one 'type' of therapy. For this reason we have grouped the techniques of postural drainage and percussion (PD&amp;P), postural drainage and clapping (PD&amp; C) and postural drainage percussion and vibration (PDPV) under the term conventional physiotherapy (CPT), for unless otherwise stated we have assumed that CPT is a derivative of, or comparable to, the other terms used in the grouping.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Exercise</HEADING>
<P>Where an individual with CF has few respiratory symptoms, exercise can often be the treatment of choice as a means of airway clearance or as an adjunct to other techniques. It has been recognised as contributing to enhanced quality of life (QoL) and improvements in functional exercise tolerance in people with chronic respiratory diseases such as CF. In addition exercise has been shown to increase respiratory muscle endurance, increase sputum expectoration and preserve respiratory function in some individuals with CF, where a higher level of aerobic fitness also correlated with a decreased risk of mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Radtke-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Radtke 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Webb-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Webb 1995</LINK>).</P>

<P>Both authors (LM and JA) independently performed data extraction and recorded data on forms developed for this purpose. If disagreement had occurred, the authors planned to seek resolution by consensus.</P>
<P>We planned to group outcome data those measured at one, three, six, 12 months and annually thereafter. If outcome data were recorded at other time periods, then we planned to consider examining these as well. We have subsequently considered these time points and felt that to combine data measured at two weeks with data measured at four weeks was inappropriate. Therefore, we have split the original proposed time point of one month and reported data at up to two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grzincich-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Grzincich 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hare 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kluft-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Milne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pike-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pike 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>) and at over two weeks and up to one month (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>).</P>
<P>We have considered trials identifying interventions of varying duration separately; we considered those of one to 12 weeks as short term; those over 12 to 24 weeks medium term; and those over 24 weeks as long term. We did not consider single-treatment interventions, as it is unlikely that an individual can be instructed in the most appropriate usage of such devices or treatment techniques in a single session. We have identified three multiple-arm trials which consider more than one oscillatory device when compared with conventional physiotherapy. In order to achieve a comparison we have set up 'dummy' study ID's which allow the data from the study to be entered more than once on the same graph (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003b</LINK>). In addition, there are other trials which consider two or more therapies. Due to the limitations of the analysis we are able to carry out in RevMan 5, the participants in the control groups will appear in more than one comparison, i.e. be counted twice, and we would caution the reader to consider this when interpreting the graphs.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2017-05-04 12:50:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cochrane Reviews incorporate a recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in included studies. It is a two-part tool, addressing the six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and &#8216;other issues&#8217;). Each domain includes one or more specific entries in a &#8216;Risk of bias&#8217; table. Within each entry, the first part of the tool involves describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This is achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of &#8216;Yes&#8217; indicates low risk of bias, &#8216;No&#8217; indicates high risk of bias, and &#8216;Unclear&#8217; indicates unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>
<P>In order to establish the risk of bias in the included studies, the two authors independently assessed the methodological rigour and quality of selected studies and reported on the six domains as recommended by the<I> Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) and incorporated the criteria on quality assessment described by Jüni (<LINK REF="REF-J_x00fc_ni-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jüni 2001</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generation of allocation sequence</HEADING>
<P>We considered this as adequate, and a low risk of bias, if a computer algorithm or a similar process based on chance was used to randomise participants to treatment groups. We identified this as inadequate, and a high risk of bias, if sequences which could be attributed to prognosis, degree of disease severity, age etc were employed. We considered this unclear, and thus the risk of bias was also be unclear, where the generation of allocation sequence has not been identified.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Concealment of allocation</HEADING>
<P>We considered concealment of allocation adequate where it was not possible for the investigators to foresee the allocation of participants to a particular treatment group, e.g. centralised or pharmacy-controlled randomisation, pre-numbered or coded identical containers administered serially to participants, on-site locked computer system, or sequentially numbered, sealed , opaque envelopes. This means the study has a low risk of bias. We considered the concealment of allocation inadequate if the investigator was able to predict the allocation, e.g., alternation; the use of case record numbers, dates of birth or day of the week; thus the study has a high risk of bias. We graded this (and the risk of bias) as unclear if the concealment of allocation has not been described.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>We reported on the degree of blinding employed in each study. Given the treatment interventions and the specific devices for chest clearance which we have considered in this review, blinding of the investigator and participants was not possible: however, blinding of the person analysing the data was possible. The risk of bias is likely to be lower when these aspects of the trial are blinded, but frequently when the study compares the use of a device this is not practically possible.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Incomplete outcome data and intention-to-treat analysis</HEADING>
<P>We described the completeness of outcome data for each main outcome and commented on attrition and exclusions from the study. If there was a discrepancy between total numbers randomised and numbers in each intervention group we reported on these and any reasons given for this occurrence.</P>
<P>We reported on whether the original investigators employed an intention-to-treat analysis (analysis based on the initial treatment allocation, not on the treatment eventually administered). We assessed whether the numbers and reasons for dropouts and withdrawals in all intervention groups were described or whether it was specified that there were no dropouts or withdrawals. If information is lacking on missing data, the risk of bias will increase.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Selective reporting</HEADING>
<P>We considered the possibility that selective reporting influences the number of published articles and for this reason have also included abstracts and articles of non-English language in our review. Following translation, we have included these articles in the review and entered data into the meta-analysis where available.</P>
<P>We considered there to be selective reporting, if statistically non-significant results were selectively withheld from publication. The most common reasons for non-publication of results are &#8216;lack of clinical importance&#8217; or lack of statistical significance. Therefore, meta-analyses excluding unpublished outcomes are likely to overestimate intervention effects. We have tried where possible to include all identified outcomes within the meta-analysis whether they demonstrated statistical significance or not and consequently reducing the likelihood of selective reporting within this review.</P>
<P>Within this review we have highlighted those references where selective reporting may have occurred. Examples of this include where we were unable to compare the original protocol of the study with the final paper and so we were unable to determine whether exclusions had occurred. Additionally, there were articles which identified particular variables in their outcome measures; however, these were not fully reported in their results. In these instances we have highlighted the discrepancies in the tables <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> and reported within the text of the review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other potential sources of bias</HEADING>
<P>We considered that external bias could also influence the number of published articles and again this can be noted from the tables <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. It is apparent that funding may have been sought, or indeed researchers identified, to consider mechanical or other devices, and their benefits, when compared to other techniques that do not necessitate potentially expensive equipment. This fact may limit the frequency of studies that include expensive equipment as research may be limited due to lack of funding streams.</P>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-06-10 08:05:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>For binary outcome measures, we planned to seek data on the number of participants with each outcome event, by allocated treated group, irrespective of compliance and whether or not the individual was later thought to be ineligible or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up. We aimed to calculate a pooled estimate of the treatment effect for each outcome across studies using relative risk where appropriate.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, we recorded either mean relative change from baseline for each group or mean post-treatment or intervention values and their standard deviations (these will be presented separately). If standard errors were reported, we planned to calculate the standard deviations if possible. We calculated a pooled estimate of treatment effect by calculating the mean difference.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2017-04-25 17:40:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>When conducting a meta-analysis combining results from cross-over trials we planned to use the methods recommended by Elbourne (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). However, only limited data were available and we entered the first-arm data only from one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Oermann-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Oermann 2001</LINK>); for the remainder we treated the cross-over trials as if they were parallel trials. Elbourne states that this approach will produce conservative results as it does not take into account within-patient correlation (<LINK REF="REF-Elbourne-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbourne 2002</LINK>). Also each participant appears in both the treatment and control group, so the two groups are not independent.</P>
<P>This review comprises data from both parallel and cross-over studies, in the analysis of the data we have combined the results from both types of trial. In order to minimise the carry-over effect from one arm to another, we have included only the data from the first arm of the cross-over trial where possible as suggested by Curtin (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>); although taking data from the first arm of the trial reduces carry-over it may offer a less efficient treatment estimate consequently leading to selection bias.</P>
<P>There were several studies which examined multiple treatment arms where more than one device was compared to conventional chest physiotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>). We created duplicate references for each of these studies to enable data from both types of oscillatory device to be entered into the analysis. There was one paper where oscillatory devices were compared with the "usual" airway clearance technique (which encompassed a number of alternative therapies); however, we did not consider it meaningful to extract these data for inclusion in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). One further paper compared five different devices and again we were not able to extract the data in a clinically relevant way to be included in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A further consideration noted in the study by Varekojis was that the data collected referred to the number of sputum samples rather than number of participants included in the study (<LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>). This does accurately reflect how the comparison influenced sputum expectorated by participants, particularly as the number of samples compared were not equal. There were 24 participants in this study with six sets of sputum data anticipated for each treatment option; however, some of the sputum cups were contaminated by hemetemesis, one dried prior to wet weight being measured and one sputum cup was lost prior to weighing, leading to a discrepancy in terms of sputum samples across the intervention groups i.e. 142 compared to 143. </P>

<P>The greater the consistency between the primary studies in a meta-analysis, the more generalisable are the results. Heterogeneity refers to the genuine differences between studies rather than those that occur by chance. We planned to test for heterogeneity using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>). The values of I² lie between 0% to 100%, and we planned to use a simplified categorization of heterogeneity where we judge heterogeneity as low if the I² value is up to 25%, moderate up to 50% and high up to 75% (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>).

<P>Many of the papers measured the outcome variables routinely and often during clinic visits. In the analysis of the papers, where possible, we have included the appropriate time points; however, it was often the case that measurements were recorded on completion of the study and it is these data that have been included in the tables of analyses. We examined the papers to assess when outcome variables were measured and which time points were reported. We recorded the data for each time point reported and noted if data were not presented for any of the outcomes. We looked for sponsorship of the trials by companies and whether this had been acknowledged in the papers. Furthermore, we noted if adverse events which could be a direct consequence of the use of the oscillating devices were reported in these papers.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Trial design</HEADING>
<P>A cross-over design was used in 20 studies, and the remaining 15 studies used a parallel design. A total of 16 studies were generated by research carried out in the USA and 15 of these were single centre. The UK generated eight single-centre studies, and the remaining 11 studies came from Europe, Canada and Australia. In addition there were four multi-centre studies, two from the USA and one from Canada and one from Germany. Study duration varied widely; ranging from two days (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>) up to 2.8 years (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>) and duration was unspecified in three studies analysed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>The 35 included studies involved a total of 1138 participants and the numbers in each trial varied from five (<LINK REF="STD-Hansen-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Hansen 1990</LINK>) to 166 (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>). Participant age (when identified) varied from four years to 63 years of age; on closer inspection 19 of the studies included children younger than 16 years of age. Eight studies did not describe their gender split, and in the 27 studies which did, 22 of them had a greater number of male participants. There were 16 studies which did not identify whether participants were in a stable condition or experiencing an exacerbation. In the 19 studies that did report this factor, seven studies included participants who were deemed stable at the time of study initiation and 12 studies included participants who were admitted to hospital for the management of clinical exacerbations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>As a consequence of many different descriptions of therapy techniques, it was considered by the authors that certain manual therapies could be combined and considered as one 'type' of therapy. For this reason we have grouped the techniques of postural drainage and percussion (PD&amp;P), postural drainage and clapping (PD&amp;C) and postural drainage percussion and vibration (PDPV) under the term conventional physiotherapy (CPT). Unless otherwise stated we have assumed that CPT is a derivative of, or comparable to, the other terms used in the grouping.</P>
<P>There were 10 studies which failed to identify the frequency of interventions performed on a daily basis. Where this was reported, the most common frequency of treatment interventions was twice daily with a range of one to four times daily. Where there were treatment comparisons, these were done at the same time of day and the same frequency of interventions occurred.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes measured</HEADING>
<P>Once again the diversity of outcomes measured was great. However, the most frequently used clinical outcome measure was respiratory function (28 studies included respiratory function parameters in their outcome data), followed by sputum weight (14 studies) and individual satisfaction (11 studies).</P>

<P>The Herrero study is a cross-over RCT comparing a combined therapy (nebulised hypertonic saline plus oscillatory PEP (Acapella<SUP>®</SUP>) to nebulised hypertonic saline alone. Each treatment arm lasted five days (running consecutively) with a one-week washout period in between arms. The study was conducted across seven CF centres in Spain and recruited 19 participants with stable CF. Outcomes measured included sputum volume, pulmonary function, cough and personal preference (<LINK REF="STD-Herrero-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Herrero 2016</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Patel study compared HFCWO to the Metaneb<SUP>®</SUP> during a 14-day study period. The primary outcome measure was the time to cessation of sputum expectorated, with data for respiratory function and participant satisfaction also collected (<LINK REF="STD-Patel-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Patel 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>Considering the risk of bias graphs (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>), we can determine that approximately 10% of the published studies had a high risk of allocation bias. This was apparent where there was no clear evidence that the allocation sequence could not be compromised by those entering participants into the studies. Methods of allocation were frequently omitted or described as alternate, and means of randomisation, concealment and sequence generation were not clearly identified. Approximately a further 85% of published studies had an unclear risk of bias, leaving only 5% of studies with a low risk of allocation bias.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Generation of sequence</HEADING>
<P>Six studies were judged to have a low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>). Randomisation according to Latin square design described by Williams (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1949" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1949</LINK>) was used in only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). Darbee used a coin toss to decide which group the first participant was allocated to (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>). A random numbers table and block randomisation were used in only one study which used sealed envelopes to conceal allocation; the envelopes were opened in sequence, which may itself be a form of allocation bias (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). A computer-generated randomisation table was used in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). In one study, the allocation sequence was generated by placing 36 pieces of paper (18 PEP mask and 18 acapella) in double-sealed envelopes one of which was opened for each enrolled participant by a research assistant not otherwise involved with the study and then the envelope was discarded (<LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>).</P>

The McIlwaine study used a process of central allocation by an independent statistician, following which the allocation sequence was sent to the study coordinator, thus reducing the risk of bias significantly (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). The three remaining studies used sealed envelopes to conceal allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>).

Darbee used a coin toss to decide which group the first participant was allocated to, thereafter allocation was by alternation i.e. could be foretold; therefore we judged there to be a high risk of bias from this method (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>).

<P>Many of the papers measured the outcome variables routinely and often during clinic visits. In the analysis of the papers, where possible, we have included the appropriate time points. However, it was often the case that measurements were recorded on completion of the study and it is these data that have been included in the tables of analyses. The authors found occasionally that some parameters, e.g, blood oxygen measurements, were taken but were not commented upon in the published paper. Four studies were thought to have the potential for selective reporting where information had been collected but no further comments were made; e.g., days lost from work or school although identified as being an outcome variable had not been reported in the results (<LINK REF="STD-App-1998" TYPE="STUDY">App 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Marks-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Marks 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>).</P>

<OTHER_BIAS_SOURCES MODIFIED="2017-05-04 12:28:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The possibility of bias due to order of the treatments was unlikely as in all of the studies where a cross-over occurred, the order of treatment interventions were randomised or alternated. Study fatigue is always a consideration when using small populations such as those with CF; and indeed one study by Newbold identified this as a reason why some participants declined inclusion into the study (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). However, as the majority of the studies included in this review are short term, one might surmise that there was little opportunity for study fatigue to impact upon adherence and this was not an outcome we chose to measure.</P>
<P>The possibility of publication bias is an important point to consider. The effect of this is that published studies may not be truly representative of all valid studies undertaken, and this bias may distort meta-analyses and systematic reviews of large numbers of studies. The problem may be particularly significant when the research is sponsored by entities that may have a financial interest in achieving favourable results.</P>
<P>When specific devices were used, there was some evidence of sponsorship by way of provision of equipment by the manufacturers and this may be considered as a source of bias. However, this did not necessarily favour the device over other modalities. The original authors in the seven studies where this occurred, acknowledged the manufacturers for their sponsorship (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hare 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>). There were few reported incidences of adverse reactions to the therapy regimens implemented, and in the unlikely event of an adverse event occurring, it was not found to have occurred as a consequence of the device under scrutiny. This may be due to the safety of these devices or indeed may reflect reporting bias; however, we are unable to reach a firm conclusion about this.</P>
<P>One paper also reports that a natural competition between two different therapists was created leading to the potential that the data could be skewed depending on how competitive or enthusiastic the therapists were (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three papers had a discrepancy between number of participants and a greater number of data sets collected (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>). Whilst the papers acknowledged this fact, it may have led to duplication of data and a consequent skewing of results.</P>
<P>One study reported that the measured levels of oxygen saturation were higher at baseline in the HFCWO group than in the group using their 'usual' airway clearance techniques, which could be a potential source of bias as groups were not balanced at the beginning of the intervention (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the West study, there were clear differences at baseline for age, FEV&#8321;, and exercise performance; participants allocated to the PEP arm of the study were older, had a greater FEV&#8321; and exercise ability than those in the acapella arm (<LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>). These discrepancies were attributed to the smaller than proposed sample size.</P>
<P>In addition, where the studies included children under 16 years of age, it is a possibility that parental influence may have occurred as there appeared to be no measures in place to eliminate or reduce this possibility.</P>

<P>The Pryor study compared flutter, cornet, PEP, ACBT and AD; however, due to the multiple comparators we have not included the data in our meta-analysis.

<HEADING LEVEL="6">b. weight (dry or wet)</HEADING>
<P>Four studies reported on this outcome; only one had data for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>), the remaining three had no data to enter (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Davies-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). When West compared PEP to acapella this was found to clear more sputum; however, this was not statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). These data, as with any wet sputum data, may not be clinically relevant as frequently wet sputum is mixed with salivary secretions and consequently may be misinterpreted as a greater volume and or weight of sputum collected. This is a point which is true for all wet weight sputum collected and not specific to this particular paper. Two studies of the studies which did not present data reported no statistical difference in the wet or dry weight of sputum expectorated when HFCWO was compared with PEP (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>) or 'usual' airway clearance (<LINK REF="STD-Davies-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Davies 2012</LINK>).

West assessed exercise performance by measuring the % change in distance achieved in the modified 10 m shuttle test (<LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>). Data showed no difference between treatments at up to two weeks (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>); however, the authors reported that 13 out of 22 participants had an improvement in exercise performance of greater than 10%, which they considered to be clinically significant. We were unable to enter data in the meta-analysis for the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>). The study compared both cornet and flutter as oscillatory devices to PEP (and breathing techniques of AD and ACBT which will be discussed later in this review) and there were no statistical differences reported for exercise tolerance using the modified shuttle walk test (<LINK REF="STD-Pryor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The McIlwaine study did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in any domain evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). The Newbold study demonstrated that there were no significant differences between flutter and PEP in either of the two QoL scores utilised, which were the Quality of Well-being Scale (QWBS) and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Index Questionnaire (CRQ) (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). One study comparing the cornet against PEP reported that there was a significant correlation between changes over 12 months in all parameters in the QWBS where current health was assessed, but no correlation when retrospective health over the previous 12 months was evaluated (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2005</LINK>). The authors suggested the use of a more sensitive measure when evaluating perceived changes, particularly when children are considered (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2005</LINK>).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">4. Level of oxygen saturation in response to treatment</HEADING>
<P>Interpretation of oxygen saturation is done using a finger probe and is most frequently written as SaO&#8322;; however, some studies have recorded this as SpO&#8322;, for ease of clarity we will be consistent in our reporting and use the abbreviation of SaO&#8322; for oxygen saturation values. Five studies reported on this outcome, but none of these had data available for analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gotz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gotz 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Winden-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Winden 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>The Darbee paper reported % SaO&#8322; but only within group differences and not between group data, thus we were not able to enter this into our analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>). The paper stated that PEP breathing was associated with increases in SaO&#8322; during treatment (P &lt; 0.00004), but HFCWO therapy resulted in decreases in SaO&#8322; (P &lt; 0.00004) (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>). One study evaluated the value of IPV compared with PEP and found there to be no significant difference between the two techniques when considering the change in SaO&#8322; (<LINK REF="STD-Gotz-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Gotz 1995</LINK>). Padman reported that the level of oxygen saturation remained over 95% in all participants; those in the PEP group had a tendency towards a further increase, although neither result was identified as statistically significant (<LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>). The Osman paper measured the change in SaO&#8322; where measured data were higher in the HFCWO arm at baseline, during treatment and 30 minutes following treatment (however these were not significant) and as a consequence of their study grouping multiple comparators (breathing exercises, flutter, PEP and CPT) when compared with HFCWO, we felt it was difficult to breakdown the data meaningfully and so have not included the data in the meta analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). The fifth study found no significant difference in transcutaneous SaO&#8322; either before, immediately after or 30 minutes after completion of the physiotherapy treatments of PEP or flutter (<LINK REF="STD-van-Winden-1998" TYPE="STUDY">van Winden 1998</LINK>).

<P>The Newbold study found no significant difference in the mean number of hospitalizations owing to pulmonary exacerbations when flutter was compared with PEP (P = 0.2) (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). In the later study by McIlwaine, the number of pulmonary exacerbations per participant was reported as 1.14 in the PEP group as compared to 2.0 per participant in the HFCWO group (P = 0.007) (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). Additionally in this study, whilst the overall incidence was low, the number of pulmonary exacerbations requiring IV antibiotics in the HFCWO group was three times more than the PEP group (19 as compared to 6). After contact with the study investigators, we have received data that can be entered into our analysis for the number of participants experiencing an exacerbation requiring antibiotics. Significantly fewer participants in the PEP group than in the HFCWO group required antibiotics for a pulmonary exacerbation, OR 4.10 (95% CI 1.42 to 11.84); however, this result was no longer significant when considering just IV antibiotics (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
<P>In an earlier study comparing flutter and PEP, McIlwaine suggested a statistically significant difference between the two groups in hospitalizations for a decline in pulmonary function; there were five hospitalizations in the PEP group and 18 in the flutter group (P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>). We were not able to enter these data in the meta-analysis as it is not clear how many individuals experienced these hospitalizations. It is important to state that these hospitalizations did not occur until at least the sixth month of this year-long study and there was a disproportionate number of participants using the flutter being admitted. Despite this being the case, there were no further withdrawals from the study because of significant clinical deterioration (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>). The fourth study found no difference in pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotics when the cornet was compared with PEP over a 12-month study period (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2005</LINK>).</P>

<P>West reported on user satisfaction using a five-point scale to rate their satisfaction with aspects of efficacy, convenience, comfort, and overall satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>).

<P>Osman reported on participant satisfaction based on comfort, efficacy, preference and frequency of urinary leakage; as a consequence of their study grouping multiple comparators (breathing exercises, flutter, PEP and CPT) when compared with HFCWO. We felt it was difficult to breakdown the data meaningfully and so have not included the data in the meta analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). However, in this paper 17 participants (55%) who completed the study, expressed a preference for their usual ACT over HFCWO (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>Tolerance to the treatments of HFCWO and PEP were discussed in the paper by Braggion, who referred to the results as good, but without statistical or other evidence to support this finding (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). Similarly in the paper by McIlwaine, participant satisfaction based on comfort, independence and flexibility showed no difference in the comfort and independence parameters, but PEP scored more highly when considering flexibility (P &gt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). When flutter was compared to PEP in the study by Padman, all participants reported they felt better and ease of expectoration was cited as having improved, although there were no data provided to support this finding (<LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>). Prasad compared the cornet to PEP, with no significant changes in parameters over the year-long study or indeed between treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Prasad-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Prasad 2005</LINK>). One child in each group withdrew, with the reasons given being the device was either too difficult to clean or they preferred their original device. There was no correlation in the decision to continue with the device at the end of the study.

<P>Milne considered satisfaction and whether participants were likely to change their preferred therapy following the study period; there were no statistical differences in satisfaction between the techniques and approximately 45% chose to continue with flutter either independently or in conjunction with ACBT (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 2004</LINK>). Osman considered participant satisfaction in terms of comfort, efficacy and urinary leakage; however, these data are from combined interventions and we were unable to breakdown the data meaningfully in order to include it in our meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). The investigators in the Osman study identified that 55% of their study population preferred their normal ACT compared to HFCWO; in this study the normal ACT was either ACBT or AD 83% of control participants (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). Phillips found that all participants in their cohort of 10 found the technique of ACBT to be comfortable (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2004</LINK>). In the same study, 40% of participants found the HFCWO to be comfortable, but difficult to clear secretions (80%); however, all participants felt ACBT made it easier to clear secretions (<LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2004</LINK>). Participant preference was reported in the Pike study, with 100% recommending ACBT and 55% flutter (P &lt; 0.008) (<LINK REF="STD-Pike-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pike 1999</LINK>).

The Gondor paper presents absolute data at day 7 and day 14 for this outcome, neither of which showed a significant difference between groups in our analysis (<LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>). However, the Gondor paper reports that there was a significant improvement in FEV&#8321; in both treatment groups over the two-week treatment period, with the flutter group having a significantly higher increase from baseline by day 7 than the CPT group; further increases in FEV&#8321; from day 7 to the end of treatment were not significant and the investigators did not find any statistical difference between the treatment groups (<LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>).

The results from the Kluft study for wet sputum weight significantly favoured oscillating devices compared to CPT when entered into our analysis, MD 3.90 g (95 % CI 0.08 g to 7.72 g) (<LINK REF="STD-Kluft-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 1996</LINK>). When the duration of sampling was further analysed it would appear that the sputum was collected over a six-day period (<LINK REF="STD-Kluft-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Kluft 1996</LINK>), yielding a greater sampling period than the other studies in the comparison which were collected over a 1-hour to a 24-hour period. One study reported sputum weights at over one week and up to two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 2004</LINK>); and only one further study reported sputum weights over two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Giles-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Giles 1996</LINK>).</P>
<P>The remaining three studies do not have data available to enter into the meta-analysis. The first of these studies, no data were provided, but the investigators noted that there was no significant difference in sputum weight (either wet or dry) between the HFCWO group or the CPT group when measured at the end of the treatment period (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). The second study was of a short duration (up to one week) and the investigators demonstrated that a significantly greater weight of sputum was yielded when using breathing techniques (P &lt; 0.001) compared to HFCWO (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). However, as a consequence of this study using multiple comparators we found it difficult to break down the data meaningfully and have not included the data in the meta-analysis. In the remaining study, Warwick measured both wet and dry sputum weight following treatments of either CPT and HFCWO in his 1990 abstract. He found that there was no statistical difference (P = 0.221) for the wet weights but a significant difference for dry weights (P = 0.046)favouring the HFCWO in the 13 pairs of samples analysed (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 1990</LINK>).</P>

The ITT analysis of data from the final questionnaire revealed a mean (SD) difference between treatment groups only in the domain of 'Body Image' (PD&amp;P = 87.9 (3.1), flutter = 82.6 (3.4), HFCWO = 78.2 (3.1), P = 0.03). The change in each CFQ domain from baseline to the first or fifth assessment after randomization, and the change from baseline to the final CFQ assessment obtained (ITT analysis) only showed a difference in the 'Social' domain at the final assessment. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons in the CFQ analyses, these results were non-significant. The CFQ 'Respiratory Domain' score was positively correlated with the overall satisfaction score in the Treatment Satisfaction Survey (TSS) at the final assessment point (R = 0.23, P &lt; 0.006).<BR/>

<P>Four studies reported on this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999b</LINK>), but only one provided data which could be entered into our analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>).Data from both time points, up to one week and over one week and up to two weeks, did not favour either treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-003.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.10</LINK>). However, the clinical relevance of this result is questionable as frequently activities such as ACTs correspond with a transient decrease in SaO&#8322; and there is no suggestion that it did not return to normal pre-treatment values within a reasonable time period (e.g. 20 minutes).</P>
<P>Gondor monitored SaO&#8322; during the study period and reported no significant differences between treatment with either flutter or CPT (<LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>). Padman reported that SaO&#8322; was higher than 95% in all participants, with no statistical difference between treatments (<LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999b</LINK>). The Osman paper measured the change in SaO&#8322; during treatment and 30 minutes following treatment; SaO&#8322; levels were higher in the HFCWO arm at baseline, however, the differences between groups were not significant (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). As already stated, the study grouped multiple comparators (breathing exercises, flutter, PEP and CPT) to compare with HFCWO and so we have not included the data in the meta-analysis.</P>

We were only able to enter data from the Varekojis study and the Modi study in our analysis for this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003b</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the short term, Varekojis looked at the comparisons of IPV and PD&amp;P (<LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>) and HFCWO and PD&amp;P (<LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003b</LINK>). There was no statistical difference reported by the investigators in either treatment arm compared to PD&amp;P when participant satisfaction was measured by Friedmans test. Similarly, our analysis also showed no significant difference between groups (<LINK REF="CMP-003.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.12</LINK>). Conversely, when Modi reported on the long-term treatment satisfaction (up to three years) looking at subsets of comfort, convenience and efficacy as well as overall satisfaction, significant differences were found for all measures favouring both flutter and HFCWO over PD&amp;P (<LINK REF="CMP-003.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.13</LINK>). When the investigators carried out sub-analysis of the data according to age, they found that oscillating devices gave adolescent participants a degree of independence from their care givers which may have impacted on their improved preference over PD&amp;P. It should be noted that the last reported TSS scores were associated with participant withdrawal from the study, indicating individuals with lower TSS were more likely to withdraw. (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006b</LINK>).</P>
<P>Arens reported participant satisfaction from the HFCWO arm of the trial only; 88% (22 participants) in this treatment group expressed satisfaction with this technique and requested this therapy in the management of further exacerbations (<LINK REF="STD-Arens-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Arens 1994</LINK>). Braggion discussed tolerance to the treatments of HFCWO and PD&amp;P and referred to the results as "good", but without statistical or other evidence to support this finding (<LINK REF="STD-Braggion-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Braggion 1995</LINK>). Giles reported that flutter was preferred by participants based on comfort and convenience (<LINK REF="STD-Giles-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Giles 1996</LINK>). In the paper by Hare, participants in the IPV group were reported to be generally satisfied with the device (<LINK REF="STD-Hare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hare 2002</LINK>). Homnick evaluated participant satisfaction in the IPV group (the questionnaire was not given to the CPT group) and reported that all eight respondents would continue to use the IPV device if given the opportunity (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1995</LINK>).In the Padman study, it was reported that participants felt they were in control of all their therapies, felt physically better and mucus was more easily expectorated with no preference given to any modality (<LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999b</LINK>). The Osman study considered participant satisfaction in terms of comfort, efficacy and urinary leakage; however, these data are from combined interventions and we felt we were unable to breakdown the data meaningfully therefore have not included this data in the meta-analysis. Investigators reported that 55% of the study population preferred their normal ACT compared to HFCWO (<LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>).</P>

Oermann also conducted a participant satisfaction survey considering efficacy, convenience and comfort.

However, on inspection of the data it became apparent that this evaluation was based on the number of samples in the analysis rather that the number of participants and their relevant corresponding sputum samples.The number of samples compared were not equal; 24 participants were included in the study with six sets of sputum data anticipated for each treatment option.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-01-19 13:19:43 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The initial aim of this review was to determine whether oscillatory devices as used in cystic fibrosis (CF) were effective for airway clearance and, if so, were they equivalent to, or superior to other recognised airway clearance techniques or devices. Outcomes included pulmonary function, sputum weight and volume, individual preference, quality of life (QoL) measures and number of hospitalisations per study period. Frequency of exacerbations was identified as an outcome and analysed as "days of hospitalizations" throughout the literature reviewed. Single-treatment studies were excluded. There were no studies identified through the search process that compared exercise with any form of oscillatory device, or indeed where the acapella or Quake<SUP>®</SUP> were included as a comparison with any other form of airway clearance. We have also not yet been able to include data from studies of the newer devices (Metaneb<SUP>®</SUP> and VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP>). Therefore, these have not been included in the analysis or any further comments made. None of the intended subgroup analyses were possible due to either the small numbers of studies or to insufficient detail allowing the separating of subgroup data within any study.</P>
<P>There were no significant differences between participants on enrolment to studies when considering demographics, spirometry, anthropometrics and clinical scores. Most studies identified improvements in outcome measures from the beginning to the end of the study periods, although between-group differences were most frequently not significant. Where there have been small but significant changes in secondary outcome variables, such as sputum volume or weight, this has not been wholly in favour of oscillatory devices. Sputum weight and volume may be considered to be somewhat misleading as an outcome variable as some individuals have difficulty expectorating and have a tendency to swallow their secretions. This can therefore significantly alter the results obtained.</P>
<P>It is the authors' opinion that oscillatory devices can be effective in clearing secretions, but despite evidence showing improvement in sputum volume, there is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that the use of these devices is superior to other physiotherapy techniques when respiratory function is the primary outcome in the short term. A study by Newbold compared flutter with positive expiratory pressure (PEP) in a 13-month intervention and found there to be no statistical differences in respiratory function or health-related QoL over the study period (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). In the most recent study looking at high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) versus PEP over a 12-month period, results significantly favour the use of PEP over HFCWO when considering the number of exacerbations requiring antibiotics (but not those specifically requiring intravenous antibiotics) occurring in each group (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). When comparing the different types of oscillatory devices, there have been no statistical differences noted between any of the primary or secondary outcomes evaluated. On occasion, there were reported preferences for flutter over HFCWO; however, these did not reach statistical significance. It would appear therefore that oscillatory devices are a recognised therapy, but they are not superior to any other form of airway clearance or that one device is superior to another. It should also be acknowledged that longer-term studies are essential when considering the differences between alternative airway clearance therapies.</P>

<P>The literature appears to be representative of the airway clearance techniques available to participants with CF. Apart from the lack of evidence with regard to either acapella, Quake<SUP>®</SUP> or exercise, all therapy techniques are included, with recognition that alternative devices are in development (e.g., the Metaneb<SUP>®</SUP> and VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP>) and we await further information before being able to fully present these options. The literature also includes representation from both children and adults with mild to severe disease. Oscillatory devices have been compared with each other and all other recognised airway clearance techniques.</P>
<P>A total of 20 studies involved flutter as a comparison, 15 studies included HFCWO, five included IPV, two included cornet and one included acapella. There were no studies comparing, Quake<SUP>®</SUP>, Metaneb<SUP>®</SUP> or VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP> with any other treatment. These are more recently developed devices and that may account for the limited, or lack of, literature evaluating the efficacy of these devices. These devices may be included in future comparative studies as the variety of treatment options become more readily available for all people with CF.</P>
<P>Most studies have been short term and the literature recognises that short-term studies demonstrating improved sputum clearance have not demonstrated preservation of respiratory function,decreased morbidity or shown improved QoL over the long term (<LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003b</LINK>). Modi was unable to identify differences in clinical effectiveness as measured by FEV&#8321; decline over the duration of this three-year study; however, perceived effectiveness as suggested by treatment satisfaction and convenience may lead to better adherence and result in long-term improvements (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006b</LINK>). In 2004, Milne also reported that in short-term studies, it would be unlikely that changes, if they existed, would be apparent in single-treatment days (<LINK REF="STD-Milne-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Milne 2004</LINK>). Whilst we did not include studies where one treatment session was compared with another, we did include those studies where a single day of treatment was included, if the therapy was conducted more than once during that day.</P>
<P>The greater the consistency between the primary studies in a meta-analysis, the more generalisable are the results. Heterogeneity refers to substantial differences between studies rather than those that occur by chance. We planned to test for heterogeneity using the I² statistic (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>); however, due to the limited data available for meta-analysis, testing for heterogeneity was not always applicable.</P>
<P>Three instances of moderate to high heterogeneity were identified in our analysis. In the test for subgroup differences in the analysis, an I² value of 59% was calculated for the comparison oscillating devices versus PEP for the change from baseline in mid-peak expiratory flow (FEF<SUB>25-75</SUB>) (% predicted) between one study lasting one month (<LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>) and three studies with a study period of one year (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>); we believe this is due to the difference in study duration (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>). Between the same three studies, a value for I² of 71% was calculated for the change from baseline in FVC (% predicted) when we analysed the data using a fixed-effect model (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). We re-analysed these data using a random-effects model, but the result remained statistically not significant (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>). These studies seem to be very diverse; however, due to the low number of studies, we were unable to investigate the causes of these instances of heterogeneity further.</P>
<P>Of the studies reviewed, 26 were less than three months in duration; and of these, 13 were considered to be of less than one-week duration.</P>
<P>It is recognised that three of the studies have multiple treatment arms and in the analysis we have considered each treatment separately (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006b" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003a" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Varekojis-2003b" TYPE="STUDY">Varekojis 2003b</LINK>). It is potentially possible to conduct a multiple treatment analysis where all the treatments are assessed simultaneously across studies; however, it was not within the capabilities of the authors to conduct such an analysis, but this should be considered in future studies to ensure clarity of the meta-analysis.Two of the studies included in the 2017 update have compared oscillatory devices with 'usual' airway clearance techniques, but the data for each individual technique were not identifiable and the authors were not able to extract data for analysis.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2017-05-04 12:46:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The following limitations all highlight the need for further good quality RCTs.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>For the purposes of this review we have included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, which are the highest quality of research studies available. This has led to the inclusion of 35 individual studies, one third of which were published only as abstracts, thus limiting the amount of salient information we were able to retrieve from them with respect to methodology and data available for analysis.</P>
<P>Few studies were considered to be of relatively high methodological quality, and therefore at a low risk of bias, e.g. where there was definite evidence of allocation concealment and blinding of some of the researchers (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Phillips-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Phillips 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-West-2010" TYPE="STUDY">West 2010</LINK>). Only four studies reported blinded allocation to treatment, it is not possible to blind the participants to the physiotherapy interventions included in this review; however, in nine studies there was evidence that those researchers who were collecting lung function or sputum samples or performing other relevant testing were blinded to the treatment intervention. The potential for a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding in all these studies cannot be excluded.</P>
<P>A sensitivity analysis for those outcomes where data from parallel studies were compared with data from cross-over studies was performed (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). The results however remained non-significant and we conclude that the results are therefore robust.<BR/>
</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Small numbers</HEADING>
<P>There were relatively small numbers of participants enrolled in the included studies (range 5 to 166) and 50% of those studies included children. We appreciate the hypotheses by Newbold that adults have &#8220;fixed damage&#8221; and therefore less potential improvement as a consequence of chest physiotherapy (CPT) and that also the mean rate of decline in adults tends to be slower (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>). This may have an impact on the accuracy of evidence when measuring the effect of a device on lung function irrespective of the duration of the study. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Inconsistency in study design</HEADING>
<P>The included studies employed different interventions and outcome measures and therefore many could not be combined for inclusion into the meta-analysis. As CPT is delivered by a therapist it must be considered that differences in technique delivery may have an impact on results achieved. This factor is most apparent in the Warwick study where competition between therapists was encouraged (<LINK REF="STD-Warwick-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Warwick 2004</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Applicability to present day practice</HEADING>
<P>Ten of the included studies were conducted over 20 years ago. Applicability of the results to present day practice may be compromised due to changes in population characteristics and interventions, including more aggressive management of lung infection and improvements in antibiotics.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Quality of evidence</HEADING>
<P>The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology and four Summary of Findings tables were generated (one for each comparison presented) (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>). All of the included studies were graded as having low or very low quality evidence. Downgrading of evidence occurred for a number of reasons including small sample size, short duration of treatment and the use of a cross-over design rather than a parallel design. There were also inadequacies noted in allocation concealment, a lack of blinding and incomplete data which suggested a high risk of bias. Anecdotal evidence and limited information on some of the intervention methodology further downgraded the evidence. This low or very low quality evidence suggests that if further research was conducted and resolution of these inadequacies existed then results would significantly influence the confidence in the estimate of effect of the interventions.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-04-26 11:03:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Several of the studies reported that they had received funding from the manufacturers of specific devices. In particular Hill-Rom (manufacturers of "the Vest<SUP>®</SUP>") sponsored three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Darbee-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Darbee 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Osman-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Osman 2010</LINK>). Two of the studies evaluating flutter were provided with the devices by Scandipharm (<LINK REF="STD-Gondor-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Gondor 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Padman-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Padman 1999a</LINK>); and one intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) study was provided with the equipment by Vortran Ltd (<LINK REF="STD-Hare-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Hare 2002</LINK>). One study comparing HFCWO and PEP were loaned or provided with the devices respectively (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>The risk of bias due to the carry-over effect is also a major problem of combined design meta-analysis on the assumption that the first period is devoid of bias, but this may lead to a biased subset of studies in a meta-analysis and it is the price of a less efficient treatment estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002b</LINK>). There is a possibility that this type of bias may have occurred in our meta-analyses since the pooled data includes 11 studies of a cross-over design and six of a parallel design. In addition, whilst the studies have considered treatment of participants when they are in a "stable" state and generally excluded participants who have had an increase in symptomology (either before inclusion or during the study) it is possible that participants have had different disease severity or levels of anxiety associated to their disease. As stated by Curtin, "such differences in study populations could be a source of heterogeneity in the treatment effect which is not caused by the design but confounded by it" (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002a</LINK>). As there were insufficient studies with data to allow sub-group analysis it is not possible to further investigate the issue of heterogeneity.</P>
<P>Two studies reported flutter therapy in the supine position, but no supportive evidence was given to suggest how this was achieved (<LINK REF="STD-Pike-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pike 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pryor-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Pryor 1994</LINK>). Under normal circumstances, the manufacturers' guidelines are to use the flutter in a sitting position.</P>
<P>In his 1998 study, Homnick also suggested that the sample size of each comparison group should be 219 participants to achieve 80% power when considering FEV&#8321; as a quality primary outcome variable (<LINK REF="STD-Homnick-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Homnick 1998</LINK>). With this factor in mind, all of the studies included in this review would be under-powered and consequently any evidence of no improvement should be regarded with some caution, as the issue of power is more important when the findings are of no difference between interventions.</P>
<P>One particular study reported that when some of the eligible participants were approached regarding entry to the study, they felt that they were happy with their current therapy regimen and on occasion they felt they had been over-studied (<LINK REF="STD-Newbold-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Newbold 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Adherence to therapies has a major impact upon outcome measures; however, few of the studies considered this as a factor when evaluating the treatment intervention. Only those participants who adhered to twice-daily treatment (based on diary records) at a level of 85% were included in the McIlwaine study (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2001" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2001</LINK>). Although we did not specifically address adherence as an outcome measure, we did consider other subjective parameters such as QoL indices, tolerance and participant-reported satisfaction, all of which ultimately impact upon a person's adherence to the therapy in question. Interest in participating in a study due to perceived effectiveness of a treatment, may have led to improved adherence and treatment satisfaction (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>). Close contact and phone calls from study coordinators may also have contributed to increased adherence identified in the McIlwaine study; and the high adherence may explain the significant increase in percent predicted FEV&#8321; in both groups from their baseline measurements, which was reported in the paper (no data provided) (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>One further point is the pooling of data between adults and children. Monitoring of the flutter technique is more challenging in children than adults, where the child may be less sensitive to the requirement for adjusting the gradient of the flutter to enable optimum oscillation. This could therefore reflect a difference in outcome if, in children, the treatment is not being optimised because of lack of understanding of the technique. However, if in practice children and adults are treated the same, a random-effects analysis will be appropriate to give the average treatment effect across all adults and children. </P>

<P>The literature recognises that there is little, if any, evidence to support the use of one airway clearance technique or device over another. The findings of this review agree with the previous Cochrane Reviews which looked at PEP physiotherapy and CPT in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-McIlwaine-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIlwaine 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Main-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Main 2005</LINK>).</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-01-19 14:26:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-01-19 14:15:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Individual preference continues to be a factor when introducing a airway clearance technique or therapy adjunct, such as an oscillatory device. It is also important to consider the impact the device may have on the individual at particular stages of their disease. It would appear no single treatment technique is suitable for everyone and the therapist delivering airway clearance should be well-educated in all aspects of airway clearance and associated therapy techniques. This would enable the appropriate selection and inclusion of airway clearance techniques or devices into the management of the individual. As there is no appreciable difference between the devices or therapies used in airway clearance, the healthcare provider should consider a cost-benefit analysis for their individual patients based on financial burdens and possible insurance cover where appropriate. In particular, where the frequency of exacerbations was shown to be increased whilst using the Vest<SUP>®</SUP> when compared to the PEP in the recent McIlwaine study (<LINK REF="STD-McIlwaine-2013" TYPE="STUDY">McIlwaine 2013</LINK>), this may have significant resource implications for the individual and the healthcare provider. Individual preference and acknowledgement of personal health beliefs are also important, as is age-appropriateness of the therapy techniques, which may have a considerable impact on concordance with therapies suggested or offered.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2017-01-19 14:26:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Many of the studies included QoL scales and satisfaction questionnaires; however, few incorporated measures of adherence. When there is no marker of superiority between airway clearance techniques, it may be prudent to include time to next exacerbation, frequency of exacerbations, individual preference, adherence to therapy and general satisfaction with treatment as potential outcome measures in further studies of these techniques. As a consequence of adherence to therapy, we may then see improvements in other parameters such as exercise tolerance and respiratory function.</P>
<P>Most of the studies reviewed were of short duration i.e. less than three months (n = 26), and of these 13 were of less than one week duration. Only 12 studies were of longer duration, which in this review extended to 2.8 years (<LINK REF="STD-Modi-2006a" TYPE="STUDY">Modi 2006a</LINK>). This would suggest for the future researcher that longer-term studies would add more weight to the perceived benefit of airway clearance techniques or therapy devices or both. It has been suggested in adherence literature that the introduction of new novel therapies increases the individual adherence for up to a three-month "honeymoon" period after which time the individual tends to resort to previous levels of adherence. This should be considered by the designers of future studies when deciding on the duration of their study. More adequately-powered long-term RCTs (parallel or cross-over in design) need to be included in this review before clinically valuable information can be gained with regard to treatment efficacy and safety.</P>

<B>Update 2017</B>
</P>
<P>We originally planned to group outcome data those measured at one, three, six, 12 months and annually thereafter. We subsequently considered these time points and felt that to combine data measured at two weeks with data measured at four weeks was inappropriate. Therefore we have split the original proposed time point of one month and separately reported data at up to two weeks and at over two weeks and up to one month.</P>
<P>We have also amended the wording of our eligibility criteria so it is clear we are only considering randomised or quasi-randomised studies and not all controlled clinical studies (which may not have any random element involved in allocation to treatment groups).</P>
<P>
<B>Update 2014</B>
</P>
<P>Two further devices (MetaNeb<SUP>®</SUP> and VibraLung<SUP>®</SUP>) have been added to the list of possible oscillatory devices in '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>'. The data for these devices are only included in abstract form and we await full publication or additional information. The references to the studies of these devices are included under '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>'.</P>
<P>
<B>Update 2010</B>
<BR/>Since the publication of the protocol there has been a new version of the RevMan software released. The full review has been developed using the RevMan 5 programme and consequently there are several sections now included which were previously not available.</P>
<P>A further device (Quake<SUP>®</SUP>) has been added to the list of possible oscillatory devices in '<LINK TAG="CRIT_INTERVENTIONS" TYPE="SECTION">Types of interventions</LINK>'. There are currently no trial data published for this device.</P>
<P>
<B>Original review</B>
<BR/>A new team of review authors have worked on the review and taken on the protocol from the previous review team. They have added a further planned subgroup analysis which they felt was clinically relevant. Furthermore in a second post hoc change, they decided to perform a sensitivity analysis including and excluding the studies with a cross-over design to assess whether the study design had an effect on the results.</P>

<P>1. The oscillating devices included in the trials under this comparison were HFCWO, flutter, IPV, acapella and cornet.</P>

<P>3. Downgraded twice due to serious risk of bias; many judgements of high risk of bias across the included studies due to reasons such as inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of participants, clinicians and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> for further information).</P>
<P>4. Downgraded once due to imprecision: many included studies had very small sample sizes, short treatment durations and employed cross-over designs. As results were not presented from paired analyses for these studies, we treated the cross-over trials as if they were parallel trials which is a conservative approach as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Sensitivity analyses indicates that results were robust to this approach.</P>
<P>5. Downgraded once due to unclear risk of bias; the study was published as an abstract only and very limited information was available regarding the study design.</P>
<P>6. Downgraded once due to risk of bias; judgements of high risk of bias across some of the included studies due to reasons such as inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of participants clinicians and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> for further information).</P>

<P>1. The oscillating devices included in the trials under this comparison were HFCWO, flutter and IPV.</P>
<P>2. Frequency of exacerbations were measured as defined by Rosenfeld as a consequence of the treatment intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Rosenfeld-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rosenfeld 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>3. Downgraded twice due to serious risk of bias; many judgements of high risk of bias across the included studies due to reasons such as inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding of participants, clinicians and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting (see <LINK TAG="STUDY_QUALITY" TYPE="SECTION">Risk of bias in included studies</LINK> for further information).</P>
<P>4. Downgraded once due to imprecision: many included studies had very small sample sizes, short treatment durations and employed cross-over designs. As results were not presented from paired analyses for these studies, we treated the cross-over trials as if they were parallel trials which is a conservative approach as it does not take into account within-patient correlation. Sensitivity analyses indicates that results were robust to this approach.</P>
<P>5. Downgraded once due to unclear risk of bias; limited information was available regarding the methodological designs of the 2 studies.</P>
<P>6. Downgraded once due to applicability; 4 of the studies reported anecdotal findings in terms of participant satisfaction or preference for a treatment arm without numerical results to support these findings.</P>
