<P>Not enough evidence to show the effect of protein supplementation of breast milk for promoting growth in preterm babies. Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for full-term babies but babies born preterm (before 37 weeks) have different nutritional needs. It is possible that premature breast milk may not meet all these needs. Preterm infants need more protein but also use up protein more quickly than full-term babies. The review of trials found that adding protein to breast milk increases short-term weight gain and body growth. However, too much protein given in formula can cause problems with infant development in the longer term. More research is needed to find the safest and most effective levels of protein supplementation.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>For term infants, human milk provides adequate nutrition to facilitate growth, as well as potential beneficial effects on immunity and the maternal-infant emotional state. However, the role of human milk in preterm infants is less well defined as it contains insufficient quantities of some nutrients to meet the estimated needs of the infant. Preterm infants require higher protein intakes than term infants to attain adequate growth rates, and have relatively higher protein turnover rates. Inadequate protein intakes may be partly responsible for low serum albumin and blood urea concentrations in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>The main objective was to determine if addition of protein to human milk leads to improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without significant adverse effects in preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This includes searches of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, MEDLINE, previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, and journal handsearching mainly in the English language.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All trials utilizing random or quasi-random allocation to supplementation of human milk with protein or no supplementation in preterm infants who remained in hospital were eligible.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracting using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by each author and synthesis of data using relative risk and weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Protein supplementation of human milk results in increases in short term weight gain (WMD 3.6 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.8 g/kg/day), linear growth (WMD 0.28 cm/week, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38 cm/week) and head growth (WMD 0.15 cm/week, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23 cm/week). There are insufficient data to evaluate long term neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes.</P>
<P>There are too few infants studied to be certain that adverse effects of protein supplementation are not increased. Blood urea levels are increased (WMD 1.0 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2 mmol/l).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Protein supplementation of human milk in relatively well preterm infants results in increases in short term weight gain, linear and head growth. Urea levels are increased, which may reflect adequate rather than excessive dietary protein intake. Further research should be directed towards the evaluation of specific levels of protein intake in preterm infants and the clinical effects of supplementation with protein, including long term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. This may best be done in the context of refinement of available multicomponent fortifier preparations.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Human milk is the recommended nutritional source for full-term infants for at least the first six months of postnatal life. It is known that in this group of infants, breast milk supplies adequate substrate to meet the infant's nutritional demands, as well as supplying the infant with other substances that may afford some physiological advantage (for example, immunoglobulins and gastrointestinal hormones). Breast feeding may also contribute to maternal-infant bonding.</P>
<P>However, the role of human milk in preterm infants is less well defined. The nutrient content of preterm human milk provides insufficient quantities of protein, sodium, phosphate and calcium to meet the estimated needs of the infant. In addition, large fluid volumes may be required to provide sufficient calories to maintain adequate growth. </P>
<P>There is evidence that preterm infants require higher protein intakes than term infants to attain adequate growth rates, and have relatively higher protein turnover rates (<LINK REF="REF-Hay-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 1994</LINK>). Preterm infants fed human milk alone show slower growth than those fed a preterm infant formula containing supplemental protein (<LINK REF="REF-Bishop-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bishop 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1990c" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1990c</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lucas-1994b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lucas 1994b</LINK>). Declining serum albumin and blood urea concentrations in these infants suggest that inadequate protein intakes may be at least partly responsible for these changes. It is not clear to what extent the better neurodevelopmental outcomes reported in babies receiving preterm formula may be attributable to their higher protein intakes.</P>
<P>In contrast, excessive protein intakes have been reported to result in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and to be associated with evidence of metabolic stress such as acidosis and elevated blood urea concentrations (<LINK REF="REF-Goldman-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldman 1969</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Four studies met the inclusion criteria (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>). Details of the included studies are included in the Table 'Characteristics of Included Studies'. All studies examined very low birthweight infants. <LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK> also studied larger low birthweight infants but the results for this group have not been included in this overview. <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK> studied only male infants.</P>
<P>Human milk protein supplements were used by three studies (<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>) and bovine casein hydrolysate by one (<LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK>). Protein intakes approximated 1.5g/kg/day across all studies. Fluid intakes between studies ranged from approximately 164 to 200 ml/kg/day. The duration of intervention and the study period is not clear for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> ceased supplementation when infants were breast fed or reached a weight of 2200g.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> provided supplemental calcium to the control group because of concerns that ultrafiltration of human milk inadvertently provided more calcium to the protein-supplemented group. <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> supplemented all infants with calcium and phosphorus. Calcium and phosphorus supplementation in the other two studies is unknown. <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> provided supplemental vitamins.</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> used alternate allocation to assign infants. <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> used sealed envelopes, and <LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK> did not specify the randomization method. <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK> did not specify the exact method and infants were randomized to either supplementation or no supplementation, with a "matched" infant assigned the other treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> performed a double-blind study; masking of investigators is unclear in other studies.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> withdrew two of nine infants randomized to the protein supplementation group (feed intolerance, need for parenteral nutrition) and one of eight infants randomized to the unsupplemented group (apnea). <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> does not report results for ten infants randomized and then withdrawn, and group allocation is not able to be determined.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> used a regression of growth parameters against time to calculate a measure of growth. The slope of the regression was converted to units of g/kg/day and cm/week for the study period.</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>These studies report results for a total of 90 infants. The a priori hypothesis evaluating differences between bovine and human milk protein supplementation was not undertaken because of insufficient numbers of infants receiving the former intervention.</P>
<P>Short Term Growth Parameters<BR/>All studies evaluated short term growth over the course of the intervention. Supplementation with protein resulted in an average increase in weight gain of 3.6 g/kg/day (95% CI 2.4 to 4.8 g/kg/day). Linear growth increased in infants receiving protein supplementation (WMD 0.28 cm/week, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38 cm/week), as did head growth (WMD 0.15 cm/week, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23 cm/week).</P>
<P>Long Term Growth Parameters<BR/>No study evaluated long term growth.</P>
<P>Neurodevelopmental Outcomes<BR/>No study evaluated long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
<P>Nitrogen Retention<BR/>No study evaluated this outcome.</P>
<P>Serum Albumin Concentrations<BR/>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>) evaluated serum albumin concentrations. There were no significant differences between the groups (29.5 vs. 27.0 g/l for protein-supplemented and unsupplemented infants, respectively - additional information provided by Dr S.Polberger). <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK> found elevated total serum protein values (49.9 vs. 44.1 g/l, p&lt;0.05) in supplemented infants. <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> demonstrated elevated total plasma amino acid levels in supplemented infants (2339 vs. 1447 umol/l at 8 weeks of age, p&lt;0.001).</P>
<P>Feeding Intolerance<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK> withdrew one infant assigned supplemental protein.</P>
<P>Diarrhea<BR/>No study evaluated this outcome.</P>
<P>Necrotizing Enterocolitis<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>, with results reported for only 7 infants in each group, stated that no infant developed NEC.</P>
<P>Metabolic Acidosis<BR/>
<LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> found that blood pH was significantly lower in supplemented infants at 2 weeks of age (pH 7.32 vs. 7.37, p&lt;0.05, no standard deviation data provided) but there were no differences at subsequent intervals. <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK> did not demonstrate any significant difference in bicarbonate levels between the groups (23.2 vs. 21.1 mmol/l).</P>
<P>Blood Urea<BR/>Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Boehm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Boehm 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Polberger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Polberger 1989</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Putet-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Putet 1987</LINK>) showed increased urea levels in supplemented infants (WMD 1.0 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2). <LINK REF="STD-R_x00f6_nnholm-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Rönnholm 1982</LINK> did not provide absolute values but similarly noted higher urea levels in supplemented infants. The clinical significance of this is unclear as the higher levels in the supplemented group were not outside a range considered normal.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Protein supplementation of human milk in relatively well preterm infants at approximately 1.5 g/kg/day results in small but statistically significant increases in weight gain, linear, and head growth over the short term study periods evaluated. There is some heterogeneity in the results of the length measurements which may reflect difficulties in accurate measurements of this parameter or differences in study design. </P>
<P>Although the differences for these short term growth outcomes are small, the effect is cumulative. For prolonged hospital stays, a small advantage in weight gain or head or linear growth may have a significant impact on growth parameters at discharge or even age at discharge. These outcomes were not able to be evaluated in this review. Protein supplementation may also result in increased serum protein levels.</P>
<P>There is no information available evaluating the pre-specified long term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
<P>Urea levels are higher in infants receiving protein supplementation, but the clinical significance of this is not clear and elevated values may reflect adequate (rather than excessive) dietary protein intake. There are insufficient data to evaluate other potential adverse effects.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Protein supplementation of human milk in preterm infants leads to increases in short term weight gain (WMD 3.6 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.8 g/kg/day), linear growth (WMD 0.28 cm/week, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38 cm/week) and head growth (WMD 0.15 cm/week, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23 cm/week). Urea levels are increased (WMD 1.0mmol/l, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.2) but remain within the normal range. Due to the small number of infants studied and the outcomes evaluated, there is an absence of data evaluating long-term effects and adverse effects of protein supplementation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Further research should be directed towards the evaluation of specific levels of protein intake in preterm infants (particularly extremely low birth weight infants) and the clinical effects (both beneficial and adverse) of supplementation. As supplementation of human milk with multiple components (protein, carbohydrate, minerals, and vitamins) is common practice, further research should concentrate on the modification and refinement of available preparations. Long term outcomes of growth and neurodevelopmental status should also be evaluated, although the numbers of infants required to evaluate this would be extremely large.</P>

<P>54 infants were initially enrolled. 10 infants were excluded post-randomization for medical reasons or insufficient enteral feeding (group allocation unclear). Two infants who developed hydrocephalus were excluded from head circumference measurements.<BR/>Half the infants in each group received (randomly) supplementation with fat (MCT oil, 1.0g/100ml of milk). The authors state that fat supplementation did not affect outcomes and therefore grouped the infants according to protein supplementation. Data is not extractable for protein supplementation alone vs. unsupplemented milk alone. Despite addition of protein to dietary intakes, there was no difference in energy intakes between the protein supplemented and unsupplemented groups.</P>
