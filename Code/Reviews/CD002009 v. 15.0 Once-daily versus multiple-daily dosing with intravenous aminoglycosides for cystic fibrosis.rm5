<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-01-23 15:02:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>We looked for evidence to show the differences between giving intravenous antibiotics once daily compared to giving them several times a day when treating flare ups of disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of an earlier review.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Most people with cystic fibrosis develop persistent lung infections and they may receive frequent courses of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Giving the antibiotics just once per day rather than several doses per day reduces the cost of treatment and the time involved.</P>
<P>
<B>Search date</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence is current to 24 June 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>This review includes four studies with a total of 328 children and adults. All the trials compared once-a-day dosing with three times-a-day dosing.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The review found that when treating people with cystic fibrosis for pulmonary exacerbations, giving the antibiotics once per day was just as good at as giving them more frequently in terms of lung function and body mass index. The review also found that giving the antibiotics once per day appeared to be less toxic to the kidneys in children. There were no differences between the different treatment schedules for other outcomes that the studies measured.</P>
<P>While once-daily treatment can be just as effective and more convenient than three-times daily treatment, we recommend further studies to look at the long-term safety of this treatment schedule.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>We judged that just one of the four studies carried a low risk that any design factors might affect the outcome results. In the remaining three studies, we thought that the fact that it was obvious whether the antibiotics were given once or three times a day could affect some outcome measures (e.g. lung function). Other risk factors were unclear or at low risk of bias. We assessed the evidence for lung function, body mass index and the evidence for side effects (e.g. toxicity) to be moderate to low quality.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-27 12:09:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effectiveness and safety of once-daily versus multiple-daily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-06-28 14:46:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings.</P>
<P>Date of the most recent search: 24 June 2016.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multiple-daily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-12 14:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 14:42:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Fifteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review. Four studies reporting results from a total of 328 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared once-daily dosing with thrice-daily dosing. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining three included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias.</P>
<P>There was no significant difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -2.81 to 3.48, moderate quality evidence); forced vital capacity, mean difference 0.29 (95% confidence interval -6.58 to 7.16, low quality evidence); % weight for height, mean difference -0.82 (95% confidence interval -3.77 to 2.13, low quality evidence); body mass index, mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.42 to 0.42, low quality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 7.96, moderate quality evidence). The percentage change in creatinine significantly favoured once-daily treatment in children, mean difference -8.20 (95% confidence interval -15.32 to -1.08, moderate quality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, mean difference 3.25 (95% confidence interval -1.82 to 8.33, moderate quality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2012-01-04 13:33:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Tracey Remmington">
<P>Once- and three-times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-03-20 08:19:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>

</P>
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-10-12 14:42:03 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common serious autosomal recessive genetic disorder in the Caucasian population. It is estimated to occur in 1 in 2500 births and about one person in 25 carries the defective gene. Progressive pulmonary deterioration is the principal cause of CF-related mortality and morbidity. People with CF have an increased susceptibility to chronic lung infections, especially with<I> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I>(<I>P aeruginosa</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Davis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davis 1996</LINK>). Most antibiotics used for treatment are administered intravenously and given for about two weeks (<LINK REF="REF-David-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">David 1986</LINK>); however, in a recent retrospective study nearly one third of individuals who were treated with more than 14 days of antibiotics showed improvements in lung function beyond the antibiotic treatment period, particularly in those who had greater decreases in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) at the time of exacerbations, and in those who were slower to initially respond to treatment. Whether the improvements in lung function beyond the 14-day period are associated with the antibiotic treatment or concurrent treatments, requires prospective study (<LINK REF="REF-Waters-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waters 2015</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2017-03-20 08:18:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>People with CF receive frequent and repeated courses of intravenous antibiotics throughout their lifetime. The quality of evidence comparing intravenous antibiotics with placebo is poor. A recent Cochrane review concluded that no specific antibiotic combination can be considered to be superior to any other, and neither is there evidence showing that the intravenous route is superior to the inhaled or oral routes (<LINK REF="REF-Hurley-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hurley 2015</LINK>). The current recommendation for intravenous antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in people colonised with <I>P aeruginosa</I> is a combination of two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flume-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flume 2009</LINK>). Combination antibiotic therapy, which has been shown to produce a synergistic effect in vitro (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 1995</LINK>), may limit the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of <I>P aeruginosa</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Cheng-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheng 1996</LINK>). However, single versus combination intravenous antibiotic therapy in CF is the subject of another Cochrane Review which found no clear evidence of benefit for combination therapy, though there was a trend to less antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Elphick-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elphick 2005</LINK>). Previously, the majority of people with CF received an aminoglycoside, as part of their intravenous antibiotic regimen, most commonly given in three divided doses (<LINK REF="REF-Tan-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2002</LINK>). However, a recent survey of prescribing practices in the UK has shown that a once-daily regimen is usual practice in 86% of UK CF centres (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2014b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2014b</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-09-27 12:24:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Aminoglycosides demonstrate concentration dependent killing and the post-antibiotic effect (<LINK REF="REF-Spivey-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spivey 1992</LINK>). Concentration-dependent killing means that the bactericidal action of aminoglycosides is related to the peak concentration of antibiotic achieved. Greater bactericidal effect occurs at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The post-antibiotic effect is a phenomenon in which the bactericidal action of the aminoglycoside continues even after the antibiotic has been cleared and its concentration has fallen below the MIC.</P>
<P>These pharmacological properties suggest that aminoglycosides could be given in higher concentrations with an extended dosing interval. There have been many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily with thrice-daily aminoglycoside treatment in participants without CF and these have been the subject of a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Barza-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barza 1996</LINK>). This study reports that once-daily dosing is as effective, and perhaps safer, than the standard thrice-daily dosing regimen. However, the results of these studies cannot be directly extrapolated to the CF population, as plasma clearance is more rapid in people with CF (<LINK REF="REF-de-Groot-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Groot 1987</LINK>). Furthermore, people with CF are vulnerable to cumulative side effects from antibiotics as they receive recurrent and prolonged courses of treatment.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-03-20 08:19:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>The use of intravenous aminoglycosides is limited by their well-recognised toxicity, affecting the inner ear and the kidney. Before any change in dosing interval can be recommended, the relative toxicity of once and multiple-daily dosing must be evaluated.</P>
<P>Once-daily aminoglycoside dosing has major advantages to people with CF and their families, especially if they receive their antibiotics at home. In addition there are cost implications in reducing the use of consumables and the time taken to prepare and deliver antibiotics.</P>
<P>This is an updated version of the previously published review (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2014a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2014a</LINK>).</P>

One study recruited only adults with an age range of 15 years to 47 years (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>) and one study recruited paediatric participants with a mean age of 11.2 years and a range from 1.7 years to 18.1 years (<LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>).

<P>All four studies evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of once versus thrice-daily dosing of intravenous tobramycin for a pulmonary exacerbation.

<P>The total daily dose of tobramycin in each group was 15 mg/kg/day in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Vic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vic 1998</LINK>) and 10 mg/kg/day in the remaining three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>).

In the Whitehead study, one participant in each group was reported as experiencing ototoxicity (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). In the Smyth study 168 out of 219 participants who completed treatment per protocol had audiograms performed at the start and finish of their intravenous antibiotic course; no participant showed deterioration in audiograms from days 1 to 14 of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>). Two participants (one on each regimen) reported acute dizziness and were withdrawn from the study. In both participants, symptoms resolved without treatment. Therefore, there was no significant difference in the relative risk of developing ototoxicity between once and thrice-daily dosing in the four studies considered, risk ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96) (low quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">5. Nephrotoxicity</HEADING>
<P>The measure of nephrotoxicity, which was pre-defined in the protocol, was the percentage increase in serum creatinine from baseline. Two studies reported this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). When data from the two studies were combined, there was a non-significant trend towards a greater rise in creatinine with once-daily treatment in adults, mean difference 3.25 (95% CI -1.82 to 8.33) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). In contrast, data from one study showed that in children there was a significantly smaller rise in creatinine with once-daily treatment, mean difference -8.20 (95% CI -15.32 to -1.08) (moderate quality evidence) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). Two studies measured N-acetyl-ß-D glucosaminidase (NAG), a proximal tubular enzyme (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>). This was measured at baseline and after 14 days of treatment in both studies. A significantly smaller rise (less toxicity) was seen with once daily for adults and children combined in the Smyth study (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>). Riethmueller measured both urinary concentrations of NAG and &#945;-1-microglobulin (<LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>). Both increased significantly during treatment but there was no difference between regimens. The Vic study uses creatinine clearance, lysozymuria and microglobulinuria to assess nephrotoxicity; for microglobulinuria there was a difference between groups on day 14 in favour of once-daily treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Vic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vic 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, using the pre-defined outcome measure of percentage change in creatinine over baseline, there was a significant difference in favour of once-daily treatment in children.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-03-10 10:45:38 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>We set out to test the hypotheses that once-daily dosing of aminoglycosides is as effective and no more toxic than multiple-daily dosing. Four studies met the inclusion criteria for this review (a total of 328 participants contributed data). All studies used tobramycin as the aminoglycoside of choice, dosed at either 10 mg/kg/day or 15 mg/kg/day or the dose last known to give satisfactory levels. In all studies, once-daily dosing was compared with thrice-daily dosing. Whilst the three studies used the same combination of antibiotics for all participants (<LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vic 1998</LINK>), the fourth study used different beta-lactam antibiotics in combination with tobramycin (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). Therefore, the individual effects of different beta-lactams in this study are unknown.</P>
<P>This systematic review has demonstrated no significant difference in efficacy, measured by improvement in lung function (moderate to low quality evidence), between once-daily and thrice-daily dosing of tobramycin. The combined number of participants (289) for the outcome measure of lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV&#8321;)) give sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a true difference between regimens of 4% predicted, if one were present. However, evidence of no greater risk of toxicity between once-daily and thrice-daily dosing is encouraging. This systematic review has shown that the relative risk of developing ototoxicity between the two treatment groups was not significant (low quality evidence). However, the results of studies of nephrotoxicity suggested that the rise in creatinine was significantly less in children with once-daily treatment (moderate quality evidence). In adults the effect was in favour of three-times daily treatment, but was not significant. The magnitude of the change in creatinine was much less than the threshold for clinical renal impairment but could be clinically important, if the effect were cumulative with subsequent courses of treatment.</P>
<P>Finally, in a chronic disorder such as cystic fibrosis (CF), long-term measures of health status are important. There was no difference found in time to next exacerbation in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>). Any differences in long-term benefits of improved lung function and nutritional status between the two groups is unknown.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-10 14:20:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>In each of the four studies included in this review the chosen aminoglycoside was tobramycin. There are several antibiotics in this class which are used in clinical practice. However gentamicin, which is widely used for the management of other infections in children and adults, is associated with increased toxicity in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>). Treatment guidelines from the UK CF Trust recommend that gentamicin should not be used (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>). Once- versus multiple-daily dosing has not been evaluated for other aminoglycosides such as amikacin, which is indicated for the management of pulmonary infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria in CF (<LINK REF="REF-Floto-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Floto 2016</LINK>) - a problem which is increasingly prevalent in people with CF. There are limited data on the long-term effects of different aminoglycoside dosing regimens on toxicity to hearing or renal function and on other outcomes such as antibiotic resistance.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-12 14:42:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>When comparing once-daily and multiple-daily dosing, the expectation may be that the new treatment (once-daily dosing) is better than the standard (thrice-daily dosing). In fact, it is more likely that the new treatment will match the efficacy of the standard treatment, but have advantages perhaps in safety, convenience and cost. Therefore, the most useful comparison of once-daily and multiple-daily dosing is one using the methodology for an equivalence study, as suggested in a paper by Jones (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 1996</LINK>). The TOPIC study employed this study design (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>), as did the study by Whitehead (<LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>). The largest study included in this review was judged to have signed a low risk for all forms of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Smyth-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smyth 2005</LINK>). The remaining three studies did not describe allocation concealment, were not blinded and did not perform an intention-to-treat analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Riethmueller-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Riethmueller 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vic-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Vic 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whitehead-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Whitehead 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>With regards to the assessment of the quality of evidence presented in the summary of findings table, we graded the evidence as moderate quality for most outcomes (there was a risk of bias in two of the included studies) and low quality where the results are not applicable to a particular section of the population (either adults or children).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2017-03-10 10:47:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Moderate to low quality evidence found in this review has demonstrated no difference in efficacy between the two treatment regimens, although once daily appears less nephrotoxic in children. Once-daily aminoglycoside treatment for pulmonary exacerbations of CF may be adopted as it is more convenient for people with CF. For further details of once-daily aminoglycoside treatment the authors would like to refer readers to the document "Antibiotic Treatment for Cystic Fibrosis" (<LINK REF="REF-CF-Trust-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">CF Trust 2009</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-10-10 14:30:48 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nikki Jahnke">
<P>Long-term safety studies (which can be open label and non-randomised) comparing the two regimens are desirable. Acute renal failure has been reported in association with the use of aminoglycosides in CF and the prevalence is 100 times higher in children with CF than in the general population (<LINK REF="REF-Bertenshaw-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertenshaw 2007</LINK>). The increased risk of renal failure is associated with gentamicin use, but not with tobramycin (<LINK REF="REF-Smyth-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smyth 2008</LINK>). Chronic exposure to aminoglycosides has been shown to be associated with reduced creatinine clearance (<LINK REF="REF-Al-Aloul-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Al Aloul 2005</LINK>). Further longitudinal studies are desirable measuring: cumulative effect on renal function; cumulative ototoxic effect; time to the next pulmonary exacerbation; quality of life and longitudinal changes in the antibiotic sensitivity of <I>P aeruginosa</I>.</P>
