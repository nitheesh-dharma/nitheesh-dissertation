The last sentence &amp;#147;However, there was no evidence of the effect of multi-faceted interventions on parent reported nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea were superior to mono-faceted outcome.&amp;#148; implies that there is evidence of superiority of multifaceted outcome for other outcomes, where there is no direct evidence. I would suggest confining this section to the evidence being presented i.e. multifaceted intervention is superior to control, while there is no evidence that monofaceted is, and leave the question of which intervention is superior to the &amp;#147;Research implication&amp;#148;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:22:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:22:42 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Recommendations for further research ?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:22:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;deleted&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:22:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:22:42 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;he authors mention the need for a trial to compare mono- vs. multifaceted intervention. However, there is also a need first to establish, beyond doubt, that multifaceted intervention work and it is cost effective. The evidence from systemic review is supportive of this hypothesis but there are only 3 studies, all with relatively small numbers and slightly differing outcomes and none assessed cost-effectiveness (these points should be mentioned in the discussion). Thus, currently multifaceted intervention is not recommended in any of the guidelines for clinical practice. The comparison between multi- and monofaceted intervention is interesting but to some extent of academic interest only. The main research question remains i.e. can we prevent asthma by allergen avoidance and if so, is this cost-effective?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2009-03-16 10:23:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;I have made some amendments following this feedback (shown in text as green using track changes).

This shows in track changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically SPACE could be considered multi not mono as the dietary intervention is not the same in the control and intervention group. Perhaps classification of SPACE should be added to the discussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have major reservations about the fact that the three multi- studies compare with usual care, whilst the mono studies often have a control that is more balanced (dummy mattress covers and alternative milks). How can the Canadian and IOW study be blinded to participants when the control group is usual care? I think at the least this needs to be mentioned in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also have difficulties with measuring outcomes at different time points ACROSS the multi and mono reviews. I had added caution about the different times of last assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS Toby can you send the authors the spreadsheet of the ROR calculations please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span modified=&quot;2008-11-27 12:12:00 +0000&quot; modified_by=&quot;Christopher J Cates&quot; class=&quot;inserted&quot;&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small issues: References to excluded studies. Some of the studies included in the review appear to have subsequent publications listed in this section of the review. These should be moved up to be subsidiary references to the primary study publications listed under each included study ID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=========================================================================&lt;br&gt;Reviewers Contributions: very brief! How do you plan to allocate the work for the full review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: To be checked by Susan please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Fine. Some clarifications made (changes in red)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: &amp;quot;The allergen reducing measures start either during pregnancy or from birth on and will continue during postnatal life. Duration of intervention may be variable.&amp;quot; Can you define a minimum acceptable duration for the intervention please?&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;At least one primary outcome measure (asthma or respiratory symptoms) has to be evaluated in the selected study to be included in the review.&amp;quot; Meta-analysis changed to review as you cannot predefine what you will combine!&lt;br&gt;The ideal way to compare mono-faceted and multi-faceted interventions is by head to head comparisons of the two approaches. If there are any trials that do this they should surely be included. If not then you can separately look at the two interventions, BUT this is not a randomised comparison and care will be needed in looking at the two sets of results. Do you have statistical help available to do this as the methods section does not include how this will be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The emerging Cochrane approach to this is to assess sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, loss to follow-up and any other specific areas where protection to bias should be considered. It is NOT current policy to combine scores, or to use these domains as a way of including studies in the review, but bias protection can be used in senstivity analysis. If you wish to use your Delphi scores that is fine but they should not be combined and will need to be entered into RevMan under the headings above.&lt;br&gt;Please add information on how you will compare mono and multi (as above) and a small number of sub-groups that you feel are important, as well as how you plan to carrry out sensitivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: I think asthma ascertainment is going to be a major headache with this review as it is notoriously difficult under the age of 5 years. What do you actually mean by BHR in outcome 2 - this needs to be made more explicit please in the methods section.&lt;br&gt;I am also concerned that comparisons to usual care will be unreliable without blinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action : Back to authors to address the above issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS Potential conflicts of interest must have an entry.

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-04-17 09:24:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is possible that early exposure to allergens (substances which cause allergy) may lead to development of asthma in high risk children. This review asks whether the risk of developing asthma, which is a disease caused by many factors, can be decreased by reducing single allergen levels in children with genetic susceptibility, or whether the reduction of more than one type of allergen exposure simultaneously will lead to a better outcome. As a direct comparison could not be made using current research we made indirect comparisons using trials that had compared single or multiple interventions with a control. In children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma 'multifaceted' interventions, which involve both dietary allergen reduction and environmental change to reduce exposure to inhaled allergens, reduce the odds of a doctor diagnosing asthma later in childhood by half. However, the effect of these multifaceted interventions on wheeze reported by parents was inconsistent and there was no beneficial effect on night-time coughing or breathlessness. Single ('monofaceted') interventions were not significantly more effective than controls in the reduction of all outcomes, but there remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than single component interventions.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-04-17 12:45:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of allergen exposure reduction for the primary prevention of asthma in children. Interventions were multifaceted (reducing exposure to both inhalant and food allergens) or monofaceted (reducing exposure to either inhalant or food allergens) Follow up had to be from birth (or during pregnancy) up to a minimum of two years of age.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-04-17 12:45:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included in the analysis studies assessing the primary outcome (current diagnosis: asthma) and/or one of the secondary outcomes (current respiratory symptoms: wheezing, nocturnal coughing and dyspnoea). We pooled multifaceted and monofaceted intervention trials separately. We made an indirect comparison of their effects using tests for interaction to calculate relative odds ratios.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-04-17 12:45:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included three multifaceted and six monofaceted intervention studies (3271 children). Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in children aged five years and older, both favoured treatment with a multifaceted intervention compared to usual care (&lt; 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and &gt; 5 years: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85). However, there was no significant difference in outcome between monofaceted intervention and control interventions (&lt; 5 years: OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64, and &gt; 5 years: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.16). Indirect comparison between these treatments did not demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and mono-interventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diagnosis in children under five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07) or five years and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13, P = 0.12). There was also no significant difference between either mono- and multifaceted intervention and control in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturnal coughing at follow up. Wheezing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and mono-interventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the significance was lost when data on treatment only was analysed.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-17 09:22:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available evidence suggests that the reduction of exposure to multiple allergens compared to usual care reduces the likelihood of a current diagnosis of asthma in children (at ages &lt; 5 years and 5 years and older). Mono-intervention studies have not produced effects which are statistically significant compared with control. In children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma, multifaceted interventions, characterised by dietary allergen reduction and environmental remediation, reduce the odds of a physician diagnosis of asthma later in childhood by half. This translates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17. The effect of multi-faceted interventions on parent reported wheeze was inconsistent and had no significant impact on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea. Data from monofaceted intervention exposed children studies were not significantly different from those of control groups for all outcomes. There remains uncertainty as to whether multiple interventions are more effective than mono-component interventions. The comparisons made were indirect, making the conclusions drawn uncertain. To our knowledge there are no ongoing studies in which both intervention strategies are randomly compared. The findings, however, warrant further direct comparison between multiple- and monofaceted interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of asthma in children.</P>

<P>Asthma is a multi-factorial disease that, in the main, develops in individuals with genetic susceptibility. Genetically predisposed children exposed to specific environmental factors (such as allergens) are believed to be at increased risk of developing asthma. It is generally accepted that the interaction between genotype and environment plays a crucial role (<LINK REF="REF-Martinez-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martinez 1997</LINK>). In this line of thinking it is assumed that reduction of exposure to allergens (inhalant as well as food allergens) could lead to a reduction in the risk of developing asthma, although current evidence on maternal dietary antigen avoidance is equivocal (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2006</LINK>). Information leading to the assumption that reducing exposure to one type of allergen might not be effective is based on results of secondary prevention strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Boner-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boner 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Platts_x002d_Mills-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Platts-Mills 1982</LINK>). Many have speculated that reduction of exposure to inhalant or food allergens could lead to a reduction in the risk of developing asthma. It has, however, proven very difficult to translate these insights into effective primary prevention strategies (<LINK REF="REF-G_x00f8_tzsche-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gøtzsche 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Killburn-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Killburn 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koopman-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Koopman 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodcock-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodcock 2004</LINK>). Up until now the reasons behind the lack of effectiveness of these carefully designed studies remain unclear.</P>
<P>A possible explanation for the assumed superiority of multifaceted allergen reducing interventions over monofaceted counterparts is based on cross-reactivity of allergens of inhalant and food origin (<LINK REF="REF-Flinterman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flinterman 2008</LINK>). When a high-risk child is exposed to either one of the allergen types (inhalant or dietary), the risk of asthma might not to be decreased. For this reason it seems likely that allergen-reducing interventions for asthma prevention should target both types of allergens (multifaceted intervention).</P>
<P>Based on theoretical considerations that asthma is a multi-factorial disease, successful prevention might only be demonstrated if most relevant environmental factors for a specific child are simultaneously avoided. To investigate this hypothesis we undertook a systematic review of mono- and multifaceted allergen avoidance interventions to prevent asthma in high-risk children, compared with controls. As we were aware that there are at present no randomised controlled trials directly comparing mono- and multifaceted interventions we considered that this approach would offer the possibility of an indirect comparison between these two intervention strategies.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to compare the effectiveness of mono- and multifaceted allergen reduction interventions in the primary prevention of asthma and asthma symptoms in children judged to be at high risk of developing asthma.</P>

<P>Children at high risk of developing atopy or asthma recruited at or before birth with the aim of preventing asthma. High risk of developing atopy or asthma was defined as a family history of atopy or asthma in at least one close relative (i.e. biologic parent or full sibling). We stipulated that the family history should be confirmed by parents, general practitioner (GP) or biological marker of hypersensitivity (specific IgE or skin prick test).</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-04-17 12:45:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Allergen reducing interventions focused on inhalant allergens and/or food allergens, either as part of a multifaceted or monofaceted intervention strategy. Co-interventions included in multifaceted or monofaceted interventions (not aimed at allergen reduction) were permitted.</P>
<P>We categorised studies as either multifaceted or monofaceted depending on whether they aimed at reducing exposure to inhalant allergens AS WELL AS food allergens (multifaceted) or whether they aimed at reducing exposure to EITHER inhalant allergens OR food allergens (monofaceted).</P>
<P>Control interventions needed to be in optimal contrast with the intervention group strategies. For this reason control group interventions included were either placebo strategies or usual care.</P>
<P>Allergen reduction measures started either during pregnancy or from birth onwards, and continued during postnatal life. The minimum duration of intervention was four months. We anticipated some variation in the length of follow up beyond this time point.</P>
<P>Another Cochrane Review of pre and postnatal dietary intervention focused on maternal diet (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2006</LINK>). However, in the current review we extend the focus to postnatal intervention in infants, and prenatal environmental allergen reducing interventions.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2011-02-17 15:39:31 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>Outcomes of interest needed to be assessed at a minimum age of two years. At least one clinical outcome measure (current asthma or respiratory symptoms, wheezing, nocturnal coughing and/or dyspnoea) had to be evaluated for studies to be eligible.</P>
<P>Asthma cannot be determined objectively in children under five years of age since lung function measurements cannot be performed reliably in these children. Nevertheless, we chose to include the outcome of current asthma in children &lt; five years because doctors do diagnose children as being asthmatic at these young ages. The diagnosis of asthma in these young children is confirmed when the respiratory symptoms (wheezing, coughing and dyspnoea) are successfully treated with asthma medication. We considered asthma diagnosed in children older than five years as a separate outcome.</P>
<P>Current nocturnal coughing is also included as an outcome although it is known that this is likely to be a manifestation of asthma in only a minority of cases, which makes it less reliable (<LINK REF="REF-Ninan-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ninan 1995</LINK>). However, as most studies in the field of asthma prevention use this criterion, we have included nocturnal coughing in the current meta-analyses.</P>

<P>We included individual studies for meta-analysis if items numbered 1, 2, 6 and 10 at least had been described and fulfilled. The reason blinding of outcome assessors is found to be more important than blinding of the parents is that it seems unethical to keep parents uninformed on the treatment they help supply to their child. For outcome assessors, however, this problem does not occur and they might even be inclined to let interpretation of outcomes be influenced by the knowledge of the group subjects were allocated to.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2009-04-08 14:07:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>We used Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>) for pooling data to assess the effects of specific interventions and report data on the same outcome measure. A formal test for statistical heterogeneity, the natural approximate Chi<SUP>2</SUP> test, assessed whether the observed variability in effect sizes was greater than would be expected to occur by chance. For dichotomous endpoints, we presented an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. We also re-analysed the data using a fixed-effect model and compared the two types of modelling. When only small differences were observed we presented the data using the random-effects model.</P>
<P>We calculated a number needed to treat (NNT) for the main outcome (asthma) at ages five years and older to define the number of children required to be treated in order for one to avoid the outcome of interest (<LINK REF="REF-Visual-Rx" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visual Rx</LINK>). We did not calculate the NNT for diagnosis under five years as these diagnoses are less standardised.</P>
<P>Due to the nature of the question addressed in this review, it was likely that there would be some variation in the length of follow up carried out in each of the studies. We therefore aimed to analyse data on diagnosis and symptoms of asthma in two ways. Firstly, we analysed data from multiple age categories (as age-pooled subgroups). For every outcome we also analysed data from the last published observation available in each of the studies, irrespective of time point. The results pooled as last observation available resulted in more data for pooling (n/N). A disadvantage of this type of pooling was the ages at which the outcome was evaluated tended to differ between the types of trials (mono- and multifaceted interventions).</P>
<P>We used intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses for all studies, even if they did not report these data. For all studies we assumed that cases lost to follow up did not satisfy the criteria for the outcome tested. To evaluate the plausibility of this assumption we performed sensitivity analyses for every outcome based on numbers of participants on-treatment (OT). If there were any major differences between the two types of analyses we reported the observations. The ITT results were the main outcome presented.</P>

<P>We included three multifaceted allergen reducing intervention trials, some with an additional co-intervention (for example, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) reduction) on prevention of asthma in children at high risk of developing asthma (n = 1157). We also included six monofaceted allergen-reducing trials (n = 2131), again some of which had an additional intervention like dietary fatty acid modification. Data from these studies were pooled separately at several age-specific time points under the outcomes:</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Current asthma (defined as doctor diagnosis) in children aged &lt; five years</HEADING>
<P>Multifaceted intervention studies favoured treatment at two years of age; the pooled results of <LINK REF="STD-Canadian-study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian study 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Isle-of-Wight-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Isle of Wight 1994</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK> showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.71 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.95). At four years of age one study (<LINK REF="STD-Isle-of-Wight-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Isle of Wight 1997</LINK>) was included and showed an OR of 0.56 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.23).

<P>Monofaceted intervention studies did not show a significant difference compared with control when data from children at two years of age from <LINK REF="STD-CAPS-HDM-2004" TYPE="STUDY">CAPS HDM 2004</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mallet-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Mallet 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-nacMAAS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">nacMAAS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPACE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">SPACE 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zeiger-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Zeiger 1989</LINK> were combined (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.64).

Data in children aged between two and five years analysed at last available assessment did not identify a significant difference in the likelihood of physician-diagnosed asthma between treatments (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64) (see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The test for interaction (Altman &amp; Bland 2003) between multifaceted and monofaceted results for the outcome 'current asthma (defined as doctor diagnosis) in children aged &lt; five years' showed a relative OR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07), which indicated that there was not a significant difference between the two types of interventions.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Wheezing</HEADING>
<P>As described for multifaceted interventions, wheezing was reported at the ages two, seven and eight years and only at age two years could data be pooled age-specifically. The results of this pooling of data at two years were not significantly different between treatment and control<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian study 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK>: OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.90). When pooled at age seven and eight years the result was OR 0.52 (95% 0.30 to 0.88). Wheeze at last reported assessment was in favour of treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isle-of-Wight-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Isle of Wight 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK>: OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81) (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>Outcome of monofaceted intervention studies was described for children at aged three, four and five years. Two studies reported data for the outcome of wheezing at three years of age (<LINK REF="STD-CAPS-HDM-2004" TYPE="STUDY">CAPS HDM 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-nacMAAS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">nacMAAS 2004</LINK>) and pooling resulted in an OR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.35). Pooling of data for 'current wheezing as last reported' was shown to be non-significant (<LINK REF="STD-CAPS-HDM-2006" TYPE="STUDY">CAPS HDM 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-nacMAAS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">nacMAAS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIAMA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PIAMA 2006</LINK>: OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.22) (see <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>The interaction between multifaceted and monofaceted results for the outcome 'current wheezing' was a relative OR of 0.59 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), which indicates a significant difference between the two types of interventions in favour of multifaceted interventions. It should be noted that the age of last assessment was later for the multifaceted intervention (two to eight years) than for the monofaceted intervention (three to five years). It is plausible that the difference in timing of outcome measurement has influenced the result of the comparison of intervention types.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Nocturnal coughing</HEADING>
<P>This was reported for multifaceted intervention studies at ages two, seven and eight years (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-study-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian study 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Isle-of-Wight-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Isle of Wight 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK>) and again could not be age-specifically pooled. Only the outcome 'current nocturnal coughing as last reported' could be pooled. This pooling of last reported data showed an OR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.16) (see <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Three monofaceted randomised controlled trials described the outcome 'current nocturnal coughing as reported by parents in questionnaires' (<LINK REF="STD-nacMAAS-2004" TYPE="STUDY">nacMAAS 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PIAMA-2006" TYPE="STUDY">PIAMA 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SPACE-2004" TYPE="STUDY">SPACE 2004</LINK>). Pooling of data from these studies at two, three and four years resulted in an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.38) (see <LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>).</P>
<P>The interaction between multi- and monofaceted results for the outcome of current nocturnal coughing was a relative OR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.22, P = 0.20), again a non-significant difference between intervention types. Again the ages of last assessment were later in the multifaceted intervention studies (two to eight years) as compared to the monofaceted studies (two to four years). This difference in outcome measurement could have influenced the result of the comparison of interventions.</P>
<P>The only study that reported <B>current dyspnoea</B> as an outcome was the multifaceted intervention study PREVASC (<LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK>).

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>To evaluate the plausibility of the assumption we made that those cases lost to follow up did not meet the criteria of the outcome tested, we analysed the results of cases on-treatment (OT). The statistical significance of the relative OR favouring multi over monofaceted interventions disappeared when our sensitivity analysis was applied to data on current wheezing (relative OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.06).</P>
<P>We carried out sensitivity analyses (analyses not included in this paper) in which we sought to determine whether removing studies of postnatal intervention gave similar results to our primary analyses of all studies. The results of these analyses were compared between multi- and monofaceted studies. These analyses revealed that the time of the start of the intervention did not alter the direction of the results.</P>
<P>Stratification for duration of intervention did not result in any useful information for the research question we postulated, as comparisons of mono- and multifaceted studies were rarely possible due to large variations in duration of the intervention.</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses on the difference between type of mono-intervention were carried out, with separate pooling of single house dust mite interventions and single food allergen reducing interventions. The results of these analyses did not provide any differing information. These analyses are not presented in this review.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-02-17 15:43:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma J Welsh">
<P>To evaluate our hypothesis that multifaceted interventions are superior to a monofaceted approach, we carried out meta-analyses of monofaceted and multifaceted allergen reducing intervention studies. We performed tests for interaction on the indirect comparisons of these pooled estimates at last assessment for all outcomes where available.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Monofaceted intervention versus control</HEADING>
<P>The effects of monofaceted intervention compared with control did not indicate a significant reduction in diagnosed asthma, or in any of the symptom-related endpoints we assessed.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Multifaceted intervention versus control</HEADING>
<P>Several of the tested outcomes tended to favour treatment with a multifaceted intervention when pooled at specific age time points, and when combining relevant time points (outcomes as last reported) over control. Based on the event rates in the control groups of the two studies reporting data at more than five years, 17 children would need to be treated with this form of intervention to prevent one child receiving a diagnosis of asthma after five years (<LINK REF="REF-Visual-Rx" TYPE="REFERENCE">Visual Rx</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two of the multifaceted allergen reducing intervention studies (<LINK REF="STD-Canadian-study-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Canadian study 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PREVASC-2005" TYPE="STUDY">PREVASC 2005</LINK>) also used an intervention for tobacco smoke exposure reduction. Reducing tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with a reduction in asthma symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Stuart-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stuart 2004</LINK>). Considering the low percentage of parents smoking in these study groups, it seems unlikely that this has distorted the results of the analyses carried out. It is feasible that the presence of an additional environmental intervention such as this may confound the treatment effect, particularly in families where exposure to tobacco smoke is high. Future studies which are concerned primarily with exposure to allergens and not toxicants should make provision for such an intervention in the control group so as to ensure that the independent variable is reduced exposure to allergens alone.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Indirect comparison of results</HEADING>
<P>From the evaluation of the tests for interaction, multiple intervention strategies were more successful than single intervention strategies when current wheezing was assessed, although this outcome was assessed in an older age group in the multifaceted treatments. When data for children on-treatment were evaluated, however, no significance was reached.</P>
<P>The test of interaction was carried out for the outcomes of diagnosis of asthma as last reported at ages <U>&gt;</U> five years and under five years of age, and neither showed statistical significance in favour of multifaceted interventions. Comparison of wheezing and nocturnal coughing associated with asthma did not reach significance when comparing the two approaches.</P>
<P>The results of the current meta-analyses indicate that the development of asthma may be prevented to a greater extent by reducing several exposures at the same time, but this observation is from an indirect comparison and was only significant for the outcome of current wheezing. The results of these meta-analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution as the method of testing the hypothesis, by separate pooling of data of mono- and multifaceted randomised controlled trials, is not a direct randomised comparison. These separate trials all have differences in design and outcome definitions, and concomitant differences in types of outcome measurements and ages at which outcome measurement was carried out.</P>
<P>Results of sensitivity analyses on starting point and duration of intervention did not alter the direction of the effect of multi- or monofaceted interventions.</P>
<P>A possible confounding factor in the indirect comparison of results of mono- and multifaceted studies for the outcome of asthma at age &lt; five years seems to be the differences in outcome definition. In some studies the outcome of asthma was defined during usual care visits whereas other studies chose to evaluate this outcome during standardised physical examinations by a doctor associated with the research project.</P>
<P>Another possible confounding factor in the indirect comparisons we carried out might have been the variation in definition of the control intervention (placebo or usual care). As all multifaceted intervention studies used usual care as control intervention and monofaceted studies often used placebo interventions, we could not test the possible occurrence of this confounding factor by carrying out a sensitivity analysis.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Summary</HEADING>
<P>The hypothesis that asthma may be better prevented by reduction of exposure to multiple allergens simultaneously might be correct, at least for current wheezing. The non-significant outcome for the comparison of mono- and multifaceted interventions at age five years and older might have been related to confounding factors caused by the indirect comparison of study results of both types of intervention. Specific differences that might have confounded the outcome might have been the difference in definition of control intervention, lack of power and difference in study outcome used in the types of studies compared, but the results might have been a true rendering of negative outcome. Multifaceted intervention studies, for example, reported data on diagnosis of asthma defined as respiratory symptoms and bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR), and monofaceted intervention studies reported data on current diagnosis of asthma defined as respiratory symptoms plus reversibility as measured by a healthcare professional or the study investigators. Also, the definitions of control interventions were not similar between intervention types.</P>
<P>The possible difference between multiple interventions and monofaceted intervention might be sufficient to justify studies which compare differing intensities of exposure reduction. An efficient way testing the hypothesis we have drawn from the indirect comparison formulated, would be by designing a study in which both types of interventions are performed and directly compared in the same study. To our knowledge studies designed like this have never been performed to date. Factors complicating the performance of such a study are the large number of participants needed to secure the power of the study, the minimum follow up duration of six years to secure the success rate of lung function measurements and the concomitant costs. Such a study, however, will be of great importance for shedding new light on the prevention of the development of asthma in genetically susceptible children, and the current meta-analyses might inspire researchers to undertake this research.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-04-17 12:45:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The current meta-analyses suggest that multifaceted interventions, characterised by dietary allergen reduction and environmental remediation, might reduce the odds of a physician diagnosis of asthma later in childhood, in children who are at risk of developing childhood asthma, by a half. This translates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17. However, the effect of multifaceted interventions on parent reported wheeze was inconsistent and had no significant effect on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea. monofaceted interventions were not significantly different from controls in the reduction of all outcomes.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-04-08 13:52:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>The evidence base for the benefit of multifaceted interventions is limited to three studies that compared this to usual care, and further work is needed to establish both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions, preferably in comparison to placebo interventions (such as dummy mattress covers). There is also a need for direct head-to-head comparative trials of mono- and multifaceted allergen reduction strategies. These should be administered from birth and involve at least six years of follow up. It will be of crucial importance that researchers follow the guidelines for diagnosing asthma for the study outcome, and that the diagnosing physician remains blinded to group allocation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention strategy and its possible effect on family dynamics and mental health status should be formally evaluated.</P>
