<P>Not enough evidence to determine if exercise is helpful in preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy occurring in about 2% to 8% of women. It is identified by increased blood pressure and protein in the urine, but women often suffer no symptoms initially. It can, through constriction of the blood vessels in the placenta, interfere with food and oxygen passing to the baby, thus inhibiting the baby's growth and causing the baby to be born too soon. Women can be affected through problems in their kidneys, liver, brain, and clotting system. Regular exercise in people who are not pregnant is known to have general health benefits, including increased blood flow and reduced risk of high blood pressure. So there is the potential for exercise to help prevent pregnant women developing pre-eclampsia. There are, however, concerns that there may be adverse effects of exercise taken during pregnancy particularly the possibility of women giving birth too early. The review of trials found two small, well conducted studies but there was insufficient data to say what the potential benefits and harms might be. Further studies are needed, and in the meantime women will be guided by their own beliefs and reasoning, as well as those of their caregivers.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The association between an increase in regular physical activity and a reduction in the risk of hypertension is well documented for non-pregnant people. It has been suggested that exercise may help prevent pre-eclampsia and its complications. Possible adverse effects of increased physical activity during pregnancy, particularly on the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction, are unclear. It is, therefore, important to assess whether exercise reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications and, if so, whether these benefits outweigh the risks. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-18 19:51:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The belief that women should remain physically active during pregnancy is prevalent in many cultures, and can be traced back to ancient times (<LINK REF="REF-Kitzinger-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kitzinger 2000</LINK>). It is thought, in many societies, that labour may be more difficult if women are not physically active during late pregnancy. For some, there is also a belief that being active will help keep the baby small enough to pass through the pelvis. Traditionally, the nature of women's work both within and outside the home has been such that most of the activities would have to be performed during pregnancy, as usual. Therefore, in most countries throughout history, only socially privileged women have had a choice about the level and type of physical activity they undertake during pregnancy. In the late twentieth century, as more women were comfortably off, and with the spread of labour saving machines to do household tasks, the concept of antenatal exercises developed. These exercises aim to prepare the woman for the birth. With changes in lifestyle in modern times, sport and exercise have also become major leisure activities for women. In addition, women increasingly have paid employment outside of the home that may include physical activity. When they become pregnant, women are often anxious about the safety to themselves and their unborn child of continuing these activities. Although there is a range of possible effects of exercise and other physical activity during pregnancy, this review deals primarily with those related to prevention of pre-eclampsia, and its consequences.</P>
<P>Pre-eclampsia is part of a spectrum of conditions known as the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy. Around 10% of women have raised blood pressure at some point before delivery. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are usually classified into four categories: (i) gestational hypertension: a rise in blood pressure during the second half of pregnancy; (ii) pre-eclampsia: usually hypertension with proteinuria (protein in urine) during the second half of pregnancy; (iii) chronic hypertension: a rise in blood pressure before pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, and (iv) pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-NHBPEP-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHBPEP 2000</LINK>). Although the outcome of most such pregnancies is good, complications of pre-eclampsia and severe hypertension are associated with a substantive increase in morbidity and mortality for both the woman and her baby (<LINK REF="REF-DH-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 2002</LINK>).<BR/> <BR/>Pre-eclampsia affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). It is a multisystem disorder, which may involve the brain, liver, kidneys, and placenta. Maternal complications include eclampsia, stroke, liver and kidney failure, and coagulopathy. Fortunately, such complications are rare. For the baby, there is an increased risk of poor growth and preterm birth. The cause of pre-eclampsia is uncertain, but current belief is that reduced blood supply to the placenta leads to abnormal function of endothelial cells, possibly as a result of oxidative stress. Pre-eclampsia is discussed in more detail in the generic protocol of interventions for prevention of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Generic-Protocol-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Generic Protocol 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The definitions of 'exercise' include exertion of muscles, limbs, etc, especially for health's sake; bodily, mental or spiritual training (Oxford English Dictionary). The term 'aerobic exercise' refers to energetic exercise that results in a rise in oxygen consumption (to around 40% to 80% of maximum), and heart rate (to around 50% to 90% of maximum). This level of activity is necessary for at least 10 minutes on at least two days per week to produce a 'training effect' of increasing or maintaining fitness in non-pregnant people (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>). Non-aerobic exercise refers to exercise that improves strength of muscles and flexibility. There is no consensus on the ideal or acceptable level of exercise, or other physical activity, during pregnancy. In the USA, an accumulation of at least 30 minutes moderate exercise each day is recommended for improving the health and well-being of non-pregnant people (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises that this is appropriate for pregnant women without medical or obstetric complications (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blood pressure tends to rise during physical exertion. Nevertheless, the association between an increase in regular physical activity and a reduction in the risk of hypertension is well documented in the non-pregnant population (<LINK REF="REF-DH-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">DH 1996</LINK>). During pregnancy there has been relatively little research about the possible effects of exercise on hypertension, or on the risk of pre-eclampsia and its consequences. Regular aerobic exercise in healthy pregnant women improves or maintains physical fitness, but it is unclear whether there are any other effects for either the mother or the baby (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>). Case-control studies have suggested that occupational and recreational exercise may be associated with a reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension (<LINK REF="REF-Weissgerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissgerber 2004</LINK>). These studies largely evaluated the effects of exercise before conception and during the first half of pregnancy for primiparous women. Other observational studies suggest that physical exertion, including standing for prolonged periods, and work inside and outside the home are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and having a small-for-gestational age baby (<LINK REF="REF-Henriksen-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henriksen 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Launer-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Launer 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mamelle-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mamelle 1984</LINK>). There is also a theoretical risk that changes in posture and balance, and the increased laxity of ligaments during pregnancy, may predispose to maternal injury during exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Sternfeld-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sternfeld 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>It has been suggested that the physiological changes associated with regular exercise may protect against pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Weissgerber-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weissgerber 2004</LINK>). Postulated mechanisms for such an effect include enhanced placental growth and vascularity, possibly as an adaptive response to intermittent reductions in placental blood flow during exercise, reduced oxidative stress, and correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction, particularly with aerobic exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Clapp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clapp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jackson-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jackson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Powers-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powers 1999</LINK>). Regular exercise is associated with an increase in plasma volume and cardiac output. Exercise has also been shown to lower plasma triglycerides (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 1996</LINK>), inflammatory cytokines (<LINK REF="REF-Clapp-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clapp 2000</LINK>), and insulin resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Mayer_x002d_Davis-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayer-Davis 1998</LINK>), all of which are elevated in pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seely-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seely 2003</LINK>). Exercise is associated with emotional well-being and reduction in stress and anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Marquez-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Marquez 2000</LINK>), and non-aerobic relaxational exercises like yoga reduce blood pressure in non-pregnant hypertensive patients (<LINK REF="REF-Patel-1975" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patel 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sundar-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundar 1984</LINK>). It is possible that non-aerobic exercise could also reduce the risk of hypertension during pregnancy, although this may not necessarily influence the risk of pre-eclampsia.<BR/>
<BR/>The relationship between physical activity, rest and the risk of pre-eclampsia is unclear, although pregnant women with hypertension have often been advised to rest (<LINK REF="REF-Caetano-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caetano 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Maloni-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Maloni 1998</LINK>), with exercise discouraged (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2002</LINK>). The effects of rest for women with normal blood pressure or with high blood pressure are covered by other Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Meher-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Meher-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meher 2006</LINK>). The aim of this review is to assess the effects of exercise and other physical activity before conception and during pregnancy on the risk of pre-eclampsia and its complications.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently assessed potentially eligible studies for inclusion. We resolved any differences in opinion by discussion.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of study quality</HEADING>
<P>We assessed the quality of each trial using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Alderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alderson 2003</LINK>). Methods used for generation of the randomisation sequence are described for each trial, where possible. Each study was assessed for quality of concealment of allocation, completeness of follow up, and blinding.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(1) Allocation concealment</HEADING>
<P>A quality score for concealment of allocation was assigned to each trial using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) adequate concealment of allocation, such as telephone randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes;<BR/>(B) unclear whether concealment of allocation was adequate;<BR/>(C) inadequate concealment of allocation such as open random number tables, sealed envelopes that were not numbered and opaque.</P>
<P>Where the method of allocation concealment was unclear, whenever possible, we contacted trialists to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(2) Completeness of follow up</HEADING>
<P>Completeness of follow up was assessed using the following criteria:<BR/>(A) less than 5% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(B) 5% to 10% of participants excluded from analysis;<BR/>(C) more than 10% and up to and including 20% of participants excluded from analysis.</P>
<P>Studies were excluded if:</P>
<OL>
<LI>more than 20% of participants were excluded from analysis;</LI>
<LI>more than 10% of participants were not analysed in their randomised groups and it was not possible to restore participants to the correct group;</LI>
<LI>there was more than 10% difference in loss of participants between groups.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Data were analysed based on the group to which the participants were randomised, regardless of whether they received the allocated intervention or not. If data were missing, whenever possible, we sought clarification from the authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(3) Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Blinding of participants is not possible, given the intervention under evaluation. Therefore, blinding was assessed only for the outcome assessor (yes/no/unclear or unspecified).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and data entry</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data. We entered data onto the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>), and double checked for accuracy.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>We carried out statistical analyses using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2003</LINK>). Results are presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to assess heterogeneity between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity was detected (I<SUP>2</SUP> more than 50%), possible causes would be explored and subgroup analyses for the main outcomes performed. Heterogeneity that is not explained by subgroup analyses may be modelled using a random-effects analysis, where appropriate.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses </HEADING>
<P>We planned to do a sensitivity analysis for the main outcomes to explore the effects of trial quality based on concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with clearly inadequate allocation concealment (rated C). This analysis will be undertaken once sufficient data are available.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Prespecified subgroup analyses for the main outcomes were based on the:</P>
<OL>
<LI>type of exercise: whether occupational, aerobic recreational, or non-aerobic recreational;</LI>
<LI>timing of recruitment: whether preconception, at or before 20 weeks' gestation, or after 20 weeks;</LI>
<LI>intensity of exercise: whether light (oxygen consumption 20% to 39% or heart rate 35% to 54% of maximum), moderate (oxygen consumption 40% to 59% or heart rate 55% to 69% of maximum) or vigorous (oxygen consumption 60% to 85% or heart rate 70% to 90% of maximum), or their equivalents, as broadly classified in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> (<LINK REF="REF-ACSM-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACSM 1998</LINK>).</LI>

<P>Two small trials were included in this review. In one (<LINK REF="STD-USA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1997</LINK>), all women had gestational diabetes, and in the other (<LINK REF="STD-USA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">USA 2000</LINK>), they had either mild hypertension or a previous personal or family history of hypertension. Women in these trials were randomised between 18 and 34 weeks' gestation to moderate/high intensity aerobic exercise, carried out over a variable number of weeks. These trials are described in detail in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>One ongoing study (<LINK REF="STD-USA-2002" TYPE="STUDY">USA 2002</LINK>) is recruiting women with a previous history of pre-eclampsia to assess the effects of moderate intensity aerobic exercise for prevention of recurrent pre-eclampsia. Further details are in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK> table.</P>
<P>Ten studies were excluded. Five were observational studies, two were quasi-randomised, two did not report relevant clinical outcomes, and in one study, 25% of participants were not randomised.

</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-USA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">USA 2000</LINK>) was of good quality, with adequate allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, and no losses to follow up. The other (<LINK REF="STD-USA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1997</LINK>) had adequate concealment of allocation but there was no blinding of outcome assessment, and 12% of participants were excluded from the analysis (one in the exercise group and three in the control group).</P>
</STUDY_QUALITY>
<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>Two trials (45 women) compared moderate intensity aerobic exercise with normal physical activity during pregnancy in women who were at moderate to high risk of pre-eclampsia. Even taken together, these trials are too small for any reliable conclusions about the effects of exercise. The confidence intervals are all wide, and cross the no-effect line for all reported outcomes including pre-eclampsia (two trials, 45 women; relative risk (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 7.09) and gestational hypertension (one trial, 16 women; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 13.37).</P>
<P>Other reported outcomes included preterm birth (two trials, 45 women; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 13.37), small-for-gestational age babies (one trial, 16 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 64.26), and caesarean section (one trial, 29 women; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.88). There were no deaths in the baby in the one trial that reported this outcome. No data were available for any other outcomes.</P>
</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of exercise or increased physical activity on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. Two small trials have compared the effects of regular moderate intensity aerobic exercise during pregnancy with maintenance of normal physical activity for women at moderate to high risk of pre-eclampsia. In both studies, women appeared to have had good compliance with the exercise program. However, these trials are far too small to provide reliable information about the effects of exercise on prevention of pre-eclampsia, or its complications.</P>
<P>Aerobic exercise appears to increase fitness during pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Kramer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kramer 2002</LINK>). One study in this review also reported that cardiorespiratory fitness increased by 10% in the exercise group compared to 5% in the control group (<LINK REF="STD-USA-1997" TYPE="STUDY">USA 1997</LINK>).<BR/> </P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:04:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>At present, there is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions about the possible effects of exercise on prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications. The decision about how much to exercise should therefore be left to individual women, in consultation with their clinicians.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2010-01-18 20:04:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Women often request advice on the appropriate level of exercise or physical activity during pregnancy. In order to provide reliable advice, there is a need for good quality randomised trials with adequate sample size. Such trials should include pre-eclampsia and its complications as reported outcomes.</P>
