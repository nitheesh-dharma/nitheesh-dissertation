<P>Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of tissue damage that occur in the elderly, malnourished or acutely ill, who cannot reposition themselves. The three trials identified found no good evidence that cleansing pressure ulcers (bed sores) using a particular technique, or cleansing with a particular solution, helps healing. Very little research has studied the cleansing of pressure ulcers and therefore we are unable to draw any firm conclusions.</P>

<P>Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of tissue damage that occur in the elderly, malnourished or acutely ill, who cannot reposition themselves. Pressure ulcers impose a significant financial burden on health care systems and negatively affect quality of life. Wound cleansing is considered an important component of pressure ulcer care.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2012-05-08 09:56:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This systematic review seeks to answer the following question: what is the effect of wound cleansing solutions and wound cleansing techniques on the rate of healing of pressure ulcers?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-07 08:16:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 3 January 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2012, Issue 12); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to November Week 3 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations December 31, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2012 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 21 December 2012).<BR/>

</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound cleansing with no wound cleansing, or different wound cleansing solutions, or different cleansing techniques, were eligible for inclusion if they reported an objective measure of pressure ulcer healing. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2012-05-14 19:27:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors extracted data independently and resolved disagreements through discussion. A structured narrative summary of the included studies was conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, risk ratio (RR), plus 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated; for continuous outcomes, mean difference (MD), plus 95% CI were calculated. Meta analysis was not conducted because of the small number of diverse RCTs identified. Two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-01-26 11:30:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One additional eligible study was identified from the updated searches, one study was added to the table of excluded studies. A total of three studies (169 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. No studies compared cleansing with no cleansing. Two studies compared different wound cleansing solutions. A statistically significant improvement in Pressure Sore Status Tool scores occurred for wounds cleansed with saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) compared with isotonic saline (P value = 0.025), but no statistically significant change in healing was seen when water was compared with saline (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 41.89). One study compared cleansing techniques; for pressure ulcers cleansed with pulsatile lavage, compared with sham (the lavage flow was directed into a wash basin positioned adjacent to the wound and not visible to the participants), there was a statistically significant reduction in ulcer volume at the end of the three week study period in the lavage group compared with the sham group (MD -6.60, 95% CI-11.23, -1.97).<B> </B>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-02-13 11:33:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified three small studies addressing cleansing of pressure ulcers. One reported a statistically significant improvement in pressure ulcer healing for wounds cleansed with saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) compared with isotonic saline solution, a further study reported no statistically significant change in healing was seen when wounds were cleaned with water was compared with saline. A final study compared pulsatile lavage with sham and found a significantly greater reduction in ulcer volume at the end of the study period in the lavage group compared with the sham group. The authors conclude that there is no good trial evidence to support use of any particular wound cleansing solution or technique for pressure ulcers.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-05-17 15:10:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, bed sores and decubitus ulcers) are localised areas of tissue damage caused by excess pressure, shearing or friction forces, which occur in those who cannot reposition themselves in order to relieve pressure on their bony prominences. This ability is often diminished in the very old, the malnourished and those with acute illness (<LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1990</LINK>). In order to quantify the problem of pressure ulcers, prevalence studies and incidence studies have been conducted (<LINK REF="REF-Keelaghan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keelaghan 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2006</LINK>). It should be noted that the terms 'prevalence' and 'incidence' have different meanings and should not be used interchangeably. Prevalence refers to the number of people with a pressure ulcer at a point in time, or during a specific time period, while incidence concerns the rate at which new pressure ulcers develop in a defined population in a specific time period (<LINK REF="REF-Beaglehole-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beaglehole 1993</LINK>).</P>
<P>One cross-sectional European study found that approximately 18% of hospital patients had a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK>). An number of Irish studies have identified prevalence rates of between 10% - 18.8% in acute and long tern care settings (<LINK REF="REF-Gallagher-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gallagher 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2012</LINK>). Reported incidence rates of pressure ulcers range from 2.2% to 66% in the UK, to 0% to 65.6% in the USA and Canada (<LINK REF="REF-Kaltenthaler-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaltenthaler 2001</LINK>). These figures are influenced by the location and condition of the patient group (hospital compared with community setting, general hospital patients compared with those with fractured neck of femur) (<LINK REF="REF-Bridel-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bridel 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Versluysen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Versluysen 1986</LINK>). Pressure ulcers are more common in patient groups such as the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Whittington-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whittington 2000</LINK>), those in orthopaedic settings (<LINK REF="REF-Versluysen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Versluysen 1986</LINK>), and those who cannot reposition themselves (for example, younger patients with injuries to the spinal cord). Other medical conditions can also predispose the development of pressure ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Schoonhoven-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoonhoven 2002</LINK>). Changing population demographics and the rise in the number of elderly patients in the future means that the number of people with pressure ulcers is likely to increase in the years ahead (<LINK REF="REF-Haalboom-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haalboom 2000</LINK>). It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that anything which improves ulcer healing outcomes will have a positive impact on both the individual and the health service as a whole (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>The presence of a pressure ulcer impacts on the individual in many ways (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecki 2009</LINK>). Pressure ulcers are painful (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecki 2009</LINK>) and malodorous, especially when there is a large amount of dead tissue combined with anaerobic bacteria in the wound bed (<LINK REF="REF-Stotts-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stotts 2001</LINK>). Furthermore, pressure ulcers can exude profusely, particularly during the early inflammatory phase (<LINK REF="REF-Iocono-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iocono 1998</LINK>), and so require frequent changes of dressings (<LINK REF="REF-Rolstad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolstad 2000</LINK>). It has been noted that the issues of concern for patients are pain, exudates, body image and worry about healing (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2002</LINK>), all of which alter an individual's quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Gorecki-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gorecki 2009</LINK>). In addition, it has been suggested that pressure ulcers also contribute to increased mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Kroger-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroger 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Redelings-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Redelings 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pressure ulcers are a significant financial burden to health care systems (<LINK REF="REF-Posnett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posnett 2009</LINK>). The Touche Ross report (<LINK REF="REF-Touche-Ross-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Touche Ross 1993</LINK>) estimated the annual cost of treatment for pressure ulcers in the UK in 1993, at between £180 and £321 million, with the cost of prevention estimated at £180 to £755 million. More recently, <LINK REF="REF-Bennett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 2004</LINK> explored the cost of pressure ulcer management and suggested that the total annual cost in the UK is £1.4 to 2.1 billion, or 4% of total healthcare expenditure. It is worth noting that costs of litigation or effects on quality of life, in terms of pain, depression and social isolation, were not included in these estimates. Therefore, at present, the precise economic impact of pressure ulcers has yet to be established (<LINK REF="REF-Posnett-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Posnett 2009</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-10-01 18:14:18 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of people with pressure ulcers involves a myriad of different interventions such as nutritional care (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>), pressure reducing/relieving surfaces (<LINK REF="REF-McInnes-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">McInnes 2011</LINK>), repositioning (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2011</LINK>) and skin and wound care (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP_x002f_NPUAP-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP/NPUAP 2009</LINK>). Furthermore, in order to reduce the distress for individuals with pressure ulcers, it is essential that their wounds be managed successfully (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 2002</LINK>). Following assessment of both the patient and the wound, the goal of management is to create the optimum local wound environment for healing (<LINK REF="REF-Rolstad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolstad 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Selection of appropriate topical therapies (i.e. those applied to the skin) is widely believed to contribute to healing (<LINK REF="REF-Rolstad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolstad 2000</LINK>). Available therapies include wound debridement (<LINK REF="REF-Ligresti-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ligresti 2007</LINK>), the application of dressings (<LINK REF="REF-Ligresti-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ligresti 2007</LINK>) and topical antimicrobial agents (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Meara-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Meara 2001</LINK>). However there is little high quality research evidence to support the use of these therapies. Wound cleansing is regarded as an important component of pressure ulcer care (<LINK REF="REF-Hellewell-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hellewell 1997</LINK>). It is assumed to be necessary to remove dead tissue and foreign bodies from wounds, and is usually undertaken before applying a dressing (<LINK REF="REF-Flanagan-1998a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flanagan 1998a</LINK>). However, there is uncertainty about what constitutes best practice (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2012</LINK>) and whether cleansing at all makes a difference. Clinicians and manufacturers recommend different solutions and methods of application, which is confusing (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 1999</LINK>). Indeed, it is argued that wound cleansing practice is often based on past experience and ritual rather than the best available evidence (<LINK REF="REF-Carr-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carr 2006</LINK>).</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez 2012</LINK> previously conducted a systematic review of the effect of water as a wound cleanser however an exploration of the effect of cleansing technique was not a feature of this review. It is argued that wound cleansing has three elements: namely, the technique, the solution and the equipment (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1995</LINK>). Techniques used include high pressure irrigation, swabbing, low pressure irrigation, showering, bathing, washing the affected area under a running solution, or total immersion in a whirlpool bath (also known as hydrotherapy) (<LINK REF="REF-Lawrence-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawrence 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindholm-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindholm 1999</LINK>). Different cleansing solutions are also used; for example, normal saline, water, and antiseptic solutions (<LINK REF="REF-Angeras-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angeras 1992</LINK>). Furthermore, wound cleansing requires the use of equipment; for example, syringes, needles, catheters and pressurised canisters (<LINK REF="REF-Young-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Young 1995</LINK>). Therefore, it is important to explore all components of the wound cleansing process, as the correct application of the solution may be as relevant as the solution itself (<LINK REF="REF-Morison-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morison 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singer-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singer 1994</LINK>). Consequently, it was decided to undertake a systematic review of the literature to summarise current evidence that could provide a contribution to relevant clinical guidelines. In addition, the review will inform research in this important area of patient care.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). This tool addresses six specific domains: namely, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance) (see <LINK REF="APP-05" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 5</LINK>) for details of criteria on which each judgement was based). Blinding and completeness of outcome data were assessed for each outcome separately. We then completed a risk of bias table for each eligible study, identifying wether we judged each component of the study to be low, unclear or high risk of bias. We have presented an assessment of risk of bias using a 'risk of bias summary figure' (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) which presents all of the judgments in a cross-tabulation of study by entry.

The study by <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1998</LINK> was excluded at this review stage because the ocutome measures employed were objective not subjective (defined by <LINK REF="STD-Burke-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Burke 1998</LINK> as wounds improved or not improved), this is an exclusion criteria as we had previously stated that the we would only include studies reporting an objective measure of pressure ulcer healing, such as time to complete healing; absolute or percentage change in pressure ulcer area or volume over time; proportion of pressure ulcers healed at the completion of the trial period; or healing rate.</P>
<P>Three eligible RCTs were identified, therefore, CCTs were not considered. The trials were published between 2001 and 2012. The first study looked at cleansing of chronic wounds (including pressure ulcers) with saline compared with cleansing with water, in the community care setting (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>). The second study looked at cleansing of pressure ulcers with isotonic saline compared with cleansing with saline spray containing <I>Aloe vera</I>, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) in the hospital setting (<LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK>). The final study looked at cleansing of pressure ulcers with low-pressure pulsatile lavage compared with sham (the lavage flow was directed into a washbasin positioned adjacent to the wound), in a spinal cord injury tertiary care center inpatient unit (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>). Overall, sample size was generally small which, consequently, is a major limitation of the studies; indeed the mean sample size was 53 (range 8 to 110).</P>

<P>All studies detailed participant eligibility criteria and all stated that the participants were randomly allocated to the groups however only two studies reported an adequate method of generating the random sequence (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>).

<P>Performance bias occurs where the awareness of which group the participant is in, rather than the intervention itself, actually affect the study outcomes. Reducing the risk of performance bias may be achieved through blinding participants and care givers. However, this remains a challenge in wound care, as many of the treatments used look different and are therefore difficult to disguise. None the less, <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK> ensured that the participants were blind to the treatment allocation, however the treatment nurse knew which group each participant was in. <LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK> ensured that the outcome assessor was blinded to the treatment allocation, in addition the treatment nurse was also blinded (this was relatively easy to do as both solutions (saline and tap water) appeared identical). <LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK> does not report whether the participant or the care giver were blinded to treatment allocation.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">How the results are presented and what the terms mean</HEADING>
<P>Results for dichotomous variables are presented as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Risk ratio is the rate of the event of interest (e.g. pressure ulcers healed) in the experimental group divided by the rate of this event in the control group and indicates the chances of pressure ulcer healing for people on the experimental treatment compared with the control treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Results for continuous variables are presented as mean difference (MD), with 95% CI. The mean difference measures the absolute difference between the mean value in two groups in a clinical trial (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). It estimates the amount by which the experimental intervention changes the outcome on average (for example, changes in pressure ulcer volume) compared with the control (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Interpretation of the results is the same as RR except the point of no effect is 0 rather than 1 (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>One RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK>) enrolled 133 patients with pressure ulcers greater than Grade 1 (National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel scale, <LINK REF="REF-NPUAP-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">NPUAP 1989</LINK>), seven of whom withdrew before the end of the trial because they were put onto antibiotics; use of antibiotics was an exclusion criterion. It is not known to which group or groups these seven participants were allocated and the trial author, in a personal communication, has not been able to obtain this information. Analysis was based on the 126 subjects who completed the trial.</P>
<P>The Pressure Sore Status Tool (PSST), developed in 1992 by Bates-Jensen and colleagues, was used as an outcome measure in this study (<LINK REF="REF-Bates_x002d_Jensen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates-Jensen 1992</LINK>). The tool uses 13 different items to assess pressure ulcer condition. All the items are scored with a Likert scale, giving a final value of between 13 and 65, with 13 indicating a healed ulcer.</P>
<P>There were 46 women and 28 men in the control group, with a median age of 73 years (range 62 to 83 years). Their wounds were cleansed with isotonic saline solution: PSST at baseline was 33 for this group, with a standard deviation (SD) of 10.3, minimum value (min) 15, maximum value (max) 52. There were 36 women and 23 men in the intervention group, with a median age of 74 years (range 56 to 84 years). Their wounds were cleansed with saline spray with <I>Aloe vera</I>, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur): mean PSST at baseline was 34.0, with SD 11.5, min 13.0, max 52.0. (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> data presented in the study report with translated headings).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome measure: percentage reduction in pressure sore status</HEADING>
<P>The mean percentage change from baseline to day 14 in the control group was -20.5 (SD 24.1, min -65.8, max 22.7), while the mean percentage change in the Vulnopur spray group was -27.8 (SD 31.3, min 69.8, max 123.5). The data from this study were skewed and the trialists used non-parametric tests that cannot be reproduced, because the raw data were not reported. As RevMan assumes a normal distribution, data have not been plotted graphically for this study, and we have accepted the trialists' analysis, which found that there was a statistically significant improvement in healing in the intervention group (P value = 0.025). The original author cannot confirm the group(s) from which the seven patients withdrew due to infection, however, the final group sizes are n = 59 in the Vulnopur group and n = 74 in the control group. If more of these patients withdrew from the Vulnopur group, the result would be biased towards that group.</P>

<P>Whilst the RCT comparing saline with tap water (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>), which enrolled 43 patients with 60 wounds, was intended to be analysed by intention to treat, eight patients were lost to follow up (four from each group) because they were admitted into hospital, did not adhere to the protocol, or declined to continue to participate therefore this was not analysis by intention to treat. Data analysis was, therefore, conducted on 35 patients with 49 wounds, eight of which were pressure ulcers. The data on pressure ulcers alone was made available by the trial authors, and this data forms the basis of what is reported in this review, i.e. 8 individuals with one pressure ulcer each.</P>
<P>The patients had chronic wounds of Grade 2 or 3, using Carville's definition (<LINK REF="REF-Carville-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carville 1995</LINK>), and were receiving care in a community setting. According to Carville's definition, Grade 2 wounds have partial-thickness skin loss (down to the epidermis and/or dermis), while Grade 3 wounds have full-thickness skin loss (down to, but not through, the fascia) (<LINK REF="REF-Carville-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Carville 1995</LINK>). For the purpose of this review, data are presented on the eight pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>There were three men and three women in the intervention group (six wounds), with a mean age of 70.5 years (range 40 to 82 years). Their wounds were cleansed with tap water; the mean wound diameter size at baseline was 463 mm (range 59 mm to 826 mm). The control group consisted of one man and one woman (two wounds), with a mean age of 71 years (range 56 to 86 years). Their wounds were cleansed using saline; the mean wound size at baseline was 713 mm; range 535 mm to 790 mm.</P>
<P>Wound cleansing for both groups was conducted in a similar manner. The wounds were irrigated with either saline or water, delivered at room temperature via a 30 ml syringe and a 20 g cannula. The surrounding skin was patted dry and a clean dressing applied. It is not clear from the study how often the wounds were irrigated. A variety of topical dressings were used, including hydrocolloids and gels. A combination of hydrocolloid and gel or hydrocolloid alone was used topically on the intervention group, whereas either a hydrocolloid alone or a hydrocolloid and hydrocolloid paste was used in the control group. The participants were followed up for a period of six weeks.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome measure: number of ulcers healed</HEADING>
<P>Three wounds cleansed with tap water healed in the six-week period, whereas none of the wounds cleansed with saline had healed at six weeks; risk ratio (RR) was 3.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 41.89) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

</P>
<P>One small RCT (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>) recruited inpatients who had spinal cord injury and were receiving standard wound care for Grade 3 and 4 pelvic (coccygeal, ischial, or trochanteric region) pressure ulcers. 28 males were included in the study and randomly allocated, using a computer-generated randomisation table, to control group (sham; n=14 ) or to the intervention group (pulsatile lavage; n=14 ). The authors report that the two groups were equivalent at baseline.</P>
<P>In the intervention group, low-pressure pulsatile lavage treatment with 1 litre of normal saline at 11 psi of pressure was applied to the pressure ulcer once daily. In the control group, the pressure ulcers received sham treatment, that is, the lavage flow was directed into a washbasin positioned adjacent to the wound and was not visible to the participants, yet the noise of the machine could be heard by the participant. Following pulsatile lavage or sham treatment, each study participant received standard wound care (moist wound care) and bed rest with regular turning, and use of a low air loss mattress for those with pelvic pressure ulcers.</P>
<P>The participants were followed up for a three week period and improvement in pressure ulcer condition was assessed by measuring changes in ulcer volume, length, width and depth of the pressure ulcers.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">Primary outcome measure: improvement in pressure ulcer condition</HEADING>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2012-10-26 13:37:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>No adequately powered RCT was identified that compared cleansing with no cleansing of pressure ulcers. Three small RCTs were identified, each exploring a different aspect of wound cleansing. This is interesting when one considers that 18% of hospitalised patients have a pressure ulcer (<LINK REF="REF-EPUAP-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">EPUAP 2002</LINK>) and that wound cleansing, among many other interventions such as repositioning and nutritional support, is a routine component of the management of these wounds (<LINK REF="REF-Rolstad-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rolstad 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) was found to significantly improve PSST scores when used to cleanse pressure ulcers compared with isotonic saline. Furthermore, in one small RCT, cleansing with pulsatile lavage yielded a greater mean reduction in ulcer volume, compared with sham. There was no statistically significant difference in healing of pressure ulcers that had cleansed with saline when compared with those cleansed with water.</P>
<P>Some methodological issues require consideration and limit the conclusions that can be drawn from this review. The existing studies are small and underpowered - indeed the mean sample size was 53 (range 8 to 110) - which restricts the certainty with which differences between groups can be identified as statistically significant.</P>
<P>Risk of bias due to methodological approaches used and potential risk of bias where poor reporting precluded the adequate assessment of bias are important considerations in this review. True allocation concealment prevents the researcher being aware which group, experimental or control, a participant is allocated to, ensuring that the participant is assigned to a specific study group by chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Concealment of group allocation was inadequately described in all of the studies. It has been suggested that lack of a clear description of allocation concealment leads to bias in assessing the outcome of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>); the size of the effect could be overestimated and so give a false impression of the value of the intervention. Studies without adequate allocation concealment tend to report larger estimates of effect when compared to those who describe adequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Blinding of the study is said to be complete if the investigators, participants, outcome assessor, and the data analyst do not know which group the participant is allocated to (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Human behaviour is influenced by prior knowledge, thus, without blinding, there is a risk that the size of the effect may be overestimated, resulting in a bias in favour of the treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Day-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Day 2000</LINK>). Therefore, blinding is considered important in the assessment of subjective outcomes, such as ease of use of a treatment, and in ensuring comparability of assessment and diagnostic interventions across all groups within a study (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Blinding is difficult to achieve in wound care, however blinded outcome assessment was achieved in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Griffiths-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Griffiths 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>), though information on blinding was not reported by <LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK>.</P>
<P>The rationale for using intention to treat analysis is two-fold; it maintains treatment groups that are similar (apart from random variation) and therefore validates the use of randomisation, and allows for handling of protocol deviations, further protecting the randomisation process (<LINK REF="REF-Hollis-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hollis 1999</LINK>). Omitting those who do not complete the study from the final analysis may bias the outcomes of the study, because those who do not complete may do so because of adverse effects of the intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Montori-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montori 2001</LINK>). Intention to treat analysis was conducted in one of the studies as there were no reported withdrawals (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>) and <LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK> reported undertaking a per protocol analysis. <LINK REF="REF-Greenhalgh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenhalgh 1997</LINK> suggests that data should be analysed for all participants originally included in the study, even if they did not complete the trial. Failure to do this can lead to an overestimation of the size of the effect, usually in favour of the intervention. However, although <LINK REF="REF-Fergusson-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fergusson 2002</LINK> argues that there may be certain circumstances where it is possible to exclude patients from analysis after randomisation (in order to avoid bias and to minimise random error), well designed studies that adhere to a high standard of methodological rigour, should ensure that this rarely happens.</P>
<P>In three of the studies, information regarding prognostic factors was unclear. The CONSORT statement set out to identify the key criteria required of authors when reporting results of studies (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>). The rationale for the development of this statement is that, to understand the significance of an RCT, the reader must be able to comprehend all components of the study clearly. Therefore, in order to be able to do this, the studies must include all relevant information when they are published. For the reader, the ability to judge the quality of a study is severely hampered by a lack of baseline data. It is evident from the studies included in this review that important pieces of information are either not reported or are not adequately described.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is little evidence available pertaining to wound cleansing for pressure ulcers. One study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in outcomes for wounds cleansed with saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) compared to isotonic saline solution (<LINK REF="STD-Bellingeri-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Bellingeri 2004</LINK>) however this study was poorly reported and at potential risk of bias. A small study demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in ulcer volume reduction in wounds cleansed with pulsatile lavage compared with those cleansed using sham pulsatile lavage (<LINK REF="STD-Ho-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Ho 2012</LINK>). It appears that there is no evidence supporting the use of water rather than saline as a wound cleansing solution. None of the trials were without some risk of bias.</P>
<P>Well designed, robust studies are required. Such trials need to be sufficiently powered, with all groups comparable at baseline, adequate allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment, with an intention to treat analysis, before firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<P>There have been no RCTs comparing the effects of cleansing pressure ulcers with not cleansing them. There is some evidence that cleansing pressure ulcers using a saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) may be associated with improved healing however this evidence may be at risk of bias. There is also some evidence to suggest that pressure ulcer cleansing using pulsatile lavage may increase healing. Overall high quality, valid evidence about the effects of different approaches to cleansing pressure ulcers is scant. </P>

<P>For this second review update we searched the following electronic databases:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 26/3/10)</LI>
<LI>The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library 2010 Issue 1</LI>

<P>The search strategies for Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL can be found in appendices. The Ovid MEDLINE search was combined with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identifying randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- and precision-maximizing version (2008 revision). The Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL searches was combined with the trial filters developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Searching other resources</HEADING>
<P>For the original review, we searched the bibliographies of all retrieved and relevant publications, identified through these strategies. Drug companies who supply cleansing solutions, as identified in the British National Formulary (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2003</LINK>) and experts in the wound care field, namely: council members of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, The European Wound Management Association, The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and the World Union of Wound Healing Societies, were contacted (by ZM) to identify any studies not located through the primary search, or to identify any further researchers involved in pressure ulcer research, whom the authors could contact directly.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">1.  Was the allocation sequence randomly generated?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: referring to a random number table; using a computer random number generator; coin tossing; shuffling cards or envelopes; throwing dice; drawing of lots.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non-random approach, for example: sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">2.  Was the treatment allocation adequately concealed?</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Low risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, web-based and pharmacy-controlled randomisation); sequentially-numbered drug containers of identical appearance; sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">High risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non opaque or not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Unclear</HEADING>
<P>Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk of bias. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement, for example if the use of assignment envelopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups.</LI>
<LI>For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate.</LI>
