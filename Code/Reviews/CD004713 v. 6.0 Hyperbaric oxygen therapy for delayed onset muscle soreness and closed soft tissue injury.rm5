<P>Soft tissue injuries are very common. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves people breathing pure oxygen in a specially designed chamber. It is sometimes used to increase the supply of oxygen to the injured area in an attempt to speed recovery. Our review included nine small trials, involving a total of 219 participants. Two trials compared HBOT versus sham therapy on ankle sprain and knee sprain respectively. Neither trial provided sufficient evidence to determine if HBOT helped people with these injuries. The other seven trials examined the effect of HBOT on muscle injury following unaccustomed exercise. There was no evidence that HBOT helped people with muscle injury following unaccustomed exercise, but some evidence that people given HBOT had slightly more pain. Further research on HBOT is not a high priority given the variety of other treatment interventions available.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-05-10 12:09:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Soft tissue injuries (including muscle damage after unaccustomed exercise) are common and are often associated with athletic activity. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than one atmosphere.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the benefits and harms of HBOT for treating soft tissue injury, including delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-05-10 12:09:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched The Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to February 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>(2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 Week 07), CINAHL (1982 to October 2008), an additional database developed in our hyperbaric facility and reference lists of articles. Relevant journals were handsearched and researchers in the field contacted.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing the effect on closed soft tissue injury (including DOMS) of therapeutic regimens which include HBOT with those that exclude HBOT (with or without sham therapy).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-12-18 14:40:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Four authors independently evaluated study quality and extracted data. Most of the data presented in the review were extracted from graphs in the trial reports.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Nine small trials involving 219 participants were included. Two trials compared HBOT versus sham therapy on acute closed soft tissue injuries (ankle sprain and medial collateral knee ligament injury respectively). The other seven trials examined the effect of HBOT on DOMS following eccentric exercise in unconditioned volunteers.</P>
<P>All 32 participants of the ankle sprain trial returned to their normal activities. There were no significant differences between the two groups in time to recovery, functional outcomes, pain, or swelling. There was no difference between the two groups in knee function scores in the second acute injury trial; however, intention-to-treat analysis was not possible for this trial.</P>
<P>Pooling of data from the seven DOMS trials showed significantly and consistently higher pain at 48 and 72 hours in the HBOT group (mean difference in pain score at 48 hours [0 to 10 worst pain] 0.88, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.67, P = 0.03) in trials where HBOT was started immediately. There were no differences between the two groups in longer-term pain scores or in any measures of swelling or muscle strength.</P>
<P>No trial reported complications of HBOT but careful selection of participants was evident in most trials.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the effects of HBOT on ankle sprain or acute knee ligament injury, or on experimentally induced DOMS. There was some evidence that HBOT may increase interim pain in DOMS. Any future use of HBOT for these injuries would need to have been preceded by carefully conducted randomised controlled trials which have demonstrated effectiveness.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-12-18 15:28:00 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Soft tissue injuries are common and range from minor abrasions and bruising to major disruption of tendons, ligaments and muscles. It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of the impact on society of soft-tissue injuries taken in isolation, but injuries in general result in tens of millions of emergency room visits and cost hundreds of billions of healthcare dollars per annum in the USA alone (<LINK REF="REF-Finnegan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnegan 2003</LINK>). Soft tissue injuries are commonly associated with athletic activity, and occur in both elite and recreational athletes. In both these groups, soft tissue injuries may be associated with considerable loss of work and health costs (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Mechelen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Mechelen 1997</LINK>). The causes of soft tissue injuries are diverse and may involve acute traumatic impact, repetitive strain and overuse, or muscle injury induced by unaccustomed exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Babul-2000a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Babul 2000a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leach-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leach 1998</LINK>). This review is restricted to acute closed injuries involving muscle, ligament and tendon only, and where the mechanism is unaccustomed use, trauma from a direct blow, strain or overuse injury.</P>
<P>Of particular interest in this review is the phenomenon of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Familiar to most individuals at some time, this is the name given to the syndrome of pain, swelling and stiffness in muscles in the days following a bout of unaccustomed activity in that muscle group. DOMS can exhibit as anything from minor muscle soreness to debilitating pain and swelling, but is most commonly described as causing a reduction in joint range of motion, shock attenuation and peak torque. A recent review confirms that the mechanisms, treatment strategies, and impact on athletic performance remain uncertain (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2003</LINK>). Putative mechanisms include lactic acid accumulation, muscle spasms, connective tissue damage, inflammation and enzyme efflux secondary to muscle cell damage. DOMS is frequently used as an experimental soft tissue injury in human research because it is both self-limiting and reliably reproduced in individuals unaccustomed to exercise.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-12-18 15:28:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Accepted treatment methods vary greatly with the specific injury. They may, however, be classified broadly as rest, local measures to reduce oedema (e.g. massage, cryotherapy, elevation), drug therapy (typically non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents), stretching or further exercise (particularly for delayed onset muscle soreness), surgical, and rehabilitative (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kader-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kader 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Perryman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perryman 2002</LINK>). The ultimate aim of treatment is to restore pain free function and enable the return to activity in the shortest time compatible with a low risk of re-injury.</P>
<P>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the therapeutic administration of 100% oxygen at environmental pressures greater than one atmosphere absolute (ATA). Administration of HBOT involves placing the injured individual in an airtight vessel, increasing the pressure within that vessel, and administering 100% oxygen for respiration. In this way, it is possible to deliver a greatly increased partial pressure (supply) of oxygen to the tissues. Typically, treatments involve pressurisation to between 1.5 and 3.0 ATA for periods between 60 and 120 minutes once or twice daily.</P>
<P>HBOT is associated with some risk of adverse effects including damage to the ears, sinuses and lungs from the effects of pressure, temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia and oxygen poisoning. Although serious adverse events are rare, HBOT cannot be regarded as benign.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2009-12-18 15:28:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It has been suggested since 1982 that HBOT might accelerate injury recovery (<LINK REF="REF-Oriani-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oriani 1982</LINK>). HBOT has been shown in a number of injury models to reduce oedema and preserve microcirculation through vasoconstriction with enhanced oxygen delivery, a direct osmotic effect and the inactivation of white cell adhesion (<LINK REF="REF-Hills-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hills 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nylander-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nylander 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Staples-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Staples 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thom-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1994</LINK>). The first clinical report, which appeared in 1993, described a 55% reduction in days lost to injury by Scottish soccer players suffering from a variety of injuries following the application of HBOT (<LINK REF="REF-James-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 1993</LINK>). Since then, a number of anecdotal reports in the non-medical media suggest that the use of HBOT has become commonplace in some elite sporting clubs. In addition, some comparative human trials have been published.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2009-12-18 15:27:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the increasing use of HBOT for soft tissue injury, and the uncertainty about the benefit and risks of this therapy, it is important to carry out a systematic review of the evidence.</P>
</IMPORTANCE>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The aim of this review is to assess the evidence for the use of HBOT for the treatment of soft tissue injuries including DOMS. Specifically, we wish to address, does HBOT safely improve and speed-up functional outcome after injury?</P>

<P>We considered any randomised or quasi-randomised (use of a method of allocating participants to a treatment that is not strictly random; e.g. by date of birth or hospital record number) clinical trials that compared HBOT with no HBOT (no treatment or sham).

<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>We accepted studies that compared treatment regimens including HBOT with similar regimens that excluded HBOT. Where co-interventions differed significantly between studies this was clearly stated and the implications discussed. </P>
<P>We accepted any standard HBOT regimen used for promoting recovery from soft tissue injury.

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-04 13:06:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>In this review, risk of bias is implicitly assessed in terms of methodological quality.</P>
<P>Study quality was assessed using an adaptation of the method outlined in <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>. The results of the quality assessment are presented in a descriptive manner. We assessed adequacy of randomisation, adequacy of allocation concealment, completeness of outcome data and the level of masking. Details of the assessment categories are shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2010-05-04 12:22:11 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Analyses were performed using the RevMan 4.2.3 software. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses wherever possible. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals calculated for continuous outcomes. Results of comparable groups of trials were pooled using the fixed-effect model. We analysed different injury categories separately (tendon/ligament injury, DOMS). Heterogeneity between comparable trials was estimated using the I² statistic and consideration given to the appropriateness of pooling. Where there was an indication of significant heterogeneity, we stipulated analysis using a random-effects model.</P>
</DATA_SYNTHESIS>
<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2010-05-04 12:22:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Where appropriate data were available, we considered subgroup analysis based on the following.<BR/>(1) Injury entry grade or severity using an established specific injury classification system where the authors have employed such a system.<BR/>(2) Type of injury including anatomical location.<BR/>(3) Dose of oxygen received (pressure, time and length of treatment course).<BR/>(4) Nature of the comparative treatment modalities, including no specific therapy.<BR/>(5) Age (adults versus children).<BR/>(6) Nature of the activity undertaken.</P>
<P>Tests of interaction were calculated to determine if the results for subgroups were significantly different. Statistical heterogeneity was assumed to be significant if the I² analysis suggested more than 30% of the variability in an analysis was due to differences between trials. Consideration was then given to the appropriateness of pooling and meta-analysis.</P>

<SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-12-18 15:55:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Where appropriate, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses investigating the effects of study quality based on the Schulz quality score (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and missing data.

The best-case scenario assumes that none of the originally enrolled participants missing from the primary analysis in the treatment group had the negative outcome of interest whilst all those missing from the control group did. The worst-case scenario is the reverse.</P>

<P>The original search in July 2004 identified 24 publications apparently dealing with the use of HBOT for the treatment of soft tissue injuries including DOMS. Initial examination confirmed four were reviews without new data, four did not involve the application of HBOT, two were case reports or case series, one was not a clinical study and one was an animal study. These reports were excluded, leaving 13 publications of possible randomised comparative trials. Repeat searching up to February 2010 of the same databases and the latest editions of textbooks and journals identified above identified no further studies. An additional reference for an already included trial (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>) was identified.</P>
<P>After appraisal of the full reports we included nine trials, two (<LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>) of which were reported in the same paper and represent 'phase 1' and 'phase 2' of a two stage study with different comparisons in each phase.

<P>The nine included trials were published between 1996 and 2003, and from a limited number of centres in Canada (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>), the USA (<LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) and Europe (<LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>). The authors are unaware of any ongoing RCTs in the area. In total, these trials recruited 219 participants but presented results for only 197 participants (90%). The number of participants in each trial ranged from 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>) to 49 (<LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>). Further details of the trials are presented in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two trials evaluated HBOT for treating acute soft tissue injury: <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> enrolled individuals with acute ankle sprains presenting within 72 hours to an orthopaedic surgeon, while <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK> enrolled individuals with grade II medial collateral ligament injuries in one knee who similarly presented within 72 hours. The other seven trials included young adult unconditioned volunteers who underwent exercise designed to produce DOMS under controlled conditions. Exercise intensity and duration varied across these studies, but all except <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK> involved multiple repetitions of resistance to lengthening of the target muscle group (eccentric exercise). Four trials exercised the quadriceps. Three of these (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>) specified the non-dominant leg and used the same protocol; the other used a similar protocol involving up to 150 repetitions (<LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>). Two studies exercised the forearm flexors, involving maximal resistance to elbow extension for 60 and 72 repetitions respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>). The remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>) involved bilateral calf muscles raises against an 80% of maximal load - five repetitions to failure. None of the trials reported a failure to produce DOMS in any study participant, and all trials indicated the use of these exercise protocols in previous studies.</P>
<P>Both the dose of oxygen per treatment session and for the total course of treatment varied between studies. The lowest dose administered was 2.0 atmosphere absolute (ATA) for 60 minutes on three occasions (intervention groups in <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>), while the highest single treatment dose was 2.5 ATA for 100 minutes for five sessions over three days (<LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>). The longest course was in <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK> who applied 60 minute treatments for 10 days. All authors therefore used between 2.0 ATA and 2.5 ATA as a maximum oxygen pressure and the total number of individual treatment sessions varied from three to 10. The mean time between injury and compression was 33 hours in <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> and 74 hours in <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>. Most DOMS trials administered oxygen or sham therapy immediately (up to four hours) after the exercise session, the exceptions being one of the two HBOT groups in both <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>, who received the first treatment approximately 24 hours after exercise ('delayed treatment').</P>
<P>Active HBOT was compared to a sham hyperbaric oxygen exposure breathing air at a trivial pressure in six trials (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>). The same type of sham exposure was used for the delayed HBOT groups in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>, while <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK> employed sham exposure at pressure by administering an 8% oxygen mixture to keep inspired oxygen tension equal to that at one atmosphere. No sham was used in the control groups of <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>, and one of the two control groups of <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>.</P>
<P>The follow-up period varied between trials, ranging from day three following exercise (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>) to six weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> followed participants to full functional recovery. All included studies reported at least one outcome of interest. Of the outcomes identified above, the trials reported data on two primary outcomes (time to full functional recovery and proportion returning to full function) and three secondary outcomes of interest (functional assessments, pain and swelling, and muscle strength).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Blinding</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials utilised a sham therapy in order to mask participants to HBOT (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>). One study (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) only provided a sham session for the group receiving delayed HBOT 24 hours after injury, while another (<LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>) did not report any blinding of participants or investigators to therapy.

<P>Both trials reported functional assessment scores. Based on an unvalidated seven-point scale, where successive scores represented an increasingly difficult level of functional activity, <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> found no significant difference between groups in the functional scores attained at the end of the final treatment session (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>: mean difference (MD) 1.00, 95% CI -0.41 to 2.41). However, <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> noted a significantly greater improvement in scores in the HBOT group compared with those in control group (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>: MD 1.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.65; P = 0.03). <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK> shows the subjective recovery of knee function results (presumed here to be on a 0 to 100 scale where 100 equals full recovery) at three follow-up times for the 14 participants clinically followed up in <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>. In presenting the results for this trial, we have assumed that there were seven participants in each group.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Pain and swelling</HEADING>
<P>Subjective pain scores, reported for both trials, decreased over time in participants of both groups.

<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>: MD 5.00, 95% CI -2.07 to 12.07) or in the decrease in pain from the initial scores (data not shown). Again assuming there were seven participants in each group of <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>, the mean pain scores were statistically significantly better in the HBOT group after 10 treatments (two weeks), but not after five treatments (one week) or at four weeks follow up (<I>see </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>: MD -1.20, 95% CI -8.36 to 5.96). The two-week result is no longer statistically significant when eight participants are assumed to be in the HBOT group and six in the control group (MD -12.00, 95% -24.31 to 0.31: Analysis not shown).</P>
<P>Swelling of the affected joint was measured in different ways in the two trials. <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> reported no significant difference between the two groups in the reduction of the foot and ankle volume, determined by water displacement, after each of the three treatments or overall (26 ml with HBOT versus 32 ml with sham HBOT). <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK> found the mean difference in knee girth between the normal and injured sides, assessed by tape measure at four weeks, was less in the HBOT group (0.11 cm versus 0.43 cm).

<P>Pooled data from four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>) for pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours, and from between four and seven days are shown in <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>. These show no significant differences between the two groups at 24 hours or later on (at end of treatment), but statistically significant differences in favour of the control group at 48 hours (MD 0.88, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.67) and 72 hours (MD 0.72, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.37). Heterogeneity was assessed as low for each comparison (I² = 0%). Subgroup analysis by muscle group exercised showed a similar effect with regard to arm and leg muscles (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>). Participants were pain free by 15 days in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> and were nearly pain free at 10 days in <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>.</P>
<P>Two trials did not report standard deviations (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>) for pain data. <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK> reported there was no difference in perceived muscle soreness between the two groups at 24, 48 or 72 hours after exercise (mean difference in visual analogue scale score (0-10) at 72 hours between control and HBOT: MD 1.35, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.64; this was reported as being no longer statistically significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for multiplicity of outcomes). Though <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> reported muscle soreness had returned to baseline levels at day three for the HBOT group while still being elevated for the control group, there were apparently no significant differences in the overall results over time. The presentation of the pain results of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK> was unclear and incomplete and could not be used to confirm the reported enhanced recovery for pain sensation in the HBOT group.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">2. Pain scores (10 = worst pain) with delayed HBOT</HEADING>
<P>Pooled data from the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>) examining delayed HBOT for pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours, and at four and seven days respectively (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). These show no significant differences between the two groups at 24 or 48 hours or later on (at end of treatment), but statistically significant differences in favour of the control group at 72 hours (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.64). However, the results for the two trials were significantly heterogeneous for this follow-up time (I² = 62%).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="6">3. Swelling</HEADING>
<P>Various physical measures were used to represent swelling. Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>) reported on limb circumference; and two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK>) reported respectively on the actual values and percentage change from baseline for the cross-sectional area of different muscles. <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> did not report mean difference or standard deviations. <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK> reported there was no difference in quadriceps circumference, measured at 10 cm and 20 cm above the patella, between the two groups at 24, 48 or 72 hours after exercise (mean difference in quadriceps circumference (10 cm level) at 72 hours between control and HBOT: MD -0.66 cm, 95% CI -6.52 to 5.19 cm). <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> reported there were no significant differences between the two groups or across time. <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK> shows the results at different times for the other three trials testing immediate HBOT; there were no statistically significant differences between the HBOT and control groups for any trial. This was also the case for the results of delayed treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Strength</HEADING>
<P>The strength of the various muscles specifically exercised in the seven trials was measured and reported in several ways. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>) reported maximal eccentric quadriceps muscle torque in Newton metres (Nm). However, <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK> did not report mean values or standard deviations in either group and therefore did not contribute to the pooled result. <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> did not report the numbers of participants in each group. Sensitivity analyses allowing for seven participants in the HBOT group and eight in the control group, or vice versa, in <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> showed non-significant results between the two groups in muscle torque. <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> reported the percentage of the initial isometric strength of forearm flexors, while <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK> reported the maximal isometric strength of elbow flexor muscles in kilopascals. <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK> reported the percentage reduction of peak torque calf muscles.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK> shows the pooled results at different times for five of the seven trials testing immediate HBOT: there were no statistically significant differences in the various measures between the HBOT and control groups for any trial. This was also the case for the results of delayed treatment in <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>). The variety of measures used means that the actual pooled results in both these graphs are difficult to interpret. The main message is the lack of statistically significant difference as well as the low heterogeneity (I² = 0%) at all times for the two comparisons, with the one exception being the 96 hours results for the delayed HBOT versus control comparison (I² = 64%). It is also notable that recovery of muscle strength (88% versus 82%) was incomplete in both groups of <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> by day 15. In contrast, the results of both groups of <LINK REF="STD-Webster-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Webster 2002</LINK> exceeded their initial values (101.5% versus 103.9%) by day five. <LINK REF="STD-Babul-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Babul 2003</LINK> reported there was no difference in maximal eccentric torque of the quadriceps muscle between the two groups at 24, 48 or 72 hours after exercise (mean difference in maximal eccentric torque at 72 hours between control and HBOT: MD -28.25 Nm, 95% CI -58.21 to 1.71 Nm).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Adverse effects of therapy</HEADING>
<P>No trial reported complications of HBOT. The exclusion of one participant from <LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK> due to quadriceps muscle compartment syndrome occurred prior to treatment and is likely to have resulted from the exercise protocol.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-05-04 12:41:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>This review has included data from nine trials and we believe these represent all the randomised controlled clinical trials in this area, both published and unpublished, at the time of searching the databases. While we have made every effort to locate further unpublished data, it remains possible that this review is subject to a positive publication bias, with generally favourable trials more likely to achieve reporting. Given this possibility, the general lack of benefit detected for HBOT for the two trials of closed soft tissue injuries (ankle and knee sprains) or the seven trials of experimentally induced DOMS is notable. Another limitation is the lack of data on long-term effects or on quality of life outcomes.</P>
<P>We located only nine trials with 219 participants in total, and there were substantially fewer participants in the data available for pooling. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Germain-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Germain 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK>) failed to provide the numbers of each group included in their results: intention-to-treat analysis was not possible for these. Most of the data presented in the review graphs were estimated from graphs published in the trial reports. While clearly unsatisfactory, this was the best we could do in the absence of information from the trial investigators. The general scarcity of data precluded most subgroup analyses but also it is notable that, with few exceptions, the results of trials testing HBOT for DOMS were homogeneous. Other problems for this review were the failure to report on primary functional outcomes in many studies, poor reporting of means and standard deviations, the variable methods used for reporting similar outcomes across studies and the lack of data regarding the treatment of uncontrolled muscle injury. In particular, the concentration of these studies on a short-term, self-limiting injury with a 100% recovery rate (DOMS) demands a cautious interpretation of the results.</P>
<P>For ankle sprains, <LINK REF="STD-Borromeo-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Borromeo 1997</LINK> reported no significant benefits in the return to previous activities, in time to recovery, in functional outcomes, pain or swelling. Though the authors found a statistically significant improvement for the HBOT group in the change scores for ankle function, the practical significance of this finding should be interpreted cautiously as this scale has not been validated and the clinical impact is difficult to assess.</P>
<P>The trial of HBOT for grade II medial collateral ligament injury conducted by <LINK REF="STD-Soolsma-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Soolsma 1996</LINK> (only reported to date in an unpublished Master of Science thesis) has several features that remain unclear. Importantly, the number of participants allocated to each arm and the scales on which a number of the outcomes are measured are unknown. Our inability to conduct intention-to-treat analyses for this trial and the difficulties in assessing clinical significance severely restricts the usefulness of this small trial.</P>
<P>We found no evidence that HBOT improves the speed of recovery from delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) following eccentric exercise designed to cause this problem. There was some indication from the analysis of pooled data from four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mekjavic-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mekjavic 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999b" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999b</LINK>) that HBOT might actually hinder recovery from muscle soreness, (e.g. at 48 hours after injury there was a statistically significant difference in pain scores between the groups of 0.88 points on a 0 to 10 scale), while there was no evidence of improvement in swelling or the return of muscle strength. These results were relatively uniform, and subgroup analysis by the site of muscle injury did not suggest a differential effect of HBOT for different muscle groups. The clinical significance of the modest differences in reported pain is unclear. There were no differences between the two groups in any of the physical measures of swelling or muscle strength. Similarly, the response to treatment when HBOT was delayed for 24 hours did not suggest important effects in the relevant groups from <LINK REF="STD-Harrison-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harrison 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Staples-1999a" TYPE="STUDY">Staples 1999a</LINK>.</P>
<P>None of these reviewed trials reported adverse effects with HBOT or control therapies, so we are unable to assess any negative impact of HBOT on the outcome of these patients other than the outcomes discussed above. HBOT is generally regarded as a relatively benign intervention. There are few major adverse effects (pulmonary barotrauma, drug reactions, injuries or death related to chamber fire). There are a number of more minor complications that may occur commonly. Visual disturbance, usually reduction in visual acuity secondary to conformational changes in the lens, is very commonly reported - perhaps as many as 50% of those having a course of 30 treatments (<LINK REF="REF-Khan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khan 2003</LINK>). While the great majority of patients recover spontaneously over a period of days to weeks, a small proportion of patients continue to require correction to restore sight to pre-treatment levels. The second most common adverse effect associated with HBOT is barotrauma. Barotrauma can affect any air-filled cavity in the body (including the middle ear, lungs and respiratory sinuses) and occurs as a direct result of compression. Aural barotrauma is by far the most common as the middle ear air space is small, largely surrounded by bone and the sensitive tympanic membrane, and usually requires active effort by the patient in order to inflate the middle ear through the eustachian tube on each side. Barotrauma is thus not a consequence of HBOT directly, but rather of the physical conditions required to administer it. Most episodes of barotrauma are mild, easily treated or recover spontaneously and do not require the therapy to be abandoned. Less commonly, HBOT may be associated with acute neurological toxicity manifesting as seizure. While there was no report of adverse effects of HBOT in any of the included trials, a careful selection of participants was evident in most.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>There was insufficient evidence from comparisons tested within randomised controlled trials to establish the effects of HBOT on ankle sprain or acute knee ligament injury, or on experimentally induced DOMS. There was some evidence that HBOT may increase pain in DOMS. Thus, the use of HBOT in these patients cannot be justified by this review. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the findings of this review, the self-limiting nature of the injury and the availability of other interventions, there is little case for further investigation of HBOT as a possible therapy for DOMS. While more information may be useful on a range of real clinical injuries, subsets of injury severity and time of presentation, any further investigations would need to be carefully justified. The effect of differing oxygen dosage and effect of other therapies administered simultaneously is not known. Any future trials would need to consider in particular:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>appropriate sample sizes with power to detect expected differences;</LI>
<LI>careful definition and selection of target patients;</LI>
<LI>appropriate range of oxygen doses per treatment session (pressure and time);</LI>
<LI>appropriate and carefully defined comparator therapy;</LI>
<LI>use of an effective sham therapy;</LI>
<LI>effective and explicit blinding of outcome assessors; </LI>
<LI>appropriate outcome measures including all those listed in this review;</LI>
<LI>careful elucidation of any adverse effects;</LI>
<LI>the cost-utility of the therapy;</LI>
