<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:14:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A minority of individuals who use amphetamines develop full-blown psychosis requiring care at emergency departments or psychiatric hospitals. In such cases, symptoms of amphetamine psychosis commonly include paranoid and persecutory delusions as well as auditory and visual hallucinations in the presence of extreme agitation. More common (about 18%) is for frequent amphetamine users to report psychotic symptoms that are sub-clinical and that do not require high-intensity intervention. Clinical reports suggest the development of amphetamine psychosis and of sub-clinical psychosis symptoms is related to the individual's lifetime history of amphetamine use, i.e., cumulative quantity and frequency of exposure to amphetamines. In one of the only randomised trials of antipsychotic medications for treating amphetamine psychosis, Leelahanaj (2005) reported that olanzapine and haloperidol delivered at clinically relevant doses both showed similar efficacy in resolving psychotic symptoms (93% and 79%, respectively), with olanzapine showing significantly greater safety and tolerability than haloperidol as measured by frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms. These outcomes are consistent with treatments for schizophrenia indicating equivalent efficacy between atypical anti-psychotics and conventional anti-psychotics, mostly haloperidol with older drugs causing more severe side effects (Leucht 1999).While anti-psychotic medications demonstrate efficacy in providing short-term relief when a heavy user of amphetamines experiences psychosis, there is no evidence to guide decisions regarding long-term clinical care using these medications for preventing relapse to psychosis.</P>

<P>The comprehensive searches found one randomised controlled trial of treatment for amphetamine psychosis meeting the criteria for considering studies. The study involved 58 participants and compared the efficacy and tolerability of two antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine (a newer antipsychotic) and haloperidol (a commonly used antipsychotic medication used as a control condition), in treating amphetamine-induced psychosis. The results show that both olanzapine and haloperidol at clinically relevant doses were efficacious in resolving psychotic symptoms, with the olanzapine condition showing significantly greater safety and tolerability than the haloperidol control as measured by frequency and severity of extrapyramidal symptoms.</P>

<P>Only one RCT of treatment for amphetamine psychosis has been published. Outcomes from this trial indicate that antipsychotic medications effectively reduce symptoms of amphetamine psychosis, the newer generation and more expensive antipsychotic medication, olanzapine, demonstrates significantly better tolerability than the more affordable and commonly used medication, haloperidol.</P>
<P>There are other two studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. The results of these two studies show that agitation and some psychotic symptoms may be abated within an hour after antipsychotic injection. </P>
<P>Whether this limited evidence can be applied for amphetamine psychotic patients is not yet known. </P>
<P>The medications that should be further investigate are conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. However, naturalistic studies of amphetamine psychotic symptoms and the prevalence of relapse to psychosis in the presence of amphetamine, are also crucial for advising the development of study designs appropriate for further treatment studies of amphetamine psychosis.</P>

</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2008-04-28 16:15:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-04-28 15:15:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>It is generally agreed that enhancing the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is of major importance in mediating amphetamines reinforcing and psychomotor stimulant effects (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 1996</LINK>). While other types of stimulants such as cocaine, which act through storage pools of catecholamines, amphetamines increase the release of newly synthesized norepinephrine and dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Ellinwood-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ellinwood 1977</LINK>). The mechanism underlying psychosis following heavy use of amphetamines is integrally linked to the neurobiology of the stimulants. The amphetamines accumulate at high levels in brain following ingestion due to highly lipophilic properties (<LINK REF="REF-Fowler-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fowler 2007</LINK>). Once ingested, users experience immediate effects that include profound feelings of euphoria and well being, sharpening of attention, and increasing levels of energy (<LINK REF="REF-Meredith-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meredith 2005</LINK>). There is a growing literature that addresses specific initial (acute) and long-term (chronic) effects to the neurobiology of amphetamine abuse. But a general understanding of the neurological bases of methamphetamine, particularly at acute, high doses is likely related to observed reductions in the number of dopamine transporters in striatum in humans (<LINK REF="REF-Volkow-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Volkow 2001</LINK>). Methamphetamine use also leads to down-regulation of D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum (<LINK REF="REF-Chang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chang 2006</LINK>) and areas in the nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate cortex (<LINK REF="REF-Paulus-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paulus 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Leland-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leland 2008</LINK>). There is some evidence that a neurobiological consequence of methamphetamine abuse involves changes in brain volume (<LINK REF="REF-Jernigan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jernigan 2005</LINK>), a finding that is consistent with volumetric increases in laboratory animals exposed to methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is toxic to 5-HT terminals in forebrain regions (<LINK REF="REF-Armstrong-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Armstrong 2004</LINK>), which also may contribute to protracted neurobiological changes, cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms commonly observed in methamphetamine abusers. The duration and magnitude of these neurobiological effects are dose dependent. Likelihood for recovery from abuse of amphetamines is also linked to severity of use, with those individuals with less severe amphetamine use disorders more likely to achieve sustained abstinence than those with more severe amphetamine use disorders.</P>
<P>It is difficult to pinpoint, exactly, the prevalence of amphetamine-induced psychosis, either locally or worldwide. Existing prevalence estimates are derived from Emergency Department records (where patients experiencing severe psychosis symptoms present) and surveys of active amphetamine users. Approximately 1.2% of 13,125 Emergency Department admissions to a Perth Australia tertiary care hospital over 3 months in 2005 involved amphetamine use (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2007</LINK>). The most common presentation involved psychiatric problems that included amphetamine-induced delirium (n=31; 19.9%) and acute psychosis (n=19; 12.2%) and of these, 25 patients (16%) had prior episodes of amphetamine-induced psychosis, which compared to 8.3% (n=13) who had known diagnoses of schizophrenia. In psychiatric facilities in Thailand, approximately 10% of admissions are attributed to methamphetamine-related psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Farrell-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farrell 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Surveys of current users of amphetamines indicate that psychotic symptoms are common and are directly associated with extent of use of the drug. In one survey of 309 actively-using individuals in Sydney Australia (<LINK REF="REF-McKetin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKetin 2006</LINK>) 13% screened positive for acute psychosis in the past year and 23% reported "clinically significant suspiciousness, unusual thought content or hallucinations, with hallucinations and suspiciousness more common than delusional thoughts." When excluding participants with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, prevalence of clinically significant psychosis symptoms was 18%. In 180 methamphetamine-using youth in Canada, similar associations were observed between reported levels of use and auditory hallucinations (<LINK REF="REF-Martin-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Martin 2006</LINK>). Thus, the epidemiology of the disorder indicates that patients with symptoms of acute psychosis due to amphetamine use present to Emergency Departments and Psychiatric Units at a low rate compared to the census of all patients and that significant psychotic symptoms are common to users with more extensive and severe amphetamine use patterns.</P>
<P>The clinical picture of those affected by amphetamine psychosis is better described in the literature. Among those who experience amphetamine psychosis symptoms, resolution usually occurs with abstinence, though the resolution may be incomplete, increasing risks for drug relapse (<LINK REF="REF-Ujike-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ujike 2004</LINK>). Psychotic symptoms due to amphetamine abuse generally resolve with medications used to treat schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Leucht-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Leucht 1999</LINK>) for those seen in emergency departments and psychiatric units, including antipsychotic or benzodiazepine medications. Similarities in clinical presentation between those with amphetamine psychosis and with schizophrenia complicate understanding the underlying mechanisms regarding amphetamine psychoses: psychotic symptoms of individuals with amphetamine psychosis may be due exclusively to heavy use of the drug or heavy use of the drug may exacerbate an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia. Empirically derived information could positively impact the ongoing health of patients who experience amphetamine psychosis, while controlled evaluation of antipsychotic medications used following resolution of psychotic symptoms has high public health significance given the potential for side effects using neuroleptic treatment.</P>
<P>Much of the study on amphetamine psychosis is based on work from Japan. In one study, onset of amphetamine psychosis was found to commence between 4 months to more than 4 years of amphetamine use (<LINK REF="REF-Sato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 1992</LINK>). A contrasting study reported onset of amphetamine psychosis after between 1.5 and 2 years of multiple daily injections each consisting of 10mg to 60mg of methamphetamine (<LINK REF="REF-Yui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yui 2002</LINK>). Clinically, acute amphetamine psychosis is virtually indistinguishable from that of acute schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-Sato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 1992</LINK>), though there are indications the two disorders may be linked genetically. Relatives of methamphetamine-users with a lifetime history of amphetamine psychosis are 5 times more likely to have schizophrenia than methamphetamine-users without a history of methamphetamine psychosis (<LINK REF="STD-Chen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2005</LINK>). Biomarkers for the two conditions are also similar. Patients with schizophrenia and with amphetamine induced psychosis show significantly increased peripheral plasma levels of norepinephrine than levels in methamphetamine users who do not have psychosis and non-methamphetamine-using controls (<LINK REF="REF-Yui-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yui 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Yui-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yui 2000</LINK>). In both conditions, patients appear for treatment with psychiatric manifestations that include hallucinations, delusions of reference and intense suspiciousness and paranoia in the setting of agitation and clear consciousness (<LINK REF="REF-Dore-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dore 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Srisurapanont-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Srisurapanont 2003</LINK>). In amphetamine psychosis, persecutory delusions are most frequent, followed by auditory and visual hallucinations. A minority of patients experience negative symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Srisurapanont-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Srisurapanont 2003</LINK>). The similarities shared by amphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia, both clinically and metabolically, raise questions of whether amphetamine psychosis is a unique presentation or if drug-induced symptoms represent an underlying vulnerability to schizophrenia. Distinguishing between these disorders is most often determined by quick resolution of symptoms in amphetamine psychosis, which is not a likely outcome of schizophrenia (<LINK REF="REF-McIver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIver 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>While the mechanisms of the two disorders may differ, the management, treatment, and treatment responses of acute amphetamine psychosis are much like that of acute schizophrenia; administration of neuroleptics produces similar responses (<LINK REF="REF-Fujii-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fujii 2002</LINK>). Patients with acute amphetamine psychosis seen in the emergency departments are typically treated with antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepine medications to reduce symptoms of psychosis, to minimize side effects and to contain behavioral agitation (<LINK REF="REF-McIver-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIver 2006</LINK>). There is a suggestion that neuroleptics may help to prevent recurrence of amphetamine psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2005</LINK>), though this implication is not based on controlled data. About 5-15% of the users who develop an amphetamine psychosis fail to recover completely (<LINK REF="REF-Hofmann-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hofmann 1983</LINK>). In one report (<LINK REF="REF-Akiyama-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akiyama 2006</LINK>) 31 of 32 methamphetamine-dependent women incarcerated in Japan and treated using antipsychotic medications experienced psychosis symptoms 5 to 31 months after their last methamphetamine injection. Of these, 9 (29%) experienced full psychosis relapses.</P>
<P>Chronic amphetamine psychosis is even more enigmatic and disturbing. In Japanese reports, about "82 percent of patients with of amphetamine psychosis recover from the paranoid psychotic state within a month after withdrawal (<LINK REF="REF-Sato-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sato 1992</LINK>)." The psychotic state recurs promptly with subsequent use, however, even a small dose, suggesting an amphetamine-induced mechanism may trigger such symptoms. Exposure to psychosocial stressors can also exacerbate the risks for relapse to amphetamine psychosis (<LINK REF="REF-Yui-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yui 2002</LINK>), in some cases without actual re-exposure to the drug.</P>
<P>No medication has been approved for the treatment of amphetamine dependence, although anti-psychotics are used commonly in the management of amphetamine psychosis. This is based on experience with schizophrenia despite little systematic study on their use in the treatment of acute amphetamine psychosis and chronic, recurrent amphetamine psychosis. There is no database to guide use of these medications, particularly relative to the time course of amphetamine psychosis, its persistence and relapse and potential for emergence of late effects, side effects, and complications to the medications. Questions relating to these issues are unsettling for clinicians due to risks for stereotypes and movement disorders. In addition, the use of ascorbic acid can accelerate the renal elimination of amphetamines (<LINK REF="REF-Beckett-1965" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beckett 1965</LINK>).</P>
<P>This systematic review relevant to the treatment of amphetamine psychosis is intended to guide those providing evidence-based medical services to patients with amphetamine-induced psychosis. Although there are a variety of amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives, the word "amphetamines" in this review stands for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine.</P>

<P>
<B>Selection of Trial</B>
<BR/>In the original review, reports identified by the electronic searches were assessed for relevance. Two reviewers (MS &amp; NJ) independently inspected all study citations identified by the electronic searches and full reports of the studies of agreed relevance were obtained. Where disputes arose the full reports were acquired for more detailed scrutiny. The reviewers (MS &amp; NJ) then independently inspected all these full study reports.<BR/>For this update of the review, one author (UK) inspected the search hits by reading titles and abstracts. Each potentially relevant study located in the search was obtained in full text and assessed for inclusion independently by two authors (SS &amp; UK). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion between the authors.<BR/>The corresponding author was contacted if information necessary for the review was not available in the reports.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality Assessment</B>
<BR/>In both the original and the updated reviews, the quality of methodology of each selected study was independently rated by the authors using the Cochrane Collaboration Reviewer's Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2006</LINK>). As above, discrepancies in ratings were resolved in discussions. The trial quality was based on the evidence of a strong relationship among the potential for bias in the results and the allocation concealment (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>) and was defined as below:<BR/>A. Low risk of bias (adequate allocation concealment),<BR/>B. Moderate risk of bias (unclear allocation concealment),<BR/>C. High risk of bias (inadequate allocation concealment), and<BR/>D. No allocation concealment used.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Collection</B>
<BR/>Data were extracted independently onto data extraction forms. Again, if the disputes arose these were resolved either by discussion between the two reviewers or the correspondence author of the paper.</P>
<P>
<B>Data Synthesis</B>
<BR/>In conducting a meta-analysis, a fixed effect model, an analysis that ignores the between-study variation, can give a narrower confidence interval than a random effect model. It is generally agreed that the fixed effect model is valid as a test of significance of the overall null hypothesis (i.e. 'no effect in all studies'). A statistically significant result obtained by the use of this model indicated that there is an effect in at least one of the studies. Because of these advantages, the fixed effect model was used for the synthesis of a group of data with homogeneity. Although a random effect model can be applied for the synthesis of a group of data with significant heterogeneity, the results obtained by the synthesis of this group of data have to be interpreted with great caution. The reviewers, therefore, decided to disregard the groups of data with significant heterogeneity.</P>
<P>As high attrition rate would affect the study results, the studies with the attrition rate of 50% or higher of the total participants will be excluded.</P>
<P>Other than raw data (e.g. death), the outcomes derived from only valid scales will be included in the reviews. In this review, a valid scale means a scale that has been published in a scientific journal.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Dichotomous data:</I>
</B> The Relative Risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used. RR is the ratio of risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. The risk (proportion, probability or rate) is the ratio of people with an event in a group to the total in the group. A relative risk of one indicates no difference between comparison groups. For undesirable outcomes an RR that is less than one indicates that the intervention was effective in reducing the risk of that outcome.</P>
<P>In addition, as a measure of efficacy, the number needed to treat (NNT) was also calculated. The reviewers extracted the dichotomous data on an intention-to-treat basis by applying the following guidelines to analyse data from included studies: (i) the analysis included all those who entered the trial; and (ii) the analysis maintained the study groups according to the original randomisation procedure. The reviewers assigned people lost to follow-up to the worst outcome.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Continuous data:</I>
</B> The Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) with 95% CI was used. WMD is a method of meta-analysis used to combine measures on continuous scales (such as weight), where the mean, standard deviation and sample size in each group are known. The weight given to each study (e.g. how much influence each study has on the overall results of the meta-analysis) is determined by the precision of its estimate of effect and, in the statistical software in RevMan and CDSR, is equal to the inverse of the variance. This method assumes that all of the trials have measured the outcome on the same scale.</P>
<P>For the studies that the treatment and/or controlled groups were divided into subgroups because of the differences of concurrent treatment, the continuous data of the subgroups receiving more rigorous treatment, e.g., higher doses of drug treatment, more intensive psychotherapy, would be extracted.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Sensitivity Analysis</I>
</B>
<BR/>Sensitivity analysis is an analysis used to determine how sensitive the results of a study or systematic review are to changes in how it was done. Sensitivity analyses are used to assess how robust the results are to uncertain decisions or assumptions about the data and the methods that were used.</P>
<P>The reviewers examined whether the decision to include the data obtained from studies in which most (50%-75%) participants were amphetamine dependents or abusers, affected the results of the review. The sensitivity analyses were done by the inclusion and exclusion of the data obtained from these studies. If both analyses point to the same conclusion in the respect of significant heterogeneity of data, the meta-analyses including the data obtained from these studies were taken into consideration. Otherwise, the meta-analyses conducted by the exclusion of the data obtained from these studies were considered.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Test for Heterogeneity</I>
</B>
<BR/>Test of heterogeneity is important to check whether the results of studies are similar within each comparison. The reviewers checked whether differences between the results of trials were greater than could be expected by chance alone. This was done by looking at the graphical display of the results but also by using Chi square tests of heterogeneity. A p-value being less than 0.05 of a Chi-square test indicated the significant heterogeneity of a data set. The statistical methods for dealing with a data set with significant and non significant heterogeneity were described in 'Data synthesis'. In addition, the possibly causes leading to the significant heterogeneity of a data set were discussed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Included studies</HEADING>
<P>One study satisfied all the criteria to be included in the review (<LINK REF="STD-Leelahanaj-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Leelahanaj 2005</LINK>). The study compared the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine and haloperidol for the treatment of amphetamine-induced psychosis. The study included 58 amphetamine psychotic participants according to DSM-IV criteria, who were randomly assigned to either receive a dose range of 5-20 mg/day for 4 weeks of olanzapine (N=29) or a dose range of 5-20 mg/day mg/day for 4 weeks of haloperidol (N=29). Ninety-three percent of the sample were men, with a mean age of 22.7 years (SD=4.8). The average duration of amphetamine use prior to randomisation was 4.5 years (SD=2.1). The study was conducted in an outpatient setting.</P>

<P>
<B>Number of people who responded to treatment</B>
</P>
<P>Treatment response was defined as having 40% or greater Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total improvement from baseline to endpoint. Twenty-seven of 29 olanzapine patients and 23 of 27 haloperidol patients responded to treatment.</P>
<P>
<B>Discontinuation rate</B>
</P>
<P>Twenty-seven of the 29 olanzapine patients and 19 of 29 haloperidol patients completed the 4-week medication period. The two olanzapine patients that discontinued were due to noncompliance and lost to follow-up whereas the 10 haloperidol patients were due to extrapyramidal side effects.</P>
<P>
<B>Average score/change in global state</B>
</P>
<P>Participants in both olanzapine and haloperidol showed significant improvements on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale from baseline to endpoint (paired t test, p&lt;0.001). Higher scores denote more severity. The average change in CGI score from baseline to endpoint was 3.3 and 3.1 for olanzapine and haloperidol, respectively. The standard deviations for this outcome could not be calculated based on the data available.</P>
<P>
<B>Average score/change in psychotic symptoms</B>
</P>
<P>Participants in both olanzapine and haloperidol showed significant improvements on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores from baseline to endpoint (paired t test, p&lt;0.001). The average change in BPRS scores from baseline to endpoint was 10.4 and 8.9 for olanzapine and haloperidol, respectively. The standard deviations for this outcome could not be calculated based on the data available.</P>
<P>
<B>Average score/change in extrapyramidal symptoms</B>
</P>
<P>Olanzapine showed no change in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) scores from baseline to endpoint (median=0.0, range 0.0). In contrast, haloperidol had a worsening effect as showed by the increased change in SAS score (median=0.2, range=0.0-3.1).</P>
<P>Olanzapine showed minimal change in Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) global scores from baseline to endpoint (median=0.0, range=-1.0-0.0), whereas haloperidol showed a worsening effect by the increased change in BAS score (median=0.0, range=-1.0-3.0).</P>
<P>Overall, olanzapine was significantly favoured over haloperidol as measured using changes in extrapyramidal symptoms, though the means and standard deviations for this outcome were not reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Patient satisfaction</B>
</P>
<P>The type and number of adverse events and or side effects experienced by participants were used as a measure of patient satisfaction. Among participants treated with olanzapine, adverse events included somnolence, headache, and skin rash. Among haloperidol treated participants, somnolence, insomnia, hypersalivation, hypertonia, dyskinesia, and extrapyramidal syndromes were reported. There was no difference in the number of adverse events experienced between these groups, except for extrapyramidal syndromes, which were reported only by haloperidol treated participants. A side effect of both olanzapine and haloperidol was weight gain, with olanzapine having significantly greater weight gain than haloperidol.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-04-28 16:15:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence about the treatment for amphetamine psychosis is very limited. To our knowledge, there has been one randomised-controlled trial of treatment for amphetamine psychosis. The results of the trial show that both olanzapine and haloperidol at clinically relevant doses can be effective in the treating patients with amphetamine-induced psychosis. The mean doses recommended for olanzapine and haloperidol are 7.5 mg/day and 7.8mg/day, respectively. The results of the study also suggest that olanzapine may be a better treatment option than haloperidol in light of an inducing few to no extrapyramidal symptoms, although the medication costs substantially more than haloperidol. The study has a small sample size (n=58), thus the findings should be interpreted with cautions.<BR/>Although they do not meet the criteria to be included in the review, the results of two other studies are worth mentioning. The results of an open study including eight amphetamine psychotic patients show that the symptoms of excitement and paranoid ideation are significantly decreased within 60 minutes of haloperidol intramuscular administration (<LINK REF="REF-Angrist-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Angrist 1974</LINK>). The results of a randomised-controlled trial in 146 acutely agitated methamphetamine users show that droperidol, a butyrophenone, can sedate the patients significantly faster than lorazepam at 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the intravenous administration (<LINK REF="STD-Richards-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Richards 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because an antipsychotic injection demonstrated its effectiveness for agitation and some psychotic symptoms occurring in amphetamine users, its risks and benefits should be further investigated in amphetamine psychotic patients. Medications that have been used for the treatment of acute exacerbation of schizophrenia should be studied in amphetamine psychotic patients. The medications that may be of interest are conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. However, naturalistic studies of amphetamine psychotic symptoms and course are also crucial for the development of study designs appropriate for further treatment studies of amphetamine psychosis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2008-04-28 16:15:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence of the treatment for amphetamine psychosis is limited. To our knowledge, one randomised controlled trial of treatment for amphetamine psychosis has been carried out. The results of this trial show that both olanzapine and haloperidol at clinically relevant doses can be effective in the treating patients with amphetamine psychosis. The mean doses evaluated for olanzapine and haloperidol were 7.5 mg/day and 7.8mg/day, respectively. It is important to note that these dosage levels are based on the outcomes of one trial. In the presence of equivalent clinical outcomes, however, the haloperidol condition experienced significantly more extrapyramidal side effects compared to olanzapine and outcomes from this trial suggest that in settings where cost is not a major concern, olanzapine may produce outcomes with fewer side effects. The small study sample in this report, however, makes it difficult to make this recommendation with confidence.</P>
<P>Although they did not meet the criteria to be included in the review, the results of two other studies in amphetamine users show that agitation and some psychotic symptoms may be abated within an hour after antipsychotic injection. Whether this limited evidence can be applied for amphetamine psychotic patients is not yet known.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Findings from one trial indicate use of antipsychotic medications effectively resolves symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Acute psychotic symptoms frequently recur when individuals relapse to use of amphetamines. In a minority of individuals, symptoms of psychosis recur in the absence of amphetamine use. This raises significant clinical questions regarding there may be clinical benefit to continued or episode regimens of antipsychotic medications following resolution of acute amphetamine psychosis. This question is particularly important in light of the ability of the medications to resolve symptoms of psychosis, but also to cause serious side effects -- especially in the less expensive, more common, older generation antipsychotic medications. While antipsychotics are commonly used to control both agitation and psychosis symptoms, it is the case that most cases of acute amphetamine psychosis resolve in the absence of amphetamine use. There would be strong significance for a controlled trial of conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines for treating acute psychosis.</P>
