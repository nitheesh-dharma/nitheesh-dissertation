<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-02-01 14:20:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Anthracyclines are among the most effective chemotherapy treatments available for various types of cancer. However, there is a risk of damage to the heart depending on the cumulative dose. In an effort to prevent heart damage different anthracycline derivates (like doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and epirubicin) are being used.</P>
<P>The authors found that for the use of many different combinations of anthracycline derivates there was no high quality evidence available and it was impossible to draw conclusions.</P>
<P>For the use of epirubicin versus doxorubicin, there was some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in anti-tumour response rate and survival between epirubicin and doxorubicin. No conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects. There are no data for children and patients with leukaemia. Further research is needed. For the use of doxorubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin, the authors found a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and subclinical heart failure (i.e. various cardiac abnormalities, diagnosed with different diagnostic methods like echocardiography in asymptomatic patients) in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin. There is no evidence which suggests a difference in anti-tumour response rate and survival between doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin. A lower rate of adverse effects was identified in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin. There are no data for children and patients with leukaemia. Further research is needed.</P>

<P>We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 29 May 2009) and EMBASE (1980 to 2 June 2009).

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2010-01-11 15:41:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We identified five RCTs of varying quality addressing epirubicin versus doxorubicin (1036 patients) with the same dose. The meta-analysis showed no evidence for a significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11). However, there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin.</P>
<P>We identified two RCTs with varying quality addressing liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin (521 patients). The meta-analysis showed a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75 and RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59 respectively). It should be noted that in one of the studies patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients in the doxorubicin group.</P>
<P>For the other possible combinations of different anthracycline derivates only one RCT (epirubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin) or no RCT was identified.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>We are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. Based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. For both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. More research is needed. For other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2010-03-31 15:42:56 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2010-01-22 08:59:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Anthracyclines are among the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and have gained widespread use in the treatment of numerous solid tumours and hematologic malignancies in both adult and paediatric patients. However, their use is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity (<LINK REF="REF-Bonadonna-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonadonna 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lefrak-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lefrak 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the time of presentation, the heart damage after anthracycline therapy can be divided into early and late cardiotoxicity: early cardiotoxicity refers to heart damage that develops during anthracycline therapy or in the first year after its completion, and late cardiotoxicity manifests itself at least one year after the completion of anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Shan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shan 1996</LINK>). The risk of developing heart failure remains a lifelong threat, especially for children and young adults who have a long life-expectancy after successful antineoplastic treatment. The risk of developing clinical heart failure 20 years after anthracycline therapy for childhood cancer is estimated to be approximately 5.5 per cent (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Dalen-2006a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Dalen 2006a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Heart damage can become manifest in patients as either subclinical cardiotoxicity or clinical cardiotoxicity. The term subclinical cardiotoxicity is used to describe various cardiac abnormalities, diagnosed with different diagnostic methods in asymptomatic patients. Examples are histological abnormalities according to the Billingham score (<LINK REF="REF-Billingham-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Billingham 1978</LINK>) or abnormalities in cardiac function measured by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. Clinical cardiotoxicity is defined on the basis of symptoms of clinical heart failure, confirmed by an abnormal diagnostic test. In the end stage of clinical heart failure, heart transplantation is the only remaining option to avoid cardiac death.</P>
<P>In the literature, there is a wide variation in the reported frequency of both clinical and subclinical cardiotoxicity; in children, the prevalence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction has been reported to be more than 57% at a median of 6.4 years after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002a</LINK>) and the incidence of clinical heart failure as high as 16% 0.9 to 4.8 years after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002b</LINK>). In adults the prevalence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction has been reported to be 36% during anthracycline therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Nousiainen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nousiainen 2002</LINK>) and the incidence of clinical heart failure 30% at a median of 37 months after treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Meinardi-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Meinardi 2002</LINK>). However, we did not perform systematic reviews on the frequency of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in adults. Possible risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Kremer-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kremer 2002b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ng-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ng 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simbre-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simbre 2005</LINK>) are the type of anthracycline used, the cumulative anthracycline dose, and the presence of additional risk factors for developing heart damage such as radiation therapy involving the heart region, type of tumour, exposure to cyclophosphamide, iphosphamide, amsacrine, trastuzumab or taxanes or the presence of pre-existing heart damage. There also seems to be a higher risk for females, children and elderly people.</P>
<P>Clinicians confront a clinical dilemma as they balance the efficacy of higher anthracycline doses against the cardiotoxicity associated with these higher doses. In an effort to prevent or reduce this toxicity, extensive research has been devoted to the identification of anthracycline derivates with less cardiotoxic effects than doxorubicin, such as daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin (<LINK REF="REF-Muggia-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muggia 1991</LINK>) and liposomal anthracyclines (<LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>An important question regarding any anthracycline derivate is whether it has a lower cardiotoxic effect without reducing the anti-tumour efficacy and without negative effects on toxicities other than cardiac damage, such as alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.</P>
<P>This is an update of the first systematic review on the cardiotoxicity of different anthracycline derivates.</P>

If possible, data were extracted by allocation intervention, irrespective of compliance with the allocated intervention, in order to allow an 'intention-to-treat' analysis. If this was not possible, this was stated. Heterogeneity was assessed both by visual inspection of the forest plots and by a formal statistical test for heterogeneity, i.e. the I<SUP>2</SUP>-test (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50% was considered substantial heterogeneity). If there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity, this was reported. We used a random effects model throughout the review. All results are presented with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). If pooling was not possible we provided descriptive results for these studies. We used the generic inverse variance function of RevMan to combine logs of the hazard ratios (HR) for progression-free survival and overall survival. Where necessary, Parmar's method was used to extract the log of the HR and its standard error (SE) (<LINK REF="REF-Parmar-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parmar 1998</LINK>). Otherwise, survival was summarised descriptively. An outcome measure was only included in this systematic review if it was the intention of the study to perform the necessary assessments in all randomised patients (i.e. not only optional or only performed in some centers). When less than 50% of the patients of a study had an acceptable follow-up for a particular outcome measure, due to associated the high risk of attrition bias, we did not report the results of this outcome measure. The risk of bias in studies included in the analyses was taken into account in the interpretation of the review's results. For all outcomes for which pooling was possible we performed sensitivity analyses for all risk of bias criteria separately. We excluded studies with a high risk of bias and studies for which the presence of bias was unclear and compared the results of studies with a low risk of bias with the results of all available studies. It was our intention to perform subgroup analyses for children and adults and for leukaemias and solid tumours, but unfortunately this was not possible (see <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> for reasons).</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2010-01-28 12:50:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>After performing the searches of the electronic databases of CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE/Ovid (2925 references: 684 identified in the update) we included a total of seven articles which fulfilled all the criteria for considering studies for this review (no new studies were identified in the update). From the currently available data of one study it is unclear if this study is eligible for inclusion in this review (identified in the update; see <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>). Fifty-two articles were excluded after assessing the full text article for reasons described in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>. The remaining 2865 articles were excluded based on the title and / or abstract since they were not a RCT, were laboratory studies, were animal studies, did not include patients with cancer, did not describe anthracycline therapy with different derivates, were duplicate publications, there was a difference in anthracycline peak dose and / or infusion duration between the treatment groups, there was a difference in chemotherapy other than anthracyclines and / or radiotherapy involving the heart region between the treatment groups, and / or did not have heart failure as an outcome measure.</P>
<P>From scanning the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews one additional article was included in this review. From the currently available data of one study it is unclear if this study is eligible for inclusion in this review (identified in the update; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of studies awaiting classification</LINK>) Ten other articles were added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>.</P>
<P>No extra information was obtained from scanning the conference proceedings of SIOP and ASCO, although two additional studies were excluded and thus added to the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK> (one identified in the update). Also, from the currently available data of one study it is unclear if this study is eligible for inclusion in this review (identified in the update; see <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>).</P>
<P>Searching the ongoing trial databases identified nine studies, of which one was eligible for this review (identified in the update; see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>). From five other trials (three identified in the update) we were not able to obtain all the information necessary to assess the eligibility of these trials (see <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK>). After obtaining additional information it became clear that the other three studies were not eligible for inclusion in the review (all identified in the update; see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, the total number of identified RCTs was eight. Five studies addressed doxorubicin versus epirubicin, two studies addressed conventional doxorubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (myocet) and one study addressed epirubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (myocet). For the other combinations of different anthracycline derivates no adequate RCTs were identified.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Description of studies addressing doxorubicin versus epirubicin</HEADING>
<P>Our analysis of the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin when compared with that of epirubicin included five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>) with a total of 1036 patients. Five-hundred-and-fifteen patients were randomised to treatment with doxorubicin, whereas 521 patients were randomised to treatment with epirubicin. There were no important differences in cumulative anthracycline doses received in both treatment arms of the different RCTs. All studies included adult patients with a solid tumour. In four studies patients were diagnosed with breast cancer (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>), and in the other study with soft tissue sarcoma (<LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>). In 2 studies the follow-up of the included patients was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>) and in one study this was possible for at least part of the included patients (<LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>). Therefore it is possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In the other studies the length of follow-up was not mentioned and as a result we don't know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in these studies are early or late. However, based on the fact that all patients included in these trials had advanced or metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that cases of heart failure in these trials were early cardiotoxicity.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Description of studies addressing conventional doxorubicin versus liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin</HEADING>
<P>Our analysis of the cardiotoxicity of conventional doxorubicin when compared with that of liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin included two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2002</LINK>) with a total of 521 patients. Two-hundred-and-seventy-one patients were randomised to treatment with doxorubicin, whereas 250 patients were randomised to treatment with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin. Both studies mentioned the cumulative anthracycline dose patients in the treatment groups received: in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK> patients in both treatment groups received a median cumulative dose of 360 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>, whereas in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2002</LINK> patients in the doxorubicin group received a median cumulative dose of 570 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP> and patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a cumulative dose of 785 mg/m<SUP>2</SUP>. Both studies included adult patients with breast cancer. In one study the follow-up of the included patients was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK>) and therefore it is possible that this study included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In the other study the length of follow-up was not mentioned and as a result we don't know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in this study are early or late. However, based on the fact that all patients included in this trial had metastatic disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that cases of heart failure in this trial were early cardiotoxicity.</P>

<P>Our analysis of the cardiotoxicity of epirubicin when compared with that of liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin included one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Chan-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Chan 2004</LINK>) with a total of 160 patients. Eighty patients were randomised to treatment with epirubicin, whereas 80 patients were randomised to treatment with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin.

<P>In all five studies the allocation of patients to the treatment groups was randomised, but none of the studies did specify the presence of a concealed treatment allocation (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>It was unclear if the care provider and patients were blinded to treatment in all five studies.</P>
<P>For blinding of the outcome assessor we scored each different outcome, with the exception of overall survival, since for that outcome blinding was not relevant.

<P>Patients lost to follow-up were also scored for each different outcome. For clinical heart failure the number of patients lost to follow-up was described and acceptable (i.e. less than 20%) in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>), in one study it was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>) and in one study it was unacceptable (<LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>). For subclinical heart failure (both as a dichotomous and continuous outcome) the number of patients lost to follow-up was unacceptable in the one study describing this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>).

<P>We could collect data on clinical heart failure from five trials with a total of 1036 adult patients with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>). There were three cases of clinical heart failure among 521 patients randomised to epirubicin and 12 cases among 515 patients randomised to doxorubicin. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in the treatment groups (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11, P = 0.07). However, there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin. No heterogeneity was detected (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%).</P>
<P>In two studies the follow-up of the included patients was more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-FESG-1988" TYPE="STUDY">FESG 1988</LINK>) and in one study it was possible that part of the included patients had a follow-up of more than one year (<LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>), therefore it is possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In the other studies the length of follow-up was not mentioned (<LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>) and as a result we don't know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in these studies are early or late. However, based on the fact that all patients included in these trials had metastatic or advanced disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that cases of heart failure in these trials were early cardiotoxicity.</P>

<P>Data on clinical and subclinical heart failure combined could be extracted from one trial including adult patients with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK>). However, due to the high risk of attrition bias (less than 50% of the patients had an acceptable follow-up), results of this study are not reported.</P>

These trials used comparable criteria to assess tumour response (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). There were 210 complete or partial responses among 521 patients randomised to epirubicin and 221 among 515 patients randomised to doxorubicin. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the response rate between the treatment groups (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08, P = 0.40). No heterogeneity was detected (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 0%). Only one study mentioned that the response rate was determined by at least two observers (<LINK REF="STD-Mouridsen-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Mouridsen 1984</LINK>).</P>
<P>Please note that due to the nature of this measurement (i.e. the percentage of patients with a remission) a high event rate is favourable.

<P>We excluded the study of <LINK REF="STD-Brambilla-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Brambilla 1986</LINK> from this analysis due to the high risk of attrition bias (less than 50% of the patients had an acceptable follow-up).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>Since all patients receiving chemotherapy will suffer from side effects, we decided to analyse only the severe and life threatening effects. We defined this as grade 3 or 4 toxicity. All studies used the WHO criteria (<LINK REF="REF-Miller-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Miller 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-Handbook-1979" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO Handbook 1979</LINK>). Therefore, it was possible to perform meta-analyses for adverse effects for which more than 1 RCT was available. For adverse effects for which 1 RCT was available, we provide descriptive results (all the mentioned RR, 95%CI and P-values are calculated in RevMan with the random effects model).</P>

<P>Data on anaemia could be extracted from two trials with a total of 546 adult patients with a solid tumour (<LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>). However, in one study there were no cases of anaemia in both treatment groups and therefore, the not significantly different results of this study were not estimable for analysis of the RR (<LINK REF="STD-Gasparini-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gasparini 1991</LINK>). As a result, pooling of results was not possible. In the other study (<LINK REF="STD-IMBSWE-1988" TYPE="STUDY">IMBSWE 1988</LINK>), there was one case of anaemia grade 3 or 4 among 250 patients randomised to epirubicin and nine among 247 patients randomised to doxorubicin.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2010-02-01 14:15:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Gail Quinn">
<P>Heart damage due to anthracycline chemotherapy is a considerable and serious problem. It reduces QOL and can even cause premature death. Also, when heart damage occurs during therapy the maximum cumulative dose of anthracyclines needs to be limited and as a result the efficacy of anthracycline chemotherapy will be reduced. This is an update of the first systematic review evaluating the existing evidence on different anthracycline derivates for reducing cardiotoxicity. Only RCTs were included since it is widely recognized that a RCT is the only study design which can be used to obtain unbiased evidence on the use of anthracycline derivates, provided that the design and execution are adequate.</P>
<P>We could identify RCTs for three combinations of different anthracycline derivates, i.e. epirubicin versus doxorubicin, liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (myocet) versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (myocet) versus epirubicin. For the other 25 combinations of different anthracycline derivates (see search strategy) no adequate RCTs could be identified.</P>
<P>For <B>epirubicin versus doxorubicin</B> five trials were identified.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis of five trials showed no evidence for a significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure between the treatment groups (RR=0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.11, P = 0.07). However, based on the low value of the RR and the wide 95% CI there is some suggestion of a lower rate of clinical heart failure in patients treated with epirubicin as compared to patients treated with doxorubicin. The reason that this difference is not statistically significant could be a result of a low power of the included studies. No results are available on the occurrence of clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with either epirubicin or doxorubicin, since none of the included studies adequately evaluated subclinical heart failure.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis of tumour response showed no significant difference in response rate between the treatment groups (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08, P=0.40). The same was true for our meta-analyses of both progression-free and overall survival (HR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.44; P = 0.78 and HR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.39; P = 0.79 respectively). However, please note that in the meta-analysis of progression-free survival substantial heterogeneity was detected. Individual studies not included in the meta-analysis also showed no significant differences in survival between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>For three evaluated adverse effects it was possible to perform a meta-analysis. A significantly lower rate of leukopenia and nausea/vomiting was identified in patients treated with epirubicin as compared to patients treated with doxorubicin. No significant difference in the occurrence of alopecia between the treatment groups was identified; please note that for this outcome substantial heterogeneity was present. For the other evaluated adverse effects pooling of results was not possible. As a result, this review does not allow for any definitive conclusions regarding those adverse effects in patients treated with either epirubicin or doxorubicin. However, for thrombocytopenia, infection, stomatitis/mucositis, thrombophlebitis, and hepatic or renal dysfunction related to drug administration, results were consistent among the individual studies evaluating the outcome (either one or two studies). None of the studies identified a significant difference in the occurrence of the evaluated adverse effects between the treatment groups. For anaemia the results were not consistent among the individual studies evaluating the outcome. The reason that some studies did not identify a significant difference between the treatment groups could be due to the fact that the number of patients included in these studies were too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (i.e. low power).</P>
<P>The cumulative anthracycline dose received in both treatment groups was comparable. Therefore, the results of the different outcomes are direct comparisons of equimolar doses of epirubicin and doxorubicin. No conclusions can be made regarding treatment with epirubicin and doxorubicin with different cumulative doses.</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the included studies varied; in many studies bias could not be ruled out due to a lack of reporting. However, at the moment this is the best available evidence of RCTs evaluating epirubicin and doxorubicin.</P>
<P>For <B>liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin</B> two trials were identified.</P>
<P>Our meta-analysis of the two trials showed a significantly lower rate of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin as compared to patients treated with doxorubicin (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75, P = 0.02 and RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59, P &lt; 0.0001 respectively).</P>
<P>However, an important question regarding any cardioprotective intervention during anthracycline therapy is whether the intervention could selectively decrease the heart damage without reducing the anti-tumour efficacy (i.e. tumour response and patient survival) and without negative effects on toxicities other than cardiac damage. Our meta-analysis of two trials for response rate showed no significant difference between the treatment groups (RR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.26, P = 0.95). The same was true for our meta-analyses of both progression-free and overall survival (HR=1.01, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.24, P=0.89 and HR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.53, P = 0.46 respectively). However, it should be noted that in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2002</LINK> there was a non-significant trend toward a shorter overall survival in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin (P = 0.09). The authors state that although this finding cannot be ignored, it seems unlikely, given the other efficacy parameters, that this is a consequence of reduced efficacy of liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin compared with conventional doxorubicin. It is possible that the excess of progesterone receptor positivity in the conventional doxorubicin arm may denote a better prognostic group. Other unmeasured prognostic factors (e.g. HER-2 expression) also may have played a role in the natural history of the disease. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK> there were no significant differences in progesterone receptor positivity between the treatment groups.</P>
<P>For all adverse effects it was possible to perform a meta-analysis. For neutropenia, nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea a significantly lower rate of the adverse effect was observed in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin as compared to patients treated with doxorubicin. For anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever, stomatitis/mucositis, asthenia/fatigue, cutaneous toxicity and infection no significant differences between the treatment groups were identified. Please note, that there was heterogeneity present in the analysis of infection.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that the cumulative anthracycline dose received in both treatment groups was the same in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Batist-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Batist 2001</LINK>, whereas in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Harris-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Harris 2002</LINK> patients in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients in the doxorubicin group. So despite a higher cumulative anthracycline dose received in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group, there was still a lower rate of both heart failure and adverse effects in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group as compared to the doxorubicin group. However, no significant differences in both tumour response and survival were identified between both treatment groups, whereas it might be expected that those outcomes would improve with a higher cumulative anthracycline dose. As a result, we are not able to provide definitive conclusions on tumour response and survival.</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the included studies varied; in many studies bias could not be ruled out due to a lack of reporting. However, at the moment this is the best available evidence of RCTs evaluating liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin and doxorubicin.</P>
<P>For <B>liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus epirubicin</B> one trial was identified. Pooling of results was therefore not possible, and as a result this review does not allow for any definitive conclusions regarding the effects of treatment with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin or epirubicin. No significant difference in the occurrence of both clinical heart failure and clinical and subclinical heart failure combined was identified. The same was true for response rate and overall survival, whereas progression-free survival was significantly better in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin as compared to patients treated with doxorubicin. We cannot explain this difference.</P>
<P>This review does not allow for any definitive conclusions regarding adverse effects in patients treated with either epirubicin or liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin. However, only for neutropenia a significant difference in favour of epirubicin was identified. For all other evaluated adverse effects no significant difference between the treatment groups was found.</P>
<P>The reason that in this study for most evaluated outcomes no significant difference between the treatment groups was identified could be due to the fact that the number of patients included in this study was too small to detect a difference between the treatment groups (i.e. low power).</P>
<P>The cumulative anthracycline dose received in both treatment groups was comparable. Therefore, the results of the different outcomes are direct comparisons of equimolar doses of liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin and epirubicin. No conclusions can be made regarding treatment with epirubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin with different cumulative doses.</P>
<P>The risk of bias in the included trial was unclear due to a lack of reporting, only the presence of attrition bias was ruled out. However, at the moment this is the best available evidence of RCTs evaluating epirubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin.</P>
<P>Regarding early and late cardiotoxicity, we must conclude the following for all 3 comparisons. In some studies the follow-up of (at least part of) the included patients was more than 1 year, therefore it is possible that these studies included cases of both early and late cardiotoxicity. In the other studies the length of follow-up was not mentioned and as a result we don't know if the cases of cardiotoxicity in these studies are early or late. However, based on the fact that all patients included in these trials had metastatic or advanced disease and the associated effect on survival duration, we presume that cases of heart failure in these trials were early cardiotoxicity.</P>
<P>For all three comparisons of different anthracycline derivates it should be emphasised that all included patients were adults with a solid tumour, mainly breast cancer. As a result no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment with epirubicin and doxorubicin in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia.</P>
<P>It should be kept in mind that the inclusion of studies for this systematic review was limited to RCTs describing cardiotoxicity, and as a result, the analyses of response rate, survival, adverse effects and QOL were possibly based on only a subgroup of trials comparing different anthracycline derivates.</P>
<P>We are awaiting the results of the currently ongoing study evaluating liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin in adults with B-cell lymphoma (see <LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK> table). We are also awaiting (additional) results of the eight trials currently awaiting assessment (see <LINK TAG="AWAITING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Studies awaiting classification</LINK> table): epirubicin versus doxocrubicin (n=3; all in patients with breast cancer), liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin (n = 2; one study in adults with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and one in adults with lymphoma), liposomal-encapsulated doxocrubicin versus epirubicin (n = 2; all in patients with breast cancer) and liposomal-encapsulated doxocrubicin versus liposomal daunorubicin (n=1; patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma). From the currently available data it is unclear if these studies are eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epirubicin versus doxorubicin</HEADING>
<P>Based on the current available evidence, we are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given in equimolar doses. No conclusions can be made regarding treatment with epirubicin and doxorubicin with different cumulative doses.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that all patients included in these studies were adults with advanced solid tumours.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin</HEADING>
<P>Based on our meta-analysis which clearly shows that treatment with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin reduces the risk of both clinical and subclinical heart failure as compared to treatment with doxorubicin despite the fact that patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose than patients treated with doxorubicin, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. However, until more evidence becomes available on tumour response and survival in patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin or doxorubicin in equimolar doses, we recommend the use of a higher cumulative liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin dose as compared to the standard cumulative doxorubicin dose. Despite the higher cumulative anthracycline dose received in the liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin group, patients treated with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin suffered from less side effects than patients treated with doxorubicin.</P>
<P>It should be emphasised that all patients included in these studies were adults with advanced breast cancer. As a result no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment with liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin and doxorubicin in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia.</P>
