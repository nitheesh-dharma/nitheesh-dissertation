<P>Neuralgic amyotrophy is a painful disorder of the peripheral nervous system that occurs in episodes. It affects the arms and shoulders, and leads to muscle wasting and weakness. There has been anecdotal evidence that corticosteroids can have a favourable effect on pain and recovery. No randomised clinical trial could be found in either the original 2009 review or when searches were updated in 2011 to validate the effects of this type of treatment, or any treatment. One randomised controlled trial comparing prednisolone to placebo is currently awaiting formal reporting.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-09-29 09:52:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Neuralgic amyotrophy (also know as Parsonage-Turner syndrome or brachial plexus neuritis) is a distinct peripheral nervous system disorder characterised by episodes (attacks) of extreme neuropathic pain and rapid multifocal weakness and atrophy in the upper limbs. Neuralgic amyotrophy has both an idiopathic and hereditary form, with similar clinical symptoms but generally an earlier age of onset and more episodes in the hereditary form. The current hypothesis is that neuralgic amyotrophy is caused by an underlying genetic predisposition and a susceptibility to mechanical injury of the brachial plexus, and that the episodes are then caused by an immune-mediated response to the brachial plexus. Hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy is genetically heterogeneous and is associated with a point mutation or duplication of the SEPT9 gene on chromosome 17q25 in 55% of the families. In the idiopathic form an underlying but as yet unknown genetic predisposition is also assumed.</P>
<P>Recovery is slow, in months to years, and many patients are left with residual pain and decreased exercise tolerance in the affected limb(s). Anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids may relieve pain or help improve functional recovery. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-01-27 15:07:32 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-09-29 09:52:37 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (17 May 2011), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library </I>2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to May 2011), and LILACS (January 1982 to May 2011) for randomised controlled trials of treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy.</P>

<P>No randomised or quasi-randomised trials were identified in either the original review or for the update. In 32 articles anecdotal evidence was found on treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy. Only three of these articles contained more than 10 treated cases, with one providing sufficient details to calculate the primary and secondary outcome measures for this review.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-08-03 16:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>There is no evidence from randomised trials to support any form of treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy. Evidence from one open-label retrospective series suggests that oral prednisone given in the first month after onset can shorten the duration of the initial pain and leads to earlier recovery in some patients. Randomised clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids or other immune-modulating therapies.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">The condition</HEADING>
<P>Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), also called brachial neuritis or Parsonage-Turner syndrome, is a distinct clinical entity (<LINK REF="REF-van-Alfen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Alfen 2011</LINK>)). Core features are episodes ('attacks') of extreme neuropathic pain and a rapid multifocal weakness and atrophy in the upper limb at onset, with slow recovery in months to years. It has both an idiopathic (INA) and autosomal dominant hereditary form (HNA). In this review, the terms HNA and INA refer to specific aspects of either form, while the term NA refers to common characteristics and the disorder as a whole. HNA is genetically heterogenous and has been found to be associated with a point mutation or duplication in the SEPT9 gene on chromosome 17q25 in about 55% of the families affected (<LINK REF="REF-Collie-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collie 2010</LINK>). Rarely, a similar clinical phenotype has been described in patients with a point mutation in the PMP22 gene (<LINK REF="REF-Russo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Russo 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinically, INA and HNA are very similar disorders with only a few established differences (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>). On a group level HNA patients are usually younger when they suffer their first attack and have more frequent involvement of nerves outside the brachial plexus, a more severe paresis and a less favourable overall outcome. Otherwise the initial pain, possible course and distribution of symptoms within the brachial plexus, recovery, complications such as shoulder joint pathology and response to treatment are the same. For this reason, and because HNA is rare and it is unlikely that significant trials will become available for this group alone, both forms of the disorder will be included in this review but considered separately.<BR/>
<BR/>The current hypothesis is that NA is caused by an underlying predisposition and a susceptibility to mechanical injury of the brachial plexus; the episodes are then caused by an immune-mediated response to the brachial plexus (<LINK REF="REF-van-Alfen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Alfen 2011</LINK>). In HNA the underlying predisposition is genetic, while in INA this is plausible but still uncertain as no causative mutations have been found in the idiopathic form of the disorder yet. In all, NA can best be defined as a disorder with a complex pathophysiological mechanism in which autoimmune, genetic and external factors all seem to play an interwoven role.</P>
<P>Anecdotal observations suggest that early treatment with corticosteroids might abort the attack, relieve pain or positively influence the course and outcome (see, for example, <LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>), but there has been no systematic review of this or other treatments such as analgesics or paramedical interventions. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The minimum incidence of idiopathic NA is estimated at two to four per 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Beghi-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beghi 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacDonald-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacDonald 2000</LINK>). The HNA form is thought to be about 10 times rarer. Neuralgic amyotrophy is more common in men (68%). The median age of onset of INA is in the early fourth decade (range: neonatal to seventh decade) and for HNA in the second decade.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Clinical relevance of the treatment and rationale for review</HEADING>
<P>Neuralgic amyotrophy often goes unrecognised by physicians, with an average delay of three to nine months before the diagnosis is made. The initial pain lasts four weeks on average and is very difficult to control with conventional analgesics. The prognosis is not as optimistic as previously assumed, with persistent pain and paresis affecting half to two-thirds of the patients (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2009</LINK>). With an estimated incidence of 3 per 100,000 per year, there are a minimum of about 500 cases in the Netherlands and 7000 cases each year in the USA. On the assumption of a loss of about USD 100 per day (240 days a year) for a sick employee and about 25% of the patients still being unable to return to work after three years, NA would cost society in the Netherlands EUR 2.5 million per year and in the USA (with around 150,000,000 employees) USD 42 million each year just for lost productivity. Healthcare costs have not been included in this estimate.</P>
<P>Corticosteroids have occasionally been used for NA but there has been no systematic review of these or of any other pharmacological or paramedical treatment. A systematic review of the evidence would be a valuable guide to clinical practice and designing trials of treatment. If treatment were found to be beneficial, such a review would be a much needed incentive to convince the medical community that early identification of patients is essential for optimal care and prevention of long-term sequelae. Such a review might also provide an indication of the existence of subgroups that are either more or less likely to benefit from treatment. A systematic review might provide important clues concerning the most appropriate drugs to try and the optimal schedules and routes of dosing.</P>

<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:10:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>We aimed to include all participants who had been diagnosed as having INA or HNA and to accept the authors' diagnosis provided that it corresponded to the spirit of the preferred diagnostic criteria as put forward in a 1999 European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) workshop report (<LINK REF="REF-Kuhlenbaumer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhlenbaumer 2000</LINK>), described in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>, with addition of known variations of the phenotype (<LINK REF="REF-van-Alfen-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Alfen 2011</LINK>). We would have included people with both the idiopathic and hereditary variant but considered them separately. We would have compared outcome measures only with other people of the same neuralgic amyotrophy subtype after any intervention. Although nerves outside the brachial plexus are affected in 56% of HNA patients and 17% of INA patients (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>), we only accepted case descriptions when brachial plexus involvement had been documented. We did not include reports on isolated individual nerve lesions or solely lumbosacral plexus involvement, with the exception of the long thoracic nerve as idiopathic long thoracic neuropathy is an accepted part of the NA spectrum.</P>

<P>Two review authors (NvA, RH) identified all those studies which were potentially relevant from all the titles and abstracts of the articles retrieved by the search. There were no disagreements.

</STUDY_SELECTION>
<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:20:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>The review authors prepared a data extraction form which included the type of study; the quality criteria, described below; number, age and sex of participants; diagnostic criteria; type of intervention used including dosage, duration and administration route details for drugs and therapeutic schemes for paramedical interventions; outcome measures and results.</P>
<P>Two review authors independently extracted the data onto the data extraction sheet from the selected studies, assessed their methodological quality and decided whether they should be included in the review, and in any meta-analysis arising in the course of the review. There were no disagreements. One review author entered data into the Review Manager (RevMan) computer package and a second author checked the data entry.</P>
</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:24:10 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>No trials were identified but in future updates of the review we will assess risk of bias according to the methods promulgated in Chapter 8 of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). We will separately assess sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, those administering treatment and assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; other sources of bias and overall risk of bias as high, low or unclear.</P>
<P>In addition, we will consider whether important differences in demographic or other factors between the intervention groups at baseline were either absent or adequately taken into account in the analysis. If the analysis does not take account of such differences, we will consider those differences which are not significant at the five per cent level as adequate, and those which are significant at this level as having a high risk of bias.</P>
<P>In the absence of adequate randomised trials concerning a particular intervention we considered observational studies in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>. No search strategy exists to reliably identify all such studies but we aimed, at a minimum, to identify from MEDLINE and EMBASE all studies which included consecutive cohorts of at least 10 participants and in whom the number of people treated was described with the results of follow-up for at least 12 weeks in 80% or more of the participants.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:26:05 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>Where more than one study had addressed the same comparisons, we would have used the Cochrane RevMan statistical package to undertake meta-analyses.

If the results from the different studies were homogeneous, we planned to use a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. If they were heterogeneous, we planned to use a random-effects model and to inspect the forest plots and trial characteristics to identify the reasons for the heterogeneity. We planned to perform sensitivity analyses by omitting trials with lower methodological quality to discover whether our conclusions from all the trials were robust, had there been sufficient trials addressing the same intervention. We would have created and inspected a funnel plot to seek evidence of publication bias.</P>
<P>As randomised trials are often short term, they may not adequately capture information about side effects of drugs. To overcome this, we would have considered non-randomised evidence about side effects in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>, using as a minimum the non-systematic review "Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs" (<LINK REF="REF-Dukes-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dukes 2000</LINK>). Finally, we also planned to address in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK> costs and cost effectiveness, also taking into account the non-randomised literature.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:34:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Ruth Brassington">
<P>No randomised controlled study on any treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy was found. From 32 articles we found anecdotal evidence on treatment for neuralgic amyotrophy. Only three observational studies contained more than 10 cases with treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Tsairis-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Tsairis 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Eijk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Eijk 2009</LINK>). Neither of the first two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Tsairis-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Tsairis 1972</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>) contained sufficient details to calculate the primary or secondary outcome measures of this review. In a consecutive case series of 99 patients (70 males, age range 3 months to 74 years), Tsairis et al mention 15 patients treated with corticosteroids (10 oral prednisolone, 5 intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)), 15 patients treated with cortisone injections into the shoulder, and 22 patients receiving physical therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Tsairis-1972" TYPE="STUDY">Tsairis 1972</LINK>). Steroids were prescribed "in moderate doses early in the course of their illness" and physical therapy was given "for prolonged periods", but further treatment details are not given. The authors report that there was no evidence that early systemic corticosteroid treatment altered the course of the disease, although a few patients reported relief of pain. Additionally 8 of the 15 patients injected in the shoulder reported pain relief. Physical therapy did not seem to speed up recovery. The study by van Alfen et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>) describes 41 patients treated with corticosteroids in a case series of 246 patients; clinical details are given for 29 patients (16 male). The median time to start of treatment was 13 days. In 18 patients the same dosage regimen of a two-week course of oral prednisolone, 60 mg daily in the first week and tapering to 10 mg per day in the second week, was used; in the other patients the dose and duration varied. Four out of 20 patients (25%) subjectively felt treatment had had a positive influence on their symptoms. The median time to a decrease in pain was five days compared to 20 days in the untreated group. In 8% (3/37) of treated patients a full recovery was documented within one month from onset, compared to 5% (11/203) in the untreated group. After a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, only the time to start of the recovery from paresis was statistically significantly shorter in treated patients. Side effects were reported by 31% (8/26) of the patients, and four patients had stopped corticosteroid therapy because of them. There were no other reports with sufficient information on side effects. The third study by van Eijk and co-workers (<LINK REF="STD-van-Eijk-2009" TYPE="STUDY">van Eijk 2009</LINK>) did contain information on several of the secondary outcome measures of this review. It reports a retrospective analysis of 50 patients (24% HNA) treated with oral prednisone within one month from onset compared to a historical cohort of 203 untreated patients (19.2% HNA). Clinical details of 16 patients were also described earlier, but less extensively, in the study by van Alfen et al (<LINK REF="STD-van-Alfen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">van Alfen 2006</LINK>). A shorter median time to pain relief was found in the treated group (12.5 days) compared to the untreated patients (20.5 days), and more patients recovered strength in the first month (18% versus 6.3%) in the treated group. After one year, full recovery was found in 12% of the treated patients and in only 1% of the controls, while good (but not complete) recovery was also more frequent in the treated group (44% versus 10.7%). Side effects of oral prednisone were found in 20% of the patients but did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. It was concluded that oral prednisone seems effective when initiated in the acute phase of neuralgic amyotrophy.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-04-22 10:54:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Kate Jewitt">
<P>No studies were found that could provide evidence for a particular form of treatment in neuralgic amyotrophy. Anecdotal evidence and a single unblinded, uncontrolled retrospective case series show some evidence to suggest that early corticosteroid therapy may have a positive influence on pain in some patients, and possibly speed up recovery in a few.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-29 10:35:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a need for randomised controlled treatment trials that evaluate the effect of immune-modulating and rehabilitation therapy for neuralgic amyotrophy. The results of a randomised controlled trial on the effect of oral prednisolone are awaited.</P>

<P>1. Clinical criteria<BR/>
<BR/>Family history<BR/>I. Autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance (&gt; 90%)<BR/>C. Isolated cases may be due to de novo mutations<BR/>
<BR/>Age at onset<BR/>I. Most commonly in the second or third decade of life<BR/>C. Earlier or later onset is possible<BR/>
<BR/>Clinical manifestations<BR/>I. Acute, recurrent uni- or bilateral brachial plexopathy<BR/>I. Severe pain precedes the onset of weakness by days to few weeks<BR/>I. Deficits are predominantly motor<BR/>I. Number of episodes may vary from one to many (up to 20)<BR/>
<BR/>C. Lumbar plexus may be affected<BR/>C. Cranial nerves may be affected (most commonly: facial nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve)<BR/>C. Phrenic nerve may be affected<BR/>C. Dysmorphic features may be present (most commonly: hypotelorism, epicanthal folds)<BR/>C. Abortive attacks may present with pain not followed by weakness<BR/>C. Intervals between attacks can be very long (up to many years)<BR/>
<BR/>E. Absence of pain before or during attacks (absence of pain has never been reported in the first attack but may very rarely occur in one of the following attacks)<BR/>
<BR/>Clinical examination<BR/>C. Motor symptoms are prominent compared to sensory loss<BR/>C. Sensory abnormalities may be present<BR/>C. Autonomic symptoms may be present (abnormal sweating in affected arm, Horner's syndrome)<BR/>C. Tendon reflexes are diminished or absent in affected limbs<BR/>C. Muscle weakness and atrophy may be noted in previously affected limbs<BR/>C. Hypotelorism, epicanthal folds, short stature may co-segregate<BR/>
<BR/>E. Signs of a generalized neuropathy<BR/>
<BR/>Course and severity<BR/>I. Relapsing/remitting course with symptom-free intervals<BR/>I. Complete recovery without any residual deficit between attacks<BR/>I. Recovery occurs within month to 2 years<BR/>C. Recovery is in many cases incomplete and residual neurologic deficit persists especially after repeated attacks affecting the same limb<BR/>C. Chronic undulating course without completely symptom-free intervals (especially pain)<BR/>
<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>2. Electrophysiological criteria<BR/>
<BR/>I. EMG shows signs of denervation or reinnervation in muscles innervated by affected nerves<BR/>C. Slightly reduced distal nerve conduction velocities in the affected nerves<BR/>C. Reduced amplitude of compound muscle action potential in affected nerves<BR/>C. Reduced amplitudes of sensory nerve action potentials in affected nerves<BR/>
<BR/>E. Electrophysiological signs of generalized neuropathy<BR/>
</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<P>3. Molecular genetics<BR/>
<BR/>I. Linkage to the HNA locus on chromosome 17q25<BR/>C. Absence of linkage to the HNA locus on chromosome 17q25<BR/>
<BR/>E. Presence of the HNPP deletion on chromosome 17p11.2<BR/>E. Presence of mutations in the PMP22 gene<BR/>
