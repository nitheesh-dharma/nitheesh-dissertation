<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-14 11:10:59 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Bladder and kidney infections (urinary tract infections - UTI) can cause vomiting, pain, dysuria, septicaemia, fever and tiredness, and occasionally kidney damage. Some people are at high risk of repeated UTIs, and they are also more likely to have serious complications (including people with kidney problems, or people who have catheters to release urine). Long-term use of antibiotics can lead to resistance, so methenamine salts (methenamine or hexamine hippurate) are often used. This review identified 13 studies (2032 participants). Methenamine hippurate may be effective in preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities particularly when used for short term prophylaxis. It does not appear to be effective for long term prophylaxis in patients who have neuropathic bladder. There were few adverse effects.Additional well controlled randomised controlled trials are necessary in particular to clarify effectiveness for longer term prophylaxis in those without neuropathic bladder.</P>

<P>Methenamine salts are often used as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI). This review was first published in Issue 1, 2002 and updated in Issue 4, 2007.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>

<P>To assess the benefits and harms of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTI. </P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2012-06-07 17:05:56 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library)</I>, MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Manufacturers' of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies and contact was made with known investigators.</P>
<P>Date of last search: June 2012</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-10-14 11:10:39 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome measures were not interpretable because of underlying heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses suggested that methenamine hippurate may have some benefit in patients without renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89; bacteriuria: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83), but not in patients with known renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 6.20; bacteriuria: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.07). For short-term treatment duration (1 week or less) there was a significant reduction in symptomatic UTI in those without renal tract abnormalities (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38). The rate of adverse events was low.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. It does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. The rate of adverse events was low, but poorly described.</P>
<P>There is a need for further large well-conducted RCTs to clarify this question, particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2012-06-07 14:01:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2012-03-14 11:10:41 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Patients at greater risk of UTI include women, those undergoing genito-urinary procedures, those with abnormal renal tract anatomy or physiology, those with foreign bodies (such as catheters), the immunocompromised, or those with a neuropathic bladder (<LINK REF="REF-Macfarlane-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macfarlane 1985</LINK>). One such high risk group is the spinal injured population (with associated neuropathic bladder), where the incidence is estimated at 1.82 UTI episodes/patient/year (<LINK REF="REF-Waites-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waites 1993</LINK>). In these high-risk patients, problems can result from antibiotic resistance and other complications such as autonomic dysreflexia, vesicoureteric reflux, related pyelonephritis, septicaemia, the need for a change in the method of bladder management, or recatheterisation. The end result is that highly susceptible populations often require hospitalisation for what in the general community would be an easily treated condition.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2012-03-14 11:10:16 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Methenamine salts are often used in the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI). They are frequently used for prolonged periods because, unlike conventional antibiotics, acquired resistance does not appear to develop (<LINK REF="REF-Parfitt-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parfitt 1999</LINK>). Given the problems of increasing antibiotic resistance, methenamine salts may be especially useful in populations susceptible to recurrent UTI.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2012-03-14 11:10:30 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Methenamine salts act via the production of formaldehyde from hexamine, which in turn acts as a bacteriostatic agent (<LINK REF="REF-Mayrer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayrer 1982</LINK>). It is uncertain whether urinary acidification and the direct bacteriostatic effect of hippuric acid contribute significantly to its action (<LINK REF="REF-Nahata-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahata 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wall-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wall 1990</LINK>). Methenamine salts are well tolerated and adverse effects, including minor gastrointestinal upsets, dysuria, abdominal cramps, anorexia, rash and stomatitis (<LINK REF="REF-_x0033_M-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">3M 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McEvoy-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">McEvoy 1999</LINK>), are generally mild (<LINK REF="REF-Mayrer-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mayrer 1982</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2012-06-07 14:01:08 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>It remains highly controversial whether methenamine salts are effective in preventing UTI (<LINK REF="REF-Saint-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1999</LINK>). In vitro studies suggest that a urinary pH below 5.5 is needed for bacteriostatic concentrations of free formaldehyde to be generated from methenamine hippurate (<LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981</LINK>). There are suggestions that it may be difficult to maintain urinary pH below this level with conventional techniques (typically ascorbic acid) long-term (<LINK REF="REF-Hetey-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hetey 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wall-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wall 1990</LINK>). It is also suggested that in catheterised patients, the amount of time that any formaldehyde produced remains in the bladder may be insufficient to be clinically effective (<LINK REF="REF-Devenport-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Devenport 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Saint-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saint 1999</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are two salts of methenamine described in clinical use. It is uncertain whether methenamine hippurate* and methenamine mandelate** are equivalent in effectiveness (<LINK REF="STD-Gow-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Gow 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greenwood-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenwood 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kasanen-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kasanen 1974</LINK>). The mandelate salt is not widely available. This review will only consider the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs.</P>
<P>Common alternatives to methenamine hippurate in oral urinary prophylaxis include antibiotic therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Albert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Niel_x002d_Weise-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niel-Weise 2005</LINK>) and cranberry juice or capsules (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2004</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Symptomatic UTI</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with symptomatic UTI according to defined clinical criteria, along with a positive urine culture. This is the most clinically significant outcome measure for populations at long-term risk of recurrent UTIs. Symptoms of UTI in the general population include: fever, dysuria, frequency, urgency, voiding of small volumes, abrupt onset, suprapubic pain, and loin pain (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1988</LINK>). In spinal injured patients, relevant symptoms should be unexplained by other inter-current pathology and include: fever, autonomic dysreflexia, increased frequency of muscle spasms or spasticity, failure of usual control of urinary incontinence and new abdominal discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-NIDRRS-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIDRRS 1992</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Quantitative urine culture (irrespective of the presence of symptoms suggestive of UTI)</HEADING>
<P>The number of UTI confirmed by appropriate microbiological criteria. Bacteriuria on quantitative urine analysis of more than 100,000 organisms of a single species per mL is the accepted standard - however, the colony count may vary from 100 to 100,000 depending on the clinical setting (<LINK REF="REF-Stamm-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stamm 1988</LINK>). Therefore in some situations, (such as a clean suprapubic tap) a colony count of less than 100,000 is acceptable.</P>

In addition this study, along with <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>, were the only studies in this group that had a patient population with known renal tract abnormalities. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> differed significantly in the underlying population studied (spinal cord injured patients with neuropathic bladder). <LINK REF="STD-Furness-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Furness 1975</LINK> had a longer (but ill defined) treatment duration, and used bacteriuria as an inclusion criterion (as opposed to an exclusion criterion in the other studies).</P>
<P>No study included a treatment group with urinary acidification which we could use for subgroup comparison.

The study by <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1989</LINK> included patients with upper renal tract abnormalities, while <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> also included patients with renal tract abnormalities (15 patients had renal or bladder stones and all participants had neuropathic bladder) and had the longest potential duration of treatment (patients studied up to six months or until they had a UTI). Methenamine hippurate may be ineffective when used in renal tract abnormalities and/or neuropathic bladders (where the outcome is symptomatic UTI).</P>
<P>Four studies had shorter durations of treatment (&#8804; 7 days) (<LINK REF="STD-Knoff-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Knoff 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyreman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyreman 1986</LINK>) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>.1: RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.56; I = 68.0%).

The study populations were: recurrent UTI (<LINK REF="STD-Kasanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kasanen 1982</LINK>), male spinal cord injury (<LINK REF="STD-Kuhlemeier-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlemeier 1985</LINK>), post-menopausal (<LINK REF="STD-Gundersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gundersen 1986</LINK>) and pre-menopausal (<LINK REF="STD-Hoivik-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoivik 1984</LINK>) women. All of these studies used a design where a participant could potentially make multiple contributions to the total number of positive tests (the numerator), and possibly the total number of tests carried out (the denominator). We have called this an "episode to participant discrepancy" (described below) and excluded these studies from the pooled analysis because of the lack of independence of repeated observations in the same individual. In addition, there were excessive post-allocation losses in <LINK REF="STD-Kuhlemeier-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlemeier 1985</LINK> (38%). The overall direction of three of these studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gundersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gundersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoivik-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoivik 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kasanen 1982</LINK>) was towards a treatment effect from methenamine hippurate. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Kuhlemeier-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlemeier 1985</LINK> were difficult to interpret in view of the high post-allocation losses. Given the methodological problems with these studies, it is possible that any estimate of effect size may be exaggerated by these studies.</P>

<P>All the studies that reported adverse events showed low rates, although the methodology for most of these studies was poor with regard to this outcome measure (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> - <I>Population and adverse events</I>). Nausea was the most common symptom and was noted in 12 patients from a total of six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gundersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gundersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kasanen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhlemeier-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlemeier 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ladehoff-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Ladehoff 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 2002</LINK>). In pregnancy, no obvious differences in birth weight, maturity at delivery, foetal abnormality or abortion were noted between treated and untreated patients (<LINK REF="STD-Furness-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Furness 1975</LINK>). Constipation was described once by <LINK REF="STD-Gundersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gundersen 1986</LINK> and twice by <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>.

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Symptomatic UTIs</HEADING>
<P>The outcome measure of most clinical significance is symptomatic UTI. Unfortunately, there was no consistency in definition and most were poorly defined. Eight studies addressed this outcome, from six different populations. Although six of the eight studies suggested a study direction in favour of treatment with methenamine hippurate, the significant methodological problems discussed above suggest that this should be treated cautiously. Two studies that dealt with longer term use of methenamine hippurate unfortunately had to be excluded because they treated recurrent events as independent. Exploration of heterogeneity among the six studies included in the pooled analysis provided a further look at between-study differences. The subgroup analysis by renal tract abnormality revealed continued heterogeneity between the four studies of patients without renal tract abnormality (<LINK REF="STD-Furness-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Furness 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Knoff-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Knoff 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Tyreman-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Tyreman 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis of four studies that used short duration (&#8804; 7 days) treatment with methenamine hippurate also showed heterogeneity. When <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1989</LINK> was removed (<I>analysis 01.05.01</I>), the heterogeneity became non-significant. It may be that methenamine hippurate is more effective for short duration treatment in those individuals without renal tract abnormalities (where the outcome is symptomatic UTI). Combining the two studies with longer duration treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Furness-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Furness 1975</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>) suggested that methenamine hippurate may be ineffective when used for longer durations, although this tentative conclusion should be treated with extreme caution as it is based on one of several subgroup analyses and a subgroup containing only two very different studies. <LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK> was the largest clinical study with the tightest confidence intervals and for the spinal cord injured group with neuropathic bladder showed no treatment effect when used (predominantly) for community prophylaxis. A test for modification of the treatment effect by urinary acidification, bladder management type or dose through formal subgroup analysis was not possible due to insufficient studies.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Bacteriuria</HEADING>
<P>Bacteriuria as an outcome measure was much better defined. Unfortunately it is also of less clinical significance in population groups who experience chronic infections (<LINK REF="REF-NIDRRS-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">NIDRRS 1992</LINK>). Twelve studies addressed this outcome measure. Again, the majority reported results in favour of treatment. Unfortunately, counting of recurrent events was again a problem. Excluding these studies and conducting a pooled analysis of eight studies revealed an overall direction in favour of treatment but in the presence of significant heterogeneity. The study that showed a treatment effect in the opposite direction was <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1989</LINK>. Heterogeneity was explored by looking at differences among the eight studies in the pooled analysis. A subgroup analysis of six studies of patients without underlying renal tract abnormality still showed heterogeneity. The direction of the pooled estimate for this subgroup favoured treatment with methenamine hippurate. It is possible that methenamine hippurate is more effective in patients without underlying renal tract abnormality, although this information would need to be treated cautiously, given the persisting heterogeneity. A subgroup analysis of five studies with short treatment duration also demonstrated heterogeneity. Exclusion of the <LINK REF="STD-Pettersson-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pettersson 1989</LINK> outlier explained much but not all of the underlying heterogeneity. It is possible that short duration treatment is more effective in people without underlying renal tract abnormality, but again this possibility would need to be treated very cautiously.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Adverse events were poorly described, with data of insufficient quality to perform formal statistical evaluation. Overall, the frequency of reported side-effects was low compared to control.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="2">Alternative oral prophylactic agents</HEADING>
<P>This meta-analysis provides the suggestion that methenamine hippurate may be more effective for short duration treatment in those individuals without renal tract abnormalities (where the outcome is symptomatic UTI). Caution needs to be taken when interpreting this result due to underlying heterogeneity, the small sample and the subgroup analysis involved. Participants likely to benefit in this short-duration treatment group are likely to have access to treatment alternatives which are potentially more effective, in particular oral antibiotics, where a recent Cochrane review has demonstrated (weak) evidence that prophylactic antibiotic use reduces symptomatic UTI rates in females undergoing abdominal surgery and short-term bladder catheterisation (<LINK REF="REF-Niel_x002d_Weise-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Niel-Weise 2005</LINK>). Another Cochrane review demonstrates that cranberry juice may reduce UTI over a 12 month period in women without abnormal renal tracts (<LINK REF="REF-Jepson-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jepson 2004</LINK>). Unfortunately, such alternative treatments are less demonstrable for those with abnormal renal tracts (including neuropathic bladder) who have high rates of antibiotic resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Thom-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thom 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Waites-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Waites 2000</LINK>) and are arguably most in need of non-antibiotic prophylaxis.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2012-03-14 11:20:07 +1100" MODIFIED_BY="Narelle S Willis">
<P>Overall, the studies were of poor quality, although more recent studies were better. The two most recent studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lee-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Lee 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schiotz-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Schiotz 2002</LINK>) demonstrated adequate allocation concealment while the others did not. The majority of the other studies were unblinded. These study characteristics are associated with exaggerated treatment effects (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>). Publication bias cannot be completely excluded, as the number of studies available for the pooled analysis was too small to be interpreted using methods such as "funnel plots" (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 1999</LINK>). "Episodes to participant discrepancy" problems in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Gundersen-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Gundersen 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoivik-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Hoivik 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kasanen-1982" TYPE="STUDY">Kasanen 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuhlemeier-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Kuhlemeier 1985</LINK>) reduced the number of studies available for the pooled analysis.</P>

</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>An exploration of heterogeneity raises the (hypothesis generating) possibility that methenamine hippurate may have some efficacy in patients without (but not in patients with) known renal tract abnormality. Short duration therapy (&#8804; 7 days) in people without renal tract abnormalities may be effective, but this group also have effective clinical alternatives such as oral antibiotic therapy available. Methenamine hippurate appears to be ineffective when used in spinal cord injured patients with neuropathic bladder. The rate of adverse events reported by the studies was low, which suggests that current usage is unlikely to be causing significant harm. There is a need for further large RCTs in particular to explore long duration therapy for patients without neuropathic bladder.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Additional well controlled RCTs are necessary, in particular to further clarify longer term prophylaxis in those without neuropathic bladder. There needs to be better definition of symptomatic bacteruria outcomes in these clinical studies.</P>
