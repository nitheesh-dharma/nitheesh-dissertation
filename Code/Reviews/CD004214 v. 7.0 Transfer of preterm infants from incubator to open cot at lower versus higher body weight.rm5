<P>For preterm infants to be discharged home from nurseries, they must be able to maintain their temperature in an unheated open cot. The timing of the transfer from the incubator is important because, if an infant is not able to maintain his/her temperature and is cold, then this could affect weight gain and delay the infant's discharge from hospital. A review of the trials found that preterm infants can be transferred to unheated open cots at a lower body weight of 1600 grams without adverse effects on temperature stability or weight gain.</P>

<P>Four eligible studies were identified. Two of the identified trials were assessed as having good methodological quality. Two studies reported daily weight gain (calculated as growth velocity); the lower body weight group had a significantly greater daily weight gain [pooled mean difference (MD) 2.66 (95% confidence interval (CI)1.37 to 3.95). One study reported a larger proportion of infants transferred at the higher body weight had an episode of low temperature in the first 72 hours; while no difference between the two groups was found in the proportion of infants experiencing cold stress post-transfer to discharge. Two studies report no difference between the two groups in requiring an overhead heater for temperature maintenance [pooled RR 1.43 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.18). No statistically significant difference was shown for proportion of infants returning to an incubator [three studies (N = 336) [pooled RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.77 to 4.08].</P>
<P>Two studies report there was no statistically significant difference in time spent in an open cot post transfer to discharge; while one study found infants transferred at lower weights had a significantly reduced length of stay [MD -9.00 (95% CI -13.29 to -4.71), a second study found no differences between the two groups [MD 0.30 (95% CI -5.11 to 5.71). In these two studies not breastfeeding at discharge was not significantly different between the lower and higher body weight groups [pooled RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.51).</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-04 11:30:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-02-15 17:00:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Preterm infants are cared for in a neutral thermal environment to prevent thermal cold stress so that minimal energy is expended, thereby minimising oxygen and energy consumption. Since improved survival of small infants cared for in warmer environments was demonstrated over 40 years ago (<LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1957" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1957</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1958" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1958</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silverman-1963" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silverman 1963</LINK>), maintaining a thermoneutral environment for preterm infants with the use of incubator care has became routine practice in neonatal nurseries. However, at some point during hospitalisation, the infant will need to make the transition from incubator to open cot. One of the key criteria for discharging preterm infants from nurseries is their ability to maintain temperature once transferred to an open cot. The timing of this transition is important because when an infant is challenged by cold, the infant attempts to increase its heat production to maintain body temperature. Vasoconstriction occurs as the infant attempts to conserve body heat and brown adipose tissue is metabolised. The increase in energy expenditure may affect weight gain. Exposure of growing preterm infants to a subthermoneutral environmental temperature in the late neonatal period results in a slowing of growth through an increase in energy expenditure (<LINK REF="REF-Glass-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glass 1969</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-04 11:30:55 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The practice of transferring infants from incubators to open cots varies widely among neonatal units, with no clear indication as to when or how this transition should take place (<LINK REF="REF-New-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">New 2010</LINK>). The usual practice is to transfer infants to open cots once a weight of around 1700 to 1800 grams has been reached (<LINK REF="REF-New-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">New 2010</LINK>). This target weight appears to be largely based on tradition or the personal experience of clinicians with little consideration of the infant's weight or gestational age at birth. The main factors determining the preterm infant's postnatal thermal stability are: (i) degree of prematurity - the more immature the infant, the thinner the skin, the less subcutaneous fat and the greater the surface area/weight ratio; (ii) birth weight - small for gestational age or lower birth weight also results in less subcutaneous fat for insulation and thermogenesis and the greater the surface area/weight ratio; (iii) postnatal age - thermostability increases with postnatal age (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-Kuller-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus Kuller 1998</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-04-27 14:52:52 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A number of measures have been suggested to assist in the maintenance of body temperature when transferring infants from incubators to open cots. These measures have included a gradual weaning process in which infants are dressed in clothing and the incubator air temperature is reduced, thus thermally challenging the infant prior to transfer to an open cot (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>), the use of heated water-filled mattresses and heated nurseries (<LINK REF="REF-Gray-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gray-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gray 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Berger-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Berger 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Weintraub-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Weintraub 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Open cots are relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of air-heated incubators. If it could be demonstrated that transfer of an infant to an unheated open cot at a lower body weight could be achieved without adverse outcome, considerable economic benefit could result in both developing and developed countries.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-02-15 17:00:27 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Delaying transition to an open cot on the basis of not reaching a certain arbitrary weight criterion may result in longer hospitalisation than necessary, thus increasing the cost of care provided (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>). Maternal perceptions of their infants may influence infant development (<LINK REF="REF-Watt-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watt 1989</LINK>). Maternal perceptions may be more positive when infants are cared for in an open cot due to ease of access promoting autonomy for parents and improving parent-infant attachment, which may improve breast feeding rates. Nursing staff may perceive that caring for infants in open cots reduces workload and that better care may be provided due to increased accessibility.</P>
<P>While there may be benefits of earlier transfer to an open cot, there may be potential risks. Transferring infants from an incubator to an open cot before an infant is ready may result in the infant's inability to maintain temperature, leading to weight loss, resulting in extended hospitalisation and adding to the cost of care (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>). The need for an infant to return to an incubator after making the transition to an open cot may also result in increased stress and anxiety to the parents and family.</P>

Incomplete outcome data: Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed? For each included study and for each outcome, we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.<BR/>We assessed the methods as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>low risk (where it is clear that all of the study's pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);</LI>
<LI>high risk (where not all the study's pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); </LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</UL>
<P>6. Other sources of bias: Was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias? For each included study, we described any important concerns regarding other possible sources of bias.<BR/>We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:</P>

<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Heimler-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heimler 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 1988</LINK>) were conducted in the US, one (<LINK REF="STD-New-2011" TYPE="STUDY">New 2011</LINK>) in Australia and the fourth (<LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK>) in Italy.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Heimler-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heimler 1981</LINK> randomised preterm infants to one of two study groups: Group A was transferred to an open cot at a weight of between 1600 grams and 1700 grams and Group B at a weight of between 1800 grams and 1900 grams. The same conditions existed for both groups. Infants were dressed in a single shirt, diaper, cap and booties throughout the study. Incubator air temperatures were kept between 30 and 32 degrees Celsius and room temperature between 25 and 27 degrees Celsius. Once all infants reached a weight of 1500 grams they were fed outside the incubator. Once transferred to a crib, the infant was covered with four blankets. Infants were fed as clinically indicated. A total of 20 infants were enrolled, however data on only 14 infants was reported (six in group A and 8 in group B).<BR/>
<BR/>The main outcome measures assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Heimler-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Heimler 1981</LINK> study were body temperature (axillary, rectal and anterior abdominal skin); gross energy intake; weight gain; head growth; length growth and skinfold thickness. Only one outcome measure, weight gain (g/kg/day) was included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Sutter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 1988</LINK> study included preterm infants, born less than 1500 grams, cared for in a single-walled incubator, who were divided into four strata based on birthweight (Stratum I. Birthweight 1251 to 1500 grams; Stratum II. Birthweight 1001 to 1250 grams; Stratum III. Birthweight 751 to 1000 grams; Stratum IV. Birthweight less then 751 grams) and then randomised to one of two study groups: Group 1 was transferred to an open cot at a weight of 1700 g and Group 2 at a weight of 1800 grams. Prior to transfer of all infants, the incubator temperature was weaned gradually by decreasing the incubator temperature by 1°C each hour until the incubator temperature reached 28°C. Infants were clothed in a cotton shirt, with one or two blankets when moved into an open cot. If the infant's temperature dropped to less than 36°C at any time during the weaning process or any time after, the infant was returned to an incubator and weaning could recommence 48 hours later. Nursery temperature was maintained at 22°C. Other nursery routines were not changed. A total of 60 infants were enrolled (30 in each group; consisting of 15 in stratum I; nine in stratum II; five in stratum III and one in stratum IV).</P>
<P>The primary outcome measures assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Sutter-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Sutter 1988</LINK> study were hypothermia requiring the infant to be returned to the incubator, weight gain (mean 24 hour weight gain) and length of hospitalisation (duration (days) from entry into the study at 1500 grams to discharge). However day of discharge was defined to be 24 hours after successful weaning from incubator to open cot, due to delayed discharge of some infants for social reasons. Only one outcome measure, returned to incubator was included in this review.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-New-2011" TYPE="STUDY">New 2011</LINK> randomised preterm infants, born less then 1600 grams, into one of two groups: intervention group (transfer to an open cot at 1600 grams); or control group (transfer to an open cot at 1800 grams). Nursery temperatures were maintained at 24 to 26 ºC with the relative humidity at 55%. On transfer, infants were dressed in a singlet, a cotton full-length jumpsuit and a woollen hat; wrapped in a flannelette sheet and a cotton blanket. A quilt was placed over the infant&#8217;s bedclothes. Post-transfer axillary temperatures were measured at one hour, three hours, then every three hours until 72 hours, and thereafter a minimum of three times a day until discharge. Temperature stability was defined as the axillary temperature range of 36·4 to 37·1 ºC. If an infant&#8217;s axillary temperature fell below 36·4 ºC a predetermined sequence to assist in temperature maintenance post-transfer was instituted: additional clothing, additional bedding, an overhead radiant heater, and finally return to an incubator. Failure of transfer was defined as return to an incubator for inability to maintain an axillary temperature above 36·4 ºC within three hours of being under an overhead heater or if an overhead heater was required on more than two occasions, for periods of greater than three hours each time, in a 24 hour period. Each infant was weighed naked every second day, prior to a feed, using electronic scales. Other nursery routines were not changed and other clinical management decisions were left to the clinical care team responsible for the infants. A total of 182 infants were enrolled (90 in 1600 gram group and 92 in 1800 gram group).</P>
<P>The primary outcomes assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-New-2011" TYPE="STUDY">New 2011</LINK> study (post-transfer) were temperature stability over 72 hours and to discharge; and average daily weight gain post-transfer over two weeks. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of infants requiring an overhead heater; the proportion of infants returned to an incubator; length of hospital stay (from time of randomisation to discharge); postmenstrual age (PMA) and weight at discharge.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK> randomised preterm infants, born less than 1600 grams, into one of two groups: early transition groups (transferred at 1600 grams) and standard transition group (transferred at 1800 grams). All infants enrolled in the study were nursed in incubators (servo-control temperature) and 40% relative humidity. Nursery temperature was maintained at 24 ºC and 40% relative humidity. On transfer, infants were dressed in a woollen hat, booties, two vests and a cotton wrap. Axillary temperatures were measured hourly until the recording of 2 consecutive readings of &#8805; 36.5°C and then every three hours at feeding time, up to 72 hours after transfer.If temperature fell below 36.5°C, then an additional wrap was added to the infant. If the temperature remained below 36.5°C, then the infant was placed under a radiant warmer and if the temperature failed to rise above 36.5°C after three hours, the infant was transferred back to an incubator. Infants were weighed daily, naked, before the 9:00 AM feeding. A total of 94 infants were enrolled (47 in each group).</P>
<P>The primary outcome assessed in the <LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK> study was length of stay. Seconday outcomes were the number of infants returned to an incubator, the growth velocity from transfer to an open crib to discharge and during the first week at home, the mean<BR/>individual amount of breast milk at discharge and during the first week at home, and the hospital readmission rate.<BR/>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-04 12:08:57 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review sought to determine the effect of transferring preterm infants from incubators to open cots at a lower body weight. We identified four studies that compared preterm infants transferred to open cots at a lower body weight versus higher body weight. Combined results of two studies showed that preterm infants transferred at lower weights had statistically greater daily weight gains (g/kg/day). Few differences were seen in episodes of low temperature between the lower body weight and higher body weight infants. A single study comparing proportion of infants having at least one episode of low temperature showed infants transferred at lower body weights had less episodes within the first 72 hours, but no significant differences were seen between the two groups from post-transfer to discharge. Similiarly two studies showed no significant difference between the two groups in those requiring an overhead heater for temperature maintenance; whilst the results of three studies showed no significant difference in the proportion of infants requiring to be returned to an incubator.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-New-2011" TYPE="STUDY">New 2011</LINK> infants transferred to an open cot at lower body weights did not have shorter length of stay (LOS) in hospital. However, <LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK> reports a significantly shorter LOS for infants transferred at lower body weights. Whilst the meta-analysis of length of stay showed a shorter LOS for babies transferred at &lt; 1600 grams there was substantial heterogeneity and this result should be treated with caution. There were large differences in the number of infants exclusive breastfeeding at discharge between the two studies with considerably fewer infants exclusive breastfeeding in the study that showed a shorter LOS for infants transferred at &lt; 1600 grams (<LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK>). It would appear that babies who transferred to an open cot earlier, who also are bottle fed, are discharged earlier. Therefore, the advantage of a shorter LOS may only be conferred on those babies who are not discharged exclusive breastfeeding.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-04-01 04:05:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>These data are relevant to current practice since the two largest trials (<LINK REF="STD-New-2011" TYPE="STUDY">New 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zecca-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Zecca 2010</LINK>), in which 276 extremely and moderately preterm infants participated, were conducted during the past six years. More evidence was provided on the effect on weight gain, episodes of cold stress and length of hospital stay for preterm infants transferred at lower body weights. Whilst evidence was provided that infants born less than 1000 grams can be transferred to unheated open cots at 1600 grams without adverse effects, this evidence should be viewed with caution as the studies were not powered for subgroup analysis.<BR/>
<BR/>All of the included trials have been undertaken in neonatal care centres in high-income countries. Given the recommendation that nursery environment temperatures should be maintained between 22 to 26 ºC (<LINK REF="REF-Lemons-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lemons 2007</LINK>), achieved by heating or air conditioning systems, these results may be applicable in middle to high income countries. It is unclear how applicable this evidence is to neonatal care practices in low-income countries in settings with less technologically-developed healthcare provision. As kangaroo mother care has been shown to decrease risk of mortality and infection/sepsis and also some increase in measures of growth, breastfeeding and infant-maternal attachment (<LINK REF="REF-Conde_x002d_Agudelo-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conde-Agudelo 2011</LINK>) this practice may still be the practice of choice.<BR/>

<P>The methodological quality of two of four included studies was good suggesting that data were valid. But it was not possible to mask caregivers to the nature of the intervention, although blinding of some outcome assessments could have been possible. Although the lack of blinding may have resulted in surveillance and ascertainment biases, resulting in the lower body weight infants being wrapped more judiciously and thus being kept warmer, however only within the first 72 hours post-transfer. This effect has not seen from post-transfer to discharge.<BR/>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2011-05-04 12:10:17 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The available data from randomised controlled trials provides evidence that well, medically stable preterm infants can be transferred from incubators to open cots at lower weights of 1600 grams without adverse effects on temperature stability or weight gain. Whilst the results of subgroup analysis according to birthweight and gestational age show that infants born less than 1000 grams or less than 34 weeks gestation are not more likely to have weight loss and temperature instability, these results should be viewed with caution as the subgroup analyses were not powered for in the study design.</P>
<P>Practice should ensure all infants transferred to open cots have regular monitoring of axillary temperatures, have a guideline indicating acceptable temperature range and clear actions and timeframe's for correcting low temperatures.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-03-24 18:17:08 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although we have demonstrated that babies can be successfully transferred at 1600 grams it may well be that they can be transferred at lower weights. There may also be better criteria for deciding when to transfer infants to an open cot other than weight.</P>
<P>It is difficult to design a pragmatic trial that will ensure that caregivers, parents and investigators are unaware of the allocated intervention of incubator or open cot care. This lack of blinding may cause surveillance and ascertainment biases that result in the lower body weight infants being wrapped and monitored more judiciously and thus kept warmer. </P>

<P>a. The words cold stress changed to low temperature and the example of temperature considered to be low has been changed from less then 36.3 °C to 36.5 °C due to current recommendations of normal temperature range for preterm infants. The recommended temperature range has changed since the inception of the protocol.</P>
<P>b. Added duration from randomisation to cot to discharge home (days) as this is clinically meaningful to the outcome of the question in this review.</P>
<P>c. Postnatal age at discharge (days) removed as this data was the same as length of stay. Added Postmenstrual age at discharge (days) as this is clinically more meaningful.</P>
