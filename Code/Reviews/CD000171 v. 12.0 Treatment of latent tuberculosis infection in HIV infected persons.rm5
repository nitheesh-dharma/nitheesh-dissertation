<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:31:44 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Most people infected with tuberculosis (TB) never get TB symptoms. This is called latent TB. People infected with HIV/AIDS are at increased risk of getting TB and about 30% of people with HIV who have latent TB will eventually get active TB. This results in an increase in the risk of earlier death. This update of the review of available clinical trials found that the risk of developing active TB was reduced when people infected with both HIV and TB used isoniazid. Isoniazid for latent TB is usually taken for six to 12 months, but more research is still needed to show optimal duration of treatment, the best treatment regime for people with HIV, and especially the best regimen in combination with HIV drugs.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:25:24 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). It is known that treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI), also referred to as TB preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis, helps to prevent progression to active disease in HIV negative populations. However, the extent and magnitude of protection (if any) associated with preventive therapy in those infected with HIV should be quantified. This present study is an update of the original review.

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-01-06 06:26:17 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review was updated using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS, AIDSearch, NLM Gateway and AIDSDRUGS (publication date from 01 July 2002 to 04 April 2008). We also scanned reference lists of articles and contacted authors and other researchers in the field in an attempt to identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion in this review.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-11-11 02:12:20 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomized controlled trials in which HIV positive individuals were randomly allocated to TB preventive therapy or placebo, or to alternative TB preventive therapy regimens. Participants could be tuberculin skin test positive or negative, but without active tuberculosis.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:33:03 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<P>12 trials were included with a total of 8578 randomized participants. TB preventive therapy (any anti-TB drug) versus placebo was associated with a lower incidence of active TB (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.85). This benefit was more pronounced in individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57) than in those who had a negative test (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Efficacy was similar for all regimens (regardless of drug type, frequency or duration of treatment). However, compared to INH monotherapy, short-course multi-drug regimens were much more likely to require discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects. Although there was reduction in mortality with INH monotherapy versus placebo among individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00) and with INH plus rifampicin versus placebo regardless of tuberculin skin test status (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95), overall, there was no evidence that TB preventive therapy versus placebo reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-09 10:58:38 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection reduces the risk of active TB in HIV positive individuals especially in those with a positive tuberculin skin test. The choice of regimen will depend on factors such as availability, cost, adverse effects, adherence and drug resistance. Future studies should assess these aspects. In addition, trials evaluating the long-term effects of anti-tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis, the optimal duration of TB preventive therapy, the influence of level of immunocompromise on effectiveness and combination of anti-tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy are needed.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 14:34:09 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Tara Horvath">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-11 11:56:54 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a chronic and manageable disease in those who are able to access treatment; the successes recorded can easily be destroyed by the high burden of tuberculosis (TB) co-infection in the HIV-infected population. Even after the initiation of ART, the incidence of HIV-related TB remains unacceptably high (<LINK REF="REF-Badri-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badri 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lawn-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lawn 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girardi-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girardi 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>According to the WHO Global TB Control report of 2008, worldwide, about 9.2 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths from TB occurred in 2006 and of these around 709,000 (7.7%) new cases and 200,000 deaths were estimated to have occurred in HIV-positive individuals (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008-_x0028_1_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008 (1)</LINK>).</P>
<P>Therefore, prevention of TB is one of the most important measures that may help in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection particularly in countries with high burden of both infections.</P>
<P>Latent TB (LTB) infection is the presence of <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </I>(<I>M. tuberculosis</I>), the organism that causes TB, in an individual in a non-active phase and without producing clinical symptoms. Although, one third of the world's population is believed to be latently infected with <I>M. tuberculosis,</I> most of those infected will never have symptoms (<LINK REF="REF-Dye-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dye 1999</LINK>). Whereas in the general population the lifetime risk of progression from latent TB infection to active disease is about 10%, HIV positive persons who are infected with <I>M. tuberculosis</I> have a 5-8% annual risk and a 30% lifetime risk of developing active tuberculosis (<A HREF="selwyn%201989">Selwyn 1989</A>) and this risk increases as immune deficiency worsens (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2003</LINK>). HIV infection by impairing cell-mediated immunity is the most potent known risk factor for the reactivation of latent <I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection (<LINK REF="REF-McShane-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">McShane 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The tuberculin skin test (TST) is the primary screening test for the diagnosis of latent TB. Although this test is over 100 years old, it represents the second longest standing test in use for TB after sputum microscopy (<LINK REF="REF-Mendelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendelson 2007</LINK>). In this test, purified protein derivative (PPD), a material derived from <I>M. tuberculosis</I> is injected into the skin of an individual and the reaction on the skin as indicated by the degree of induration is evaluated after about 48-72 hours.</P>
<P>A person is said to be positive to the TST (PPD positive) if there is a strong skin reaction. In HIV infected persons, a reaction greater than 5mm is considered positive while a reaction of less than 5mm is said to be a negative reaction. An individual without a reaction to TST and other common antigens such as mumps and candida is said to be anergic. PPD positive individuals are at a greater risk of progressing to active TB disease than people not infected with<I> M. tuberculosis</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Watkins-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watkins 2000</LINK>). Despite being an imperfect test, with both false positive and false negative results, TST remains a very useful and indeed a critical tool, both for epidemiologic research and the control and prevention of clinical tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>HIV infection also has implications for the diagnosis and clinical presentation of TB. The proportion of PPD negative individuals with tuberculosis infection seems to be higher in HIV positive populations than in those who are not infected with HIV (<A HREF="daniel%202000">Daniel 2000</A>). Similarly, the percentage of sputum smear negative patients with active tuberculosis is higher in HIV infected populations compared with HIV negative populations raising concerns for TB detection. Furthermore, extra-pulmonary tuberculosis is more common in patients with HIV infection than those who are not HIV-infected (<LINK REF="REF-Harries-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harries 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The treatment of LTB (also known as TB preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis) is the administration of one or combination of anti-TB drugs to people with latent infection with<I> M. tuberculosis</I> with the aim of eradicating latent infection before it develops into active disease. The use of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is one of the strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to decrease the burden of TB in people living with HIV in addition to establishing intensified TB case finding and ensuring the control of TB infection in health-care and congregate settings (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Several placebo-controlled trials in HIV negative people infected with<I> M. tuberculosis</I> have shown that daily isoniazid given for 6-12 months substantially reduces the subsequent risk of active tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Brien-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Brien 1994</LINK>; <A HREF="smieja%202003">Smieja 2003</A>). Similarly, several placebo-controlled trials have shown that treatment of latent TB is effective in HIV-infected individuals (<LINK REF="STD-Gordin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halsey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Halsey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hawken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Quigley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Whalen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Whalen 1997</LINK>). Following the publication of these trials, a systematic review that included 10 trials was published in 2004 and the results showed that treatment of LTB infection reduces the risk of active TB in HIV positive individuals especially those with a positive TST (<LINK REF="REF-Woldehanna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woldehanna 2004</LINK>). We hereby report an update of this review.</P>

<P>The objective of this review was to determine the effectiveness of TB preventive therapy (PT) in reducing the risk of active TB and death in persons infected with HIV. The following hypotheses were proposed for testing depending on available evidence:</P>
<P>1. PT does not reduce the incidence of, and interval to active TB in HIV infected persons. If PT is effective in reducing the incidence of active TB, the effect is not dependent on the following factors:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>PPD status (whether the TST is positive or negative)</LI>
<LI>Degree of immunocompromise (stage of HIV disease)</LI>
<LI>TB drug regimen including type, dosage and duration of treatment</LI>
<LI>Time since completion of therapy</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. PT does not reduce the frequency of death from all causes in HIV infected persons.<BR/>3. PT does not slow the progression of HIV disease through reducing the incidence of AIDS and delay of time to the development of AIDS.<BR/>4. PT is not associated with an increased incidence of adverse drug reactions and different drug regimens do not have different rates of adverse reactions</P>

Where we were able to obtain information from either published or unpublished data, we stratified results by PPD status and HIV/AIDS status at baseline. We also extracted information on adherence to therapy.</P>
<P>Differences between reviewers (CA, IA &amp; SS) in relation to data extraction or quality assessment were resolved by discussion and re-examination of the relevant studies.</P>
<P>We pooled data using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals using a fixed effects model. We tested for statistical heterogeneity of trial results at the 0.1 level. For continuous data such as time to AIDS, we used the weighted mean difference (WMD). Heterogeneity was quantified by the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic, which quantifies the percentage of the total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2003</LINK>); smaller percentages suggest less observed heterogeneity.</P>

<P>In addition to the 10 trials included in the original systematic review, we initially identified a possible four new trials that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grant-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Grant 2005</LINK>) was later excluded because it assessed the effect on incidence of TB at a clinic that offered INH under routine conditions and participants were not randomized to receive INH or placebo. The study by Lim 2006 (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>) was an additional publication from the Whalen trial (<LINK REF="STD-Whalen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Whalen 1997</LINK>), which was already included in the review. Lim et al reported data on the rate of disease progression to AIDS or death, with results reported for PPD positive persons and those with anergy (<LINK REF="REF-Lim-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lim 2006</LINK>).Long-term follow-up results of <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 1998</LINK> were published in <LINK REF="STD-Quigley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 1998</LINK>.</P>
<P>This current update thus includes 12 trials with a total of 8578 randomized participants. Study size varied from 98 to 2018 participants. The two new trials included in this update are <LINK REF="STD-Rivero-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivero 2007</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Mohammed-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammed 2007</LINK>. The study by Rivero et al. that was included in the original review recruited anergic individuals <LINK REF="STD-Rivero-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rivero 2003</LINK>. The study identified in this update recruited PPD+ individuals <LINK REF="STD-Rivero-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivero 2007</LINK>.</P>

One multi-national study included participants from Mexico, USA, Haiti and Brazil (<LINK REF="STD-Gordin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Study participants were 13 years of age or older (mean age 33 years). 47% were female, with a range of 20% to 69% across trials. Mean duration of follow up ranged from 1 to 3 years.</P>
<P>Some reports included only individuals who were PPD+ (<LINK REF="STD-Gordin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Halsey-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Halsey 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivero-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Rivero 2007</LINK>) and others involved only those known to be anergic (<LINK REF="STD-Gordin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rivero-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Rivero 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mohammed-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Mohammed 2007</LINK>). One trial included both PPD+ and anergic individuals as separately randomized groups (<LINK REF="STD-Whalen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Whalen 1997</LINK>; Lim 2006) and another as one group with stratification by PPD status in the analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Martinez-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Martinez 2000</LINK>). A further trial among PPD negative individuals did not test for anergy (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2001</LINK>). The remaining trials included individuals regardless of PPD status (<LINK REF="STD-Hawken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>) with only two of these providing stratified data (<LINK REF="STD-Hawken-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Hawken 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>)</P>

<BR/>We detected no heterogeneity in the outcome across the trials.</P>
<P>We found no trials that compared the effects of different drug dosages, treatment frequency or duration of therapy on clinical outcomes. Current trials do not provide sufficient data to assess the impact of preventive therapy on interval to active TB.</P>
<P>We assessed the influence of various factors on the incidence of active TB:</P>
<P>PPD status<BR/>Among individuals who were tuberculin skin test positive, preventive therapy reduced the risk of active TB by 62% (4 trials; 2378 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). There was no evidence of effect for individuals with a negative tuberculin test (7 trials; 2822 participants; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24).<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>
</P>
<P>Stage of HIV disease at baseline<BR/>We found limited data stratified by stage of HIV/AIDS at baseline. In <LINK REF="STD-Gordin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 1997</LINK>, which compared INH to placebo, the relative risk (95% CI) for the development of confirmed TB was 3.42 ( 0.14 to 82.33) for those with AIDS and 0.32 (0.06 to 1.54) for those without AIDS; neither of these findings being statistically significant. Similarly, in <LINK REF="STD-Gordin-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 2000</LINK> comparing INH with RIF+PZA, the risk of confirmed TB was not statistically significant in subgroups defined by AIDS status: AIDS RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.43; no AIDS RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.74.</P>
<P>Time since treatment<BR/>We found limited information on the duration of the protective effect of preventive therapy. <LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 1998</LINK> provided data for a median follow-up of 1.8 years in a mixture of PPD positive and negative people found a reduction in the risk of active TB in the intervention groups versus placebo (INH: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97; RIF plus PZA: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.91). In a subsequent report (<LINK REF="STD-Quigley-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Quigley 1998</LINK>) presenting findings after a mean follow-up of 3 years, Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a diminishing effect over time. Nevertheless, compared to placebo the reported cumulative risk in the first 2.5 years remained lower for INH (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.00), for RIF plus PZA (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.09) and for both intervention arms combined (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.93).</P>
<P>In another study (<LINK REF="STD-Whalen-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Whalen 1997</LINK>) involving PPD positive individuals, INH (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.67), INH + RIF (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.77) and INH + RIF + PZA (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.00) were each shown to significantly lower the risk of active TB after a mean of 15 months. This benefit remained statistically significant on long-term follow-up for the rifampicin containing regimens but not for INH alone (Johnson 2001). Based on a Cox regression analysis the adjusted relative risk at 3 years was 0.67 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.07) for INH, 0.49 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.82) for INH + RIF, and 0.41 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.76) for INH+RIF+PZA. For anergic participants the initial statistically non-significant benefit 1 year after INH treatment (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.1.79) (<LINK REF="STD-Whalen-1997_x002d_anergy" TYPE="STUDY">Whalen 1997-anergy</LINK>) remained at 2 years (adjusted relative risk 0.61 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.16) (Johnson 2001 -anergy).</P>
<P>The long-term follow-up results for the studies mentioned above should be interpreted with caution as there was substantial loss to follow-up in all trials which may have introduced bias.</P>
<P>DEATH FROM ALL CAUSES</P>
<P>We found no evidence that preventive therapy versus placebo reduced all-cause mortality (9 trials; 5762 participants; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05) or reduced mortality among those who were PPD positive (4 trials, 2378 participants, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.02), however these findings were heterogeneous (p=0.04).</P>
<P>The single placebo-controlled trial that assessed the effect of INH by stage of HIV/AIDS at baseline found no difference (<LINK REF="STD-Gordin-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Gordin 1997</LINK>): with AIDS (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17), without AIDS (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.35).</P>
<P>There was reduction in mortality with INH monotherapy versus placebo among individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00).</P>
<P>We found no differences in the effect on death by study drug with the exception of INH+RIF, which was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death (2 trials; 1179 participants; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95). Direct comparison of different drug regimens revealed no differences.<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>.</P>
<P>AIDS</P>
<P>Based on data from two trials of an INH based regimen versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Fitzgerald-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Fitzgerald 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>), we found no evidence of a reduction in the incidence of AIDS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.28). However, one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>) found a lower risk of AIDS in PPD + individuals (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.85), but not in those with a negative skin test (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.20). <LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK> also found a significant increase in the mean time to AIDS (in months) (WMD 7.8, 95% CI 1.71 to 13.89) <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>.</P>
<P>ADVERSE EVENTS</P>
<P>We extracted available data on adverse events deemed by the investigators as serious enough to discontinue treatment.

This systematic review which updates a previous Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Woldehanna-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woldehanna 2004</LINK>) confirms that treatment of latent TB reduces the risk of clinical tuberculosis in HIV infected populations by 32%. Although there was reduction in mortality with INH monotherapy versus placebo among individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test and in those treated with INH plus rifampicin versus placebo regardless of tuberculin skin test status, overall, there was no evidence that TB preventive therapy versus placebo reduced all-cause mortality. The impact of INH preventive therapy on mortality is of public health importance as INH is commonly used in most resource poor countries and it's being scaled up as part of the WHO Three I's initiative (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2008-_x0028_2_x0029_" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2008 (2)</LINK>). Globally, less than 30, 000 HIV-infected people were reported to have been started on INH preventive therapy in 2007 &#8211; equivalent to just 0.1% of the 33 million people estimated to be infected with HIV (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2009</LINK>). Though the major findings of this updated review are not different from those reported in the original review, overall, they provide more up-to-date evidence in support of the use of TB preventive therapy in people living with HIV.</P>
<P>For INH monotherapy, compared with placebo, the short-term reduction in relative risk of one-third is only half of that in people who are HIV-negative (<LINK REF="REF-Smieja-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smieja 2003</LINK>), the absolute risk reduction (ARR) for active tuberculosis is greater (2% vs 1%). In HIV positive and negative individuals the pooled number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent one case of TB is therefore 50 and 100, respectively. However, among people infected with HIV who have a positive tuberculin test, chemoprophylaxis appears to be substantially more beneficial (INH: ARR 5%, NNT 20). The combined NNT should, however, be interpreted with caution as NNTs in individual trials will be influenced by a number of factors, including baseline incidence rates, misclassification of cases and duration of follow-up.</P>
<P>How long the initial benefit conferred by anti-tuberculosis drugs on the incidence of active tuberculosis persists is not known with certainty. Based on one study with limited follow-up (median duration of follow-up 1.8 years), it seems that the initial protection conferred by chemoprophylaxis may diminish over time (<LINK REF="STD-Mwinga-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Mwinga 1998</LINK>). Whether HIV positive individuals living in areas of high TB prevalence should receive repeated courses of preventive treatment or even remain on life-long treatment cannot be answered from currently available research.</P>
<P>Although there appears to be no difference in benefit from alternative anti-tuberculosis drugs/drug combinations for the outcomes examined, current trials do not provide sufficient data on drug resistance and adherence to treatment which, along with information on cost, would be important for choosing a particular drug regimen. Adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment were more common in trials using multi-drug combination therapy as opposed to INH alone.</P>
<P>The finding from one study that preventive therapy may reduce the incidence of AIDS and time to full-blown disease is plausible (<LINK REF="STD-Pape-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Pape 1993</LINK>). It is known that <I>M. tuberculosis</I> can activate HIV-infected CD4 lymphocytes and this may lead to progression from HIV infection to clinical AIDS (<LINK REF="REF-Daniel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Daniel 2000</LINK>). This observation, however, awaits confirmation in further trials.<BR/>
<BR/>Currently available trials do not provide sufficient data to draw firm conclusions about the value of preventive therapy for improving survival in persons infected with HIV. It was also not possible to determine whether the effects of treatment are influenced by the stage of HIV disease at baseline and also evidence on the optimal duration of TB preventive therapy is still lacking.</P>
<P>Potential limitations of the review</P>
<P>In this updated review, a comprehensive search strategy was used to identify all new studies and one author was contacted for clarification of reported findings. Methods to minimize systematic error were used in the extraction of data and assessment of methodological quality of included studies. While all trials seemed to be of good quality some key components, such as allocation concealment, were not reported in all the studies. Although the trial characteristics varied, there was no statistical heterogeneity for the primary outcomes assessed in this updated review. As non-tuberculous Mycobacteria also occur commonly among HIV-infected patients, studies that did not speciate positive cultures might erroneously have included non-tuberculous Mycobacteria as cases of TB. Furthermore, there were no studies that examined the combination of TB preventive therapy and ART. Finally, as most of the trials were conducted in developing countries, the results of this review are likely to be applicable to the situations where the burden of tuberculosis is high and preventive therapy is most needed.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-09 17:58:36 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Current guidelines and policy statements regarding the use of preventive therapy in HIV infected individuals who are TST positive (<LINK REF="REF-CDC-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">CDC 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>) are supported by the results of this review. However, in developing countries, especially in Africa, where the rates of both tuberculosis and HIV infection are high, logistical and financial barriers to wide-scale use of TB preventive therapy need to be critically examined. There is evidence to show that ART can be feasibly administered in resource-limited settings (<LINK REF="REF-Akileswaran-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akileswaran 2005</LINK>).Therefore, the experiences from ART scale-up may be beneficial in the scale-up of TB preventive therapy. Importantly, care should be taken to ensuring that programmes of TB preventive therapy do not divert resources from treating active tuberculosis or from offering ART to the large numbers of people who may need these treatments. In addition, poor adherence and drug resistant TB disease potentially associated with the use of long courses of isoniazid monotherapy should be considered although available evidence does not show a significant increase in the risk of INH resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Balcells-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Balcells 2006</LINK>). Policy makers should take all these factors into consideration when designing broad public health interventions in the area of TB control in people living with HIV.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2008-12-15 14:08:33 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher Akolo">
<P>Trials assessing the long-term effects of anti-TB chemoprophylaxis are needed to more adequately assess the duration of benefit in various settings. These trials should be large enough to assess overall mortality as an endpoint and should also assess the impact of preventive treatment on progression of HIV disease. Whether the level of immunocompromise in HIV positive individuals influences the efficacy of preventive therapy is still not known and this question warrants further study. With the current scale-up of ART services, trials that will evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of TB preventive therapy and ARTneed to be conducted particularly in developing countries and the cost-effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis drugs compared to highly active antiretroviral therapy for preventing active tuberculosis should also be evaluated.</P>
