<P>
<B>Review question</B>
</P>
<P>Scaling and polishing of the teeth may reduce deposits (plaque and calculus), as well as bleeding and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Over time a reduction in gingivitis (a milder form of gum disease) will reduce progression to periodontitis (a severe gum disease).</P>
<P>This review examines the evidence for the effects of routine scale and polish treatment. It has been carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group to assess the benefits or otherwise of routine scale and polish treatments for healthy adults; to establish whether different time intervals between treatments influence these; to assess if the treatment is more effective if given together with instruction on how best to maintain healthy gums, and to compare the effectiveness of the treatment when given either by a dentist or by a dental therapist or hygienist.</P>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Many dentists or hygienists provide regular scaling and polishing for most patients at regular intervals even if they are considered to be at low risk of developing gum disease. There is debate about the clinical effectiveness of scaling and polishing and what is the best time interval between treatments.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this review a 'routine scale and polish' is scaling and polishing of both the crown and root surfaces to remove deposits of (mainly) bacteria called plaque, and also hardened plaque known as calculus (tartar). Calculus is so hard it cannot be removed by toothbrushing alone and this along with plaque, other debris and staining on the teeth is removed by the scale and polish treatment. Scaling or removal of hardened deposits is done with specially designed dental instruments or ultrasonic scalers and polishing is done mechanically with special pastes.</P>
<P>In this review scaling above and below the gum level is included, however any surgical procedure on the gums, any chemical washing of the space between gum and tooth (pocket) and more intense (root planing) scraping of the root than simple scaling is excluded.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 15 July 2013.</P>
<P>Three<B> </B>trials with 836 participants were included in this review, ranging from 61 to 470 in each trial. Participants in two trials were adults aged 18 to 73, in the other trial young air force cadets.</P>
<P>One study included patients attending three general dental practices for check-up appointments. Only patients with calculus or bleeding on probing and pockets between teeth and gums less than 3.5 mm were included. One study included young adult male US Air Force cadets and the other patients attending a dental school hygiene clinic. All participants had varying degrees of gingivitis but no evidence of loss of the bone that the teeth are anchored in (alveolar bone) which is caused by periodontitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>The most pertinent result found was from one study which was based in general practice, the most appropriate setting. This study did not show either a benefit or harm for regular six or 12-month scale and polish treatments when compared to no scale and polish. However, the study on young air force cadets compared scale and polish treatments at different time intervals and did find some differences for gingivitis, plaque and calculus when three-month treatments were compared with annual treatments, favouring the three-month treatments. This study also looked at whether the treatment should include both scale and polish and oral hygiene instruction. There were reductions in gingivitis, plaque and calculus. No studies compared dentists with other oral health professionals.</P>
<P>Scaling is an invasive procedure and associated with a number of adverse effects including damaged to tooth surfaces and tooth sensitivity. This information was not captured or reported on by the included studies.</P>
<P>None of the studies included in this review reported on patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life or economic outcomes.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>Given the considerable resources involved in providing this treatments for adults in many countries it is disappointing that there is so little good quality, reliable research evidence available to inform clinical practice. The quality of the evidence was generally low, with one of the included studies being more appropriate than the others.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-10-10 10:40:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Many dentists or hygienists provide scaling and polishing for patients at regular intervals, even if those patients are considered to be at low risk of developing periodontal disease. There is debate over the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 'routine scaling and polishing' and the 'optimal' frequency at which it should be provided for healthy adults.</P>
<P>A 'routine scale and polish' treatment is defined as scaling or polishing or both of the crown and root surfaces of teeth to remove local irritational factors (plaque, calculus, debris and staining), that does not involve periodontal surgery or any form of adjunctive periodontal therapy such as the use of chemotherapeutic agents or root planing.</P>

<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-11-05 09:51:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The objectives were: 1) to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of routine scaling and polishing for periodontal health; 2) to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of providing routine scaling and polishing at different time intervals on periodontal health; 3) to compare the effects of routine scaling and polishing with or without oral hygiene instruction (OHI) on periodontal health; and 4) to compare the effects of routine scaling and polishing provided by a dentist or dental care professional (dental therapist or dental hygienist) on periodontal health.<B>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-11-05 09:52:20 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 15 July 2013), CENTRAL (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> 2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 15 July 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 15 July 2013). We searched the <I>meta</I>Register of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Register (<A HREF="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</A>) for ongoing and completed studies to July 2013. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.</P>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2013-11-05 09:52:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Randomised controlled trials of routine scale and polish treatments (excluding split-mouth trials) with and without OHI in healthy dentate adults, without severe periodontitis.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-11-06 12:21:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MDs) (standardised mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies. Study authors were contacted where possible and where deemed necessary for missing information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-11-06 12:21:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Three studies were included in this review with 836 participants included in the analyses. All three studies are assessed as at unclear risk of bias. The numerical results are only presented here for the primary outcome gingivitis. There were no useable data presented in the studies for the outcomes of attachment change and tooth loss. No studies reported any adverse effects.</P>
<P>- Objective 1: Scale and polish versus no scale and polish<BR/>Only one trial provided data for the comparison between scale and polish versus no scale and polish. This study was conducted in general practice and compared both six-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments with no treatment. This study showed no evidence to claim or refute benefit for scale and polish treatments for the outcomes of gingivitis, calculus and plaque. The MD for six-monthly scale and polish, for the percentage of index teeth with bleeding at 24 months was -2% (95% CI -10% to 6%; P value = 0.65), with 40% of the sites in the control group with bleeding. The MD for 12-monthly scale and polish was -1% (95% CI -9% to 7%; P value = 0.82). The body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.</P>
<P>- Objective 2: Scale and polish at different time intervals<BR/>Two studies, both at unclear risk of bias, compared routine scale and polish provided at different time intervals. When comparing six with 12 months there was insufficient evidence to determine a difference for gingivitis at 24 months SMD -0.08 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.10). There were some statistically significant differences in favour of scaling and polishing provided at more frequent intervals, in particular between three and 12 months for the outcome of gingivitis at 24 months, with OHI, MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.05; P value = 0.003) and without OHI MD -0.21 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.12; P value &lt; 0.001) (mean per patient measured on 0-3 scale), based on one study. There was some evidence of a reduction in calculus. This body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.</P>
<P>- Objective 3: Scale and polish with and without OHI<BR/>One study provided data for the comparison of scale and polish treatment with and without OHI. There was a reduction in gingivitis for the 12-month scale and polish treatment when assessed at 24 months MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.06) in favour of including OHI. There were also significant reductions in plaque for both three and 12-month scale and polish treatments when OHI was included. The body of evidence was once again assessed as of low quality.</P>
<P>- Objective 4: Scale and polish provided by a dentist compared with a dental care professional<BR/>No studies were found which compared the effects of routine scaling and polishing provided by a dentist or dental care professional (dental therapist or dental hygienist) on periodontal health.<BR/>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-17 14:25:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>'Periodontal (gum) disease' is a broad term that encompasses a cluster of diseases that result in inflammatory responses and chronic destruction of the tissues that surround and support the teeth, namely the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone (collectively referred to as the 'periodontium'). Dental plaque is the principal aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Plaque is necessary but is not sufficient for periodontal disease to occur. The host response, the modifying effect of various risk factors and the bacterial attack from dental plaque can account for a variety of disease patterns, both between different individuals and between different sites in the mouth within the same individual. Calcified plaque (calculus) does not have a major role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, although it does act as a 'retention web' for bacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Ismail-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ismail 1994</LINK>) and reduces the effectiveness of personal oral hygiene control.</P>
<P>Plaque-induced periodontal disease has traditionally been divided into two general categories: gingivitis and periodontitis. Gingivitis is a reversible disease and can be defined as the presence of gingival inflammation (where the gum can appear reddened and swollen and may bleed easily) without loss of connective tissue attachment. Gingivitis is a precursor to periodontitis in some<I> </I>individuals - that is, gingivitis does not inevitably progress to periodontitis. Periodontitis can be defined as the presence of gingival inflammation at sites where there has been a pathological loss of attachment (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>). This loss of attachment contributes to pocket formation and the denuded cementum may become contaminated by microorganisms and their products (<LINK REF="REF-Jenkins-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jenkins 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rate of progression of periodontitis is neither predictable nor steady. The disease is considered to progress in relatively short episodes of rapid tissue destruction, sometimes followed by some repair, and mostly by prolonged periods of quiescence (<LINK REF="REF-Pilot-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilot 1997</LINK>). Some diseased sites may progress by as much as three mm per year (<LINK REF="REF-Haffajee-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haffajee 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindhe-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhe 1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>Epidemiological studies of periodontal diseases are difficult to interpret due to the diversity of measures used to describe and quantify disease and the absence of uniform definition and classification. This is reflected in the World Health Organization Global Data Bank estimates (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>) which state that the prevalence of moderate severity disease ranges from 2% to 67% and that advanced disease occurs in 1% to 79% of the population. Gingivitis is highly prevalent in most populations and at most ages (<LINK REF="REF-Albandar-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Albandar 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Corbet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Corbet 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 1986</LINK>) with global values ranging from 50% to 90%. In the UK, it was reported in the 1998 Adult Dental Health Survey (<LINK REF="REF-Kelly-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kelly 2000</LINK>) that 54% of dentate adults had some periodontal pocketing of 4 mm or more and 5% had deep pocketing (of 6 mm or more); 43% had some loss of attachment of 4 mm or more and 8% had loss of attachment of 6 mm or more. The prevalence of pocketing and loss of attachment increased with age. For example, the proportion of dentate adults with some loss of attachment increased from 14% among those aged 16 to 24 years to 85% of those aged 65 and over.</P>
<P>The goals of periodontal therapy have been defined in many different ways. Some authors have defined the ultimate aim of periodontal treatment as being to control disease progression or achieve a rate of progression which is compatible with a functional dentition for the lifetime of the individual (<LINK REF="REF-Pilot-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pilot 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sheiham-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheiham 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wennstrom-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wennstrom 1990</LINK>). Others have defined the key goals as improving periodontal health and thereby satisfying a patient's aesthetic and functional needs or demands. Currently accepted clinical signs of a healthy periodontium include the absence of inflammatory signs of disease such as redness, swelling, suppuration, and bleeding on probing; maintenance of a functional periodontal attachment level; minimal or no recession in the absence of interproximal bone loss; and, where present, functional dental implants (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>A fundamental component of the preventive management of periodontal disease is the control of dental plaque by the patient. Hence patient education and training in personal oral hygiene should form an integral part of any treatment plan for a patient with periodontal disease. Conventional periodontal therapy also includes non-surgical treatment as well as a variety of surgical approaches (<LINK REF="REF-Needleman-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needleman 2002</LINK>). The precise choice of intervention may be influenced by the clinical severity of the disease, with surgery generally reserved for cases of advanced disease to allow for adequate access to, and full debridement of, areas with deep pocketing.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-05 15:36:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scaling and polishing of the teeth by a dentist or a dental care professional (DCP) (dental therapist or dental hygienist) ) is a non-surgical intervention that is intended to supplement (and is not a substitute for) the patient's home-care plaque control. This is frequently provided as part of the dental recall appointment (<LINK REF="REF-Beirne-2005a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirne 2005a</LINK>). Scaling is the removal of plaque, mineralised plaque deposits (also referred to as calculus or tartar), debris and staining from the crown and root surfaces of the teeth. Specially designed sharp dental instruments ('hand scalers') or ultrasonic scalers can be used to perform the scaling procedure. Polishing is the mechanical removal of any residual extrinsic stains and deposits, typically undertaken by using a rubber cup or bristle brush loaded with a prophylaxis paste. Scaling and polishing can be used with or without a variety of adjuncts such as antimicrobial agents (either topical or systemic), gingival crevice irrigation and root planing. Root planing is a procedure for smoothening the root surface of a tooth that involves the "removal of cementum or surface dentin that is rough or impregnated with calculus, toxins or microorganisms" (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstein-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstein 1992</LINK>). The rationale for root planing is to allow the gingival tissue to heal close to the root, shrinking the tissue and reducing the depth of the pocket that has formed (<LINK REF="REF-Bonito-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bonito 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Within the confines of this Cochrane review a 'routine scale and polish' is defined as scaling or polishing or both of the crown and root surfaces of teeth to remove local irritational factors (plaque, calculus, debris and staining), that does not involve periodontal surgery or any form of adjunctive periodontal therapy such as the use of chemotherapeutic agents or root planing. The definition includes both supragingival and subgingival scaling. The term 'routine' is simply used to indicate that the scale and polish is "a regular course or procedure" (<LINK REF="REF-Oxford-Dict-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oxford Dict 1995</LINK>) i.e.<I> </I>that the scale and polish is an intervention that is intended to be provided at 'regular intervals' to patients (without specifying any one particular frequency e.g<I>. </I>every month, every six months, every nine months, every 12 months, etc. at which patients may receive this intervention).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-05 10:15:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Scaling and polishing of the teeth is a commonly provided intervention in general dental practice. In the United Kingdom approximately 50% of all adult courses of treatment provided under the National Health Service (NHS) (General Dental Services) regulations "consist of the patient having nothing more than an examination<I> </I>(and a)<I> </I>scale and polish" (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>). In 1999/2000, approximately 13 million scale and polishes were provided for NHS patients in England at a gross cost to the NHS of GBP 122 million (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>). In a survey of general dental practitioners preventive recommendations in western New York State, 86% of respondents stated that they would recommend scaling and polishing every six months for 'low risk' patients of all ages (a 'low risk' patient was defined as a patient having "adequate brushing and flossing habits" and "no history of periodontal disease") (<LINK REF="REF-Frame-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frame 2000</LINK>). There has been debate over the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness associated with the routine scaling and polishing of teeth and the frequency with which it should be provided for patients. This debate is complicated by the fact that a 'routine scale and polish' is not a precisely defined intervention in periodontal disease management and there is no universally accepted definition of the term. In the United States the term 'oral prophylaxis' is most often used and has been defined as "the removal of plaque, calculus and stain from exposed and unexposed surfaces of the teeth by scaling and polishing as a preventive measure for the control of local irritational factors" (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 1992</LINK>). The role and contribution of DCPs (dental hygienists and dental therapists) in maintaining periodontal health has increased in recent years. Any differences in treatment outcome following intervention by a dentist or DCP are not well understood and require investigation. This is an update of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Beirne-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirne 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Beirne-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beirne 2007</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-05 10:26:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This was conducted using the recommended approach for assessing the risk of bias in studies included in Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We used the two-part tool, addressing six specific domains (namely sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other bias). Each domain included one specific entry in a 'Risk of bias' table. Within each study, the first part of the tool involved describing what was reported to have happened in the study. The second part of the tool involved assigning a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry. This was achieved by answering a pre-specified question about the adequacy of the study in relation to the entry, such that a judgement of 'low' indicated low risk of bias, 'high' indicated high risk of bias, and 'unclear' indicated unclear or unknown risk of bias.</P>
<P>All of the domains of sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias were each addressed in the tool by a single entry for each study. It is not possible to blind patients to which intervention they are receiving. Scale and polish visits can be considered to be a 'complex intervention' as the delivery of the clinical care may have impact on oral hygiene behaviour in between scale and polish visits leading to different clinical outcomes. Blinding of participants was not therefore considered as a risk of bias domain, only blinding of outcome assessor. Where the patients self assessed the outcomes to the trial this was noted.</P>
<P>The risk of bias assessments were undertaken independently and in duplicate by two review authors as part of the data extraction process.</P>
<P>After taking into account the additional information provided by the authors of the trials, studies were grouped into the following categories.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results) for all key domains.</LI>
<LI>Unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that raises some doubt about the results) if one or more key domains were assessed as unclear.</LI>

<P>In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1985</LINK>, the control group received a 'periodontal prophylaxis' every six months (no further details were given of the precise nature of the prophylaxis, however, it was assumed to fall within the definition of 'routine scale and polish' used in this review). In the experimental group, periodontal prophylaxes were administered according to a variable schedule, based on the outcome of differential dark-field microscopy (DDFM) tests. For participants with negative DDFM tests, recall intervals were gradually extended from one to two, to three, to six, to 12, to 24 months (s<I>ee</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for further details of the DDFM test and subsequent assignment of recall intervals on the basis of the test).

<P>As can be seen from the descriptions provided above and from the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table there was considerable heterogeneity in the characteristics of the interventions provided in different studies. The OHI components also varied, with some studies (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK>) giving toothbrushing instruction only, where the participants in those groups who received OHI were instructed to use the Bass technique for the lingual surface of the mandibular molars but the modified Roll technique for all other areas. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1985</LINK>) the intervention was described as a "periodontal prophylaxis" and there was no indication given regarding the delivery or otherwise of OHI to the participants. In <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK> the participants were allocated a 15-20 minute appointment for oral hygiene advice plus intervention, however additional time was permitted as required. In <LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK> the duration of the scale and polish given to comparison groups varied from 30 to 50 minutes, with or without an additional 10 minutes of oral hygiene instruction.

<P>In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK>) there were five comparison groups (groups 1, 2, 3, 4A and 4B) (<I>see</I> <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for full details of the interventions provided). For Comparison 3 we compared groups 2, 3 and 4A with each other (where oral hygiene instruction (OHI) was provided alongside the scale and polish), and compared groups 4B and 1 with each other (where no OHI was provided). We did not make comparisons between groups that did and did not receive OHI alongside the scale and polish in Comparison 3.<BR/>For Comparison 4 we compared group 4A (scale and polish with OHI at three-month intervals) with group 4B (scale and polish without OHI at three-month intervals) and group 2 (scale and polish with OHI at 12-month intervals) with group 1 (scale and polish without OHI at 12-month intervals). In this study, group 2 received one scale and polish treatment per year given in two 30-minute appointments, five to 11 days apart. Similarly, group 3 received two scale and polish treatments per year, the first of which was provided over two visits, five to 11 days apart. In our comparisons and analyses, groups 2 and 3 have been described as '12-month interval' and 'six-month interval' groups respectively and no distinction has been drawn between the 'two-visit' and 'one-visit' scale and polish treatments.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1985</LINK> no standard deviations for the data were given in the paper. In order to use the data we made the assumption that the standard deviations would be similar to those from the <LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1986</LINK>. To be conservative we assumed a common standard deviation for the test and control groups based on the control group standard deviation for the <LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1986</LINK> study that was larger than that for the test. As no statistically significance differences were found, an analysis assuming larger standard deviations than this would not affect the results and conclusions for this study.</P>

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>) provided data for the comparison between scale and polish versus no scale and polish. The patient population and setting for <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK> were most appropriate to answer the questions posed by this review, and this study was assessed as at unclear risk of bias. <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK> provides a comparison between six-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments with no treatment, with a follow-up of 24 months. This study was conducted in general dental practice and included patients attending for check-up appointments who had no pockets greater than 3.5 mm. After 24 months of follow-up there were no clinically important differences between scale and polish treatments and no treatment for the outcomes of gingivitis, calculus and plaque. This body of evidence (a single study, at unclear risk of bias), was considered to be of low quality and should be interpreted with caution.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Objective 2: Routine scale and polish at different time intervals on periodontal health (based on a test for periodontal disease)</HEADING>
<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1985</LINK>) provided data for the comparison between scale and polish at a fixed interval versus scale and polish in response to the signs or symptoms or both of periodontal disease. This study compared scale and polish provided at six-monthly intervals with scale and polish provided in response to bacterial assessments. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment (scale and polish in response to bacterial assessments) and control (six-monthly scale and polish) groups at any time point over the course of this three-year trial. Participants in the treatment group were initially recalled more frequently than those in the control group, however, by the end of the trial, recall intervals for scaling and polishing were considerably extended for many participants in the treatment group and 11 participants had not received a scale and polish by the end of the study. Despite this extension of recall interval, the periodontal health of participants in the test group (as measured using the outcomes gingivitis, plaque and pocket depth) was not adversely affected compared to the control group. However, neither treatment nor control regimen was successful in preventing gingivitis and mean gingival index scores in control and test groups generally increased at each time point over the course of the trial.</P>
<P>Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK>) provided data for the comparison between scale and polish at a fixed interval versus scale and polish at a different fixed interval. The studies were conducted in two distinct populations -regular attenders in general practice (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>) and young adult males aged 17 to 22 years (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK>). As already mentioned the patient population and setting for <LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK> were most appropriate to answer some of the questions posed by this review. There were consistent results in <LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK> towards improved outcomes (lower levels of plaque, calculus and gingivitis) in more frequent interval groups compared with less frequent interval groups. However, the differences generally only reached statistical significance when comparisons were made between the most frequent interval groups (scale and polish delivered at three or four-monthly intervals) with the least frequent interval groups (scale and polish delivered at 12-monthly intervals). We have reported the comparison between six-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish intervals combined with oral hygiene instruction (<LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) in the summary of findings table.

<P>One of the included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jones-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jones 2011</LINK>) was more appropriate than the others for answering many of the questions posed by this review. This study was conducted on adults attending their dentist in general dental practice for check-ups. More trials in a primary care setting including a more representative group of participants with higher levels of disease would enhance the evidence base for answering the questions posed by this review. The other two older studies were not conducted in primary care, and included patients who were either young, or who had had or were referred for treatment for periodontal disease. It is difficult to envisage how the experimental intervention in <LINK REF="STD-Listgarten-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Listgarten 1985</LINK> could reasonably be used in general practice and its applicability in different patient populations with varying levels of risk for destructive periodontitis is uncertain.</P>
<P>Three of the four objectives were addressed by at least one included trial, however there were no trials addressing the fourth objective comparing scale and polish provided by a dentist with a professional complementary to dentistry.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes reported</HEADING>
<P>The outcomes used in different studies were measured using different indices. The three included studies reported: three different gingivitis indices, two different calculus indices, three different plaque indices and probing depth was only reported in one study. Many primary and secondary outcomes were not reported in any of the three studies: tooth loss, attachment change, adverse events and economic cost factors. It is important that trials measure the harms as well as the benefits of interventions. Scaling is an invasive procedure and has been associated with a number of adverse effects, including damaged enamel surfaces by repeated scaling, tooth sensitivity and gingival recession (<LINK REF="REF-Brothwell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brothwell 1998</LINK>). It is also recognised that subgingival scaling of shallow pockets can cause permanent loss of periodontal attachment (<LINK REF="REF-Brothwell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brothwell 1998</LINK>). The latter would have been captured in 'attachment change' data but these were not reported in any of the trials included in this review. It would undoubtedly be advisable for future randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of scaling and polishing to report on adverse events to allow for a more balanced appraisal of benefits and harms.</P>
<P>It is increasingly recognised that the signs and symptoms of periodontal disease can impact on patients' oral health related quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Needleman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needleman 2004</LINK>). Therefore, interventions designed to ameliorate these signs and symptoms might be expected to have a positive impact on a patient's quality of life. However, studies of the effects of periodontal therapy have only rarely used patient-centred outcome measures (<LINK REF="REF-Elley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elley 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Needleman-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Needleman 2004</LINK>) and none of the trials included in this review reported such outcomes. We are therefore unable to make any statements regarding the impact of routine scaling and polishing (as defined in this review) on patients' quality of life.</P>
<P>Similarly, although economic cost outcomes (such as time foregone to attend for appointments and provider costs) are relevant to the debate regarding the merits and demerits of routine scaling and polishing, such outcomes were not reported in any trials included in this review.</P>
<P>Again, it would be advisable for future trials to include quality of life and economic cost outcomes to allow for a full evaluation of the beneficial and harmful effects of this intervention.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-05 13:39:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Given the considerable resources involved in providing routine scale and polish treatments for adults in many countries (<LINK REF="REF-DoH-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">DoH 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Frame-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frame 2000</LINK>), it is disappointing that there is a paucity of good quality, reliable research evidence to inform clinical practice. Only three studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, all judged to be at unclear risk of bias. It is impossible to blind patients to the timing of scale and polish treatments, and as having a scale and polish treatment may influence personal oral hygiene behaviour, participant blinding was not included in the risk of bias assessment. The quality of the body of evidence available for each outcome (gingivitis, calculus and plaque) for three of the four objectives of this review was found to be low (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>; <LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>).

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-05 13:42:05 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>A sensitive search strategy was used for this review. Every effort was made to identify all relevant studies. No studies were excluded due to language restrictions.</P>
<P>Data collection and analysis were done by two review authors independently, and any disagreement between review authors was resolved by discussion to minimise/exclude bias during the review process.</P>
<P>It is possible not all relevant studies have been identified for inclusion in this review due to grey literature bias and the publication of studies in non-indexed journals. In addition, post-hoc changes to a protocol may potentially bias the results of a review. For this updated review we made some important alternations to the selection criteria specified in the original protocol. Firstly, we excluded split-mouth studies as this design does not reflect the manner in which routine scaling and polishing is provided in practice. Secondly, we excluded trials where participants were described as having severe periodontal disease (e.g. alveolar bone loss involving most teeth or individuals requiring referral for specialist periodontal treatment). We also excluded trials where participants had undergone specialist periodontal treatment in the six months preceding the trial and who were in the 'maintenance phase.' These exclusions were made because best clinical practice would suggest that these categories of patients should receive more advanced periodontal treatment than the 'routine scale and polish' as defined in this review. Finally, we also excluded trials where only a single scale and polish treatment was provided as, once again, this does not reflect the manner in which 'routine scaling and polishing' is provided in practice. As specified in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK> section of our review, a 'routine scale and polish' is an intervention that is intended to be provided at regular intervals to patients, and not as a 'stand alone' intervention provided at a single point in time.</P>
<P>We consider that these adjustments to the selection criteria have resulted in a review that will ultimately be more useful to practitioners who are providing 'routine scale and polish treatments' and patients who are receiving this intervention.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-05 13:45:58 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We did not find any other reviews that addressed the specific objectives of this Cochrane review. Reviews of oral health promotion and dental health education have demonstrated that, in general, oral hygiene instruction can induce limited behaviour change in patients and reduce plaque levels in the short term, but there is no lasting effect (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kay-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kay 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sprod-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sprod 1996</LINK>). In our review only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Lightner-1971" TYPE="STUDY">Lightner 1971</LINK>) evaluated the effects of providing oral hygiene instruction in conjunction with scale and polish treatments on plaque levels. The provision of oral hygiene instruction with three-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments was associated with small but statistically significant reductions in plaque at 24 and 48 months when compared with three-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments without oral hygiene instruction.</P>

<P>There is a need for well conducted trials in this area which include a sufficient number of patients to detect a true difference, if any, and that are of sufficient duration (five years or more). Given that scaling and polishing is a commonly provided intervention in general dental practice, we would recommend that additional trials should be conducted in primary care settings and considered as a complex intervention with oral hygiene instruction. Outcomes should include clinical measures (such as those reported in the trials included in this review) and tooth loss, patient-centred factors and economic factors. As one of the principal known aetiological agents (plaque) is the same for gingivitis and periodontitis, long-term studies may also include caries outcomes. In addition, studies should be carried out to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of routine scaling and polishing provided by different dental personnel. We would also recommend that due attention be given in future studies to what levels of improvement in various outcomes should be considered clinically significant. Such information is needed to help guide changes in actual dental practice. It is also recommended that all trials should be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (<A HREF="http://www.consort-statement.org/">www.consort-statement.org/</A>).</P>

<P>Clinical examination (every 6 months). Prophylaxes administered according to a variable schedule, based on the outcome of differential dark-field microscopy (DDFM) tests. For negative DDFM tests (less than 15% spirochetes or motile rods, or less than 20% spirochetes plus motile rods) recall intervals were gradually increased from 1 to 2, to 3, to 6, to 12, to 24 months. 1 month after the baseline examination, the test was negative the recall interval was extended to 2 months and no prophylaxis was given. If at that time the test was still negative the interval was increased to 3 months, and so on. By the time a 12-month interval was assigned, a subject may already have gone 12 months without a prophylaxis. If at a given recall (e.g. 3 months) a test was positive, a prophylaxis was given and the patient kept on the same recall interval (in this case, 3 months). If 3 months later the test was still positive, the prophylaxis was repeated and the patients recall interval reduced to the next lower interval, in this case 2 months. No patients were assigned recall intervals of less than 1 month. (Note: the latter description of the DDFM test was given in an earlier paper by the authors (Listgarten 1982 (for full reference <I>see</I> 'Additional references')). In the experimental group, the authors state that 25 out of 30 subjects achieved recall intervals of 12 to 24 months within the 3-year experimental period. 11 subjects in the experimental group reached the end of the study without receiving a single prophylaxis over the 3-year duration of the trial.

Not included were pregnant women, patients with internal diseases, with prosthetic restorations and untreated caries. 15 test persons took part in 3 different programmes, over a period of 3 months that had the following objectives: oral hygiene instructions and motivation (dental nurse) as well as professional tooth cleaning (dentist). 1 group made up of 10 test persons (group IV) served as the control group. The programme of group III with 1 motivation session without teeth cleaning training was designed to check which results the frequent examination with an oral hygiene pass/check book produces.

Bleeding was detected by running a blunt-ended (PCP-10) probe gently around the gingival margin of the tooth at a 60°<BR/>angle, in contact with the sulculur epithelium. After approximately 30 seconds, any bleeding elicited was<BR/>recorded according to a dichotomous scale for each tooth: present/not present</P>
