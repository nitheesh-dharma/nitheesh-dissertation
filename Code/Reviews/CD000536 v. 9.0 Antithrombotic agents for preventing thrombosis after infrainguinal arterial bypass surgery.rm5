<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2011-05-06 10:39:23 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lower limb atherosclerosis can lead to blocked blood vessels causing pain on walking (intermittent claudication) or, if more severe, pain at rest, ulceration and gangrene (critical limb ischaemia).</P>
<P>Surgery to bypass the blockage uses either a piece of vein from another part of the person&#8217;s body or a synthetic graft. The bypass may help improve blood supply to the leg but the graft can also become blocked, even in the first year. To help prevent this, people are given aspirin (an antiplatelet drug) or a vitamin K antagonist (anti-blood clotting or antithrombotic drug), or both, to try to stop loss of blood flow through the graft (patency). The review of trials found that patients undergoing venous grafts were more likely to benefit from treatment with vitamin K antagonists than platelet inhibitors. Patients receiving an artificial graft may benefit from platelet inhibitors (aspirin). However, the evidence is not conclusive. Although a total of 14 randomised, controlled trials involving 4970 patients were included in the review, trials with larger patient numbers are needed. This is because there was considerable variation between the included trials in whether patients received both types of drugs, anticoagulation levels and how they were measured, and the indications for surgery, intermittent claudication or critical limb ischaemia.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-03 05:54:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is frequently treated by either an infrainguinal autologous (using the patient's own veins) or synthetic graft bypass. The rate of occlusion of the graft after one year is between 12% and 60%. To prevent occlusion, patients are treated with an antiplatelet or antithrombotic drug, or a combination of both. Little is known about which drug is optimal to prevent infrainguinal graft occlusion. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003.</P>

<P>A total of 14 trials were included in this review; 4970 patient results were analysed. Four trials evaluating vitamin K antagonists (VKA) versus no VKA suggested that oral anticoagulation may favour autologous venous, but not artificial, graft patency as well as limb salvage and survival. Two other studies comparing VKA with aspirin (ASA) or aspirin and dipyridamole provided evidence to support a positive effect of VKA on the patency of venous but not artificial grafts. Three trials comparing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to unfractionated heparin (UFH) failed to demonstrate a significant difference on patency. One trial comparing LMWH with placebo found no significant improvement in graft patency over the first postoperative year in a population receiving aspirin. One trial showed an advantage for LMWH versus aspirin and dipyridamol at one year for patients undergoing limb salvage procedures. Perioperative administration of ancrod showed no greater benefit when compared to unfractionated heparin. Dextran 70 showed similar graft patency rates to LMWH but a significantly higher proportion of patients developed heart failure with dextran.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-05-03 12:57:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-05-03 12:57:35 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lower limb atherosclerosis may manifest as pain on walking (intermittent claudication) or, if more severe, pain at rest, ulceration and gangrene (critical limb ischaemia). Intermittent claudication (IC) corresponds to Fontaine's classification (<LINK REF="REF-Fontaine-1954" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fontaine 1954</LINK>) stage II and critical limb ischaemia (CLI) refers to stages III and IV. In selected patients, treatment includes placement of a femoropopliteal or femorodistal bypass graft to divert blood past the occluded arterial segment, thereby improving blood perfusion of the limb, relieving the symptoms of claudication or rest pain, and avoiding amputation because of ulceration and gangrene (limb salvage). Several different materials may be used for bypass grafting. These include a section of the patient's own vein (autologous vein graft), an artificial graft material such as dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), treated human umbilical vein (taken from an umbilical cord), or a combination of these materials. Graft patency is dependent on many factors including the indication for surgery (IC or CLI), quality of arterial inflow and outflow, type of graft used (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2010</LINK>), operative technique, progression of atherosclerosis in the proximal or distal arteries, and graft stenosis due to remodelling and intimal hyperplasia (IH) (a narrowing of the graft due to excessive formation of cells in the inner lining).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-05-03 06:41:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is evidence that patients with lower limb atherosclerosis frequently have a prothrombotic tendency (<LINK REF="STD-Swedenborg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swedenborg 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woodburn-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woodburn 1996</LINK>). The body's physiological stress response to surgery adds further to this.<B> </B>Additionally, platelets are implicated in the initial steps of IH development (<LINK REF="REF-Davies-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Davies 1994</LINK>). Therefore, a key question is whether postoperative treatment following infrainguinal bypass grafting should include long or short-term antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants in order to prevent graft occlusion (<LINK REF="REF-Kretschmer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kretschmer 1999</LINK>) and, if so, whether the same treatment is optimal for all kinds of grafts and patients. Several reviews have been published (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Girolami-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Girolami 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kraiss-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kraiss 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindblad-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindblad 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tangelder-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tangelder 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Watson-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Watson 1999</LINK>) trying to address these questions. A separate Cochrane review has been published on antiplatelet treatment in patients with symptomatic PAD undergoing infrainguinal bypass (<LINK REF="REF-Cochrane-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cochrane 2008</LINK>); this present review will focus on the role of anticoagulants.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2011-05-03 06:51:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The overall one year incidence of graft failure (graft occlusion) for above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafts is 12% to 18% when a vein is used (<LINK REF="REF-Achermann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achermann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>) and 20% to 25%% when PTFE is used (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>). These figures rise to approximately 30% and 40%, respectively, for below-knee popliteal grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1991</LINK>); 30% and 60% for femorotibial bypass grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Consensus-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Consensus 1991</LINK>). Approximately 5% to 25% will fail within one month of the procedure (in the acute phase) depending on the type of graft material used; the highest failure rates are for prosthetic grafts to the tibial arteries (<LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1996</LINK>). Almost 10% of early failures are due to the consequences of technical error (<LINK REF="REF-Alback-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alback 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stept-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stept 1987</LINK>) or to thrombogenic (clot forming) graft material (<LINK REF="REF-Hanson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanson 1987</LINK>). The remaining 5% to 10% are considered as unexpected early graft failures and might be caused by an increased prothrombotic state. Eighty per cent of all graft failures will occur within the first two postoperative years, due to development of graft stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-Bandyk-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandyk 1987</LINK>). Stenosis continues to develop at a rate of approximately 5% to 7% per year causing late vein graft failure (<LINK REF="REF-Schoder-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schoder 2001</LINK>). The Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) for the management of peripheral arterial disease (<LINK REF="REF-Norgren-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norgren 2007</LINK>) states a five-year patency rate of infrainguinal above-knee bypass grafts of 74% to 76% for vein and 39% to 52% for PTFE grafts. If blood flow in the failed graft cannot be restored and further bypass surgery is not possible, then limb perfusion may, in some cases, be so poor that the limb cannot remain viable and amputation is required. Successful prevention of graft failure, and the need for surgical re-intervention, is of major clinical and economic importance (<LINK REF="REF-Robinson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robinson 1997</LINK>).</P>

</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2011-05-03 06:57:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>To determine the efficacy of pharmacotherapy using anticoagulant drugs in patients with lower limb atherosclerosis (Intermittent claudication (IC) and critical limb ischaemia (CLI)) undergoing femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass grafting. Outcomes include the overall success of therapy (graft patency and limb salvage rates) and complications of treatment. The null hypothesis tested is that antithrombotic therapy does not improve graft patency and limb salvage rates after femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass surgery for lower limb atherosclerosis.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Primary patency rate</HEADING>
<P>Primary patency rates were analysed at three, six, 12, 24 months, and five years postoperatively comparing anticoagulant with no anticoagulant treatment for all graft types. There was a statistically non-significant positive trend in favour of anticoagulant treatment on primary patency: odds ratio (OR) 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.40) at three months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>); OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.03) at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>); OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.99) at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>), OR 0.76 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.05) at 24 months (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>) and OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.07) at five years (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>
<P>When venous grafts were analysed separately in patients treated with VKA versus control patients, a more positive but non-significant effect for venous grafts was shown: OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.42) at three months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>); OR 0.40 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.95) at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>); OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.14) at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>); OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.55 to 1.17) at 24 months (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>); and OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.40) at five years (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>). There was considerable heterogeneity between the trials as will be discussed later and the results were heavily weighted by the (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>) study; but the effect measures did not vary significantly when a random-effects method was used (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.81). In the (<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>) study warfarin therapy was withdrawn in most patients with a vein bypass when the data monitoring board found that there was no benefit on patency for vein bypass patients but a probable increase in morbidity.</P>
<P>In contrast, the effect in artificial conduits at the early time points was less pronounced: OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.13 to 5.95) at three months (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>); OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.20 to 3.82) at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-008.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.2</LINK>). After 12 months and at later time points the antithrombotic effect seemed to be stronger in preventing bypass failure, with statistical significance after five years: OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.13; fixed) at 12 months; OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.29; fixed) at 24 months; and OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.73) at five years.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Limb salvage</HEADING>
<P>The effect of VKAs on limb salvage was calculated for 139 patients in the treatment group and 129 controls. It should be noted that for seven patients with early occlusion in each group of the <LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK> study no follow-up data were provided. There was a tendency for coumarins to reduce limb loss during the observation time: OR 0.27 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.72) at three months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>); OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.76) at six months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>); OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.11) at 12 months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>); OR 0.50 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.96) at 24 months (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>); and OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.69) at five years (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). There was considerable heterogeneity (81%) in <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>, which may have been due to there being a higher proportion of patients with critical or severe ischaemia in the <LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK> trial.</P>

<P>Analysis for assisted primary patency, secondary patency, site of distal anastomosis, and bleeding complications in the different patient groups could not be performed due to inaccessible raw data.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 10:59:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Differences in patency between venous and artificial grafts have been apparent for many years, with artificial grafts having a higher rate of occlusion than their venous counterparts (<LINK REF="REF-Abbott-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abbott 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Achermann-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Achermann 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parsons-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parsons 1996</LINK>). This review demonstrates that antithrombotic drug treatments also vary in their effects on patency depending on the type of graft used. The initial pooled analyses (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) would suggest that all patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery might benefit from VKA in terms of patency rates, limb salvage and survival at three, six, 12 and 24 months regardless of graft type (although the effect does not reach statistical significance for graft occlusion or survival). However, since graft type has a major influence on patency the effects of antithrombotic treatments on venous and artificial grafts must be considered separately.</P>
<P>For venous grafts, meta-analysis suggests that VKA may have a positive effect on patency compared to no VKA (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>), however at no point did this result reach statistical significance. In fact of the four included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarac 1998</LINK>) only (<LINK REF="STD-Kretschmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmer 1992</LINK>) found a statistically significant result in favour of VKA, at 12 and 24 months and at five years. The remaining trials failed to reach statistical significance at any point and the results were heavily weighted by the <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> trial. The <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> trial appeared to favour no VKA but this result again failed to reach statistical significance; the trialists concluded that there was no difference in the patency of in venous grafts between patients receiving VKA and no VKA. In this study warfarin therapy was withdrawn in most patients with a vein bypass when the data monitoring board found that there was no benefit on patency for vein bypass patients but a probable increase in morbidity. Similar trends were seen for limb loss, limb salvage and death in patients with venous bypasses receiving VKA. It is worth noting that there was considerable heterogeneity between the included trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Sarac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarac 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> all patients received aspirin, but not in <LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK> or <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmer 1992</LINK>. In addition anticoagulation levels were variable and measured differently, and indications for surgery (intermittent clauducation versus critical limb ischaemia) varied between trials.</P>
<P>A further meta-analysis demonstrated that VKA has a positive effect on patency compared to ASA and DIP for up to 24 months in patients receiving venous grafts (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76) (<LINK REF="CMP-012.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 12.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>For artificial grafts only two trials compared VKA to no VKA (<LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK>) and the meta-analysis was heavily weighted by the <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> trial. The data showed no significant difference in patency at three, six,12 or 24 months. There was however an apparent improvement in patency with VKA at five years (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.73) (<LINK REF="CMP-008.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.5</LINK>). In the <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> trial, patency rates varied between 6 mm and 8 mm bypass subgroups and there was a significant difference in patency in the 6 mm group, 71.4% in the warfarin plus aspirin group compared with 57.9% in the aspirin group. No significant differences in limb loss or death were identified.</P>
<P>Comparison of VKA to ASA and DIP in artificial grafts showed a significant beneficial effect on patency with ASA and DIP at six, 12 and 24 months (<LINK REF="CMP-013.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.1</LINK> to <LINK REF="CMP-013.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 13.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Comparing rates of bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation was generally difficult due to differences in reporting. However, VKA was seen to be associated with a higher rate of bleeding complications compared to both no VKA and aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-BOA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">BOA 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kretschmer-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Kretschmer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sarac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarac 1998</LINK>). Both <LINK REF="STD-Arfvidsson-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Arfvidsson 1990</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-BOA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">BOA 2000</LINK> estimated a major bleeding complication rate of approximately 4% to 5%; this compares to a rate of 2.5% with aspirin in <LINK REF="STD-BOA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">BOA 2000</LINK>. The rate of wound haematoma also appears significantly increased with VKA compared with aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-Sarac-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Sarac 1998</LINK>). Inter-study differences in the therapeutic ranges of anticoagulation clearly have implications on the rate of haemorrhagic complications.<BR/>
<BR/>Generally, it should be noted that comparison between the different studies was hampered by the fact that the target international normalised ratio (INR) differed between trials; the (<LINK REF="STD-BOA-2000" TYPE="STUDY">BOA 2000</LINK>) trialists aimed at 3.0 to 4.5 whereas the investigators of the <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2002</LINK> trial aimed at a value of 1.4 to 2.8. In other studies, a Quick value was used instead of the INR, making direct comparison almost impossible.</P>
<P>The effect of LMWH and UFH on early patency was evaluated in three trials that included a total of 509 patients. Results were largely inconclusive with only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Samama-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Samama 1994</LINK>) showing a positive effect for LMWH above UFH when comparing graft occlusion at day 10 and day 30. Neither <LINK REF="STD-Norgren-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Norgren 2004</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Swedenborg-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Swedenborg 1996</LINK> showed any significant difference. Additionally a per protocol analysis of the <LINK REF="STD-Samama-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Samama 1994</LINK> data failed to demonstrate significance. Pooled intention-to-treat data at day 30 did show a marginally positive effect for LMWH over UFH but a much larger cohort of patients receiving venous and artificial bypasses would have to be evaluated for reliable comparison in the future.</P>
<P>One trial comparing LMWH versus ASA and DIP (<LINK REF="STD-Edmondson-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Edmondson 1994</LINK>) found improved graft patency for the LMWH group at six and 12 months but this advantage was only in patients undergoing surgery for limb salvage and not for claudication. Of note, only a quarter of the patients in the study had vein grafts. A larger study is required both to confirm this result and to allow for subgroup analysis comparing graft type.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:02:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for VKA in venous bypasses is weak and at times inconsistent. VKA does appear to be more favourable than antiplatelet therapy in terms of graft patency but there may be an increase in bleeding complications. The evidence for antiplatelet drugs in artificial bypasses is much more consistent and reliable. In order to support these findings and to rule out any divergencies, further large trials with homogeneous, precisely reported patient characteristics of the study participants and study designs are needed. It should be mentioned that extracting data from the included trials was difficult as most publications did not provide raw data, which is ideally needed for an appropriate analysis. Contacting the authors was usually not very successful, either because raw data were no longer available or authors did not reply. Therefore, the numbers of patients and events had to be calculated from the survival curves.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2011-05-03 11:09:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, our findings show a tendency towards agreement between the different trials, which is also biologically plausible. Venous and prosthetic grafts appear to have varying mechanisms of failure. Venous grafts, once they have been incorporated into the high pressure system in the human leg, lose their endothelial layer within days (<LINK REF="REF-Sasaki-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sasaki 2000</LINK>). Exposure of the subendothelial layers to the blood stream triggers the expression and release of tissue factor (<LINK REF="REF-Channon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Channon 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Muluk-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Muluk 1998</LINK>), one of the activators of the coagulation cascade. This process results in locally increased thrombin generation with subsequent thrombus formation that is enhanced by a simultaneous inflammatory process through the release of interleukins (interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor), which attract and activate granulocytes and monocytes. The latter are able to express additional tissue factor, thus enhancing the local thrombogenic process. Vein grafts undergo an active remodelling process over several months following arterialisation, with increases in wall thickness and stiffness and changes to the luminal diameter (<LINK REF="REF-Jacot-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacot 2004</LINK>). Venous grafts fail after developing stenosis either at or around anastomotic sites or at points along their length. It is postulated that it is the combination of venous remodeling and intimal hyperplasia (IH) that leads to luminal narrowing and subsequent failure in venous grafts (<LINK REF="REF-Owens-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Owens 2010</LINK>). Although activated platelets play an important role in thrombus formation and IH, it seems that the activated coagulation system at the graft site of endothelial injury also has a role and thrombin inhibition with VKA may therefore have some benefit. On the other hand, inhibition of platelet deposition on prosthetic grafts might be the more efficient therapy for patients with PTFE and dacron bypasses. IH at the distal anastamosis appears to be the principal cause of prosthetic graft failure. Compliance mismatch between the synthetic graft and the native artery results in altered wall stress and endothelial damage around the anastamosis. Areas of IH develop, particularly at the heel and toe of the anastamosis and on the floor of the recipient artery. Introduction of a vein cuff at the anastamosis reduces the IH response (<LINK REF="REF-Kissin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kissin 2000</LINK>) and it is postulated this may be due to a reduction in compliance mismatch (<LINK REF="REF-Sarkar-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sarkar 2006</LINK>). A key step in the initiation of IH is the adherance and aggregation of platelets to the injured endothelium; it may be that this is the main therapeutic target in preventing prosthetic bypass graft failure, where IH has a dominant role. The recently reported CASPAR trial (<LINK REF="REF-CASPAR-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CASPAR 2010</LINK>) combined antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone and showed significant improvement in graft patency in prosthetic grafts (hazard ratio (HR) 0.65; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.95) but not venous grafts (HR1.25; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67), which would seem to support this argument.</P>

<P>Evidence-based results suggest VKA may be of more benefit in venous bypasses. The evidence for antiplatelets in prosthetic grafts is stronger and more consistent. Large randomised controlled trials are required to further evaluate the effects of VKA on venous bypasses and to determine the optimal dose (INR value aimed at) and length of treatment. Additionally, the effect of LMWH compared with UFH in perioperative treatment should be evaluated in larger RCTs that include a subgroup analysis of venous and artificial grafts. In view of the new available antithrombotic agents, such as direct thrombin inhibitors (for example dabigatran) or the factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban<B> </B>and<B> </B>apixaban),<B> </B>many new trials should investigate the efficacy and safety of these agents for bypass patency, limb salvage, and survival. At present graft patency is variably assessed between trials (including clinically, the ankle-brachial pressure index, duplex scanning, angiography) and it would be useful to reach a consensus as to how this should be defined, including the degree of stenosis that may indicate a failing graft that requires intervention. This would allow improved comparison between trials. Furthermore, presentation of data should be much more detailed, and not only show survival curves for overall patency. Tables showing the raw data would improve the transparency of the trial performance and allow comparison of endpoints at consecutive time points of follow up. Thus, the reader would be enabled to identify the number of occlusions or other endpoints at different time points in each comparison group, as well as in subgroups defined by bypass material, above-knee and below-knee anastomosis, and inflow and outflow conditions.</P>

<P>116 patients suffering from IC or severe arterial insufficiency were included in the study. 92 patients (79%) had critical or severe ischemia (PAOD stages III and IV) and 24 patients suffered from (21%) claudication (stage IIb). There was no significant difference between the treatment and the control group concerning age (71  1 vs 73  1 years), sex (37 m/24 f vs 36 m/19 f), duration of symptoms (26  4 vs 25  4 months), diabetes mellitus (15 vs 15 patients), stage of the disease (46 vs 46 patients with CLI), smoking (35 vs 29 patients), or type of reconstruction (27 vs 22 saphenous vein and 14 vs 19 PTFE grafts).

<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Graft occlusion, limb loss and death were primary endpoints at one, two, three, four, five, six, nine, and 12 months, thereafter every 12 months. Assessment of graft patency was performed by Doppler flow measurement and arteriography when in doubt. Bleeding complications requiring hospitalisation were recorded.</P>

<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>18 patients were investigated receiving 18 autologous saphenous vein grafts. Patient characteristics regarding age, sex, preoperative ABI, stage of the disease (claudication), smoking, site of the distal anastomosis did not differ significantly in the two comparison groups.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2008-09-26 16:22:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Heather  Maxwell">
<P>LMWH (Fragmin) or UFH in a dose of 70 anti-Xa activity U/kg of UFH or LMWH (Fragmin) was administered intravenously once during surgery.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>The main focus of this study was to evaluate hypercoagulability as a risk factor, whereas early graft occlusion was only of secondary interest. Follow-up duration was not specified, but the term 'postoperatively' implied occlusion shortly after operation but no longer than 24 hours. No further information was accessible for follow-up evaluations of graft patency, limb salvage or survival.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Patients scheduled for saphenous vein infrainguinal bypass were randomised to either treatment strategy. Randomisation procedure was not specified and attempts to contact the authors were unsuccessful. <BR/>

<P>First of all we like to compliment authors with their extensive work<SUP>1</SUP> on the topic of antithrombotics and infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery. Periprocedural prophylactic antithrombotics (PPAT) involves every day practice around the world during arterial interventions in the vascular patient, but is subject to much discussion and evidence based consensus is lacking.</P>
<P>To increase insight in periprocedural prophylactic anticoagulation and to develop evidence based guidelines on this topic for vascular surgery and interventional radiology, a study group was instituted in the Netherlands: CAPPA: Consensus on Arterial PeriProcedural Anticoagulation. This group consists of Dutch vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists and is supported by the Dutch Boards of Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology. In our effort to elucidate PPAT we have found two misinterpretations of study data in your review. Correction of this data alters the interpretation and outcome of part of the meta-analysis in your review.</P>
<P>After 2 extensive surveys on daily practice of antithrombotics amongst vascular surgeons<SUP>2</SUP> and interventional radiologists<SUP>3</SUP>, we performed a systematic review<SUP>4</SUP> on the subject of "prophylactic periprocedural antithrombotics in open and endovascular abdominal aortic (AAA) repair". Another systematic review was performed on the subject of "prophylactic intraoperative antithrombotics in open infrainguinal bypass surgery (IABS)". This review has recently been accepted for publication by the Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery (Torino).</P>
<P>While performing this systematic review, we thoroughly studied the manuscripts of the Cochrane review on antithrombotics administered during surgical procedure, especially the sub-heading "Unfractionated heparin (UFH) versus low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)", on page 6, 10 and 12. For accurate interpretation of the data we have contacted authors of included studies. The work by Norgren et al<SUP>5 </SUP>is one of the key studies of the review and the exact definition of distal reconstructions depicted in his study was not completely clear for us. Dr Norgren clarified to us by mail:</P>
<P>"Distal reconstructions imply a distal anastomosis below the BK popliteal artery (mainly crural arteries or ADP). Proximal reconstructions mean aorto-iliac, aorto-femoral and iliaco-femoral". This means that the numbers depicted in the meta-analysis in the Cochrane review should be corrected for the patency and mortality at day 30: included patients for infrainguinal reconstructions should be: 174 +77 for the LMWH group and 221 for the UFH group. This alteration of data affects the outcome of the meta-analysis, since now no significant difference between the two groups can be found.</P>
<P>Patency at day 30, see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>
</P>
<P>Mortality at day 30, see <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>
</P>
<P>On the study of Swedenborg et al<SUP>7</SUP>, it was stated on page 10 of the Cochrane review, that "No time points were included and so the data could not be included in the meta-analysis". After additionally contacting prof. Swedenborg by mail, it was established that the follow up in his study<SUP>7</SUP> was 30 days. Therefore we included the data from that study in our meta-analysis.<SUP>5-7</SUP>
</P>
<P>Stated by the authors of the Cochrane in the discussion on page 12 is that "Pooled intention-to-treat data at day 30 did show a marginally positive effect for LMWH over UFH but a much larger cohort of patients receiving venous and artificial bypasses would have to be evaluated for reliable comparison in the future". From our forest plot it can be deducted that not even this marginal effect is present.</P>
<P>We realize that our remarks are of only very minor importance and we agree with the conclusion of authors that more RCTs should be executed on this topic before any reliable conclusion can be drawn on the topic of LMWH versus UFH as periprocedural prophylactic antithrombotic. We would be obliged if our, small, additions to the Cochrane Review will be published in your Journal.</P>
