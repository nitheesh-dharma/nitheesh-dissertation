<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-06-18 12:40:43 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) causes significant morbidity, severe complications, and economic burden worldwide. Though current surgical therapies are effective for gallstones, some types of gallstones (e.g., calcium bilirubinate calculi) cannot easily be eradicated by surgery and they often recur in the bile duct system, putting people at high risk of severe complications. The objective of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of Chinese medicinal herbs for people with cholelithiasis. Though some Chinese medicinal herbs appear to be safe for people with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease, they have not been conclusively shown to have curative effects on gallstones due to the low methodological quality (high risk of bias) of the included trials. Thus, randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias should be conducted to assess the effects of Chinese medicinal herbs before they can be used widely in the clinic.</P>

<P>Eleven randomised trials with 1205 participants with asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate cholelithiasis were included. None of the randomised clinical trials compared a single Chinese medicinal herb with a Western medicine or with surgery. No placebo-controlled trials were identified. In the trials comparing one Chinese herbal medicine (Gandanxiaoshi tablet) versus another (Aihuodantong tablet), there was no significant difference in the improvement of upper abdominal pain after the end of treatment (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.05), and the heterogeneity among trials was not substantial. No other outcomes could be assessed. The remaining trials of Chinese medicinal herbs (Qingdan capsule, Danshu capsule, Paishi capsule, Rongdanpaishi capsule), did not offer specific data on symptoms, signs, or change in gallstones that would permit assessment of significant differences in curative effects between the treatment and control groups. No serious adverse events were reported.<BR/>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-06-24 13:13:22 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Cholelithiasis, which refers to the presence of gallstones in the biliary tract, is a relatively common disease, with an incidence mean rate of 9% to 15% in adults worldwide (<LINK REF="REF-Shipeng-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shipeng 2000</LINK>). The frequency of gallstone occurrence differs greatly across continents and countries, varying from 6% to 70% (<LINK REF="REF-Jorgensen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jorgensen 2000</LINK>). The disease is caused by multiple risk factors, including increasing age, ethnic and hereditary factors, female sex, multiple pregnancies, obesity, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, long-term intravenous nutrition (total parenteral nutrition), and certain types of operations for peptic ulcers (<LINK REF="REF-Mendez_x002d_Sanchez-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mendez-Sanchez 1991</LINK>). In people with a mild form of the disease, no symptoms can be observed (silent stones), but gallstones may be found in the biliary system using such imaging methods as abdominal ultrasound, cholecystography, and computed tomography (<LINK REF="REF-Yirong-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yirong 1994</LINK>). In symptomatic patients, cholelithiasis can induce biliary colic, bile duct infection, cholecystitis, or even suppurative cholangitis and pancreatitis (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2000</LINK>). Severe complications of gallstone disease, such as suppurative cholangitis or pancreatitis, always occur due to migration of the gallstone into the common bile duct from the gallbladder. These stones may enter the common bile duct and cause occlusion of the lumen, causing obstructive jaundice; pancreatitis due to obstruction of the pancreatic ducts; or ascending cholangitis as a result of diminished bile flow (<LINK REF="REF-Veedfald-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veedfald 2011</LINK>). These complications are the main causes of death related to cholelithiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Jieping-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jieping 2000</LINK>). Gallstone disease is usually chronic, and symptomatic gallstone disease adversely affects quality of life. Furthermore, gallstone disease is associated with high medical costs, and causes an economic burden in the form of healthcare expenses.</P>
<P>Currently cholecystectomy, predominantly performed via laparoscopy, is the standard treatment for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Keus-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Keus 2010</LINK>). It is estimated that more than 500,000 cholecystectomies are carried out annually for symptomatic gallstone disease in the USA (<LINK REF="REF-Fischer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fischer 2004</LINK>). If the gallstone in the biliary system must be cleared, choledochoscopy and endoscopic papillotomy are invasive therapeutic options (<LINK REF="REF-Ronglai-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ronglai 2001</LINK>). However, some types of gallstone recur easily and are quite difficult to eradicate in a single surgical or non-surgical procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Nakavama-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nakavama 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ha-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ha 2011</LINK>); one such type of gallstone is calcium bilirubinate calculus, a sandy or massive stone in the bile duct caused by biliary tract infection or parasite infestation (<LINK REF="REF-Xiaosi-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xiaosi 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sackmann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackmann 1997</LINK>). People with these types of gallstones can be a challenge to treat because the people are reluctant to undergo surgery, or because the presence of comorbidities can preclude the multiple surgeries needed to resolve the condition.</P>
<P>Several non-invasive and pharmacological treatment options have been used as an alternative to surgery. These include lithotripsy (<LINK REF="REF-Neuhaus-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuhaus 1998</LINK>), bile acid administration (chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid) (<LINK REF="REF-Veedfald-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Veedfald 2011</LINK>), disodium edetate, or methyl tert-butyl ether (<LINK REF="REF-Patino-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patino 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chinese medicinal herbs are commonly defined as a series of therapeutic plants that are compatible with one another, which means that some are used as the main therapeutic ingredients for the disease, some are used as accessorial intensifiers for therapeutic ingredients, and others are used as neutral ingredients to control side effects. When an environmental factor is involved in the occurrence of a disease, that factor can interact with an underlying imbalance in the body and thereby lead to the disease. Thus, a physician will treat the underlying imbalance, not only the disease itself. Herbal medicines are abundant tools for re-establishing the underlying balance, thereby restoring health to the body. Several medicinal herbs have been commonly held to be effective against cholelithiasis (<LINK REF="REF-Ziliang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziliang 2001</LINK>). These herbs include Lysimachia christinae Hance, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Citrus aurantium L, Artemisia capillaris Thunb, Forsythia suspensa (Thunb) Vahl, Lonicera japonica Thunb, and Crataegus pinnatifida Bge.var.major N.E.Br.</P>
<P>Chinese medicinal herbs are used to treat cholelithiasis in China (<LINK REF="REF-Hong-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hong 1997</LINK>). Some clinical trials have been performed to assess the benefits or harms of these herbs on people with gallstones (<LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Binghui-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Binghui 2002</LINK>). However, we did not find any Chinese systematic reviews until 2010 (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>); the review provided only an incomplete appraisal of methodological quality in the included trials, preventing definitive conclusions.</P>

<P>
<B>Allocation sequence generation </B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: sequence generation was achieved using computer random number generation or a random number table. Drawing lots, tossing a coin, shuffling cards, and throwing dice were adequate if performed by an independent adjudicator.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method of sequence generation was not specified.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the sequence generation method was not, or may not have been, random. Quasi&#8208;randomised studies, those using dates, names, or admission numbers in order to allocate patients, are inadequate and were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Allocation concealment</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: allocation was controlled by a central and independent randomisation unit; sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes; or similar so that intervention allocations could not have been foreseen in advance of or during enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: the trial was described as randomised, but the method used to conceal the allocation was not described so that intervention allocations may have been foreseen in advance of or during enrolment.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: if the allocation sequence was known to the investigators who assigned participants or if the study was quasi&#8208;randomised. Quasi&#8208;randomised studies were excluded for the assessment of benefits but not for assessing harms.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: blinding was performed adequately, or the outcome measurement was not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether the type of blinding used was likely to induce bias on the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: no blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome or the outcome measurement was likely to be influenced by lack of blinding.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Incomplete outcome data</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the underlying reasons for missing data were unlikely to make treatment effects depart from plausible values, or proper methods were employed to handle missing data.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: there was insufficient information to assess whether the missing data mechanism in combination with the method used to handle missing data were likely to introduce bias in the estimate of effect.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: the crude estimate of effects (e.g., complete case estimate) was clearly biased due to the underlying reasons for missing data, and the methods used to handle missing data were unsatisfactory.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<B>Selective outcome reporting</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: pre&#8208;defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on.</LI>
<LI>Uncertain risk of bias: not all pre&#8208;defined or clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were reported on, or were not reported fully, or it was unclear whether data on these outcomes were recorded or not.</LI>
<LI>High risk of bias: one or more clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes were not reported on; data on these outcomes were likely to have been recorded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The clinically relevant and reasonably expected outcomes include the data of mortality and morbidity, symptoms, physical signs, and image results of reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones, or other results which the original investigators intended to assess.</P>
<P>
<B>Other bias</B>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Low risk of bias: the trial appeared to be free of other factors that could put it at risk of bias. </LI>

No quasi-randomised trials and cohort studies were identified for detailed assessment of harm. Trials comparing herbs versus placebo or no treatment were not identified, and no cross-over trials were found. All 11 trials were performed in China.

The last trial (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>), which compared Chinese medicinal herbs plus one antibiotic versus the same antibiotic alone, did not specify clearly the status of the patients, but we assume them to be inpatients since patients with cholecystitis requiring intravenous infusion are usually admitted as inpatients in Chinese hospitals.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>The Chinese medicinal herbs used in the intervention group of the 11 trials were either patent herbal medicines (i.e., proprietary formulations made by a pharmaceutical company) or herbal compounds prepared in a pharmacy at the discretion of the pharmacist. As a primary supportive treatment for symptoms, such as upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, and vomiting, trial participants in three trials received an antibiotic, spasmolytics, or analgesics. An antibiotic was given in the trial comparing herbs plus antibiotic versus the same antibiotic alone (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>), and the spasmolytics as well as analgesics were given in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xing-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xing 2009</LINK>). From the publication of the <LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK> trial, it is clear that the same antibiotic was administered to the control and intervention groups, but the identity and dosage were not provided (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Five trials compared Chinese medicinal herbs (538 people) with three types of Chinese medicines: Chinese medicinal herbs (Tongfupaishizhitong decoction) versus medicinal herbs (Anetholi trithionum) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Deng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Deng 2005</LINK>); Chinese medicinal herbs (Paishi capsule) versus Chinese medicinal herbs (Lidanpaishi capsule) in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2012</LINK>); and Chinese medicinal herbs (Gandanxiaoshi tablet) versus medicinal herbs (Aihuodantong capsule) in three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>). Five trials compared Chinese medicinal herbs (633 people) versus two types of Western medicines: Chinese medicinal herbs versus ursodeoxycholic acid in four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2012</LINK>); and Chinese medicinal herbs versus chenodeoxycholic acid in one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Xing-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xing 2009</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>; <LINK REF="TBL-03" TYPE="TABLE">Table 3</LINK>). One trial compared Chinese medicinal herbs plus Western medicine (antibiotic) (34 people) versus the same Western medicine (antibiotic) (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>) (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). None of the included trials compared a single Chinese medicinal herb versus Western medicine or versus surgery.</P>
<P>All of the participants in the included trials were asymptomatic or had mild-to-moderate symptoms, including mild upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, or icterus. In one trial, an antibiotic was administered for three to five days due to complications of mild acute cholecystitis, and the acute cholecystitis symptoms disappeared in less than one week (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>).</P>
<P>In most trials, herbs were given orally in dosages of 10 to 50 g for periods ranging from 20 days to six months (median, one to three months). Herb dosage was not reported in some trials to protect commercial or proprietary interests. Across all 11 trials, more than 30 individual Chinese medicinal herbs were used, with the most frequent being the 7 to 15 herbs listed in <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK>. The following herbs were used most frequently: Herba Lysimachiae, 54.5% (6 trials); Fructus Aurantii, 54.5% (6 trials); Radix Paeonia Alba, 45.5% (5 trials); Radix Aucklandiae, 45.5% (5 trials); Rheum Offcinale Baillon, 36.4% (4 trials); Rhizoma Corydalis Fructus, 36.4% (4 trials); Radix Curcumae, 36.4% (4 trials); Herba Artemisiae Capillaris, 36.4% (4 trials), and Radix Glycyrrhizae, 27.3% (3 trials). Each trial used different formulations and dosages of Chinese medicinal herbs. The constituents and the dosage of the Chinese medicinal herbs were different in all the trials except for the three trials by <LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>; and <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The trial authors did not report some specific results anticipated by our protocol; instead, most trials reported general clinical effects based on a general clinical curative index that aggregates changes in symptoms and signs, as well as reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones. In this index, complete curative effects were defined as disappearance of all symptoms and signs, and complete disappearance of gallstones based on imaging tests. Partial curative effects were defined as the disappearance of some symptoms, signs, and gallstones, and reduction (but not total disappearance) of gallstones based on imaging tests. No curative effects were defined as the disappearance of some or all symptoms, and an increase or no change in gallstones based on imaging tests. Some trials did not report symptoms and signs of interest to this review (see <LINK TAG="CRIT_OUTCOMES" TYPE="SECTION">Types of outcome measures</LINK>), but they did provide data on other symptoms, such as anorexia, belching, dry throat with bitter taste, and constipation. Some trials recorded some symptoms of adverse events, such as diarrhoea.</P>

<P>Three trials comparing one Chinese herbal medicine versus another Chinese herbal medicine could be included in a meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>). In these trials, Gandaoxiaoshi tablet, a compound of Chinese medicinal herbs, was given to the intervention group (200 people) at a dose of 3.0 g three times per day for three months, and Aihuodantong capsule at 0.1 g three times per day was given to the control group (90 people) for three months. The specific symptom of upper abdominal pain was mentioned in only two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>), and statistical analysis of the outcomes of the two trials are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>. Authors of these trials did not report data for other symptoms and signs listed in the protocol, such as biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, and icterus, so they could not be assessed.</P>

<P>Of the three trials, only two presented specific data (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>). The results of these trials showed no significant improvement on hypochondriac pain between the intervention group of 120 people (106 of whom reported upper abdominal pain before treatment) and the control group of 60 people (47 of whom reported upper abdominal pain before treatment) (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.05) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>, the intervention group (16 people) received Cai hu cheng qi decoction, a compound of Chinese medicinal herbs, plus an antibiotic at an unspecific dose and for an unspecified treatment period. The control group (18 people) received the same antibiotic at an unspecific dose and for an unspecified treatment period. Detailed results about upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, and icterus were not specified; the authors simply mentioned that there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the disappearance time of upper abdominal pain and in the rate with which fever resolved. Therefore, outcomes related to symptoms, signs, and the underlying gallstone syndrome could not be assessed.</P>
<P>In the trial of <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>, the intervention group (100 people) was given Rongdanpaishi capsule, a compound of Chinese medicinal herbs, at a dose of 5 # three times per day for six months, and the control group (100 people) received ursodesoxycholic acid at 0.5 g every night for six months. In addition to the significant difference in general clinical curative effects, the authors reported improvement in upper abdominal pain, bitter taste, anorexia, and abdominal fullness in the intervention group. However, the authors did not report specific quantitative data for these outcomes, so the results could not be assessed in detail. Similarly, the other seven trials did not report detailed results on upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, or icterus (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Deng-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Deng 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Xing-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Xing 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2012</LINK>); the trial authors mentioned only that there was a significant difference between the intervention and control groups in general clinical curative effects. Therefore, symptoms and signs could not be assessed.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Number of participants without reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones</HEADING>
<P>The effects of Chinese medicinal herbs on reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones were assessed by B-ultrasound at the end of the treatment period (<LINK REF="TBL-05" TYPE="TABLE">Table 5</LINK>). 'Excretion' refers to the disappearance of the stone in follow-up ultrasound, presumably due to migration of the stone from the bile system to the intestine, while 'dissolution' refers to detectable reduction in stone size (e.g., from 2 cm to 1 cm), with the residual stone still detectable by ultrasound.<B> </B>The results show a significant difference in the effect on reduction, excretion, or dissolution of the gallstones between the intervention and control groups in two trials (<LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-She-1981" TYPE="STUDY">She 1981</LINK>, gallstones were excreted in 10 of 16 participants in the intervention group, while excretion did not occur in any of the 18 participants in the control group (P value = 0.000); this trial did not report the numbers of participants in whom the gallstones partially dissolved or reduced. Of the three trials pooled for meta-analysis (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001b" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001b</LINK>), only <LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK> presented data on the numbers of participants not showing reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones; however, these numbers, determined by B-ultrasound, did not differ significantly between the intervention group (54/60 people) and the control group (25/30 people) (P value = 0.496).</P>

</P>
<P>Adverse effects were mentioned in six of the 11 included trials (54.5%) (<LINK REF="TBL-06" TYPE="TABLE">Table 6</LINK>). Three of these six trials compared one Chinese herbal medicine (Gandanxiaoshi tablet) versus another Chinese herbal medicine, which was either Aihuodantong capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>) or Lidanpaishi capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Su-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2012</LINK>). The other three trials compared the Western medicine, ursodesoxycholic acid, versus different Chinese medicinal herbs, which were either Rongpaidanshi capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>), Danshu capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>), or Paishi capsule (<LINK REF="STD-Shi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2012</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Shi-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Shi 2012</LINK> reported no adverse events in either the intervention or control group, whereas the numbers of participants experiencing adverse effects varied from 2 to 25 in the other five trials (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Huang-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Huang 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Su-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Su 2012</LINK>). The following adverse effects were reported: vertigo, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. The trial authors did not indicate whether the adverse effects were ascertained by standardised monitoring or voluntary self report, neither did they attempt to isolate the specific Chinese medicinal herbs that might be inducing those adverse effects.

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The results of the systematic review suggest that Gandanxiaoshi tablet, a patent Chinese medicinal herb, has equivalent clinical effects on cholelithiasis as compared to another herbal medicine, Aihuodnatong capsule; however, the absolute efficacy of either Gandanxiaoshi tablet or Aihuodantong capsule is unknown because we did not find any trials comparing these herbal medicines to placebo or no treatment. The result from the meta-analyses in this review showed that Gandanxiaoshi tablet showed no significant difference from Aihuodantong capsule in the improvement of cholelithiasis symptoms. The other studied Chinese medicinal herbs in the included studies, while traditionally believed to reduce upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, and icterus, did not show any significant difference from control groups for the majority of outcome measures. The therapeutic effects on reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones in the bile duct or the gallbladder, or both were unclear in comparisons of Gandanxiaoshi tablet and Aihuodantong capsule.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:42 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The long-term goal of cholelithiasis treatment is to prevent recurrence of gallstones and onset of severe complications. The investigators of the included trials relied on a general clinical curative index that aggregated changes in certain specific symptoms and signs, as well as reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones, but that did not take into account changes in other symptoms, such as upper abdominal pain, biliary colic, nausea, vomiting, and icterus. However, all the included participants in the trials are asymptomatic or just mild-to-moderate symptoms,<B> </B>participants with severe symptoms were excluded from the research because Chinese medicine practitioners believe medicinal herbs to play only an accessory role in treating cholelithiasis, therefore, people with severe cholelithiasis are usually treated with Western approaches. Furthermore, most trials did not report specific data on the reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones, so we could not evaluate these outcomes. None of the trials reported how many participants had undergone biliary operations after treatment, so the proportion of participants who had undergone these operations could not be determined. In fact, most trials did not report other important outcomes, such as mortality, patient quality of life, medical costs, incidence of complications, or follow-up. As a result, we could not draw any definite conclusions about the outcomes of interest to our review.</P>
<P>No serious adverse effects of the Chinese medicinal herbs for cholelithiasis were reported. However, definitive conclusions about adverse effects could not be drawn from this review as the sample size of the included trials was not large, and the period of treatment and follow-up seemed insufficient. Though some slight symptoms, such as diarrhoea, were observed both in the Chinese medicinal herbs group (<LINK REF="STD-Dai-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Dai 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhang-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Zhang 2001a</LINK>), and Western medicine control group (<LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2004</LINK>), reporting of adverse effects was poor and unsystematic, so we could not draw any conclusion about which medicine had more frequent or serious adverse effects. In fact, most Chinese clinical trials on Chinese medicinal herbs do not report adverse effects of the herbs or simply do not mention adverse effects, consistent with our previous observations that harm reporting is unreliable in studies on Chinese medicinal herbs (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>A plausible explanation for this lack of reporting is that Chinese clinical practitioners traditionally believe that Chinese medicinal herbs have few or no adverse effects since the herbs are natural products that have been used in China for many years. However, a growing number of studies show that Chinese medicinal herbs do cause adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 2012</LINK>). Therefore, medical researchers as well as clinical practitioners should pay more attention to such adverse effects and should consider them during clinical trial design and therapy planning. </P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All randomised clinical trials included in this review were of poor methodological quality, which led to a relatively high risk of bias. Trial reports provided only a limited description of study design and randomisation, and not all trials used allocation concealment. All trials stated only that random assignment was used, which we confirmed with the trial authors by telephone, but the reported outcomes data were incomplete, preventing us from drawing appropriate conclusions about the curative effects of the Chinese medicinal herbs on cholelithiasis. Most trials provided only general statements about the effects of the herbs; specific outcomes data, such as the numbers of participants experiencing reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones, were not presented. We could not obtain this missing information, even after contacting the trial authors.</P>
<P>As a result of the different medicinal herbs used in the included trials and the high risk of bias, the therapeutic effects of several commonly used Chinese medicinal herbs, such as Herba Lysimachiae, Radix Paeonia Alba, Fructus Aurantii, Rheum Offcinale Baillon, Rhizoma Corydalis Fructus, and Radix Curcumae, remain uncertain. The trials also presented different clinical prescriptions in the diversity of Chinese medicinal herbs applied, as well as in baseline patient parameters such as age, sex ratio, and cholelithiasis aetiology and severity, preventing us from performing meta-analyses.</P>
<P>The evidence we collected for our analyses is weak and we can neither recommend nor argue against the use of the Chinese medicinal herbs studied in our review for treatment of cholelithiasis.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:47 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found the design, execution, and reporting of the included clinical trials to be inadequate: important outcomes, such as mortality, biliary operations, quality of life, and medical costs, were not reported. There were no treatment withdrawals in the included trials, but information on adverse events, participant follow-up, and outcomes was incomplete. Participant characteristics at baseline were not clearly described in some of the trials. All these factors led us to estimate the trials to be at high risk of bias.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Dimitrinka Nikolova">
<P>The results of one systematic review are in agreement with our review (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>), that is, that Chinese medicines do affect clinical symptoms of cholelithiasis. However, the long-term therapeutic effects have rarely been reported. The conclusions of the present review require verification due to the low methodological quality, heterogeneity, and inherent risk of bias in the included trials.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>According to this systematic review, Chinese medicinal herbs should not be claimed to have strong positive therapeutic effects on the reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones in the bile duct or the gallbladder even for people with asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate cholelithiasis. The risk of bias of the included randomised trials is high, and the available clinical data remain scanty. There is no strong evidence for the routine application of Chinese medicinal herbs in treatment of cholelithiasis.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-06-18 13:53:53 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The methodological quality of future randomised clinical trials for treatment of cholelithiasis with Chinese medicinal herbs should be improved. In particular, the trials should present how allocation sequences were generated and how allocation was concealed in detail. Trials should use blinding and should be placebo-controlled. Withdrawals and dropouts during the trial should be clearly reported. In fact, trials should report on all clinically important outcomes over a sufficiently long follow-up period.</P>
<P>Future studies of medicinal herbs to treat cholelithiasis should be well-designed, multicentre, large-scaled randomised trials that compare Chinese medicinal herbs versus no treatment/placebo and versus a standard treatment for which we have data (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid and the dissolution of gallstones). Trials should present in detail how allocation sequences were generated and how allocation was concealed. Specific outcomes should be assessed, including reduction, excretion, or dissolution of gallstones; recurrence of gallstones; quality of life; mortality; adverse effects; symptoms; signs; complications; and cost-effectiveness, in addition to general clinical curative effects. Adverse effects should be critically assessed by standardised monitoring or by an effective self report system, or both. More attention should be paid to the long-term adverse effects caused by Chinese medicinal herbs.</P>
