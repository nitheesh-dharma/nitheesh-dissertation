<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Eating more fish has been recommended as one way of possibly reducing asthma. Populations (such as Eskimo communities) with diets high in fish also have low rates of asthma. As diets in other communities have become higher in saturated fats, asthma has also increased. The theory has been that an ingredient in fish oil may reduce inflammation. Inflammation causes the swelling in the airways of the lungs that leads to asthma attacks. However, this review of trials found that people with asthma changing their diets to include more fish oil did not improve their asthma.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2010-05-19 09:40:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Epidemiological studies suggest that a diet high in marine fatty acids (fish oil) may have beneficial effects on inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and possibly asthma.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>(1) To determine the effect of marine n-3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation in asthma.<BR/>(2) To determine the effect of a diet high in fish oil in asthma.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2010-05-19 09:40:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved trials and contacted fish oil manufacturers. Searches were current as of May 2010.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>We included randomised controlled trials in patients with asthma more than two years of age. The study duration had to be in excess of four weeks. Double blind trials were preferred, but we also reviewed single-blind and open trials for possible inclusion. </P>
<P>All four reviewers read each paper, blind to its identity. Decisions concerning inclusion were made by simple majority. We all performed quality assessment independently.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>The only comparison possible was between marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo. There were insufficient trials to examine dietary manipulation alone.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:06:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>Nine randomised controlled trials conducted between 1986 and 2001 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Seven were of parallel design and two were cross-over studies. Eight compared fish oil with placebo whilst one compared high dose versus low dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Two studies were conducted in children, whilst the remaining seven studies were conducted in adults. None of the included studies reported asthma exacerbations, health status or hospital admissions.</P>
<P>There was no consistent effect on any of the analysable outcomes: FEV1, peak flow rate, asthma symptoms, asthma medication use or bronchial hyper reactivity. One of the studies performed in children which combined dietary manipulation with fish oil supplementation showed improved peak flow and reduced asthma medication use. There were no adverse events associated with fish oil supplements.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is little evidence to recommend that people with asthma supplement or modify their dietary intake of marine n-3 fatty acids (fish oil) in order to improve their asthma control. Equally, there is no evidence that they are at risk if they do so.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY MODIFIED="2010-05-20 16:09:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Interest in the possible health benefits of dietary marine n-3 fatty acids (fish oil) developed following observations that those populations, such as Eskimos, with a high dietary intake of fish also have a low incidence of atherosclerotic and thrombotic disorders, as well as inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The recent understanding of asthma being a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways and that our dietary patterns have changed over the past 30 years has led to speculation that a diet deficient in fish may also lead to worsening of asthma. The potential anti inflammatory effect of fish oil is that its active ingredient, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is a competitive substrate with arachidonic acid in generating metabolites. EPA is a substrate for the generation of less active prostenoids and leukotrienes than arachidonic acid, thereby potentially acting to reduce airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction.</P>
<P>To date, the evidence for beneficial effects of a dietary intake which is high in marine n-3 fatty acids is controversial. Whilst some support for this hypothesis has occurred in epidemiological studies, the data from intervention studies has been conflicting. <LINK REF="REF-Black-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Black 1997</LINK> hypothesised that dietary fatty acid intake may influence the development of allergic sensitisation by increasing the formation of prostaglandin E2; which in turn promotes T helper lymphocyte Th2 responses and stimulates the formulation of immunoglobulin E. As dietary fat intake patterns have changed over the past few decades, with an increase in saturated fat consumption and a reduction in polyunsaturated fat intake, there is some suggestion that this may be an important factor in the increasing prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases. However, a review of the clinical trials of asthma and fish oils (<LINK REF="REF-Monteleone-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monteleone 1997</LINK>), concluded that there was no evidence of clinical improvement in people with asthma using fish oil supplementation, despite some changes seen in inflammatory cell functions.</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:10:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>From the title, abstract or descriptors, one reviewer (RW) reviewed the literature searches to identify potentially relevant trials for full review. Searches of bibliographies and texts were conducted to identify additional studies. All three reviewers independently read the abstract and methods sections of the papers to select the trials for inclusion in this review, using specific criteria. All three reviewers were blinded to the identity of each paper. Agreement was by a simple majority of all three reviewers and we resolved disagreement by consensus.</P>

<DATA_EXTRACTION MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:10:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>We (RW, MA) extracted data for the trials independently. We obained confirmation of methodology in two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>) and obtained additional data in three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK>).

</DATA_EXTRACTION>
<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2010-05-19 09:41:49 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>All three reviewers independently performed methodological quality assessment. All used two different methods of assessment. First, using the Cochrane approach to assessment of allocation concealment, all trials were scored and entered using the following scheme:<BR/>Grade A: Adequate concealment<BR/>Grade B: Unclear concealment<BR/>Grade C: Obviously not adequate concealment.</P>
<P>We measured inter-rater reliability using simple agreement. For seven of the nine studies there was 67% agreement and 100% agreement for the other two studies in the first instance. After discussion with all reviewers we achieved 100% agreement.</P>
<P>We assessed concealment of allocation as clearly adequate (Grade A) in only 1 study (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK>). The adequacy or otherwise of the seven other studies could not be determined from the details published in the papers (Grade B). One study was deemed to have obviously inadequate allocation concealment (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK>).</P>
<P>In addition, we assessed each study using a 0 to 5 scale described by <LINK REF="REF-Jadad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jadad 1996</LINK> and summarised as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Was the study described as randomised? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)</LI>
<LI>Was the study described as being double blind? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)</LI>
<LI>Was there a description of withdrawals and drop puts? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)</LI>
<LI>Was the method of randomisation well described and appropriate? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)</LI>
<LI>Was the method of double blinding well described and appropriate? (1 = Yes, 0 = No)</LI>
<LI>Deduct one point if methods for randomisation or blinding were inappropriate.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:12:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>The planned analyses included:<BR/>Comparison 1: marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation versus placebo<BR/>Comparison 2: marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation vs untreated control<BR/>Comparison 3: dietary marine n-3 fatty acid manipulation vs untreated control<BR/>Comparison 4: dietary marine n-3 fatty acid manipulation vs placebo<BR/>Comparison 5: where different doses of marine n-3 fatty acid supplements/manipulation were used, dose-response analysis was attempted , categorising studies by mean plasma/red cell fatty acid levels where available.</P>
<P>These comparisons were performed separately for each outcome, namely lung function measurements (FEV1 and PEF), asthma medication usage, asthma symptom scores, number of asthma exacerbations, health status (quality of life) scores, bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) and hospital admissions, whenever the results were reported.</P>
<P>To compare studies which used different doses of marine fatty acids, we converted doses to daily equivalents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in grams. Where appropriate, we entered continuous data as negative values to conform to the Cochrane convention whereby effects that favour the treatment under review move to the left of the line of no effect.</P>
</EFFECT_MEASURES>
<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:11:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>We calculated the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes to provide pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) where the outcome of interest was expressed as the same scale for all included studies. If we used different scales to measure the same outcome e.g. Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) measured in absolute units and as a percentage of predicted normal we used the standardised mean difference (SMD). For both methods, random and fixed effect models were compared. Where there was a significant difference in the pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals between the random and fixed effects models, the random effects model has been used. We performed Chi square tests to assess heterogeneity between studies.</P>
<P>For dichotomous variables, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): both fixed and random effects models were used.</P>

<P>Of the nine studies which met the inclusion criteria, seven were of parallel design (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kirsch-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kirsch 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>) whilst two were cross-over trials (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK>). Both cross-over studies compared marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo. The study by <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK> was a three arm study, comparing evening primrose oil, fish oil and olive oil (as placebo). However, only the fish oil and olive oil (placebo) arms were considered in this review. We performed separate analyses for each of these study designs.</P>
<P>Of the seven parallel studies, five compared marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>); one compared dietary marine n-3 fatty acid manipulation with dietary n-6 fatty acid manipulation (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>) and one compared high dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation with low dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation (<LINK REF="STD-Kirsch-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kirsch 1988</LINK>).</P>
<P>Seven of the studies were in adults, and two were in children (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>A total of 187 people with asthma were included in these nine studies.</P>
<P>Reasons for excluding studies were: not randomised controlled trial (5), not marine fatty acids in asthma (3), no outcome measurements (3) and inadequate intervention period (3). One abstract contained insufficient information for further assessment and we therefore excluded it. A further abstract was excluded as the published article which related to the abstract was included in the review.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS MODIFIED="2008-05-17 14:22:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J  Lasserson">
<P>None of the studies reported asthma exacerbations, health status (quality of life) or hospital admissions. One adverse event was reported in a participant receiving placebo by <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kirsch-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Kirsch 1988</LINK> met our inclusion criteria, but compared high dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation (4 gm EPA/day) with low dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation (0.1 gm EPA/day) so we did not combine it with the studies that used placebos. In this study, there was no difference in FEV1 or symptom scores between the two comparison groups.</P>
<P>Results of lung function measurements, asthma medication usage, asthma symptom scores and bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR) from the eight placebo controlled studies were combined.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Lung function</HEADING>
<P>FEV1 measurements were performed in two of the parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>). There was no significant effect of marine n-3 fatty acids. The combined WMD (fixed effect model) for FEV1 following marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation was 2.08 % predicted (95% CI -4.77 to 8.93, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>The PEF was reported in four parallel studies (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>) and the two cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK>). In the parallel studies, the pooled SMD for the PEF at the end of the studies was 1.05 (95% CI 0.02 to 2.08), using a random effects model. This suggests a significant improvement following marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. However there was significant heterogeneity between the studies (Chi-squared = 15.34, p &lt; 0.01). The two studies by Arm et al (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>), showed clear differences in PEF at the end of the studies that favoured marine n-3 fatty acids. This may, however, have been due to differences in PEF at baseline. These values were lower in the placebo group than in participants who were allocated to receive marine n-3 fatty supplementation. When the results were expressed as the change in PEF from baseline, there was no significant effect of marine n-3 fatty acids. The SMD using a random effects model was 0.51 (95% CI -0.46 to 1.47), Chi squared = 15.53, p &lt; 0.001. Heterogeneity was attributable to the significant effect of the dietary supplement on change in PEF in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the cross-over studies, the WMD for PEF using a fixed effect model was 5.1 l/min (95% CI -34.29, 44.38).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Asthma symptoms</HEADING>
<P>Seven studies reported asthma symptom scores. The scales differed between studies, but five of the six reported symptom scores as a numerical figure, with a higher score representing worse asthma symptoms. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK>) reported symptoms in terms of "same, better or worse".</P>

The study by <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK> reported an improvement in symptoms, whilst that by <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK> found no improvement.</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Asthma medication </HEADING>
<P>Five studies reported asthma medication usage. These scores all differed, but all used the same basic approach: the more asthma medication was required, the higher the score. In the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>, the medication score was based on the total number of doses of bronchodilator medication used throughout the study period. The studies by <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK> also gave total asthma medication usage scores throughout the study period, but the score combined bronchodilator, preventive and other asthma medication usage.</P>
<P>Four of the five parallel studies reported asthma medication usage (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>). The pooled SMD using a random effects model was -0.84 (95% CI -2.11 to 0.44). Significant heterogeneity between these studies existed for asthma medication usage (Chi-squared = 24.78, p &lt; 0.001). This was attributable to the study of <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK> which showed a significant reduction in medication use, in contrast to the other studies.</P>
<P>Of the two cross-over studies, only that by <LINK REF="STD-McDonald-1990" TYPE="STUDY">McDonald 1990</LINK>, reported asthma medication usage. No effect was found.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Bronchial Hyper-responsiveness (BHR)</HEADING>

The results from all studies were log transformed for this analysis. The pooled SMD using a fixed effect model for the studies was -0.14 (95% CI -0.52 to 0.24), showing no overall change.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analysis</HEADING>
<P>Only one of the three planned sub-group analyses could be conducted due to the small number of studies included in this review. The two studies conducted in children (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>) were compared to the four studies of parallel design in adults (<LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Dry-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Dry 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thien-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Thien 1993</LINK>) for BHR and asthma symptoms outcomes. Neither BHR nor asthma symptom scores were significantly different between children and adults.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-05-18 01:30:21 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We found nine studies which met the inclusion criteria. A further fourteen were excluded from this review because they were not randomised controlled trials, did not study marine fatty acids in asthma, did not report relevant outcome measures and/or had inadequate intervention periods. The methodological quality of most of the included studies, particularly the concealment of allocation following randomisation, could not be determined clearly from the information presented in the papers. We would encourage authors of future papers to follow the CONSORT (1996) guidelines and fully report such details. The two studies by Mickleborough (well performed RCTs) deserve special attention. The first (2003) was excluded because authors studied the effects of fish oil supplementation on exercise induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes, which may have different pathogenetic mechanisms from chronic persistent asthma. Moreover, the duration of intervention in this study was less than 4 weeks. The more recent sudy (2006) conducted in asthmatic subjects similarly had a short duration (less than 4 weeks), with the main outcome studied also being the effect on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. However, it is noted that data on lung function measurements, medication use and compliance assessment were also collected.</P>
<P>The review has found no convincing evidence that supplementation of diet with marine n-3 fatty acids leads to an improvement in asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, bronchial hyper-reactivity or FEV1. Unfortunately none of the studies reported asthma exacerbations, health status (quality of life) or hospital admissions.</P>
<P>There was no consistent effect of n-3 supplementation on PEF as a measure of lung function and there was significant heterogeneity between studies. The apparent improvement in PEF following marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation is probably due to imbalance in the baseline values of PEF in the studies by <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Arm-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Arm 1989</LINK>.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK> showed an improvement in symptoms although the remaining five studies found no improvement. Interestingly the original paper by <LINK REF="STD-Stenius_x002d_Aarniala1989" TYPE="STUDY">Stenius-Aarniala1989</LINK> did not report this improvement in asthma symptoms, however this was probably because the analysis in the original paper was a comparison of all three arms of the study, whilst in this review analysis was restricted to only the fish oil and placebo arms of the study.</P>
<P>Whilst the review has found insufficient evidence to promote the addition of marine n-3 fatty acid supplements to the diets of asthmatics, it also found no evidence of adverse events either. This suggests that whilst there may be no benefit in marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation, there may be no harm in doing so either.</P>
<P>Much of the interest in n-3 fatty acid supplementation for asthma began in the era when the neutrophil was considered to possibly have an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Certainly, the most profound anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids are on neutrophil function and mediator generation. Hence, this may explain the clinical benefit in diseases where there is neutrophilic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, cystic fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease. However, in asthma, eosinophils and mast cells are now thought to be more important effector cells. N-3 fatty acids do not have a significant anti-inflammatory effect on eosinophils and mast cells in-vitro. Hence, this may explain their relative lack of efficacy in asthma compared with these other diseases. Nevertheless, with current emergent understanding of asthma phenotypes, there may be subtypes of asthma with predominant neutrophilic inflammation, such as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction or non-eosinophilic asthma, where dietary n-3 fatty acid supplementation may have a therapeutic role. </P>
<P>It should be noted that, only in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>), was dietary manipulation of marine n-3 fatty acids carried out as part of the treatment phase. It is noteworthy that this trial showed a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow and asthma medication use. It remains to be seen whether this finding would be replicated in other studies in children, or studies in which dietary manipulation was carried out as well as supplementation.</P>
<P>Most of the epidemiological evidence which gave rise to the hypothesis that marine n-3 fatty acids may have a protective effect, came from studies that found that the regular consumption of fish has a protective effect. It has been assumed from these epidemiological studies that as fish is the major source of n-3 fatty acids in the human diet, then n-3 fatty acids have been the component responsible for this protective effect. This review has not addressed the issue of whether the regular consumption of fish per se, or whether there is another active component in fish that may result in improved asthma control.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The results from this review suggest that there is little evidence to recommend that people with asthma supplement or modify their dietary intake of marine n-3 fatty acids (fish oil) in order to improve their asthma control. Equally, there is no evidence that they are at risk if they do so.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Given the small number of studies, which have been conducted to date, and the limited range of clinically important outcomes that have been reported there is a need for further research in this area. Specifically, since the total number of people with asthma who have been involved in the studies has only been 187, future studies should include larger numbers of subjects. Similarly the outcome measures of asthma exacerbations, hospital admissions and quality of life scores should be included in future studies. Only two studies have been conducted to date (<LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nagakura-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Nagakura 2000</LINK>) in children so it is difficult to make any firm conclusions as to the benefits, or otherwise, of marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation in this age group. </P>
<P>This review has not been able to answer the question whether increasing the dietary intake of marine n-3 fatty acids by increased fish intake (but not n-3 supplementation) result in improved asthma control. Further studies would be required to address this issue. The study of <LINK REF="STD-Hodge-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Hodge 1998</LINK> provides the most encouragement for this further work.</P>

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised controlled trial. Double blind. Parallel design. Comparison of diet high in omega-6 fatty acids (placebo capsules: safflower/palm/olive oil) and diet high in omega-3 fatty acids (capsules: MaxEPA). Omega-3 diet participants advised to eat fish at least once per month, omega-6 group to avoid fish. Six month intervention period.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>45 asthmatic children, aged 8 to 12 years. 39 completed the study (6 dropped out at baseline prior to randomisation). Asthma defined as reported episodic wheeze in past 12 months and airway hyperresponsiveness. Asthma severity scores based on PEF, day and night symptom scores and medication usage. Excluded those on oral steroids, "significant other diseases", known aspirin or salicylate sensitivity. No mention as to how subjects were recruited.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Omega-3 (active) group: 4 x MaxEPA capsules/day (total of 1.2g omega-3/day). Dietary control consisted of use of canola oil and canola based margarines and salad dressings which were supplied in unmarked containers and used in place of usual fats/oils. Advised to consume fish at least once a month.<BR/>omega-6 (placebo) group: 4 x matched placebo capsules containing safflower (1.8g/day), palm (1.8g/day) and olive oil (0.4g/day). Usual fat/oil intake replaced with sunflower oil and sunflower oil based margarines and salad dressings. Advised to avoid fish.<BR/>Route of administration was oral.
