<P>Measles (rubeola) is an infectious disease caused by multiplication of a single-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the genus <I>Morbillivirus</I> in the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva. It can lead to serious complications and death. Chinese herbal medicines are believed to be effective in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of measles, and are widely used as the main or adjunctive therapy to treat measles in China and other countries.</P>
<P>The review authors found a large number of clinical studies providing evidence of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of measles. Some of these reports claimed to be randomised controlled trials. However, after telephone interviewing 32 trial authors, we found that none of them used acceptable randomisation procedures to allocate participants and 34 studies included participants with measles complicated with other diseases, for example, pneumonia. Ten trials were non-randomised controlled studies and four trials require further classification. In this update, we were unable to include any randomised controlled trial for assessment. Although no trials were included, the authors reviewed the articles and found no reports of adverse events in the use of Chinese herbal medicines for treating measles. High-quality and large trials are needed.</P>

<P>We did not identify any suitable trials for inclusion. In this updated review we identified 80 trials which claimed to use random allocation. We contacted 32 trial authors by telephone and learned that the allocation methods used were not randomised. We excluded 34 studies because the participants experienced complications such as pneumonia. We excluded 10 trials because of non-random allocation and complications experienced by the participants. We were unable to contact the remaining four trials' authors, so they require further assessment and have been allocated to the 'Studies awaiting classification' section.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2011-09-12 17:52:52 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Measles (rubeola) is an infection caused by multiplication of a single-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the genus <I>Morbillivirus</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Budd-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Budd 2002</LINK>) in the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva. Measles was identified in ancient times and it continues to cause serious problems in many parts of the world. A dramatic decline in both morbidity and mortality has been achieved with the use of measles vaccines (<LINK REF="REF-Nemir-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemir 1990</LINK>). In 2008 it was estimated that a total of 164,000 deaths were caused by measles globally (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). The only source of infection is from acutely infectious patients.</P>
<P>The measles pathogen exists in secretions from the nasopharynx, mouth and conjunctiva of infected persons; and in sputum, urine and blood, especially in leukocytes. It is spread by droplets or on direct contact with nasal or throat secretions. Less commonly, it is spread by airborne means or by articles freshly soiled with secretions of the nose and throat (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). The virus can be very dangerous. Ninety-five per cent of people who have not been vaccinated can be infected after contact with an infectious patient (<LINK REF="REF-Zhou-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhou 2003</LINK>). Children between six months and five years of age are the most likely to be infected. Measles is one of the most readily transmitted communicable diseases and probably the best known of the serious childhood rash with fever illnesses (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2004</LINK>). Patients with immunological deficiencies, malnutrition and particularly vitamin A deficiency may have severe and often fatal forms of measles.</P>
<P>Measles has two clinical manifestations: typical and atypical. The former can be divided into three stages: a prodromal stage, an eruption stage and a subsidence stage. The latter clinical manifestation has several types: mild measles, severe measles, adult measles and heterotypic measles (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Following an incubation period of six to 18 days, the first clinical signs appear and include profuse mucoserous nasal discharge, sneezing, excessive formation of tears and development of photophobia, cough, Koplik spots and fever (<LINK REF="REF-Nemir-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nemir 1990</LINK>). Three to four days later, the rash develops and symptoms become more severe. The rash generally disappears three to five days later and the temperature decreases (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>). Complications occur in approximately 30% of cases (<LINK REF="REF-Hussey-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hussey 2003</LINK>). Pneumonia is the most common and most dangerous complication. In addition, laryngitis, carditis, otitis media and cephalitis may develop. Diagnosis of typical measles is often based on the clinical signs and symptoms. Detecting the specific antibody in the serum and <I>Morbillivirus</I> in samples may not be needed. Diagnosis of atypical measles is more difficult and may require sero-diagnosis.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2011-08-16 12:55:15 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no specific treatment for measles. Therapy should be aimed at alleviating symptoms and preventing complications. For uncomplicated measles, rest and supportive treatment aids recovery for most people. Therapies for reducing fever and pain, for example, antipyretics and extra fluids during the febrile period and cough suppressants are necessary (<LINK REF="REF-Perry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Perry 2002</LINK>). Aspirin should be used with caution because a correlation has been found between children taking aspirin and the development of Reye's syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Starko-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Starko 1980</LINK>). Vitamin A is used in low-income countries to treat measles. There is no significant reduction in overall mortality, but it can reduce mortality in children under two years age (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Many Chinese physicians believe that herbal medicines are effective in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of the disease. Herbal medicines are not only routinely used for most respiratory diseases in hospitals but are also commonly used by many Chinese people at home. Chinese medical theory is based on the belief that measles is caused by an invasion of an 'exterior unhealthy influence'. Accordingly, appropriate drugs (treating the unhealthy influence) are used in the early stage of the disease. These drugs are thought to promote sweating to reduce fever and clear 'toxic material'. Drugs thought to improve immunity are used in later stages to speed recovery from measles.</P>

<THEORY MODIFIED="2011-09-14 10:53:43 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Herbs are dispensed depending on the symptoms. Pharmacological experiments suggest that Ge Gen (<I>Radix puerariae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Dou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dou 2004</LINK>), Sheng ma (<I>Rhizoma cimicifugae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2004b</LINK>), Jing Jie (<I>Herba schizonepetae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2004a</LINK>) and Lian qiao (<I>Fructus forsythiae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Deng-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deng 2004</LINK>) may abate fever. In addition, Sheng ma (<I>Rhizoma cimicifuga</I>e) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2004b</LINK>) and Jing Jie (<I>Herba schizonepeta</I>e) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2004a</LINK>) might act as analgesics and sedatives. Bo he (<I>Herba menthae</I>) is used to induce perspiration and loosen sputum (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004a</LINK>). Jing Jie (<I>Herba schizonepetae</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Zhao-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhao 2004a</LINK>) and Jie geng (<I>Radix platycodi</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Xuan-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xuan 2004</LINK>) may have an antitussive effect and loosen sputum. Sang ye (<I>Folium mori</I>) (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2004b</LINK>) and Zi CaO (<I>Radix arnebiae)</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Hou-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hou 2004</LINK>) may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Mai dong (<I>Radix ophiopogoni</I>s) might improve immunity (<LINK REF="REF-Tao-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tao 2004</LINK>). Ideally, it is thought that Chinese medicinal herbs should be used according to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine.</P>

Changes in diagnostic criteria may produce significant variability in the clinical characteristics of the patients included, as well as in the results obtained.

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2011-09-09 22:37:14 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Although Chinese medicinal herbs are widely used to treat measles in China and many relevant clinical studies have been completed and published, we were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We hope high-quality RCTs in this field will be conducted in the future.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2011-09-09 22:37:25 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="Liz Dooley">
<P>The results of the telephone interviews demonstrated that the designs of the clinical studies we identified were not randomised, even though all of the identified studies mentioned randomisation. Some studies allocated patients voluntarily. Some studies allocated patients according to the patients' admitting sequence, making it a pseudo-random allocation. None of the trials concealed patient allocation or used a blinding method.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2011-09-09 22:37:34 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Allocation concealment is important in preventing selection bias. None of the studies related to our question concealed the allocation process, which could lead to a high risk of selection bias.</P>
<P>Blinding was not used, which could lead to a high risk of performance and detection bias. Chinese medicinal herbs usually differ from Western medicines in terms of appearance, taste and smell. Therefore, blinding was difficult. However, a double-dummy technique could be used and the outcome assessors could be blinded. Publication bias may exist as all of the studies were published in Chinese and no primary articles reported negative results.</P>
<P>An additional problem was that most Chinese medicinal herbal preparations were tested in one study only and most of the trials were conducted in country hospitals or smaller clinics. This means that most of the trials did not receive ethical approval and therefore may not be true trials but analysis reports from case notes.</P>

<P>There were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for or against Chinese medicinal herbs as a treatment for measles.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-09-12 18:02:40 +1000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Further research in Chinese medicinal herbs seems justified by both the claims of the doctors and the popularity of alternative therapies in general. RCTs are urgently needed in order to define the efficacy and acceptability of these interventions for measles.</P>
<P>Well-designed, multi-centre RCTs are required to evaluate Chinese medicinal herbs for measles. Outcome measures should include overall symptom and fever clearance times. Adverse events should be critically assessed by standardised monitoring or an effective self reporting system. Attention should be paid to long-term adverse effects of Chinese medicinal herbs.</P>
<P>Although Chinese herbal medicine as a treatment for measles and its method of manufacture are widely accepted in China, most of the constituents of the pharmacological preparations used in trials cannot be clearly specified. This is in marked contrast to pharmacological agents used in Western medicine, in which the chemical constituents, the quantities and the percentage of any impurities or contaminants are precisely known, and the variation between different production batches is kept within specified limits. Variation between formulations and batches of treatments are an inevitable consequence of traditional Chinese medicines, though the Chinese Government also specifies the limits of variation that are acceptable. This variation is a factor that may contribute to any heterogeneity between different study results.</P>
<P>Furthermore, one must accept that the overall treatment concept for traditional Chinese medicine is different to that used in Western medicine. When a study uses a self prepared herbal formulation, the quality of herbs and methods of preparation should be stated in detail, in order to achieve consistent effects.</P>
