<P>Vitamin K injection can prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Vitamin K helps the blood to clot but the body's capacity to store it is very low. Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN) is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin K in newborns and results in life-threatening bleeding in an infant in the first hours to months of life. Classic HDN occurs on days one to seven and late HDN occurs from week two to 12. Some Vitamin K comes from the placenta but it is not always enough. The review of randomized trials found that a single injection of Vitamin K prevents classic HDN.</P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Vitamin K deficiency can cause bleeding in an infant in the first weeks of life. This is known as Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). HDN is divided into three categories: early, classic and late HDN. Early HDN occurs within 24 hours post partum and falls outside the scope of this review. Classic HDN occurs on days one to seven; common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, nasal and from a circumcision. Late HDN occurs from week 2-12; the most common bleeding sites are intracranial, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal. </P>
<P>Vitamin K is commonly given prophylactically after birth for the prevention of HDN, but the preferred route is uncertain.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To review the evidence from randomized trials in order to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of classic and late HDN. Main questions are: Is one dose of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? Is there a significant difference between the oral route and the intramuscular route in preventing classic and late HDN? Are multiple oral doses of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN?</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All trials using random or quasi-random patient allocation, in which methods of vitamin K prophylaxis in infants were compared to each other, placebo or no treatment, were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were extracted independently by each author and were analysed with the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group, using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two eligible randomized trials, each comparing a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K with placebo or nothing, assessed effect on clinical bleeding. One dose of vitamin K reduced clinical bleeding at 1-7 days, including bleeding after circumcision, and improved biochemical indices of coagulation status. Eleven additional eligible randomized trials compared either a single oral dose of vitamin K with placebo or nothing, a single oral with a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K, or three oral doses with a single intramuscular dose. None of these trials assessed clinical bleeding. Oral vitamin K improved biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1-7 days. There was no evidence of a difference between the oral and intramuscular route in effects on biochemical indices of coagulation status. A single oral compared with a single intramuscular dose resulted in lower plasma vitamin K levels at two weeks and one month, whereas a 3-dose oral schedule resulted in higher plasma vitamin K levels at two weeks and at two months than did a single intramuscular dose.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>A single dose (1.0 mg) of intramuscular vitamin K after birth is effective in the prevention of classic HDN. Either intramuscular or oral (1.0 mg) vitamin K prophylaxis improves biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1-7 days. Neither intramuscular nor oral vitamin K has been tested in randomized trials with respect to effect on late HDN. Oral vitamin K, either single or multiple dose, has not been tested in randomized trials for its effect on either classic or late HDN.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 09:45:59 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Vitamin K deficiency can cause bleeding in an infant in the first hours to months of life. This is known as Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) or Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB). The diagnosis is based on bleeding in an infant with a prolonged prothrombin time with a normal fibrinogen level and platelet count. A rapid correction of the prothrombin time and/or cessation of bleeding after vitamin K administration are confirmative.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Sutor-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutor 1999</LINK> have recently suggested that the term "Hemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn" (HDN) should be replaced by "Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding" (VKDB), as neonatal bleeding is often not due to vitamin K deficiency and VKDB may occur after the 4-week neonatal period. However, VKDB may occur at any age, and in this review we use the term HDN to include bleeding in neonates and infants up to 4 months of age due to inadequate activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X), correctable by vitamin K replacement.</P>
<P>HDN is divided into three categories: early, classic and late HDN. Early HDN occurs within 24 hours after birth, cannot be prevented by postnatal vitamin K prophylaxis and falls outside the scope of this review. Classic HDN occurs on days one to seven. Common bleeding sites are gastrointestinal, cutaneous, nasal and from a circumcision (<LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 1999</LINK>). Late HDN occurs from week 2-12. The most common bleeding sites in this latter condition are intracranial, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal (<LINK REF="STD-Hathaway-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Hathaway 1991</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-von-Kries-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Kries 1998</LINK>). The estimated incidence of late HDN in Europe is approximately five to seven per 100,000 live births (<LINK REF="REF-von-Kries-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Kries 1998</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>HDN is caused by low plasma levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In the newborn the plasma concentrations of these factors are normally 30-60% of those of adults. They gradually reach adult values by six weeks of age. Administration of vitamin K immediately after birth prevents a further drop in these factors (<LINK REF="REF-Lane-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lane 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 1999</LINK>). Although placental transfer of vitamin K does occur, this is not always adequate. Administering vitamin K to mothers before birth does not seem to be a useful method to prevent deficiency in infants (<LINK REF="REF-Shearer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shearer 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Vitamin K is necessary for synthesis of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX and X in the liver. In the absence of vitamin K, the liver will synthesize inactive precursor proteins known as PIVKA's (proteins induced by the absence of vitamin K). Because vitamin K is fat-soluble, it can only be absorbed from the intestine in the presence of bile salts. The body's capacity to store vitamin K is very low and the half life of the vitamin K- dependent coagulation factors is short (<LINK REF="REF-Zipursky-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zipursky 1999</LINK>). Because of this, deficiency can occur quickly if the intake is not sufficient.</P>
<P>In nature there are two types of vitamin K: vitamin K1 or phylloquinone, which is found in foodstuffs like green vegetables, vegetable oils, and dairy products, and K2 or menaquinone, which is synthesized by the intestinal flora and only absorbed in small amounts. Vitamin K3 or menadione is a synthetic, water-soluble vitamin, which is no longer used as a prophylaxis in most parts of the world, because of its potential to cause hemolytic anemia with jaundice. The only source of vitamin K in newborns is food because the bowel is still sterile and there is no synthesis of K2 by bacterial flora. The amount of vitamin K ingested differs with the way the child is fed. Breast milk contains lower amounts of vitamin K than modern formula milk or cow's milk and the risk of developing vitamin K deficiency is higher for the breast-fed infant (<LINK REF="REF-Haroon-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haroon 1982</LINK>).</P>
<P>Trials that investigate HDN prophylaxis using vitamin K often measure biochemical outcomes rather than clinical ones, because of the low incidence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in neonates and infants. The International Normalised Ratio, INR, compares the blood coagulation status of an individual to that of the normal population; thus, an INR &gt;1 indicates that coagulation is slower than in the control group. The detection of PIVKA serves commonly as a biochemical outcome, with a high PIVKA level indicating vitamin K deficiency. The prothrombin time is dependent on several clotting factors, several of which are vitamin K dependent; thus, vitamin K deficiency results in a prolonged prothrombin time. The prothrombin index compares the prothrombin time of a subject to the normal prothrombin time. Prothrombin (antigen) is a measure for the serum level of prothrombin. Echis factor II and the ratio of factor II/ Echis factor II are outcomes that are rarely used. This method substitutes Echis carinatus snake venom for thromboplastin. A ratio of factor II/ Echis factor II is used to denote the amount of active prothrombin/ total prothrombin. When vitamin K is adequate, the ratio equals one. When vitamin K is deficient the ratio is &lt;1 (<LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Connor-1986" TYPE="STUDY">O'Connor 1986</LINK>).</P>
<P>In different parts of the world, various methods of vitamin K prophylaxis are practiced. The benefits of oral prophylaxis are that it is easy and non-invasive and it can also be administered by midwives. The main disadvantages are that absorption is not certain and can be adversely affected by vomiting or regurgitation. If multiple doses are prescribed, compliance can be a problem (<LINK REF="REF-Croucher-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croucher 1994</LINK>). Intramuscular prophylaxis is more invasive than oral prophylaxis and can cause pain and a muscular hematoma at the site of the injection.</P>
<P>Since Golding et al. reported an increased risk of developing childhood cancer after parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Golding-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1990</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Golding-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Golding 1992</LINK>) this has been a cause of concern. After the reports by Golding et al. there have been several studies of this relationship. Recently Ross and Davies (<LINK REF="REF-Ross-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2000</LINK>) reviewed the evidence in this field. They found no randomized or quasi randomized evidence with regard to the association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and cancer in childhood. Ten case-control studies were identified, of which seven found no relationship and three found a weak relationship of neonatal administration of intramuscular or intravenous vitamin K with the risk of solid childhood tumors or leukemia. Taken as a whole, these studies do not establish a causal relationship between these routes of administration and an increased risk of cancer.</P>
<P>One systematic review of prophylactic vitamin K for newborn infants was published in 1996 (<LINK REF="REF-Brousson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brousson 1996</LINK>). The authors studied both the randomized and non-randomized evidence. They concluded that administering vitamin K intramuscularly to newborns is effective and safe, and that an oral regimen of three doses of 1 to 2 mg, the first given at the first feeding, the second at 2 to 4 weeks and the third at 8 weeks, may be an acceptable alternative but needs further testing in large clinical trials.</P>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>Primary objective: <BR/>To review the evidence from randomized trials in order to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K prophylaxis in the prevention of classic and late HDN. <BR/>Main questions are: <BR/>Is one dose of vitamin K, given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN? <BR/>Is there a significant difference between the oral route and the intramuscular route in preventing classic and late HDN? <BR/>Are multiple oral doses of vitamin K , given after birth, able to significantly reduce the incidence of classic and late HDN?</P>

<P>Outcome:<BR/>Most of the studies mentioned that there were no cases of bleeding among infants included in the trial, without mentioning HDN as a prespecified outcome. In the present review HDN was only considered an outcome of the study if the authors specifically mentioned that the infants were assessed for bleeding. None of the studies had the power to detect clinically significant differences in incidence of HDN between treatment groups. The results in all these studies concern changes in prothrombin times, coagulation factors, plasma vitamin K levels and PIVKA II levels. A subsequent search for studies that relate these laboratory measurements to subsequent clinical outcomes produced no relevant studies. No randomized or quasi randomized evidence with regard to the association between parenteral vitamin K prophylaxis and cancer in childhood was found. Also we found no RCT's on the side effects of vitamin K prophylaxis, i.e. high plasma bilirubin levels or muscular hematomas. It was not possible to perform subgroup analyses on breast and bottle fed infants, since practically all the trials used bottle feeding as an exclusion criterion.</P>

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2008-10-16 09:46:00 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We retrieved two types of trial from the search. Two trials dealt with clinical outcomes, but mostly the trials dealt with surrogate, biochemical outcomes i.e. PIVKA II and plasma concentration of vitamin K. Overall, methodological quality was poor: randomisation procedures were often not described or inappropriate, and loss to follow up was high.</P>
<P>Some of the trials used different types of vitamin K (K1, K2, K3, and mixed micellar K1). We did not do subgroup analyses based on type of vitamin K. In a systematic literature search, we could find no evidence concerning the relation of type of vitamin K to its effectiveness in preventing HDN.</P>
<P>Some of the vitamin K doses compared in the trials are much higher than those commonly used in current practice. We found no evidence that a higher dose of vitamin K will improve coagulation status more than the commonly used dose of 1 mg. Also, we found no evidence that higher than physiological vitamin K plasma levels are better than physiological levels.</P>
<P>Because of the rarity of HDN, it would take an extremely large sample size to create significant results if clinical outcomes had been chosen in these trials. The follow-up would also be a problem, because to identify all the cases of classic and late HDN, the patients would have to be observed for at least three months. Although a relationship between the surrogate outcomes and HDN is expected on biological grounds, no evidence could be found in the literature that proved this relationship.</P>
<P>We retrieved only one trial comparing a multiple oral dose regimen to a single intramuscular dose of vitamin K; the outcomes studied were Vitamin K1 levels and INRs. As the correlation of vitamin K levels with the child's coagulation status is not known, and the coagulation status does not necessarily correlate with clinical outcomes, we cannot conclude that a single oral dose is as good as a single intramuscular dose. Although the randomised evidence summarized in this review shows no evidence of a difference in this respect, it cannot be deduced that there is evidence of no difference.</P>
<P>In the absence of evidence from randomized trials on the effect of vitamin K, intramuscular or oral, on late HDN, evidence from observational studies of large cohorts can be turned to. We did not do a systematic review of such studies but we note that several descriptive studies have been published on the relationship of method of vitamin K prophylaxis and HDN or VKDB that had large sample sizes and dealt with clinical outcomes. Many of these studies report observational comparisons of different multiple oral dose regimens, either with each other or with intramuscular vitamin K. For example, in The Netherlands, all healthy, breastfed infants receive l mg of oral vitamin K directly after birth and then 25 mcg orally daily from week 1 to week 13. This scheme is believed to be safe and efficient (<LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1993</LINK>), but there are no randomized controlled trials to support this.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1997</LINK> summarized the findings of over 2,000,000 infants that had been followed in different countries and after different methods of prophylaxis. This summary found that the 95% confidence interval of the total incidence of late VKDB of groups of children that received 1 mg of intramuscular vitamin K overlapped with that of the group that received 1 mg of oral vitamin K directly after birth and then 25 mcg orally daily from week 1 to week 13. This could indicate that the latter scheme of prophylaxis is as effective as intramuscular prophylaxis. But since these studies were not randomized controlled trials, their validity can be doubted. For example, the infants were born in different countries and the participating countries observed the infants over different time periods between the 1960's and the 1990's. It is not known how this could have affected the results.</P>
<P>Recent observational studies describe the occurrence of classic and late VKDB after a new regimen was introduced (<LINK REF="REF-Schubiger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubiger 1999</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Wariyara-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariyara 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1993</LINK>). Since clinical decisions must be made on the basis of the best available evidence, current local recommendations on routine administration of vitamin K to newborns are based on these observational studies. It is no surprise that these recommendations differ in regard to the route of administration, and/or number of repeated oral doses.</P>
<P>In the absence of randomized evidence, the recent reviews by <LINK REF="REF-Brousson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brousson 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Cornelissen-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cornelissen 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Ross-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ross 2000</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-von-Kries-1999a" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Kries 1999a</LINK>, and <LINK REF="REF-Wariyara-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariyara 2000</LINK> provide important information on which to base clinical decisions. Some of these reviews conclude that almost all cases of late VKDB are preventable with intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis administered once at birth, whereas a single oral dose given at birth may be less effective (<LINK REF="REF-Brousson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brousson 1996</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-von-Kries-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">von Kries 1999</LINK>). Repeated oral phytomenadione doses given to breast-fed infants either weekly (1 mg) or daily (25 mcg) seem to be as effective as intramuscular phytomenadione prophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Schubiger-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schubiger 1999</LINK>). A daily supplement would mimic what happens to the bottle fed baby because all formula milks are artificially fortified (<LINK REF="REF-Wariyara-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wariyara 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Maternal prophylaxis during breast feeding to enhance the content in breastmilk provides an alternative, rather more complex, strategy. So far, there is one randomized trial. This found that in exclusively breastfed infants who receive intramuscular phylloquinone at birth, the vitamin K status as measured by plasma phylloquinone and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin concentrations is improved by maternal oral supplements of 5 mg/d phylloquinone through the first 12 weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Greer-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 1999</LINK>). The efficacy of three oral two mg doses using the new mixed micellar preparation ('Konakion MM') remains to be established.</P>
<P>The method of prophylaxis that is chosen will depend not only on efficacy but on other factors as well. Cost will be an important factor in the decision for some countries. Another factor is the possibility for follow-up if repeated oral doses are to be given. This is especially important when advising daily vitamin K supplements for the first three months of life. Another issue is the acceptability of performing an invasive procedure on a neonate if it has not been proven absolutely necessary.<BR/>
</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>A single dose (1.0 mg) of intramuscular vitamin K after birth is effective in the prevention of classic HDN. Either intramuscular or oral (1.0 mg) vitamin K prophylaxis improves biochemical indices of coagulation status at 1-7 days. Neither intramuscular nor oral vitamin K has been tested in randomized trials with respect to effect on late HDN. Oral vitamin K, either single or multiple dose, has not been tested in randomized trials for its effect on either classic or late HDN.<BR/> <BR/>Different methods of prophylaxis have been tested in randomized trials for their effect on coagulation status and vitamin K levels, but these outcomes are of uncertain clinical importance. When single doses of oral and intramuscular vitamin K are compared, the only difference found is lower plasma vitamin K levels in the oral group at two weeks. Despite this, there is no evidence of a difference in indices of coagulation status. When three doses of oral vitamin K are compared to a single dose of intramuscular vitamin K, the plasma vitamin K levels are higher in the oral group at two weeks and two months, but, again, there is no evidence of a difference in coagulation status. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>There have been several trials done on this topic. Practically all of them measured surrogate outcomes. It does not seem necessary to do more studies on these outcomes comparing oral with intramuscular administration since clinical outcomes provide stronger evidence. A randomized controlled trial comparing multiple oral doses of vitamin K with a single intramuscular dose and assessing clinical outcomes could provide important evidence on the effects of this method of prophylaxis, since it might be an alternative for the more invasive intramuscular prophylaxis. The outcomes of such a trial would have to be classic and late HDN and, because the method in which the infants are fed can affect the results, this will have to be taken into account. HDN is rare and to acquire significant results, the sample size of a trial would have to be extremely large, up to 500,000 participants, making the likelihood of such a trial ever being done seem extremely remote. A systematic review is needed of all observational studies of acceptable quality which examine the effects of different methods of vitamin K prophylaxis on classic and late HDN.</P>
