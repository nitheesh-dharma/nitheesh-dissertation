<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-07-23 14:40:16 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Frances J Kellie">
<P>Pregnant women with very high blood pressure (hypertension) can reduce their blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs, but the most effective antihypertensive drug during pregnancy is unknown. The aim of antihypertensive therapy is to lower blood pressure quickly but safely for both the mother and her baby, avoiding sudden drops in blood pressure that can cause dizziness or fetal distress.</P>
<P>During pregnancy, a woman's blood pressure falls in the first few weeks then rises again slowly from around the middle of pregnancy, reaching pre-pregnancy levels at term. Pregnant women with very high blood pressure (systolic over 160 mmHg, diastolic 110 mmHg or more) are at risk of developing pre-eclampsia with associated kidney failure and premature delivery, or of having a stroke. The review of 35 randomised controlled trials including 3573 women (in the mid to late stages of pregnancy, where stated) found that while antihypertensive drugs are effective in lowering blood pressure, there is not enough evidence to show which drug is the most effective. Fifteen different comparisons of antihypertensive treatments were included in these 35 trials, which meant that some comparisons were made by single trials. Only one trial had a large number of participants. This trial compared nimodipine with magnesium sulphate and showed that high blood pressure persisted in 47% and 65% of women, respectively. Calcium channel blockers were associated with less persistent hypertension than with hydralazine and possibly less side-effects compared to labetalol. There is some evidence that diazoxide may result in a woman's blood pressure falling too quickly, and that ketanserin may not be as effective as hydralazine. Further research into the effects of antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy is needed.</P>

<P>Thirty-five trials (3573 women) with 15 comparisons were included. Women allocated calcium channel blockers were less likely to have persistent high blood pressure compared to those allocated hydralazine (six trials, 313 women; 8% versus 22%; risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.66). Ketanserin was associated with more persistent high blood pressure than hydralazine (three trials, 180 women; 27% versus 6%; RR 4.79, 95% CI 1.95 to 11.73), but fewer side-effects (three trials, 120 women; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.53) and a lower risk of HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and lowered platelets) syndrome (one trial, 44 women; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.81).</P>
<P>Labetalol was associated with a lower risk of hypotension compared to diazoxide (one trial 90 women; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.99) and a lower risk of caesarean section (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.02), although both were borderline for statistical significance.</P>
<P>Both nimodipine and magnesium sulphate were associated with a high incidence of persistent high blood pressure, but this risk was lower for nimodipine compared to magnesium sulphate (one trial, 1650 women; 47% versus 65%; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.93). Nimodipine was associated with a lower risk of respiratory difficulties (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.99), fewer side-effects (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) and less postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92) than magnesium sulphate. Stillbirths and neonatal deaths were not reported.</P>
<P>There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects of any other drugs.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:44:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Until better evidence is available the choice of antihypertensive should depend on the clinician's experience and familiarity with a particular drug; on what is known about adverse effects; and on women's preferences. Exceptions are nimodipine, magnesium sulphate (although this is indicated for women who require an anticonvulsant for prevention or treatment of eclampsia), diazoxide and ketanserin, which are probably best avoided.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-07-05 12:42:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-07-05 12:42:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>During normal pregnancy there are considerable changes in blood pressure. Within the first weeks the woman's blood pressure falls, largely due to a general relaxation of muscles within the blood vessels (<LINK REF="REF-de-Swiet-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Swiet 2002</LINK>). Cardiac output also increases. From around the middle of pregnancy blood pressure slowly rises again until, at term, blood pressure is close to the level it was before pregnancy. Blood pressure during pregnancy can be influenced by many other factors including, time of day, physical activity, position and anxiety. Modest rises in blood pressure alone may have little effect on the outcome of pregnancy, but high blood pressure is often associated with other complications. Of these, the most common is pre-eclampsia. This is a multisystem disorder of pregnancy which commonly presents with raised blood pressure and proteinuria (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2009</LINK>), and occurs in between two to eight per cent of pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1988</LINK>). Although the outcome for most of these pregnancies is good, women with pre-eclampsia have an increased risk of developing serious problems, such as kidney failure, liver failure, abnormalities of the clotting system, stroke, premature delivery (birth before 37 completed weeks), stillbirth or death of the baby in the first few weeks of life (<LINK REF="REF-Tuffnell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuffnell 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>In view of the many factors that can influence blood pressure, it is not surprising that there is often uncertainty about whether a specific abnormal measurement is potentially harmful for that woman. Once blood pressure rises above a certain level, however, there is a risk of direct damage to the blood vessel wall, regardless of what caused the rise. This risk is not specific to pregnancy, as it is similar for non-pregnant people with very high blood pressure. The level at which this risk merits mandatory antihypertensive therapy is usually considered to be 170 mmHg systolic blood pressure or 110 mmHg diastolic (<LINK REF="REF-Tuffnell-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tuffnell 2006</LINK>). If the woman has signs and symptoms associated with severe pre-eclampsia (such as hyperreflexia, severe headache, sudden onset of epigastric pain, or lowered platelets) a lower threshold for treatment may be recommended (<LINK REF="REF-CEMD_x002d_UK-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEMD-UK 2011</LINK>). The possible consequences of such high blood pressure for the mother include kidney failure, liver failure and cerebrovascular haemorrhage (stroke). In the UK, for example, stoke resulting from severe hypertension was the single most common cause of maternal death associated with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-CEMD_x002d_UK-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CEMD-UK 2011</LINK>). For the baby, risks include fetal distress due to impaired blood supply across the placenta, and placental abruption (separation of the placenta from the wall of the womb before birth).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-04-24 11:24:50 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Once blood pressure reaches 170 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic, the woman is at increased risk of harmful effects. There is therefore a general consensus that she should receive antihypertensive drugs, to lower her blood pressure, and that she should be in a hospital. The aim of treatment is to quickly bring about a smooth reduction in blood pressure to levels that are safe for both mother and baby, but avoiding any sudden drops that may in themselves cause problems such as dizziness or fetal distress.</P>
<P>A wide range of antihypertensive drugs have been compared for management of severe hypertension during pregnancy. The most commonly recommended drugs include hydralazine, labetalol and nifedipine (<LINK REF="REF-Lindheimer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindheimer 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lowe-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lowe 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Magee-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2011</LINK>) and there is most experience with these.</P>
<P>In general, maternal side-effects are not different from those in the non-pregnant state, and are listed in pharmacological texts. All drugs used to treat hypertension in pregnancy cross the placenta, and so may affect the fetus directly by means of their action within the fetal circulation, or indirectly by their effect on uteroplacental perfusion.</P>
<P>The care of women with very high blood pressure during pregnancy is often complex.For women who have pre-eclampsia, there is also the question of whether there is additional benefit from prophylactic anticonvulsant drugs, and this question is covered in the review 'Anticonvulsants for women with pre-eclampsia' (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010</LINK>). In addition, other Cochrane reviews relevant to the care of women with severe hypertension include plasma volume expansion (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 1999</LINK>), and steroids for HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and lowered platelets) syndrome (<LINK REF="REF-Woudstra-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woudstra 2010</LINK>). Once blood pressure is controlled, in many cases a decision will be made to deliver the baby fairly soon, particularly if the pregnancy is at or near to term. If the baby is very premature, the blood pressure responds well to initial treatment, and there are no other complicating factors, the pregnancy may be continued with the hope that this will improve outcome for the baby. This issue of timing of delivery for severe pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks' gestation is covered by a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Churchill-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Churchill 2002</LINK>). Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in pregnancy has been reviewed by <LINK REF="REF-Abalos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Abalos 2007</LINK>.</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-04-18 15:15:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Very high blood pressure needs to be lowered to protect the woman. This needs to be done in a controlled manner, to avoid complications for the mother and baby, While all antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure, their comparative benefits and adverse effects when used for very high blood pressure during pregnancy remain uncertain.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Cluster-randomised trials</HEADING>
<P>Although cluster-randomised trials of interventions for treatment of very high blood pressure are unlikely, if identified in future updates and they meet all other eligibility criteria, they will be included along with individually-randomised trials. We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>) using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC. If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information. We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.</P>

<P>For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:46:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>). We used fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials&#8217; populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful. The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and we planned to discuss the clinical implications of treatment effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials.</P>
<P>If we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of  T² and I².</P>

<SUBGROUP_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-04-24 11:29:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>In future updates, if we identify substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We will consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it is, use random-effects analysis to produce it.</P>
<P>Data are presented by class of drug. In addition, the following subgroup analyses will be conducted when sufficient data become available:</P>

Nine studies (2292 women) also stated that the women had either 'proteinuria' or 'pre-eclampsia' as an inclusion criterion. Several trials specified a minimum gestational age for recruitment, and this ranged from 20 weeks to 36 weeks. Others stated that delivery was planned for soon after treatment. One small trial (30 women) (<LINK REF="STD-N-Ireland-1991" TYPE="STUDY">N Ireland 1991</LINK>) had minimum entry criteria of a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg but was included as most women were stated to have had labile blood pressure, proteinuria and symptoms. Another study included 150 women for whom first line therapy with methyldopa had not been successful (<LINK REF="STD-South-Africa-2000" TYPE="STUDY">South Africa 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>The antihypertensive drugs evaluated in these trials were hydralazine, calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, nimodipine, nicardipine and isradipine), labetalol, atenolol, methyldopa, diazoxide, prostacyclin, ketanserin, urapidil, magnesium sulphate, prazosin and isosorbide. There are 15 comparisons in the review. Hydralazine was the most common comparator, being compared with another drug (labetalol, calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin, diazoxide, ketanserin or rapidil) in six comparisons. Most drugs were given either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) except nifedipine, nimodipine, isosorbide and prazosin which were given orally. Dosage varied considerably between studies, in both amount and duration of therapy.</P>
<P>The primary hypothesis for the one large study (<LINK REF="STD-Nimodipine-SG-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Nimodipine SG 2003</LINK>) was to compare the effects on prevention of eclampsia, and this study is also included in the review of magnesium sulphate and other anticonvulsants for prevention of eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010</LINK>). It is also included here as it met the inclusion criteria for the review, and a secondary hypothesis in the trial was to compare the antihypertensive effects of these two drugs.</P>
<P>All but two studies were single comparisons comparing one type of antihypertensive drug with a different hypertensive drug. One study included three comparison groups (atenolol versus ketanserin versus methyldopa) (<LINK REF="STD-Argentina-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Argentina 1990</LINK>). We undertook analysis for each single pair comparison, <I>see</I> Analyses 14, 15 and 16. One trial included four comparison groups (IV labetalol versus IV hydralazine versus oral nifedipine versus sublingual nifedipine) (<LINK REF="STD-Switzerland-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Switzerland 2012</LINK>). However, there were no outcome data that could be included in any analysis.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Most of the drugs included in this review reduce high blood pressure. This is not surprising, as there is no reason why drugs that are known to reduce blood pressure in people who are not pregnant should not also reduce blood pressure for women who are pregnant. Currently, for women with very high blood pressure during pregnancy there is insufficient evidence to conclude that any one antihypertensive drug is clearly better than another.</P>
<P>Probably the three most commonly recommended drugs for very high blood pressure during pregnancy are hydralazine, labetalol and the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Data in this review do not suggest any significant differential effects, with the exception of for calcium channel blockers, which were associated with less persistent hypertension than hydralazine and possibly less side-effects compared to labetalol.</P>
<P>Hydralazine was associated with a significant increase in the risk of HELLP syndrome when compared with ketanserin (46% versus 9%) however, such a high level of HELLP syndrome is difficult to explain with hydralazine use, and is in contrast to the low risk of HELLP syndrome in another study comparing hydralazine with labetalol where incidence of HELLP is 2% in both arms. There was insufficient evidence for any difference among these three drugs for other more substantive outcomes for the mother or baby.</P>
<P>From the data presented here it is clear that nimodipine, ketanserin, and high-dose diazoxide have serious disadvantages, and so should not be used for women with very high blood pressure during pregnancy as better options are readily available. Nimodipine is generally no longer used to control high blood pressure in the non-pregnant population, but instead, is used for improvement of neurological outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage (<LINK REF="REF-Tomassoni-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomassoni 2008</LINK>). Diazoxide given as repeated 75 mg bolus injections, seems to be associated with a greater risk of dropping the blood pressure so low that treatment is required to bring it back up again, with an associated increased risk of caesarean section, when compared with labetalol. Smaller doses may not have this disadvantage, as observed in a recent study in which 15 mg bolus injections were compared, with no ill effect on hypotension (<LINK REF="REF-Hennessy-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hennessy 2007</LINK>). Ketanserin was far more likely to be associated with persistent hypertension than hydralazine.</P>
<P>In the one large trial that compared nimodipine with magnesium sulphate, 54% of women allocated magnesium sulphate had persistent hypertension. So, although it is clearly of value for seizure prophylaxis in women with pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010</LINK>), magnesium sulphate should not be used for control of very high blood pressure. Nearly half the women in the nimodipine arm also had persistently high blood pressure, as well as increased risk of eclampsia compared with magnesium sulphate</P>
<P>It would also seem sensible to avoid chlorpromazine. Although only one small trial has compared chlorpromazine with nifedipine, this antipsychotic drug has a complex mode of action and impacts on several organ systems. One well known side-effect is convulsions, which is a serious disadvantage for women with hypertension during pregnancy. That this concern is real, rather than theoretical, is demonstrated by the review of magnesium sulphate versus lytic cocktail (which includes chlorpromazine) for women with eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Duley-2010a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duley 2010a</LINK>). This review shows a clear increase in the risk of further seizures associated with lytic cocktail compared to magnesium sulphate.</P>
<P>One trial did compare an antihypertensive, the nitrate isosorbide, with placebo for women with very high blood pressure (<LINK REF="STD-Mexico-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Mexico 2000</LINK>). This study was excluded from the review, as our objective was to compare one antihypertensive drug with another. In this study, 60 women with diastolic blood pressure 110 mmHg or above after 20 minutes rest were randomised to either sublingual isosorbide or placebo. Both groups had an intravenous infusion of Hartmann solution. Outcome was assessed over one hour, during which time one woman allocated isosorbide had hypotension. At the end of the one-hour study, mean blood pressure was substantially lower for women allocated isosorbide compared to placebo, there were no episodes of fetal distress or imminent eclampsia, and similar numbers of women in both groups complained of headache. Outcome after one hour is not reported. This study does show that isosorbide lowers blood pressure, but the clinically important question is not whether it is better than placebo, but whether it has any substantive advantages over other drugs in widespread clinical use.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Any effect on a comparative improvement in control of blood pressure would be of far greater clinical importance if it was reflected in comparative improvements in other more substantive outcomes, such as stroke, serious maternal morbidity and perinatal death. With the exception of the large trial comparing nimodipine with magnesium sulphate, all the trials to date have been small, with few outcomes other than control of blood pressure reported.</P>
<P>During pregnancy, there are additional issues other than control of blood pressure, however, such as avoiding a precipitous drop in blood pressure that might cause problems for the unborn baby, side-effects that are similar to symptoms of worsening pre-eclampsia and so may delay recognition of the need to intervene, not lowering the blood pressure too far as this might also compromise blood supply across the placenta to the baby, and if the drug itself crosses the placenta not causing harm to the baby. There are relatively few data on the comparative effects of the alternative drugs on these other outcomes.</P>
<P>Surprisingly few studies have reported maternal side-effects. Common side-effects included severe headache and nausea, symptoms which are similar to those of imminent eclampsia and so may make clinical management more difficult. There has been concern that rapid-release nifedipine capsules may increase the risk of hypotension, and in some countries these have been withdrawn from use. One small trial (64 women) compared nifedipine capsules with slower and longer-acting nifedipine tablets (<LINK REF="STD-Australia-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Australia 2002</LINK>). Outcome was assessed after 90 minutes; similar proportions of women had persistent high blood pressure (11% allocated capsules versus 9% allocated tablets), and there was less hypotension amongst those allocated tablets although this did not achieve statistical significance (3/31 versus 1/33; risk ratio 3.19, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 29.10).</P>
<P>There were insufficient data for the planned subgroup analysis by whether the severe hypertension was associated with proteinuria.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>The overall methodological quality of the trials contributing data to the review was low to moderate and has been summarised in <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>. While none of the studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias for all domains, several trials did not provide clear information on methods. Fifteen of the 35 included trials failed to describe adequately the methods used for random sequence generation and allocation concealment and were assessed as unclear risk of bias. Lack of blinding was a problem in all of the included studies; blinding women and clinical staff to a randomised group is not feasible with this type of intervention. The impact of lack of blinding is difficult to judge. Knowledge of allocation could have affected other aspects of care and the assessment of many outcomes, particularly blood pressure. Loss to follow-up was not always described, but did not appear to be a major source of bias in the majority of studies.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>Problems with interpreting the data in this review include differences in the way persistent hypertension was defined for each study, and differences in the clinical characteristics of the women. For example, definitions for persistent hypertension included time taken to achieve target blood pressure, ability to achieve target blood pressure within a certain time period, and need for additional medication. These differences are reflected in the wide range of frequency of persistent high blood pressure across studies. For example, in the five categories with hydralazine as a comparator the frequency of persistent high blood pressure amongst women allocated hydralazine ranged from 0% to 20%, while amongst women allocated an alternative drug, it ranged from 0% to 60%. As few studies had blinding either of the intervention or the assessment of outcomes, there is considerable potential for bias in the assessment of blood pressure.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Denise Atherton">
<P>An alternative analysis of this topic concluded that the data do not support hydralazine as first line treatment for very high blood pressure in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Magee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magee 2003</LINK>), and recommended future trials compare labetalol with nifedipine. However, that analysis included quasi-randomised studies and women with very high blood pressure after delivery. Once the analysis is restricted to include only studies with less potential for bias and women with very high blood pressure during pregnancy or labour, as in our review, the data are insufficient to support the conclusion that labetalol is better than hydralazine.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-07-05 13:20:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is no clear evidence that one antihypertensive is preferable to the others for improving outcome for women with very high blood pressure during pregnancy, and their babies. Until better evidence is available, the best choice of drug for an individual woman probably depends on the experience and familiarity of her clinician with a particular drug, and on what is known about adverse maternal and fetal side-effects. Probably best avoided are magnesium sulphate (although this is indicated for women who require an anticonvulsant for prevention or treatment of eclampsia), high-dose diazoxide, ketanserin, nimodipine and chlorpromazine.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-07-22 15:49:55 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Well designed large trials are needed to make reliable comparisons of the maternal, fetal and neonatal effects of antihypertensives in common clinical practice. Ideally, clinicians should compare an agent they are familiar with in their routine clinical practice with a promising alternative that is available locally, or would be likely to become available if shown to be preferable. Many hospitals around the world continue to use hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine as the first choice for women with very high blood pressure. The priority is therefore to compare these drugs with each other, or other more promising alternatives.</P>
<P>Future trials should measure outcomes that are important to women and their babies, rather than attempting to document relatively subtle differences in the effects on blood pressure. These outcomes should include persistent high blood pressure, need for additional antihypertensive drugs, further episodes of severe hypertension, low blood pressure, side-effects, severe maternal morbidity (such as stroke, eclampsia, renal failure, and coagulopathy), need for magnesium sulphate, mode of delivery, length of stay in hospital, mortality for the baby, and admission and length of stay in a special/intensive care nursery. In order to reliably estimate differential effects on these substantive outcomes, high quality large studies will be required. There should also be long-term follow-up to assess possible effects on the woman's risk of cardiovascular problems after discharge from hospital, and on growth and development of the child. This is relevant not only because these drugs may cross the placenta, but also because too rapid lowering of blood pressure with a placenta that has marginal functional reserve could lead to ischaemic brain injury and long-term neurodevelopment problems. Alongside data from randomised trials, mechanisms need to be developed to monitor possible rare adverse events related to in utero exposure to antihypertensive agents.</P>
<P>Interpretation of the results of future studies would be made easier and more clinically meaningful by the use of similar definitions for key outcomes, such as persistent high blood pressure, and hypotension. Studies that recruit women both before and after delivery should report outcome data separately for these two groups of women. Outcomes should also be reported separately for women with and without proteinuria at trial entry.</P>
<P>Once better information is available about the relative merits and hazards of agents already in widespread use, it will become possible to compare new drugs with the best of the traditional agents in well designed randomised trials.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Selection of studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently evaluated studies to assess eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. If there was no agreement, the third author was asked to independently assess the study for inclusion. If agreement was still not reached, the study was excluded until clarification could be obtained from the authors.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Assessment of methodological quality of included studies</HEADING>
<P>Two authors independently extracted data on trial characteristics. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Quality of each included study was assessed using the criteria in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook (<LINK REF="REF-Clarke-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clarke 2002</LINK>).</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(i) Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)</HEADING>
<P>Method for generating the randomisation sequence was described for each trial. Studies with a quasi-random design were excluded. Concealment of allocation was assessed for each trial, with adequate concealment graded A, unclear B and clearly inadequate concealment C. Studies with clearly inadequate concealment of allocation were excluded. Where the method of allocation concealment was unclear, authors were contacted to provide further details.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(ii) Performance bias (blinding of participants, researchers and outcome assessment)</HEADING>
<P>Quality scores for blinding of the assessment of outcome were assigned to each reported outcome using the following criteria (these scores are displayed in the methods column of the 'Characteristics of included studies' table):</P>
<P>(A) double blind, neither investigator nor participant knew or were likely to guess the allocated treatment;<BR/>(B) single blind, either the investigator or the participant knew the allocation. Or the trial may be described as double blind, but side-effects of one or other treatment mean that it is likely that for a significant proportion (more that 20 per cent) of participants the allocation could be correctly identified, or the method for blinding is not described;<BR/>(C) no blinding, both investigator and participant knew (or were likely to guess) the allocated treatment, or blinding not mentioned.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">(iii) Attrition bias (loss of participants, eg withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)</HEADING>
<P>For completeness of follow-up, scores were assigned using the following criteria:</P>
<P>(A) less than three per cent of participants excluded from the analysis;<BR/>(B) three per cent to 9.9 per cent of participants excluded from the analysis;<BR/>(C) 10 per cent to 19.9 per cent of participants excluded from the analysis.</P>
<P>Excluded: If not possible to enter data based on intention to treat or 20% or more participants were excluded from the analysis of that outcome.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction and data entry</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors extracted data on outcomes, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. If agreement was not reached, that item was excluded until further clarification was available from the authors. Data were entered onto the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>) and checked for accuracy. There was no blinding of authorship or results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analyses</HEADING>
<P>Statistical analyses were carried out using Review Manager (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2000</LINK>). Results were presented as summary relative risk with 95% confidence intervals and, if relevant, as risk difference and number needed to treat to benefit. The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic was used to assess heterogeneity between trials. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results were pooled using a fixed-effect model. If substantial heterogeneity was detected (I<SUP>2</SUP> more than 50%), possible causes were explored and subgroup analyses for the main outcomes performed. Heterogeneity that was not explained by subgroup analyses was modelled using random-effects analysis, where appropriate. Possible explanations for the variation, such as study quality and women's characteristics at trial entry, were explored.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>When appropriate, in future updates, we will carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of trial quality based on concealment of allocation, by excluding studies with unclear allocation concealment (rated B).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Data are presented by class of drug. In addition, the following subgroup analyses will be conducted when sufficient data become available:</P>
<OL>
<LI>treatment regimen within each class of drug;</LI>
<LI>whether severe hypertension alone, or severe hypertension plus proteinuria at trial entry.</LI>
