<TITLE>Not enough evidence to support using low level laser therapy alongside drug treatments for tuberculosis</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 11:37:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious bacterial infection that can affect different parts of the body; most frequently it affects the lungs (pulmonary TB). Some bacteria can be drug resistant, and some people may have the infection alongside another medical condition. People suffer from severe cough, weakness and sweats, and some people still die from TB even though effective drug treatment has been around for many years. It is has been proposed that low level laser therapy may help the drugs to be more effective. There are a number of different devices for giving the laser treatment, some giving the treatment externally (to the body or acupuncture sites), some using for internal treatment (for blood or lungs) at varying doses. The review of trials found only one randomized trial where the data were poorly reported, and it did not clarify the potential benefits and harms. Low level laser therapy should only be used in randomized controlled trials until its value is evaluated.</P>

<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2009-11-06 11:43:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>The main treatment for tuberculosis is antituberculous drugs. Low level laser therapy is used as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs, predominantly in the former Soviet Union and India.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-06 11:43:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-02 14:20:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Low level laser therapy as a treatment for tuberculosis has been the subject of published studies since the early 1990s (<LINK REF="REF-Vlassov-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlassov 2002</LINK>). It has been used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Badalov-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Badalov 1990</LINK>) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Iagafarova-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Iagafarova 1998</LINK>) caused by drug sensitive and multiple-drug-resistant mycobacteria (<LINK REF="REF-Bhagwanani-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhagwanani 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lomachenkov-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lomachenkov 1998</LINK>), and people who have tuberculosis in addition to an underlying medical condition such as endobronchitis (<LINK REF="STD-Shesterina-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Shesterina 1991</LINK>). The mechanism of action of low level laser therapy in treating tuberculosis is not known, but it has been hypothesized that it involves the modulation of "information exchange between the human body and universe" or have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anaesthetizing action within the human body (<LINK REF="REF-Illarionov-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illarionov 1998</LINK>).</P>
<P>A variety of different laser devices have been used for treating tuberculosis. They include gas lasers, such as the helium-neon laser and the nitrogen laser, and semiconductor lasers, such as the diode pulse beam arsenic-gallium laser. The devices typically deliver 2 mW to 200 mW, with the power density typically ranging from 0.05 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> to 5 W/cm<SUP>2</SUP> (<LINK REF="REF-Alt-Med-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alt Med 2002</LINK>). The laser therapy may be applied externally, such as to acupuncture points or surfaces of the body close to the internal organs affected by tuberculosis (anatomical projections of affected areas), or internally, such as to the blood or to the lung cavities or to bronches. Short external applications (usually less than one minute) are described as stimulating, while longer applications (greater than five minutes) are described as relaxing (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Breugel-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Breugel 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Illarionov-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Illarionov 1998</LINK>). The lasers may be used in conjunction with an invasive procedure such as a bronchoscopy.</P>
<P>The main treatment for tuberculosis is a course of antituberculous drugs taken over a period of at least six months (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1999</LINK>). This lengthy treatment course can make it difficult for people to adhere to the full course and can increase the frequency of cases where the <I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> bacteria, which cause tuberculosis, develop resistance to the antituberculous drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Yew-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yew 1999</LINK>). Lasers seem to be mainly used for treating tuberculosis in countries of the former Soviet Union and India in the belief that they may reduce the length of the treatment or increase the frequency of cure (<LINK REF="REF-Vlassov-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlassov 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review summarizes evaluates the available evidence on the role of low level laser therapy as an adjunct to antituberculous drugs for treating tuberculosis.</P>

<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare low level laser therapy plus antituberculous drugs with antituberculous drugs alone for treating tuberculosis.</P>

<STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 11:37:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Of eight potentially relevant studies, we excluded seven studies, six conducted in Russia and one in Azerbaijan, for the reasons described in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>', and included one randomized controlled trial (<LINK REF="STD-Puri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Puri 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Puri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Puri 2003</LINK> was conducted in New Delhi, India and enrolled 130 participants for an evaluation of the gallium-arsenide laser in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. All participants received the same basic antituberculosis drug regimen in addition to either the laser treatment or sham laser treatment. Those receiving the laser had daily treatment for 10 days and were either admitted to hospital or attended the outpatient clinic. The treatment was external with the location guided by chest radiographs. Further details are provided in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'. The participants in the sham irradiation control group used the same machine without switching it on.</P>
<P>The trial measured a number of outcomes of which the sputum conversion and clinical improvement are relevant to this review; however, no data are available for the latter outcome. Although the trialists did not report adverse events or death as outcome measures, some data were reported that relate to these. The trial report provided information on these outcome measures, but the data were insufficient for analysis. The attempts to contact the author for clarification were unsuccessful. The trial report did not provide details on the group that each of the participants were randomized into or which group those participants that left the trial were from; the only details on group allocation was for the 65 participants who were cured (<I>see</I> <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>

<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Puri-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Puri 2003</LINK> was described as a randomized controlled trial, but there is no information on how the allocation sequence was generated. It was also unclear how the allocation was concealed. The participants were blinded to the intervention, but it is unclear if this was the case also for the treatment providers and outcome assessors. In terms of the inclusion of the randomized participants available for the analysis of the time to sputum conversion (a primary outcome measure), the trialists have reported that 53.85% (70/130) of the enrolled participants completed treatment, but we are unsure to which treatment group five of these participants were allocated.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-06 11:37:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>The original version of this review included a search for and description of non-randomized studies on low level laser therapy for tuberculosis (<LINK REF="REF-Vlassov-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlassov 2002</LINK>). Over 3500 participants and 60 researchers from India and countries throughout the former Soviet Union were involved in the 29 studies, which tended to report promising results. Since this time we have continued our search of the literature and have been surprised to find that only one randomized controlled trial has since been conducted. It has been disappointing to find that the description of the methods and results in the trial report meant that we were unable to summarize the findings. Any further studies conducted in this area must be well-designed randomized controlled trials, which should be reported in full to allow the wider scientific community to gain a better understanding of the potential value of this intervention.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>The one small randomized controlled trial that evaluated low level laser therapy for treating tuberculosis was poorly reported and does not clarify the potential benefits or harms of this intervention. The use of this intervention is not supported by reliable evidence.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Researchers need to focus on conducting well-designed randomized controlled trials to assess low level laser therapy for treating tuberculosis. The trialists must ensure that all participants give their consent, use pragmatic outcome measures including adverse events, and provide a detailed description of any antituberculous drugs used concurrently with the laser therapy (these should be the same in both the intervention and control groups). The trials should be reported in full and preferably conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>).</P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Aim of investigation. To study the efficacy of complex antibacterial therapy of first discovered destructive pulmonary tuberculosis including endobronchial laser therapy. Material &amp;amp; methods. Under observation were 577-patients with first discovered destructive pulmonary tuberculosis in whom endobronchial laser therapy was used by help of helium-neon laser LG-111. Irradiation dose during the session made-up 2,1 - 3 J. Results. By the end of the 4 month of antibacterial and laser therapy clinical recovery of bronchial tuberculosis was observed in the majority of main group patients, while in control group only in 1/3 of patients. Degree II-III stenosis and scarry transformation of mucous membrane in main group patients were formed significantly rare, than in control one (12,7% and 48,0%, accordingly) . After laser therapy closure of decay cavities from 3 to 5cm in diameter was achieved in 27,7% of main group patients in 4 months and in 34,4% - on the 6 month of treatment, while in patients of control group a great part of closures of decay cavities (67,9%) was noted after 6 months of treatment and later&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="JOURNAL_ARTICLE">

<P>Excluded because the intervention and control groups did not receive the same baseline treatments: the control group received "pathogenetic" interventions (methyluracil, insulin, sodium thiosulphate) and no LLLT; the intervention group received no "pathogenetic" interventions, but did receive LLLT. The report in the full text dissertation says participants were distributed into two groups using a random numbers table. Concealment of allocation and blinding were not mentioned. Of the 25 participants in the intervention group, 6 were excluded because of poor adherence and discharged from the hospital between 1 to 3 months of therapy. No participants were excluded from the control group. The outcomes presented for the intervention group were calculated only for the participants that remained in the study. The trial author did not respond to our requests for further information</P>
