Presumably this is to determine whether there is an baseline imbalance across the groups? If the authors can provide a reason for including this data in this section I would be willing to listen to their argument so I have for now decided not to delete this, but to relegate it to the last of the comparisons. Ideally this should come out of the review though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Are these different surgical approaches really equally effective on survival outcomes? &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical imprecision needs to be taken account of more fully in the reporting of the findings of this review. Overall survival is rated as high quality. There is no statistically significant difference, but the effect estimate for 5 year follow-up indicates that the relative effect ranges from a reduction in the odds of disease free survival of 24% to an increase of 38%. In absolute terms based on the SoF table this translates to an absolute reduction of 6% to an increase of 6%. Is this variation when expressed in absolute terms sufficient to downgrade for imprecision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By not downgrading for imprecision the authors are expressing a high degree of confidence that the effects of these different procedures are equivalent (or at least LTME is not inferior to OTME). In the absence of a clear indication as to what might be considered an important difference, might this not be considered an indication that the estimated effect on mortality is imprecise and does not rule out a survival benefit in either direction? Two large trials are ongoing and others including COLOR are likely to contribute to this result in future updates. Unless the authors are prepared to state that the 6% difference in 5 year mortality in either direction is unimportant (and state this in the section Quality of the evidence), I would be inclined to downgrade for imprecision here. This would change some of the reporting of the lack of effect (which would be attributable to statistical imprecision rather than equivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar issues are likely to affect a number of the other outcomes including the 10 year survival rate (which has an OR of 1.25), OS (which has an OR of 1.15), local occurrences (0.89) and retrieval of lymph nodes (unless the differences at either end of the confidence interval are not important).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have made other changes around this in the abstract and pending confirmation around the effect on mortality, the PLS will definitely need to be revised. Text highlighted in yellow indicates where I have concerns about the statement of 'no difference' between the interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Overall completeness and applicability of the evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section is weak and I have provisionally populated this with information that had previously been included under Summary of main results. This section should really carry a comment on how far the studies enabled the authors to address the objective of the review. This should feature something about the external validity of the study populations, where the procedures were carried out, the relevance of the outcomes identified by the review were used in the included studies (rather than just restating what they were). The text that I have now moved here should be retained as a comment on current practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2014-04-02 09:41:32 +0200" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Sandra Vennix" REVIEW_NO="086" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.6 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="4.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-04-02 09:39:50 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Colorectal (large bowel) cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world. The risk of developing rectal cancer increases with age and is most common in people around 70 years of age. The treatment consists of complete surgical resection of the tumour and surrounding tissue by a technique called total mesorectal excision (TME), sometimes combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This surgery can be performed by either normal open abdominal surgery with a large incision or by keyhole laparoscopic surgery with several small incisions for the instruments and camera. For colon cancer, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results. These results are expected to be equal for rectal surgery. However, surgery for rectal cancer is technically more difficult than for colon cancer due to the location deeper in the pelvis and close to important nerves. Therefore a complete and safe resection of the tumour should be guaranteed, this is important to reduce the risk of recurrence of the tumour and could be tested by assessing recurrence rates and patient survival in the long term.</P>
<P>In this updated review, we have assessed all randomised studies of laparoscopic and open TME for rectal cancer, to compare and combine their results. We included 14 trials reporting on a total of 3528 patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery. In 14.5% of those having laparoscopic surgery needed conversion to open surgery by a large incision in the abdomen due to difficulties or problems during the procedure.</P>
<P>There is currently moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) has similar effects to open TME (OTME) on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The estimated effect was imprecise and further research could impact on our confidence int this result. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay. We found that pain was lower in the LTME group and that resumption of diet was better. We did not find clear evidence of a difference in quality of life between the two groups, but costs were higher for LTME. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to our understanding of the effects of these surgical approaches on long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.</P>

<P>Colorectal cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world. For colon carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results with equal oncologic results. These short-term benefits are expected to be similar for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remained controversial due to the lack of definitive long-term results. Thus, the expected short-term benefits can only be of interest when oncological results are at least equal.</P>

<P>We identified 45 references out of 953 search results, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3528 rectal cancer patients. We did not consider the risk of bias of the included studies to have impacted on the quality of the evidence. Data were analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle with a mean conversion rate of 14.5% (range 0% to 35%) in the laparoscopic group.<BR/>There was moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic and open TME had similar effects on five-year disease-free survival (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.76 to1.38, 4 studies, N = 943). The estimated effects of laparoscopic and open TME on local recurrence and overall survival were similar, although confidence intervals were wide, both with moderate quality evidence (local recurrence: OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.57 to1.39 and overall survival rate: OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.87 to1.52). There was moderate to high quality evidence that the number of resected lymph nodes and surgical margins were similar between the two groups.<BR/>For the short-term results, length of hospital stay was reduced by two days (95% CI -3.22 to -1.10), moderate quality evidence), and the time to first defecation was shorter in the LTME group (-0.86 days; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.54). There was moderate quality evidence that 30 days morbidity were similar in both groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1). There were fewer wound infections (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93) and fewer bleeding complications (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.93) in the LTME group.<BR/>There was no clear evidence of any differences in quality of life after LTME or OTME regarding functional recovery, bladder and sexual function. The costs were higher for LTME with differences up to GBP 2000 for direct costs only.<BR/>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-04-01 11:48:25 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We have found moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has similar effects to open TME on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and further research could impact on our confidence in this result. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of recovery for non-locally advanced rectal cancer. Currently results are consistent in showing a similar disease-free survival and overall survival, and for recurrences after at least three years and up to 10 years, although due to imprecision we cannot rule out superiority of either approach. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to a more robust analysis of long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-04-01 10:02:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-04-01 10:02:46 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The incidence of rectal cancer in the western world is 28% to 35% of the total colorectal cancer incidence, with 15 to 25/100,000 new patients per year for both men and women. The risk increases with age, with a median age of 70 years at the time of diagnosis; the associated mortality is between 4 and 10 per 100,000 per year (<LINK REF="REF-Glimelius-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glimelius 2013</LINK>). Symptoms suggesting rectal cancer typically include changes in bowel habits, the feeling of incomplete emptying, rectal bleeding, anaemia or weight loss. The diagnosis can be made by tumour biopsy during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. If rectal cancer is confirmed, the extent of the disease is examined by imaging of the chest and liver for signs of metastases, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and/or endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) are done to determine the degree of rectal wall and mesorectal fascia invasion. The majority of rectal carcinomas are adenocarcinoma (95% to 98%), usually arising from an adenoma (<LINK REF="REF-Glimelius-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Glimelius 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Monson-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Monson 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-03-21 11:32:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Complete resection of rectal cancer can be achieved by a sphincter-preserving anterior resection (AR, rectosigmoid resection) or an abdominoperineal resection (APR). Both had high local recurrence rates until the introduction of the total mesorectal excision (TME) (<LINK REF="REF-Heald-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heald 1986</LINK>). Total mesorectal excision achieves a complete removal of the rectum together with its draining lymphatics, and results in low rates of recurrence. Despite the successful introduction of laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures for the resection of colonic cancer, surgeons have been more reluctant to introduce laparoscopic TME due to the technically demanding resection plane.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-24 11:59:59 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted TME offers several theoretical advantages compared to open resection. It may be associated with less blood loss, faster recovery, early feeding and a lower morbidity rate, as shown in laparoscopic colonic surgery (<LINK REF="STD-Braga-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pikarsky-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pikarsky 2002</LINK>). The magnified view of the pelvis afforded by the laparoscope may facilitate identification of the autonomic nerves and thus prevent unintentional injury of these nerves. However, these advantages of LTME are only beneficial to people with rectal cancer when local recurrence and disease-free survival rates are at least similar to those achieved with OTME.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-02-11 10:23:27 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The introduction of laparoscopy 20 years ago has caused major changes in colorectal surgery. For benign disease, such as diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease, laparoscopy has become the surgical technique of choice for its benefits in recovery, complication rate and cosmetic results. Only recently, sufficient evidence has become available showing laparoscopic surgery is safe for the treatment of colonic cancer. Four large randomised trials (472 to 1076 participants) could not show any differences in quality of resection and long-term recurrence and survival rates between laparoscopic and open surgery for colon cancer (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-COST-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">COST 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-COLOR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">COLOR 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-LAPKON-II-2009" TYPE="STUDY">LAPKON II 2009</LINK>). Although <LINK REF="REF-COLOR-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">COLOR 2009</LINK> was not able to rule out any difference with their non-inferiority design, the meta-analysis by <LINK REF="REF-Kuhry-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kuhry 2008</LINK> did not show any differences.</P>
<P>Despite the larger number of randomised trials on laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer, there is still limited evidence for long- and short-term outcomes after LTME due to the lack of high quality randomised controlled trials with sufficient follow up. Now the results of more well designed large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) become available, there is a need for a updated systematic review of these results.</P>

<P>From the 29 references, we identified two ongoing trials and 14 published clinical trials. Most larger trials have published their results at several stages in different papers. Both ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12609000663257" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12609000663257</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-NCT00726622" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00726622</LINK>) are still recruiting participants and no results have been published yet. Of the 14 published trials, two (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK>) completed participant recruitment but have not yet published long-term data on survival. The COLOR 2 trial has a second published paper on a local subgroup, referred to as <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-b-2011" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 b 2011</LINK> in this review. The Hong Kong trials are divided into the low rectal cancer group in <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2008</LINK> and the rectosigmoid group in <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK>, with the last subdivided in four papers because results are published for different subgroups as shown in the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK> is the biggest group, presenting upper rectum and sigmoid data, <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-b-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong b 2009</LINK> is the upper rectal subgroup and reports 10-year follow-up data. <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-c-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong c 2000</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-d-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong d 2003</LINK> are both small subgroups of <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK> and present only short-term data on immunological response.<BR/>
<BR/>The UK MRC CLASICC study is presented across nine papers, with six grouped as <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>, giving respectively the short-term, three-year, five-year and 10-year results, the costs and an analysis of long term complications of the same participant group. <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-c-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC c 2001</LINK> (one) and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-b-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC b 2005</LINK> (two) include papers for a selected or local participant subgroup and are therefore reported separately. <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> also consists of two papers, with the second paper focusing on functional recovery in the same participant group. The remaining eight clinical trials have one reference each, with the note that <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2007</LINK> are different trials and different authors despite the coincidence of names.</P>
<P>All 14 clinical trials were published as full papers and involved a total of 3528 rectal cancer patients (range 19 to 1044). The characteristics of these trials are described in 20 separate data sets and thus tables to allow for sufficient details on six additional subgroup papers.<BR/>
</P>
<P>All studies had quite similar exclusion criteria. The most common were: T4 rectal cancer, rectal cancer recurrence, people with synchronous or metachronous colorectal cancer, metastatic disease, emergency surgery, intestinal obstruction or perforation, contraindication for laparoscopy and no informed consent. The majority of the studies described the technique for laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME). Perioperative treatment of participants was not described in most of the trials. Six studies had a standardised protocol (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braga-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-b-2011" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 b 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2011</LINK>) and only two had an enhanced recovery protocol (<LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lujan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lujan 2009</LINK>). Data on the type of anaesthesia and analgesia were not given in most studies.</P>
<P>Most studies reported on a range of different outcomes. The most commonly assessed were overall and disease-free survival rates, local recurrence rates, adequacy of oncological resection (margins and number of lymph nodes removed), duration of surgery, conversion rate, mortality, morbidity, anastomotic leakage, postoperative pain, gastrointestinal recovery rate and hospital stay. Most studies lacked a definition of conversion. The most common causes for conversion to open surgery were tumour invasion of adjacent structures or bulky tumours, dense adhesions and technical failure.

Only three studies described the use of a wound protector in LTME, and reported a similar total of two (0.8%) port site recurrences (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of resection: CRM positivity and number of lymph nodes retrieved</I>
<BR/>One of the most important variables for measuring the quality of the oncological resection and predicting recurrence and survival are circumferential margin involvement and number of lymph nodes retrieved. Eleven RCTs describe the number of retrieved lymph nodes, with no difference between both groups (MD -0.43; 95% CI -1.13 to 0.26; <LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Eight studies reported on circumferential margin positivity, with no difference between LTME and OTME (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.40; <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Duration of surgery, incision length and conversion rate</I>
<BR/>The duration of surgery was longer for LTME in 11 out of 12 included trials for this analysis, with a difference of 37 minutes (MD 37.48; 95% CI 27.80 to 47.15; <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>). Two other studies did not report on surgical time. Four studies reporting on incision length all found a shorter incision length for LTME with a mean difference of 12 centimetres (MD -12.83; 95% CI -14.87 to -10.80; <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>All studies except two (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2007</LINK>) describe the conversion rate for the laparoscopic group (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). The mean conversion rate was 14.5% (0% - 34%), and as described in <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>, is highly dependent on the location of the tumour and the experience of the surgeon. For most studies, the surgeons' experience was not clearly stated and therefore cannot be compared from these results.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Intraoperative morbidity, blood loss and transfusion requirement</I>
<BR/>Ten studies described less intraoperative blood loss or transfusion requirement for LTME with a mean difference of 102 millilitres (MD -101.78; 95% CI -147.57 to -55.98; <LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>) and an odds ratio for transfusion requirement of 0.34 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.62; <LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>). Only <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> described a higher transfusion requirement for LTME, but a lower percentage of participants with over 100 millilitres of blood loss during surgery (27% versus 95%, P &lt; 0.001). The overall intraoperative morbidity was described in four studies and was 11.3% for LTME versus 12.0% for OTME (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.18; <LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>). There were insufficient data to compare bowel injury, haemorrhage and solid organ injury separately but individual studies did not show any differences.</P>
<P>
<I>Postoperative morbidity and mortality</I>
<BR/>The overall complication rate was 29.3% (LTME) and 27.5% (OTME) (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.10; <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>), with fewer wound infections and less postoperative bleeding in the LTME group (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK>) and OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.93 (<LINK REF="CMP-003.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.3</LINK>)). We found no differences in urinary bladder infection or retention (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.81; <LINK REF="CMP-003.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.4</LINK>) and pneumonia (OR 1.32; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.09; <LINK REF="CMP-003.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.5</LINK>) between both groups. See <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>.</P>
<P>Ten studies described similar anastomotic leakage rate for both groups (7.7% vs 6.3% OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.40; <LINK REF="CMP-003.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.6</LINK>), while two other trials only included abdominoperineal resection and did not have anastomotic leakage as an outcome. Consequently, the need for reoperation was 5.1% and 5.8% (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.20; <LINK REF="CMP-003.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.7</LINK>) in the LTME and OTME groups respectively. The anastomotic leakage rate has been corrected for participants without an anastomosis.</P>
<P>Data on postoperative mortality were available for 11 studies, with similar mortality rates for the two treatment groups for individual and grouped data (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.32; <LINK REF="CMP-003.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.8</LINK>). Four of them (<LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liu-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Liu 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Liang-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Liang 2011</LINK>) reported no 30-day mortality in either group.</P>
<P>
<I>Postoperative pain</I>
<BR/>Postoperative pain can be assessed in many different ways. Common measures are a visual analogical scale (VAS) score, patient-controlled anaesthesia (PCA) use, days of morphine use and epidural insufficiency requiring opioid use. Six studies reported results for pain score and analgesic use, and all reported lower analgesic use in the LTME group (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.60; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.27; <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK> reported on the percentage of participants using epidural, opioids or other analgesics, with less epidural use in the LTME group.Three trials reported on VAS pain scores, with a lower pain score for LTME at day one (MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.04 to -0.44; <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>
<I>Gastrointestinal recovery and hospital stay</I>
<BR/>Length of hospital stay was given in 11 studies, and showed a reduction of two days for the LTME group (MD -2.16; 95% CI -3.22 to -1.10; <LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>). This is reflected in the gastrointestinal recovery rate to a faster resumption of a normal diet (MD -0.52; 95% CI -0.80 to -0.23; <LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>), and an earlier first bowel movement (MD -0.86; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.54; <LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>) in the LTME group. See <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>.</P>
<P>
<I>Long-term morbidity: Incisional herniae and bowel obstruction</I>
<BR/>Only three studies reported on long-term morbidity from incisional hernia and intestinal obstruction (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braga-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-b-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong b 2009</LINK>). No statistically significant difference between OTME and LTME was seen (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.32 to 2.21; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>). Intestinal obstruction occurred less frequently in the LTME group (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.75; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<I>Quality of life: physical and sexual functioning</I>
<BR/>Four studies reported on quality of life using questionnaires (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braga-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>). Only two reported on bladder and sexual functioning (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>).<BR/>
</P>
<P>Of the four reporting on physical functioning, three reported significantly better functioning in the LTME group at three, six or 12 months. The <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK> showed return to normal functioning at three months for both groups.<BR/>
</P>
<P>The reports on bladder and sexual functioning suffered from low response rates, varying from 71% overall response rate down to 10% on specific questions about sexual enjoyment and problems. <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK> showed a baseline difference in sexual problems, but better sexual functioning after three months in both groups. In contrast, male sexual problems were worse three months after surgery but there was no difference between both groups. The LTME group had significantly fewer micturition, gastrointestinal and defecation problems at three months after surgery.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-b-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC b 2005</LINK> both reported on participants in the CLASICC trial, but used different populations, questionnaires and time points. <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-b-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC b 2005</LINK> showed worse sexual functioning after LTME, specifically for erectile dysfunction, but none were statistically significant. No differences in sexual interest, activity and enjoyment were seen at any time point, although for women there was a significant decrease compared to the preoperative baseline for both groups.</P>
<P>
<I>Immune response</I>
<BR/>Five studies described some short-term differences in immune response (<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-c-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC c 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-d-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong d 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-c-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong c 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-b-2011" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 b 2011</LINK>). They all reported different parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Two studies reported on B-cell, T-cell, cortisol and natural-killer cell (NK-cell) levels.<BR/>
</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-c-2001" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC c 2001</LINK> had the largest population (n = 161), but did not show any differences in T-cell, B-cell and NK-cell levels at day three. <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2007</LINK> included 71 participants and the three other studies around 40 participants each. <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-c-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong c 2000</LINK> showed higher levels of IL-6 and CRP, with a peak for IL-6 at two hours (P &lt; 0.001) and CRP at 48 hours (P &lt; 0.01) in the OTME group. The same results were shown by <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2007</LINK>, but they were measured at one and three days with a difference for IL-6 at day one and for CRP at day one and three for the OTME group. Cortisol levels and WBC were also higher in the OTME group at day one. <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-b-2011" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 b 2011</LINK> expressed results only as ratios compared to preoperative values and showed less increase in IL-6 level at two hours postoperatively in the LTME group. Cortisol, WBC and CRP did not show any differences at 2, 24 and 72 hours. Finally, <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-d-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong d 2003</LINK> did not show any differences at days one and three for WBC, NK-cell, T-cell and B-cell levels, but for T-cell and B-cell levels there was less suppression in the LTME group at day eight.<BR/>

<P>
<I>Costs</I>
<BR/>An analysis of costs was included in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braga-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2008</LINK>). Data were too heterogeneous to be included in a meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-Braga-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Braga 2007</LINK> only reported the difference in costs in which the benefits of LTME could not compensate for the additional operating room charges, with a mean difference of USD 351 more for LTME. The four other studies calculated the costs per participant randomised. <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK> reported the median direct and indirect costs for LTME. <LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK> reported the costs at GBP 6344 for LTME and GBP 6786 for OTME resulting in a saving of GBP 353 for LTME while being the only study in this analysis that used a fast-track programme. <LINK REF="STD-MRC-CLASICC-a-2005" TYPE="STUDY">MRC CLASICC a 2005</LINK> reported the opposite, with GBP 8259 for LTME and GBP 7820 for OTME, resulting in GBP 439 higher costs for LTME. Neither result achieved a statistically significant difference. <LINK REF="STD-Hong-Kong-a-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Hong Kong a 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Ng-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Ng 2008</LINK> reported only the direct costs, with means of USD 9297 and USD 9588 for LTME and USD 7148 and USD 7517 for OTME with a significant difference of about USD 2000 in favour of OTME.<BR/>

<P>Nine studies (n = 1877) reported on at least one of the long-term survival or recurrence outcomes and the meta-analyses as well as the separate studies showed similar long-term survival and recurrence rates for laparoscopic and open total mesorectal excision<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>We found a mean difference in hospital stay of two days, with individual studies reporting a 0.5- to 5-day difference in favour of LTME. <LINK REF="REF-Schwenk-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schwenk 2005</LINK> found comparable results for colon cancer with a mean difference of 1.5 days in favour of the laparoscopic group. Seven studies standardised their postoperative protocol, but only two implemented an enhanced recovery programme.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-04-02 09:40:48 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Benefits of laparoscopic surgery are attributable to causing less surgical trauma to the patient, which has a positive effect on surgery-induced immunosuppression. This can be demonstrated by taking measurements after surgery, with different peak moments for several parameters. The included studies in this review did not take measurements at the same time point, which may explain why not all of them could show differences in similar parameters. Reduced immunosuppression could be related to a lower complication rate and to shorter hospital stay, and may reduce development of postoperative metastasis (although this has yet to be shown in a randomised trial (<LINK REF="REF-Hogan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 2011</LINK>)).</P>
<P>The included RCTs include studies and subgroups of patients with low, mid and high rectal cancer and both APR and anterior resections with and without anastomosis. These differences can affect outcomes, especially the various techniques for low rectal resections can influence the circumferential margins and therefore local recurrences and survival. Lack of reporting of the CRM is an important issue with only eight out of fourteen studies describing this outcome. The number of retrieved lymph nodes is described by eleven studies but is more dependent on difference in high and low vascular ligations of the mesentery than on open or laparoscopic surgery. (<LINK REF="REF-Kessler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kessler 2013</LINK>)</P>
<P>With a mean age between 44 and 72, three studies including T4 carcinoma and six offering neoadjuvant treatment in selected cases and a tumour localisation between 15 cm and the anal verge, there is a fair amount of heterogeneity among the included studies. Especially the early and smaller studies included a younger and healthier study population compared to the average rectal cancer patient. Of the four ongoing trials (n = 470 to 1100 participants), three (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12609000663257" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12609000663257</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT00726622" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00726622</LINK>) require neoadjuvant treatment for selected stages of rectal cancer and the fourth (<LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK>) stratifies the randomisation for neoadjuvant treatment. This might influence both long term and short term outcomes as only six offered neoadjuvant therapy in this review. All ongoing studies include abdominoperineal resections as well as (low) anterior resections, but the maximum distance from the anal verge varies between 9 cm (<LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK>), 12 cm (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00726622" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00726622</LINK>) and 15 cm (<LINK REF="STD-ACTRN12609000663257" TYPE="STUDY">ACTRN12609000663257</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK>).</P>
<P>Another important difference between the included RCTs and current practise are the fast track recovery programmes such as the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme. Only two included studies describe an enhanced recovery programme (<LINK REF="STD-King-2006" TYPE="STUDY">King 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lujan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Lujan 2009</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK> referred to local protocols, whereas the other two ongoing studies do not describe their postoperative protocol in the online summary. The LAFA trial (<LINK REF="REF-Vlug-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vlug 2011</LINK>) showed laparoscopic surgery in combination with fast track recovery resulted in the fastest recovery and hospital discharge compared to regular care and open surgery.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-04-02 09:41:04 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Since 1998, 14 RCTs have been published to answer the question whether LTME results in better short-term results and at least equal long-term oncological results. The quality of these studies varied extensively, as did the number of included participants. Although the total mesorectal excision principle has been established since 1986, treatment protocols have changed. Surgeons gained more experience in laparoscopic colon and rectal cancer surgery, fast-track protocols were introduced and neoadjuvant treatment became a standard of care in a proportion of cases. All of these factors are able to influence the long-term results of these trials; however they should influence both the laparoscopic and open groups equally, except for the learning curve for laparoscopic procedures.</P>
<P>The quality of the evidence for the most important outcomes was moderate (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The main reason is the imprecision of the confidence intervals, they allow for a variability in odds ratios up to 40% on both sides, which contributes to an absolute increase or decrease of 6% in disease free survival, 5% in overall survival, 2% in local recurrences, and 3% in 30-day morbidity. The <LINK REF="STD-COLOR-2-a-2013" TYPE="STUDY">COLOR 2 a 2013</LINK> trial used a 5% margin for local recurrences for their non-inferiority design, therefore our results remain within those limits.</P>

<P>Publication bias is a threat for any systematic review. We believe we have missed no important randomised controlled trials after screening reference lists of included trials and other relevant studies and reviews, in addition to the extensive systematic searching of electronic databases and trials registers. We have described all registered ongoing trials.</P>
<P>In the current literature regarding learning curves in laparoscopic colorectal surgery, a wide range of numbers of procedures is reported until a flat curve is achieve, ranging from 11 to 15 colectomies (<LINK REF="REF-Simons-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simons 1995</LINK>), 30 colorectal resections (<LINK REF="REF-Schlachta-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schlachta 2001</LINK>) and 60 to 65 colectomies (<LINK REF="REF-Tekkis-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tekkis 2005</LINK>). For the open total mesorectal excision (OTME) technique, the cut-off point for percentage of clear resection margins is defined as around 50 procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Oh-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Oh 2011)</LINK>. This suggests that only the surgeons in <LINK REF="STD-Kang-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Kang 2010</LINK> are assumed to have had sufficient experience for a good laparoscopic resection and results may further improve over time.<BR/>

<P>A meta-analysis of RCTs on laparoscopic and open colorectal surgery (<LINK REF="REF-Sammour-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sammour 2011</LINK>) has shown a higher intraoperative complication rate for laparoscopic surgery of 6.3% versus 3.9% for open surgery (OR)1.55, 95%CI 1.12 to 2.15). The rate of bowel perforations was 2.1% versus 0.9% (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.10) across 3018 participants. These differences had limited effect on the outcome, with an average postoperative complication rate of 28%.

<P>There is currently moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has similar effects to open TME on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and we cannot rule out either approach being superior. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of recovery for non-locally advanced rectal cancer and shorter hospital stay. Currently results are consistent in showing a similar disease-free survival and overall survival, and for recurrences after at least three years and up to 10 years although due to imprecision we cannot rule out superiority of either approach. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to a more robust analysis of long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.<BR/>

<P>The evidence presented in this systematic review is sufficient to establish the overall and long-term oncological safety of laparoscopic TME. However, at this moment the available data are still insufficient to confirm these results for subgroups such as abdominoperineal resections, following neoadjuvant therapy, in locally advanced disease and in combination with fast track recovery protocols. </P>

<P>Since the published protocol and original review, in this version we only include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared laparoscopic with open total mesorectal excision. This has resulted in discarding the 46 non-randomised studies of the 48 included studies in favour of 12 new RCTs not originally included.In addition to the outcome measures given in the protocol, we have included long-term morbidity, recurrences and overall survival. We have excluded the respiratory recovery rate, as the definition is unclear and only one trial reported on this outcome.<BR/>For methodological assessment, we have discarded the scale by <LINK REF="REF-Sackett-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 2000</LINK>, because we now only include randomised controlled trials. We now assess the included trials according to the <LINK REF="REF-CONSORT-Statement-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">CONSORT Statement 2010</LINK> and using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.</P>
