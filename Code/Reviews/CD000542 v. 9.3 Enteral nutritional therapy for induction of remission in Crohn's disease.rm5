Common symptoms of this condition include abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. When Crohn's disease patients are experiencing symptoms, it is characterized to be 'active' disease. When the symptoms stop, it is called 'remission'.</P><P><B>What is enteral nutrition?</B></P><P>Enteral nutrition is a feeding method where all of a person's daily caloric intake is delivered using the GI tract. An example of this is nasogastric tube feeding, where a tube is inserted through a person's nose to deliver their daily nutritional requirements in liquid form. Enteral nutrition can be a form of nutritional therapy for Crohn's disease patients. Enteral nutrition is categorized into elemental and non-elemental (semi-elemental and polymeric) diets. Elemental diets come from amino-acid sources, whereas non-elemental diets come from oligopeptide or whole protein sources.</P><P><B>What are corticosteroids?</B></P><P>Corticosteroids are an effective treatment option for active Crohn's disease. These drugs that are taken by mouth and work as immunosuppressants.</P><P><B>What did the researchers investigate?</B></P><P>The researchers studied whether enteral nutrition is better than steroid therapy at producing remission in Crohn's disease patients. In addition, the investigators looked to see if one type of enteral nutrition was better than another (e.g. elemental vs.non-elemental) at producing remission in Crohn's disease.</P><P><B>What did the researchers find?</B></P><P>The researchers found twenty-seven studies (1,011 participants) that fulfilled the search criteria. Eleven of these studies, which included 378 patients, compared elemental to non-elemental diets at producing remission in Crohn's disease. Eight studies, which included 352 patients, investigated enteral nutrition compared to steroid therapy at inducing remission in Crohn's disease. The researchers searched the medical literature extensively up to July 5, 2017.</P><P>Very low quality evidence suggests that steroids may be more effective than enteral nutrition for induction of remission in adults with active Crohn's disease. Very low quality evidence also suggests that enteral nutrition may be more effective than steroids for induction of remission in children with active Crohn's disease. There was no difference in remission rates between elemental and non-elemental diets. An increase in side effects was not seen with elemental diets compared to non-elemental diets, nor with enteral nutrition compared to steroids. Common side effects experienced with enteral nutrition included vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn and flatulence . Common side effects associated with steroid use included acne, moon facies, muscle weakness, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) . Patients on enteral nutrition were more likely to withdraw from the study due to side effects than those on steroids. The most common reason for study withdrawal was inability to tolerate the taste of the enteral nutrition diet. Enteral nutrition should be considered in pediatric Crohn's patients or in adult patients who can comply with nasogastric tube feeding or perceive the formulations to be palatable, or when steroid side effects are not tolerated or better avoided. Further research is required to confirm the superiority of corticosteroids over EN in adults. Further research is required to confirm the benefit of EN in children. More effort from industry should be taken to develop palatable polymeric formulations that can be delivered without use of a nasogastric tube as this may lead to increased patient compliance with this therapy.</P></SUMMARY_BODY></SUMMARY><ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2018-03-15 10:31:38 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:40:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Corticosteroids are often preferred over enteral nutrition (EN) as induction therapy for Crohn's disease (CD). Prior meta-analyses suggest that corticosteroids are superior to EN for induction of remission in CD.

The primary outcome was clinical remission. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A random-effects model was used to pool data. We performed intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses for the primary outcome. Heterogeneity was explored using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics. The studies were separated into two comparisons: one EN formulation compared to another EN formulation and EN compared to corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were based on formula composition and age. Sensitivity analyses included abstract publications and poor quality studies. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess study quality. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes.</P></ABS_DATA_COLLECTION><ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:40:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Twenty-seven studies (1,011 participants) were included. Three studies were rated as low risk of bias. Seven studies were rated as high risk of bias and 17 were rated as unclear risk of bias due to insufficient information. Seventeen trials compared different formulations of EN, 13 studies compared one or more elemental formulas to a non-elemental formula, three studies compared EN diets of similar protein composition but different fat composition, and one study compared non-elemental diets differing in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of 11 trials (378 participants) demonstrated no difference in remission rates. Sixty-four per cent (134/210) of patients in the elemental group achieved remission compared to 62% (105/168) of patients in the non-elemental group (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; GRADE very low quality). A per-protocol analysis (346 participants) produced similar results (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18). Subgroup analyses performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no differences in remission rates. An analysis of 7 trials including 209 patients treated with EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: &lt; 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: &gt; 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no difference in remission rates (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26). Very low fat content (&lt; 3 g/1000 kCal) and very low long chain triglycerides demonstrated higher remission rates than higher content EN formulas. There was no difference between elemental and non-elemental diets in adverse event rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.60; GRADE very low quality), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.09; GRADE very low quality). Common adverse events included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and bloating.</P><P>Ten trials compared EN to steroid therapy. Meta-analysis of eight trials (223 participants) demonstrated no difference in remission rates between EN and steroids. Fifty per cent (111/223) of patients in the EN group achieved remission compared to 72% (133/186) of patients in the steroid group (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.03; GRADE very low quality). Subgroup analysis by age showed a difference in remission rates for adults but not for children. In adults 45% (87/194) of EN patients achieved remission compared to 73% (116/158) of steroid patients (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82; GRADE very low quality). In children, 83% (24/29) of EN patients achieved remission compared to 61% (17/28) of steroid patients (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.97; GRADE very low quality). A per-protocol analysis produced similar results (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14). The per-protocol subgroup analysis showed a difference in remission rates for both adults (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95) and children (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.97). There was no difference in adverse event rates (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.11; GRADE very low quality). However, patients on EN were more likely to withdraw due to adverse events than those on steroid therapy (RR 2.95, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.48; GRADE very low quality). Common adverse events reported in the EN group included heartburn, flatulence, diarrhea and vomiting, and for steroid therapy acne, moon facies, hyperglycemia, muscle weakness and hypoglycemia. The most common reason for withdrawal was inability to tolerate the EN diet.</P></ABS_RESULTS><ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:40:44 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Very low quality evidence suggests that corticosteroid therapy may be more effective than EN for induction of clinical remission in adults with active CD.

Primary therapeutic efficacy was suspected in an uncontrolled study where patients awaiting surgery appeared to experience improvement in the clinical activity of their inflammatory bowel disease as well as in their nutritional status (<LINK REF="REF-Voitk-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Voitk 1973</LINK>). There is now a vast experience and literature supporting the use of nutritional therapy in Crohn's disease but the mechanism of action and ideal formulation are still unknown. Nutritional therapy is classified by the nitrogen source derived from the amino acid or protein component of the formula. Elemental diets are created by mixing of single amino acids and are entirely antigen free. Oligopeptide or semi-elemental diets are made by protein hydrolysis and have a mean peptide chain length of four or five amino acids which is too short for antigen recognition or presentation. Polymeric diets contain whole protein from sources such as milk, meat, egg or soy. Polymeric diets can be classified more simply as elemental (amino acid-based), semi-elemental (oligopeptide) and polymeric (whole protein) diets.</P><P>The use of enteral nutritional therapy to treat active Crohn's disease has been shown to be less effective than conventional corticosteroid therapy in three meta-analyses published in the mid nineties (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_Banares-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez-Banares 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Messori-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messori 1996</LINK>). This was demonstrated again in previous Cochrane meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2007</LINK>), despite differences in criteria for study inclusion. However, in some of the trials evaluating enteral nutrition versus steroids, the steroid-treated patients sometimes received additional concurrent drug therapy such as sulfasalazine or antibiotics. Exclusion of such trials (<LINK REF="STD-Lochs-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Lochs 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Malchow-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Malchow 1990</LINK>), resulted in a lack of superiority of steroids over enteral nutritional therapy, but the sample size was also markedly reduced. One further meta-analysis showed no difference in effectiveness between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of acute Crohn's disease in children (<LINK REF="REF-Heuschkel-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heuschkel 2000</LINK>). This apparent discrepancy may stem from differences involving the study populations (e.g. ages, disease activity, disease duration), interventions (e.g. with or without concurrent 5-ASA preparations), outcome assessments (disease activity measures), methodology (e.g. sample size, blinding, randomization), and patient compliance (adults may not readily accept nasogastric feeding).</P><P>Regardless of whether enteral nutrition therapy is equal or slightly inferior in effectiveness to corticosteroids, its use deserves consideration in both the adult and pediatric population. There is a growing resistance to the frequent use of corticosteroids in children with Crohn's disease due to numerous adverse effects, particularly on growth, bone mineral density and body image. In addition, corticosteroids are not effective therapies for achieving mucosal healing (<LINK REF="REF-Landi-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Landi 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Modigliani-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modigliani 1990</LINK>). Therefore, in some parts of the world such as in Europe, enteral nutrition is presented as first line therapy based on good efficacy data for induction of remission as well as beneficial effects on growth, rapid nutritional restitution, fewer adverse effects and improved quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Afzal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afzal 2004</LINK>). The argument for the use of enteral nutrition as primary therapy for Crohn's disease is further supported by evidence of mucosal healing (<LINK REF="REF-Afzal-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afzal 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Fell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamamoto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamamoto 2007</LINK>), and one study demonstrated significantly higher rates of mucosal healing compared to patients receiving corticosteroids (<LINK REF="STD-Berni-Canani-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Berni Canani 2006</LINK>).</P><P>Enteral nutrition as a primary therapy for induction of Crohn's disease is often overlooked as a treatment option in the United States. Despite the evidence supporting its role as a means for induction of remission, only 4% of American gastroenterologists use it regularly to manage mild to moderately active pediatric Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2003</LINK>). Reasons for lack of uptake among physicians include concerns about poor acceptability of nasogastric tubes by patients, palatability of formulations, and lack of compliance with a restrictive dietary intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Kansal-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kansal 2013</LINK>). However, palatable polymeric formulations have been produced recently and oral administration of these formulations has been demonstrated to be as efficacious as feeds delivered by the nasogastric route (<LINK REF="REF-Rubio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubio 2011</LINK>). The ability to use a palatable oral polymeric formulation as a means of induction therapy helps to overcome some of the prior limitations of enteral nutrition treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2007</LINK>). Prior versions of this systematic review and meta-analyses were performed using an intention-to-treat analysis, which includes treatment failures who withdrew due to poor acceptance of enteral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Zachos-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zachos 2007</LINK>). This updated meta-analysis therefore aimed to also perform a per-protocol analysis to compare enteral feeding versus corticosteroids for treatment of active Crohn's disease, but exclude treatment failures that occurred on the basis of poor palatability or lack of acceptance of a nasogastric tube, since these limitations may be overcome with use of palatable oral polymeric formulations. This review also provides an update on the existing effectiveness and safety data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition, and for elemental versus non-elemental feeds (i.e. one form of enteral nutrition versus another) for induction of remission of active Crohn's disease.</P></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:17:55 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>The primary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of exclusive enteral nutrition as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on effectiveness.</P></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-15 10:31:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:18:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:17:57 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials published in any language were considered for inclusion in the review.

We excluded the following types of studies: trials allowing oral intake other than clear liquids; trials allowing co-intervention with antibiotics, or corticosteroids in high or recently increased doses among patients allocated to enteral nutrition; and trials not defining disease activity and remission.</P></CRIT_INTERVENTIONS><CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:18:22 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>The studies used one of various measures to assess remission: the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), van Hees Index, the simple Crohn's Disease Index (or Harvey-Bradshaw simple CDI), the International Organization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Index (IOIBD) and the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI). The definition of remission can vary across studies using the same assessment scale. Thus, the primary outcome was the number of patients achieving remission, as defined by each individual study, and expressed as a percentage of the patients randomized (intention-to-treat analysis). Additional analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis, excluding patients who withdrew due to lack of acceptability of a nasogastric tube for feeding or palatability of the enteral feed. Patients who withdrew for other reasons were still counted as treatment failures. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events.</P></CRIT_OUTCOMES></SELECTION_CRITERIA><SEARCH_METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-15 10:31:56 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) Embase (Ovid) and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to 5 July 2017.

Additional citations were sought using references from applicable systematic reviews and studies retrieved from the computerized and manual searches.</P></SEARCH_METHODS><DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2018-03-07 11:09:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Study selection: The studies (and abstracts when available) retrieved by the search strategy were independently reviewed by at least two investigators (NN, AD or DZ). Study eligibility was determined by discussion and consensus.</P><P>Quality Assessment: The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). We assessed the following domains: methods used for randomization and allocation concealment (selection bias); blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (performance and detection bias); incomplete outcome data (attrition bias); selective reporting of study outcomes and other potential sources of bias. Each potential source of bias was rated as low, high or unclear risk of bias. If an item could not be evaluated due to missing information, it was rated as an unclear risk of bias. The quality of studies was independently assessed by at least two investigators (NN, AD or DZ) with disagreements settled by consensus with all authors. Studies with at least one domain at high risk of bias were excluded on sensitivity analyses.</P><P>The GRADE approach was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schunemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schunemann 2011</LINK>). The GRADE approach allows overall appraisal of the quality of evidence such that one can determine confidence in how likely the effect estimate reflects the item of interest. Randomized trials start as high quality of evidence, but can be downgraded due to risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, unexplained heterogeneity, imprecision, and publication bias. After consideration of these factors, the overall quality of the evidence was graded as one of:</P><P>- High - further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect;</P><P>- Moderate - further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate;</P><P>- Low - further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; or</P><P>- Very low - any estimate of effect is very uncertain.</P><P>Data extraction:<BR/>Data extraction forms were developed and data were independently extracted from eligible studies by at least two investigators (NN, AD or DZ). Rereading and discussion resolved any discrepancies in data recorded on the extraction forms. The extracted data included baseline characteristics of patients (i.e. number of patients randomized, age, sex, anatomic distribution of disease, duration of diagnosed disease, disease activity score, and co-intervention if any); details of formulation and therapeutic administration of enteral nutrition or corticosteroid therapy; details on dropouts/withdrawals; and outcome assessment (i.e. time of assessment, clinical disease activity index used, definition of clinical remission, and remission rates according to the total number of patients randomized). A separate per-protocol assessment was conducted by removing patients from the analysis who could not tolerate enteral feeding due to palatability of the formulation or non-acceptance of a nasogastric tube.</P><P>Statistical analyses:<BR/>Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3.5, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol basis. For the dichotomous outcomes such as achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as risk ratios (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A random-effects model was used to pool data. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics.</P><P>Studies were separated into two groups:<BR/>A. one form of enteral nutrition compared to another form of enteral nutrition and<BR/>B. one form of enteral nutrition compared to corticosteroids.<BR/><BR/>Pre-specified subgroup analyses included:<BR/>(i) age (i.e. adults &gt; 18 years versus children <U>&lt;</U> 18 years);<BR/>(ii) disease duration (i.e. new onset defined as disease duration of &lt; 6 months versus chronic disease defined as disease duration of &gt; 6 months);<BR/>(iii) disease location (i.e. small bowel, large bowel, or both);<BR/>(iv) fat composition (i.e. low fat versus high fat content; long chain triglyceride content; or fatty acid content);<BR/>(v) protein composition (i.e. elemental, semi-elemental polymeric; or nitrogen source); and<BR/>(vi) type of carbohydrate source.</P><P>Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of:<BR/>(i) the inclusion of abstracts; and<BR/>(ii) methodologic quality, excluding studies of lower quality (i.e. at least one aspect of the study considered to be at high risk of bias).<BR/></P></DATA_COLLECTION></METHODS><RESULTS MODIFIED="2018-03-12 12:53:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><STUDY_DESCRIPTION MODIFIED="2018-03-12 12:53:49 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>The literature search conducted on July 5, 2017 identified 1135 records.

In the trial with two enteral nutrition arms versus a steroid arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gassull-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gassull 2002</LINK>), participants with mild disease activity were allowed to take the feeds orally, while those with moderate to severe disease received the diet nasogastrically. There was a cumulative withdrawal rate of 26% in those receiving enteral nutrition therapy compared to no withdrawals in the steroid group. For the purpose of analysis, the two groups that received different feeds were combined into one enteral nutrition arm and compared to the steroid arm (<LINK REF="STD-Gassull-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gassull 2002</LINK>).

This apparent discrepancy may stem from differences involving study populations (e.g. ages, disease activity), interventions (e.g. route of administration), outcome assessments (disease activity measures) and methodology (e.g. sample size, blinding, randomization). This meta-analysis aimed to pool data from existing randomized controlled studies to examine whether formula composition affected efficacy. No difference in remission rates was observed when different formula compositions were compared by meta-analytic techniques. Although the choice of activity index utilized in the studies varied, the majority of studies included in the meta-analysis used a validated index with similar cut-off values defining inclusion or remission (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2002</LINK>).</P><P>Subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on study quality or specific aspects of protein or fat composition did not yield any statistically significant differences in remission rates. No statistically significant differences were seen between diets containing different nitrogen sources, classified simply as elemental (free amino acids), semi-elemental (oligopeptides) or polymeric (whole protein). Comparisons between any combination of the different protein sources showed no significant difference in remission rates. Similarly, one study comparing polymeric diets differing in glutamine-enrichment showed no difference in remission rates (<LINK REF="STD-Akobeng-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Akobeng 2000</LINK>). A non significant trend favouring very low fat and low LCT content was demonstrated in this review. Although different values for LCT content were evaluated and no statistically significant difference was found, the trend supporting lower LCT content was strongest for the lowest value evaluated (&lt; 5% LCT). However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small numbers of patients resulting in a lack of statistical power to show a difference should one exist. Several studies have hypothesized that the proportion or type of fat in an enteral feeding can affect the production of pro or anti-inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="STD-Bamba-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Bamba 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gassull-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Gassull 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Leiper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Leiper 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sakurai-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Sakurai 2002</LINK>). The possibility that fat composition influences immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory effect in active Crohn's disease warrants further exploration with larger trials.</P><P>Data concerning effectiveness of enteral nutrition based on disease duration or disease distribution were not reported in the majority of studies, so subgroup analyses with respect to disease characteristics could not be performed. Several early reports suggest increased efficacy of enteral nutrition in patients with small bowel involvement and those patients with isolated colonic involvement seemed less likely to benefit from enteral feeding (<LINK REF="REF-Afzal-2005b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Afzal 2005b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilschanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilschanski 1996</LINK>). However, recent studies suggest disease phenotype may not impact response to enteral nutrition. <LINK REF="STD-Buchanan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Buchanan 2009</LINK> carefully defined phenotypic classification in 110 patients on enteral nutrition and found no significant differences in remission rates based on disease location. One retrospective study compared remission rates according to route of administration, and incidentally found that the site of disease involvement had no impact on response to nutritional therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Rubio-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rubio 2011</LINK>). Current recommendations suggest the use of exclusive enteral nutrition as first line therapy to induce remission in children with active luminal Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Ruemmele-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ruemmele 2014</LINK>). There are inadequate data from the trials examined in this meta-analysis to confirm or refute this recommendation. The recent data demonstrating equal efficacy in colonic disease as compared to small bowel disease also suggests a potential role of enteral nutrition as a means to induce patients with ulcerative colitis and this merits further investigation.</P><P>The use of enteral nutritional therapy to treat active Crohn's disease was shown to be less effective than conventional corticosteroid therapy in past meta-analyses (<LINK REF="REF-Fernandez_x002d_Banares-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fernandez-Banares 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Griffiths-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Griffiths 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Messori-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messori 1996</LINK>). This updated meta-analysis confirms this finding in adult populations and suggests that enteral nutrition may be more effective than steroids in pediatric populations. Further research about which form of intervention is most effective in pediatric patients is warranted. On a per-protocol basis, no statistically significant difference in the overall effect estimate was seen between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. This suggests that failure of enteral nutrition therapy may be due to difficulty with tolerating nasogastric tube feeding and poorly palatable formulations. For the per-protocol analysis, steroids were superior to enteral nutrition in adults and enteral nutrition was superior to steroids in children.</P><P>This meta-analysis did not aim to compare the method by which enteral nutrition should be delivered to induce remission. Although polymeric diets are more palatable, failure of enteral nutrition can occur if inadequate oral administration occurs, and the nasogastric route should then be used to optimize compliance and effectiveness (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2005</LINK>). Although exclusion of a normal diet or nasogastric route of administration may be viewed as barriers to enteral nutritional therapy, even young children can learn to insert the tube for overnight feeds (<LINK REF="REF-Sanderson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sanderson 2005</LINK>). Recent efforts by industry to develop palatable polymeric formulas may help increase acceptance from patients since the use of nasogastric feeding can be avoided. Various flavouring agents also assist to make these formulas more palatable.</P><P>There is substantial variability in use of enteral nutrition in different parts of the world. Whereas 62% of western European gastroenterologists use this therapy routinely for the management of pediatric patients with Crohn&#8217;s disease, only 4% of American gastroenterologists regularly use enteral nutrition in their practice (<LINK REF="REF-Levine-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levine 2003</LINK>). A barrier to its uptake in the United States is related to personal experience and training of clinicians involved in patient care. Clinicians trained in a centre where enteral nutrition is not used routinely are less likely to adapt it for use in their own practice. Other barriers preventing routine use of enteral nutrition include the lack of a uniform protocol on its use, uncertainty regarding the duration of treatment, uncertainty whether concurrent oral intake should be permitted, and how to reintroduce food once remission has been induced. Immunomodulators or biologic therapies are often used for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease, but there may be a role for continuing to use enteral nutrition in patients with quiescent disease. Small studies suggest remission could be maintained by delivering a portion of caloric intake via overnight enteral feeding by nasogastric tube and allowing patients to eat normally during the day (<LINK REF="REF-Takagi-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Takagi 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilschanski-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilschanski 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamamoto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamamoto 2007</LINK>). This needs to be confirmed in larger studies and different populations before being adapted.</P><P>There are several additional benefits to enteral nutrition that are not examined in this meta-analysis due to insufficient data. Adverse events often seen in patients using corticosteroids such as stunted growth or osteoporosis are not a concern when using enteral nutrition. Although patients treated with corticosteroids often achieve clinical remission, corticosteroids often fail to induce mucosal healing (<LINK REF="REF-Modigliani-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Modigliani 1990</LINK>). Case series have described mucosal healing with enteral nutrition therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Fell-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fell 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Yamamoto-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yamamoto 2007</LINK>). The <LINK REF="STD-Borrelli-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Borrelli 2006</LINK> trial which failed to show a significant difference in remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroids, did demonstrate a significant difference in mucosal healing with enteral nutrition. The goals of treatment of Crohn&#8217;s disease have changed in the past decade, with a recent focus on targeting objective improvement in several domains including mucosal healing. In addition to symptom control, this advantage of enteral nutrition also adds further appeal over corticosteroid therapy.</P><P>In summary, meta-analysis of the available trials has not demonstrated any significant benefit based on the formula composition of nutritional therapies. More prospective data are needed to evaluate the effect of disease factors such as disease location and duration on response to therapy. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of enteral nutrition for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease is evident from the remission rates shown in the trials included in this meta-analysis. The additional benefits for mucosal healing, growth, nutritional status and quality of life should strengthen the argument for considering the use of enteral nutrition as primary therapy in Crohn's disease. Given that no statistically significant difference in remission rates was seen between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy when analyzed on a per-protocol basis, this suggests a need to focus on methods of increasing compliance with enteral nutrition therapy from patients, including the development of palatable polymeric formulations that can be delivered without use of a nasogastric tube. Further study on the mechanisms by which enteral nutrition works, its use in maintenance of remission, whether it should be combined with drug therapy for induction or maintenance of remission, and the efficacy of enteral nutrition in ulcerative colitis are needed.</P></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:31:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:31:51 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Very low quality evidence suggests that corticosteroid therapy may be more effective than enteral nutrition for induction of clinical remission in adults with active Crohn's disease. Very low quality evidence also suggests that enteral nutrition may be more effective than steroids in children with active Crohn's disease. Protein composition does not appear to influence the effectiveness of enteral nutrition for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. Enteral nutritional therapy should be considered as therapy for Crohn's disease in certain cases, such as in pediatric patients or in patients who can comply with nasogastric tube feeding or perceive the formulations to be palatable, or when steroid side effects are not tolerated or better avoided.</P></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:31:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>Further research is required to confirm the superiority of corticosteroids over enteral nutrition in adults. Further research is required to confirm the benefit of enteral nutrition in children. More effort from industry should be taken to develop palatable polymeric formulations that can be delivered without use of a nasogastric tube as this may lead to increased patient compliance with this therapy..</P></IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH></CONCLUSIONS></BODY><ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS MODIFIED="2018-03-07 08:32:04 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald"><P>The authors are grateful to Dr. Anne Griffiths for her contribution to the original meta-analysis on this subject matter for the Cochrane Collaboration.
