<SUMMARY>
<TITLE>Abortion after three months of pregnancy can be done by an operation or with medicines. This review looked at which way is better.</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>We did computer searches to find studies that compared any operation to any medicine used for abortion at this stage of pregnancy. We wrote to researchers and looked through book chapters and other articles to find more studies.</P>
<P>We found two studies. The first compared dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) to injecting a drug into the pregnant womb. The second compared D&amp;E to drugs taken by mouth and by vagina. </P>
<P>The D&amp;E operation was better than injecting medicines into the womb. Medicines taken by mouth and vagina worked as well and were as acceptable as a D&amp;E, but caused more pain and side effects. More studies with modern medicines used for abortion after 3 months of pregnancy are needed.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Determining the optimal method of performing second-trimester abortions is important, since they account for a disproportionate amount of abortion-related morbidity and mortality. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To compare surgical and medical methods of inducing abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy with regard to efficacy, side effects, adverse events, and acceptability.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>We identified trials using Pub Med, EMBASE, POPLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We also searched the reference lists of identified studies, relevant review articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings for additional, previously unidentified studies. We contacted experts in the field for information on other published or unpublished research. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised trials comparing any surgical to any medical method of inducing abortion at &#8805; 13 weeks' gestation were included.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We assessed the validity of each study using the methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook. Investigators were contacted as needed to provide additional information regarding trial conduct or outcomes. Two reviewers abstracted the data. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous variables using RevMan 4.2. The trials did not have uniform interventions, therefore, we were unable to combine them into a meta-analysis.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Two studies met criteria for this review. One compared dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) to intra-amniotic instillation of prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>
<SUB>&#945;</SUB>. The second study compared D&amp;E to induction with mifepristone and misoprostol. Compared with prostaglandin instillation, the combined incidence of minor complications was lower with D&amp;E (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.65) as was the total number of minor and major complications (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.46). The number of women experiencing adverse events was also lower with D&amp;E than with mifepristone and misoprostol (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.76). Although women treated with mifepristone and misoprostol reported significantly more pain than those undergoing D&amp;E, efficacy and acceptability were the same in both groups. In both trials, fewer subjects randomised to D&amp;E required overnight hospitalisation. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>Dilation and evacuation is superior to instillation of prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>
<SUB>&#945;</SUB>. The current evidence also appears to favour D&amp;E over mifepristone and misoprostol, however larger randomised trials are needed. </P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Worldwide, 10-15% of induced abortions occur in the second trimester of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Finer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stat.-Service-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stat. Service 2005</LINK>). Contributing factors include, among others, late diagnosis of pregnancy or fetal anomalies, logistic and financial barriers to abortion services, ambivalence, and fear of disclosure or of the procedure (<LINK REF="REF-Ingham-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ingham 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Drey-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Drey 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-George-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">George 1996</LINK>). The optimal method of second trimester abortion continues to be debated (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-HMSO-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">HMSO 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Siebert-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siebert 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stubblefield-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stubblefield 2005</LINK>). Making this determination is important because abortions performed in the second trimester account for a disproportionate amount of abortion-related morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Bartlett-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bartlett 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1997</LINK>). </P>
<P>Surgical and medical methods of second trimester abortion have both evolved in the past 30 years. Dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E), introduced in the 1970s, has become the preferred surgical technique over dilation and curettage, hysterotomy, and hysterectomy because of its relative safety (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1982</LINK>). Early induction methods, such as intra-amniotic instillation of hypertonic solutions and prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>
<SUB>&#945;</SUB>, have largely been replaced by oral or vaginal prostaglandin analogues with or without the antiprogestin, mifepristone (<LINK REF="REF-Stubblefield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stubblefield 2004</LINK>). </P>
<P>Specialized training and the maintenance of an adequate caseload are required to perform D&amp;E safely. Inexperienced providers are advised to use medical methods (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2004</LINK>). The relative frequency of D&amp;E to medical induction, therefore, varies. For example, D&amp;E is used for 96% of abortions performed at &#8805;13 weeks' gestation in the United States and 75% of those in England and Wales (<LINK REF="REF-Strauss-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Strauss 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stat.-Service-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stat. Service 2005</LINK>). In contrast, in Finland and Sweden virtually all abortions in the second trimester are performed medically (<LINK REF="REF-Stakes-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stakes 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>Among the drawbacks of early methods of induction abortion were the need for amniocentesis, long induction-to-abortion intervals requiring hospitalisation, gastrointestinal side effects, and the frequent need for curettage after expulsion of the fetus (<LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cates-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 1978</LINK>). With the introduction of prostaglandin E and F analogues, the efficacy of induction abortion improved and side effects were reduced. The most frequently employed prostaglandin analogue is misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Goldberg-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldberg 2001</LINK>), which is used alone or in combination with the antiprogestin, mifepristone. </P>
<P>The ideal regimen of misoprostol administration for induction abortion has not been determined. Studies have included doses ranging from 100-800&#956;g using a variety of routes and dosing intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Caliskan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Caliskan 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jain-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jain 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ngai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngai 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stubblefield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stubblefield 2004</LINK>). The median induction time for misoprostol-alone regimens ranges from 12-45 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Ngai-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ngai 2003</LINK>). Mifepristone is an antiprogestin which softens the cervix and increases uterine sensitivity to prostaglandins (<LINK REF="REF-Bygdeman-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bygdeman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norman-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norman 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Swahn-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Swahn 1988</LINK>). The addition of mifepristone shortens the induction interval to a median of 7-9 hours, and decreases the dose of prostaglandin required and the need for analgesia (<LINK REF="REF-Urquhart-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Urquhart 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rodger-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rodger 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thong-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thong 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ashok-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Goh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>The safety and efficacy of D&amp;E by experienced hands has been reported mainly in cohort studies and case series reports. Early cohort studies demonstrated that D&amp;E is safer than instillation abortion (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kafrissen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kafrissen 1984</LINK>), but comparisons with more modern induction protocols are limited. A recent retrospective cohort study comparing D&amp;E to misoprostol demonstrated a lower complication rate with D&amp;E, however selection bias was evident (<LINK REF="REF-Autry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Autry 2002</LINK>). Because the comparative safety and acceptability of surgical and medical abortion remains unresolved, this review evaluates all randomised controlled trials comparing these two approaches to second-trimester abortion.</P>

</METHODS>
<RESULTS>
<STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<P>Two trials met criteria for this review. The first study (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 1980</LINK>) randomised 100 women with pregnancies of 13-18 weeks gestation to D&amp;E or a standard protocol using intra-amniotic prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>
<SUB>&#945;</SUB> . The primary outcome was the total complication rate. The second trial (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>) aimed to randomise 60 women at 13.9-19.9 weeks gestation to D&amp;E or induction using the Aberdeen regimen (<LINK REF="REF-Ashok-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 1999</LINK>) of oral mifepristone (200 mg) and misoprostol (800 mcg vaginally followed by 400 mcg orally every 3 hours). The primary outcome was the feasbility of recruitment into a randomised trial of surgical versus medical abortion in the second trimester in the United States.</P>
<P>One unpublished study (<LINK REF="STD-Philips-1974" TYPE="STUDY">Philips 1974</LINK>) could not be obtained for review despite multiple attempts to acquire the manuscript and to contact the primary author. An available abstract stated that the study was a double-blind comparison of prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>&#945; instillation, hysterotomy, and induction with hypertonic saline. Randomisation was not mentioned in the abstract. </P>
</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>
<STUDY_QUALITY>
<P>Both trials used an appropriate method of generating the randomisation sequence, either manual shuffling of envelopes (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 1980</LINK>) or computer-generated (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>). The primary author confirmed that concealment was maintained using sequentially-numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes in both trials. Each study described an a priori hypothesis and an appropriate sample size calculation. </P>
<P>In the comparative trial of D&amp;E and prostaglandin instillation (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 1980</LINK>), 6 subjects in the prostaglandin arm discontinued from the trial while awaiting treatment. These subjects were excluded from the analysis; no intent-to-treat analysis was performed. Side-effect data could not be analysed as mean numbers of episodes of a given side effect (e.g., vomiting and diarrhoea) were reported, but standard deviations were not included. Communication with the primary author revealed that raw data was no longer available.</P>
<P>In the study comparing D&amp;E to mifepristone and misoprostol (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>), recruitment was stopped after one year due to slow enrolment, as required by the trial's stopping rules. Eighteen women were randomised, 9 per group.</P>

<P>
<U>
<BR/>D&amp;E vs. Prostaglandin F</U>
<U>
<SUB>2</SUB>
</U>
<U>&#945;</U>
<U>:</U> More subjects undergoing D&amp;E completed the abortion by their assigned method largely due to early discontinuations in the prostaglandin group (OR 17.41, 0.97-313.73). All subjects randomised to prostaglandin required overnight hospitalisation compared to 2 randomised to D&amp;E. </P>
<P>The incidence of minor complications, defined by the authors as haemorrhage not requiring transfusion, febrile morbidity, cervico-vaginal trauma and prostaglandin reaction, was lower in subjects randomised to D&amp;E as compared to those undergoing prostaglandin instillation (OR 0.17, 0.04-0.65). There was also a lower incidence of major complications, which included seizure and haemorrhage requiring transfusion, in the D&amp;E group (OR 0.12, 0.01-2.34). The combined incidence of minor and major complications was significantly lower in the D&amp;E group (OR 0.12, 0.03-0.46). With the exception of cervico-vaginal trauma, there was a trend toward fewer individual complications in the D&amp;E group.</P>
<P>Gastrointestinal side effects were reported by mean numbers of episodes. Twenty-four subjects (55%) in the prostaglandin group experienced a mean of 2.4 episodes of vomiting compared with 6 (12%) in the D&amp;E group who experienced a mean of 1.8 episodes. Eight subjects (18%) in the prostaglandin group had a mean of 2.9 episodes of diarrhoea compared with none in the D&amp;E group. </P>
<P>
<U>D&amp;E vs. Mifepristone/Misoprostol:</U> One subject assigned to D&amp;E underwent labor after laminaria placement and aborted spontaneously. As a result, 8 of 9 women randomised to D&amp;E completed the abortion by assigned method compared to 9 of 9 women assigned to induction with mifepristone and misoprostol (OR 0.30, 0.01-8.35). No subjects randomised to D&amp;E required an overnight stay in the hospital. </P>
<P>The total number of women experiencing one or more adverse events was lower in the D&amp;E group (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.07-0.76). In the mifepristone and misoprostol group, 3 subjects experienced a fever of &gt; 38ºC, one of whom was treated with antibiotics. Four subjects undergoing induction required an unintended surgical intervention; 3 needed extraction of a retained placenta and one had a delayed presentation of retained products of conception. One subject in the D&amp;E group received superficial burns to her abdomen from a heating pad that was used to control labor pains after laminaria placement. </P>
<P>Side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) were more frequent in the induction group, however none of the comparisons was statistically significant. Pain, emotional discomfort, satisfaction, and acceptability (as rated by likelihood of repeating the same method in the future and recommendation to a friend) were reported using a 5-point Likert scale (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). Overall pain was significantly higher in the mifepristone and misoprostol group (3 vs. 2, p=0.03) but there were no substantial differences in other indicators of acceptability and satisfaction. <BR/> </P>

<P>The largest studies comparing D&amp;E to second trimester medical abortion utilized cohort data collected by the Joint Program for the Study of Abortion under the Population Council and the Centers for Disease Control (JPSA/CDC) between 1970-1978 (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kafrissen-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kafrissen 1984</LINK>). Compared to D&amp;E, instillation of prostaglandin F<SUB>2</SUB>
<SUB>&#945;</SUB> between 13 and 24 weeks gestation was associated with a higher risk of serious complications (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1). One randomised trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 1980</LINK>) confirms the JPSA/CDC findings with regard to the overall safety of D&amp;E compared with intra-amniotic prostaglandin. <SUB>
<BR/>
</SUB>
<BR/>Instillation techniques are rarely used in modern abortion care. Few studies compare D&amp;E to current methods. Autry and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Autry-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Autry 2002</LINK>) retrospectively evaluated D&amp;E (n=139) and induction with misoprostol (n=125). Women treated with misoprostol had a higher overall rate of complications compared to those undergoing D&amp;E (22% vs. 4%, p&lt;0.001). However, selection bias was evident as subjects in the induction group were of significantly higher gestational age (20.3 ± 2 weeks vs. 18.4 ± 2.2 weeks, p&lt;0.001). </P>
<P>The second trial in this review (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>) prospectively compared D&amp;E to induction with mifepristone and misoprostol. Both methods were effective and acceptable. However, more women undergoing induction experienced adverse events. These were limited to fever &gt; 38ºC and the need for curettage. Transient fever is a known side-effect of misoprostol (<LINK REF="REF-Stubblefield-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stubblefield 2004</LINK>). The incidence of fever from prostaglandin administration varies by dose, route, and frequency of administration (<LINK REF="REF-Tang-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tang 2000</LINK>). Four of 9 women assigned to induction required curettage. This is higher than has been reported by centres experienced with this regimen. In a retrospective case-series of 999 inductions using the Aberdeen protocol, Ashok and colleagues (<LINK REF="REF-Ashok-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 2004</LINK>) reported that 8.1% of subjects required surgical evacuation of the uterus. Using a similar dosing protocol with mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol, Goh, et al. (<LINK REF="REF-Goh-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goh 2006</LINK>) found a 5% incidence of curettage among 386 consecutive subjects. </P>
<P>Minimizing side effects, pain, and procedure duration are all important aspects of abortion care. Side effects were higher with both induction methods, and mifepristone and misoprostol was associated with significantly more pain than D&amp;E. The need for hospitalisation also differed. All subjects randomised to prostaglandin instillation and 55% of those treated with mifepristone and misoprostol required overnight hospitalisation (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>). Some type of intervention is required in the day or two prior to abortion with either D&amp;E or induction which also adds time to the procedure. Cervical preparation with osmotic dilators is typically undertaken 24-48 hours prior to surgery in order to decrease the incidence of procedure-related complications (<LINK REF="REF-Grimes-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grimes 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schulz--1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1983</LINK>). Mifepristone is given 24-48 hours before administration of misoprostol which shortens the induction time (<LINK REF="REF-Ashok-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 2004</LINK>). While these interventions reduce the time spent in the hospital for all subjects, subjects who undergo D&amp;E are likely to spend less time in the hospital overall. </P>
<P>The study by Grimes and colleagues (<LINK REF="STD-Grimes-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Grimes 2004</LINK>) demonstrates the difficulty of recruiting subjects into randomised trials of surgical and medical abortion methods in the United States. Another randomised trial of first trimester abortion methods performed at a different U.S. site encountered the same difficulty; 24 months were required to recruit 50 participants (<LINK REF="REF-Creinin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Creinin 2000</LINK>). This may not be as much of a barrier elsewhere. Ashok and colleagues in Scotland (<LINK REF="REF-Ashok-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ashok 2002</LINK>) successfully performed a partially randomised trial comparing vacuum aspiration to induction with mifepristone and misoprostol in women between 10-13 weeks' gestation. In their trial, only 18% of women recruited declined random allocation. </P>
<P>In the two randomised trials in this review, D&amp;E resulted in fewer adverse events than induction for second trimester abortion. Induction with mifepristone and misoprostol, however, appears to be effective and acceptable. This conclusion is consistent with that of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) which has assigned D&amp;E a category "A" recommendation (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2004</LINK>). Induction abortion is ascribed a category "B" recommendation based on the status of the available evidence. The sample sizes were small in these studies, therefore the results are imprecise. Larger trials, which include gestations up to 24 weeks, are still needed to improve the precision of outcomes estimates, especially for rare complications such as uterine perforation, infection, or haemorrhage. To achieve an adequate sample size, it may be necessary to perform these studies in areas where induction abortion is more acceptable than in the United States. </P>

<REFERENCE NOTES="&lt;p&gt;Unpublished manuscript unavailable and author could not be reached for comment. Abstract: The efficacy of abortions induced by prostaglandins (PGS), hysterotomy, and hypertonic saline was compared in this double-blind study of 106 cases. PGF2 alpha was used for the PG segment of the study, and it was administered intraamniotically in either single (50 mg) or multiple (25 mg initially followed by 1 or 2 more doses) injections. 51 cases received PGF2 alpha (23 single dose and 28 multiple dose), 24 women received intraamniotic saline, and 31 had abortion by hysterotomy. 11 technique failures were recorded (6 with PGs and 5 with saline). All patients were in midtrimester of pregnancy. Time interval between injection and expulsion of products was within 24 hours in 48% of the single dose PGF2 alpha cases, and within 24-72 hours in 39% of PGF2 alpha inductions (13% took over 72 hours). For saline induction, 33% expelled within 24 hours and 67% within 24-72 hours. Hysterotomy took 30-45 minutes for completion. With multiple dose PGF2 alpha, 43% expelled the products within 24 hours and 50% expelled within 24-72 hours. Of the 51 cases of PGF2 alpha, there were 16 cases with single dose who needed surgical removal of the placenta (31%), whereas 23 cases with multiple doses (45%) required surgical evacuation. 14 of the saline cases (58.3%) required subsequent evacuation. Side effects were less marked with saline than with PGF2 alpha; these were generally vomiting and diarrhea, although 2 cases of infection with PGF2 alpha occurred, probably because of indwelling catheter. Blood loss was considerably less with the PG method than with saline. 85 of the 106 cases were followed, and 42 of the 51 PGF2 alpha patients had no complaints at follow-up; 23 of 24 saline cases had no complaints; and 30 of 31 hysterotomy cases followed had no complaints. PGF1 alpha is preferred over saline because the interval to evacuation is shorter and blood loss is minimal. Hysterotomy is less preferable because of the need for general anesthesia and complications generally associated with abdominal surgery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" PRIMARY="NO" TYPE="UNPUBLISHED">

<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised controlled trial. Random allocation by means of "shuffling, selecting, and numbering" sealed envelopes containing treatment allocation cards. Single operator blinded to cumulative number of subjects assigned to each group.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>100 women requesting termination of pregnancy.<BR/>Inclusion criteria: any age, race, or gravidity, 13-18 weeks gestation by last menstrual period, willing to accept allocation, "reasonable expectation" of obtaining follow-up information.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: evidence of abortion that had already been initiated spontaneously or artificially, anticipation of concurrent sterilization or other operation at the time of termination, preexisting medical or surgical condition thought to be incompatible with either treatment.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Surgical method: Dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) performed under intravenous sedation with intracervical block (20 cc 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000). All subjects received cervical preparation with laminaria placement one day prior to abortion.<BR/>Medical method: Prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2a) intra-amniotic instillation with indwelling catheter. Initial dose of 40 mg with additional 20 mg doses at 24 and 36 hours as needed. Cervical preparation not performed. Curettage performed if placenta not expelled within 2 hours of fetus and for all subjects routinely after expulsion of placenta. <BR/>Neither oxytocics or prophylactic antibiotics used in either group.<BR/>All subjects given thermometer to monitor temperature twice daily for 5 days post-abortion. Follow-up scheduled for 2 weeks after abortion.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome: total complication rate including major (seizure, hemorrhage requiring transfusion) and minor (febrile morbidity, trauma to cervix or vagina, prostaglandin reaction) complications. <BR/>Other outcomes: Delay in completion of abortion, abortion completed by allocation group, time/need for hospitalization, side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and treatment of complications (curettage, antibiotics, blood transfusion, surgical repair of cervical or vaginal injury), hospital re-admissions.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Subjects treated with PGF2a required delay in treatment until gestational age was greater than or equal to 16 weeks by hospital protocol. Six subjects discontinued participation in study due to delay. <BR/>Failure of PGF2a instillation defined as failure to expel fetus within 48 hours after instillation of initial dose.<BR/>D&amp;E subjects monitored 1 1/2 hours after surgery. Post-procedure hematocrit not checked.<BR/>PGF2a subjects observed for a minimum of 4 hours after completion of abortion and hematocrit determined prior to discharge.</P>
</CHAR_NOTES>
</INCLUDED_CHAR>
<INCLUDED_CHAR STUDY_ID="STD-Grimes-2004">
<CHAR_METHODS>
<P>Randomised controlled trial. 1:1 random allocation using computer-generated permuted blocks. Concealment maintained with sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes prepared by epidemiologist not associated with the trial.</P>
</CHAR_METHODS>
<CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<P>18 women requesting termination of pregnancy.<BR/>Inclusion criteria: any race or ethnic group, age 18 years or older, English speaking, gestational age determined by ultrasound to be 13.9-19.9 weeks by biparietal diameter. Subjects with fetal death or anomalous fetuses were included.<BR/>Exclusion criteria: prior cesarean delivery or myomectomy, medical conditions contraindicating mifepristone or misoprostol use, known transportation difficulties relating to abortion visits, subjects unwilling to be contacted by telephone or letter for follow-up at 2 weeks.</P>
</CHAR_PARTICIPANTS>
<CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<P>Surgical method: D&amp;E performed under "light general anesthesia without intubation." All subjects received cervical preparation with laminaria insertion 1-2 days prior to abortion.<BR/>Medical method: 200 mg oral mifepristone followed 48 hours later by 800 mcg vaginal misoprostol. Each subject received additional doses of 400 mcg oral misoprostol every 3 hours to a maximum of 4 oral doses until abortion occurred. Placental removal performed if spontaneous expulsion did not occur within 2 hours of passage of fetus.<BR/>All subjects received prophylactic doxycyline.</P>
</CHAR_INTERVENTIONS>
<CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<P>Primary outcome: feasibility of randomising U.S. women to two methods of abortion. <BR/>Other outcomes: time to completion of medical abortion, need for hospitalization beyond one day, need for unanticipated curettage or removal of placenta.<BR/>Acceptability, satisfaction, adverse events, side effects such as vomiting or diarrhea, best and worst features of treatment assessed with self-administered questionnaire prior to discharge and 2 weeks after treatment.</P>
</CHAR_OUTCOMES>
<CHAR_NOTES>
<P>Planned enrolment of 60 subjects. Stopping rules established based on rates of enrolment: if 20 patients could not be enroled within 12 months or 40 within 24 months. Enrolment stopped after 12 months.</P>
