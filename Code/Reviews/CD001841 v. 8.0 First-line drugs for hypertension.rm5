It has been divided into three categories, based on resting blood pressures, measured in a standard way: mild hypertension (140 to 159/90-99 mmHg), moderate hypertension (160 to 179/100 to 109 mmHg), and severe hypertension (180/110 mmHg or higher). Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, even if blood pressure readings are very high. For most adults with primary or essential hypertension, there is no identifiable cause for the high blood pressure. Some people have high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, caused by underlying conditions such as adrenal gland tumours, kidney problems, thyroid problems, excessive alcohol intake, or use of certain medications, such as birth control pills. Isolated systolic hypertension is a condition in which the diastolic pressure is normal (less than 90 mmHg), but systolic pressure is high (160 mmHg or greater). This is a common type of high blood pressure among older people.<BR/></P><P>Blood pressure tends to increase with age. High blood pressure is more common in men in early middle age, more common in women after age 65, and more common in Blacks compared to Caucasians. The risk of high blood pressure is increased when there is a family history of high blood pressure, in the presence of obesity, or when physically inactive. High blood pressure is associated with smoking, too much salt in the diet, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, high levels of stress, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, and sleep apnea.</P><P>Uncontrolled persistent resting high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney damage, and vision loss.</P><CONDITION MODIFIED="2018-03-05 19:03:41 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>When drug treatment is indicated in the management of patients with elevated blood pressure, an important decision is which drug to choose first. The decision should be informed by the best available evidence on reduction of the outcomes that are important to the patient, i.e. the ability of the drug to reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with elevated blood pressure (disabling stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and mortality).</P></CONDITION><INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2018-03-05 19:03:56 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>High blood pressure should initially be managed with changing life style &#8212; eating a healthy diet with less salt, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight. When these life-style changes are not enough, treatment with antihypertensive drugs is recommended. Several different classes of medications are available to reduce blood pressure. The six main drug classes, included in this review, are thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers.</P></INTERVENTION><THEORY MODIFIED="2018-03-05 19:04:48 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Different classes of antihypertensive drugs have different mechanisms of action.</P><P><B>Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics</B>: The mechanism of action by which thiazide diuretics lower blood pressure in the long term is not fully understood (<LINK REF="REF-Zhu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhu 2005)</LINK>. After chronic use, thiazides lower peripheral resistance. The mechanism of these effects is uncertain, as it may involve effects on the whole body, renal autoregulation, or direct vasodilator actions (<LINK REF="REF-Hughes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hughes 2004</LINK>). Thiazides act on the kidney to inhibit reabsorption of sodium (Na<SUP>+</SUP>) and chloride (Cl<SUP>-</SUP>) ions from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys, by blocking the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (<LINK REF="REF-Duarte-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Duarte 2010</LINK>). They also increase calcium reabsorption at the distal tubule, and increase the reabsorption of calcium ions (Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>), by a mechanism involving the reabsorption of sodium and calcium in the proximal tubule in response to sodium depletion.</P><P><B>Beta-blockers</B>: Beta-blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine on adrenergic beta-receptors. Some block activation of all types of beta-adrenergic receptors (&#946;<SUB>1</SUB>, &#946;<SUB>2</SUB>, and &#946;<SUB>3</SUB>), and others are selective for one of the three types of beta receptors (<LINK REF="REF-Frishman-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frishman 2005</LINK>).</P><P><B>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</B>: ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII), and thus decrease the actions of angiotensin II. The end result is to lower arteriolar resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke work, and volume; lower resistance in blood vessels in the kidneys; and increase excretion of sodium in the urine. Renin and AI increases in concentration in the blood as a result of negative feedback of the conversion of AI to AII. AII and aldosterone levels decrease. Bradykinin increases, because ACE is also responsible for inactivation of bradykinin.</P><P><B>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): </B>ARBs block the activation of angiotensin II AT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors. Blockage of AT<SUB>1</SUB> receptors directly causes vasodilation, reduces secretion of vasopressin, and reduces the production and secretion of aldosterone.</P><P><B>Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)</B>: CCBs block calcium channel and inhibit calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells. They reduce blood pressure through various mechanisms: by vasodilation, by reducing the force of contraction of the heart, by slowing the heart rate, and by directly reducing aldosterone production.</P><P><B>Alpha blockers:</B> &#945;<SUB>1</SUB> adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit the binding of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) to the &#945;<SUB>1</SUB> receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells. The primary effect of this inhibition is vasodilation, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, leading to decreased blood pressure.</P></THEORY><IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2018-03-13 10:43:12 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><P>There have been a number of reviews of the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy, but most have emphasized effectiveness of all drug classes (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gueyffier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueyffier 1996</LINK>), or effectiveness of all drug classes in special populations, such the elderly (<LINK REF="REF-Insua-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Insua 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-MacMahon-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">MacMahon 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thijs-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thijs 1992</LINK>). When all drug therapies are included in one review, there is an underlying assumption that the benefits of lowering blood pressure are independent of the mechanism by which it is achieved. This assumption has not been proven, and it is likely that different classes of drugs will have different blood pressure lowering effects, and will have effects that are independent of the blood pressure lowering effect. A drug that lowers blood pressure could have pharmacological and physiological actions independent of blood pressure lowering, and these other actions (both known and unknown) could enhance or negate the effects on health outcomes associated with the decrease in blood pressure. This possibility is supported by a recent analysis that suggested that blood pressure lowering only explains about 50% of the treatment effect in antihypertensive trials (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 2005</LINK>).</P><P>This review update aims to 1) document the best available evidence of effectiveness for different classes of drugs and doses used as first-line therapy, compared to placebo or no treatment, and 2) present the outcome data in a way that best assists clinicians in the choice of a first-line drug.</P></IMPORTANCE></BACKGROUND><OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2018-03-06 11:35:29 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary objective</HEADING><OL><LI>To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low dose and high dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment.</LI></OL></SUBSECTION><SUBSECTION><HEADING LEVEL="4">Secondary objectives</HEADING><OL><LI>To quantify the blood pressure lowering effect of antihypertensive treatment when different drug classes are used as the first-line drug.</LI><LI>To quantify the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects of different first-line antihypertensive class drugs, compared to placebo or no treatme</LI></OL></SUBSECTION></OBJECTIVES><METHODS MODIFIED="2018-03-27 13:08:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2018-03-23 12:17:46 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2018-03-05 19:06:22 -0800" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) of at least one year duration.

The pooled data showed a reduction in total mortality when using a thiazide as the first-line choice, and suggested that as first-line therapy, low-dose thiazide, reduced coronary heart disease events, whereas high-dose thiazide did not.</P><P>Five RCTs used a first-line beta-blocker (19,313 participants), and provided enough data to compare with first-line thiazides. Analyses suggested that beta-blockers reduced total stroke and total cardiovascular events less than all thiazides, and they reduced coronary heart disease less than a first-line low-dose thiazide. It is important to note that in four of the five beta-blocker trials, atenolol was the beta-blocker used. It is possible that the reduced effectiveness of first-line beta blockers was limited to atenolol.</P><P>First-line angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, in three RCTs and a smaller population (6002 participants), were associated with similar benefits, but wider confidence intervals than first-line low-dose thiazides for all outcomes.</P><P>The amount of data for first-line calcium channel blockers in one trial (4695 participants) was insufficient to make any meaningful comparisons; this can be appreciated by noting the wide confidence intervals associated with the treatment effects for this drug class (<LINK REF="STD-SYST_x002d_EUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SYST-EUR 1997</LINK>).</P><P>Relative risk (risk ratio) is the best way to indirectly compare the effectiveness between different drug classes. When we compared risk ratios (RR), beta blockers (RR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.98) appeared to be less effective than low-dose thiazides (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76) in reducing total cardiovascular events. First-line ACE inhibitors (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85), and calcium channel blockers (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), had less data, but could not be distinguished from low-dose thiazides for the effect on total cardiovascular events, or other outcomes.</P><P>However, for the patient, it is more meaningful to have a measure of the absolute risk reduction (ARR) over a specified period of time. We calculated this summary measure for total cardiovascular events for the four drug classes in three clinical settings, where it was possible: secondary prevention, primary prevention (moderate to severe hypertension), and primary prevention (mild to moderate hypertension).</P><P><B>Secondary prevention</B>: For the three secondary prevention trials using thiazides, and the one secondary trial using an ACE inhibitor, the average baseline blood pressure was approximately 155/94 mmHg. The average total cardiovascular event rate was 23.1% over five years in the control group, and the RR with treatment was 0.76. Therefore, the ARR over five years was 5.5% (23.1 X 0.24). For the two secondary prevention beta-blocker trials, there was no clear reduction in total cardiovascular events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.21). There were no secondary prevention trials that used calcium channel blockers.</P><P><B>Primary prevention (moderate to severe hypertension)</B>: For the seven low-dose thiazide trials in this category, the baseline systolic blood pressure was 175 mmHg, and the average total cardiovascular event rate over five years in the control groups was 16%. The RR with treatment was 0.68, for an ARR over five years of 5.1% (16 X 0.32). This is similar to the 5.5% calculated for secondary prevention. For the two beta-blocker trials in this category, there was no significant reduction in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.02). In the one calcium channel blocker trial, the ARR over five years was 4.6% (16 X 0.29), and in the one ACE inhibitor trial, the estimated ARR over five years was 3.7% (16 X 0.23; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK>).</P><P><B>Primary prevention (mild to moderate hypertension)</B>: There were five first-line high-dose thiazide trials in this category, with an average baseline systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg. In these five trials, the average cardiovascular event rate in the control group over five years was 4.1%. The RR with first-line high-dose thiazide treatment was 0.80 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.94), and the ARR over five years was 0.82% (4.1 X 0.2). For the one beta-blocker trial in this category, the RR with treatment was 0.82, and the ARR over five years was 0.74% (4.1 X 0.18).</P><P>This demonstrates that the absolute benefits are at least as good for first-line low dose thiazides as the other classes of antihypertensives. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for a low-dose thiazide in moderate to severe hypertension (average systolic 175 mmHg) is about 20 over a five-year duration. The NNTB was only a little lower in a secondary prevention setting, though the baseline blood pressures (average systolic 155 mmHg) were also lower.</P><P>Notably, the NNTB was much higher, about 120 over five years, for primary prevention patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The low absolute benefit in individuals with lower blood pressure at baseline reflected two differences: the lesser relative benefit of a RR of 0.8 versus a RR of 0.7, and the lower five-year event rate in the control groups of 4%. One of the limitations of this analysis was that the first-line drug used in this population was a high-dose thiazide, which the evidence suggests is not as effective. It is possible that using a low-dose thiazide in these trials would have improved the benefit to a RR of 0.7. However, even if that was true, the absolute benefit would still be small (ARR = 1.2%; NNTB 83 over five years). The low absolute benefit of antihypertensive therapy for mild to moderate elevations in blood pressure in primary prevention needs to be reflected by authors of hypertension guidelines.</P><P>Many of the patients in these trials also had co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus. In this review, it was not possible to assess these patients separately, but <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK> analyzed their diabetes subgroup, and found the relative benefit was the same, and the absolute benefit was greater in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients.</P></SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS><APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2018-03-27 13:08:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>Since 72.7% of participants in this review were primary prevention, the data are primarily relevant to a primary prevention population. Three of the included first-line thiazide trials included participants with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA; (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSCSG-1974" TYPE="STUDY">HSCSG 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-PATS-1996" TYPE="STUDY">PATS 1996</LINK>)). When we deselected these trials from the thiazide analyses, the treatment effect estimates did not change. When we deselected all trials in which the baseline prevalence of myocardial infarction was either not reported (<LINK REF="STD-Barraclough-1973" TYPE="STUDY">Barraclough 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuramoto-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kuramoto 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC_x002d_O-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC-O 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_II-1970" TYPE="STUDY">VA-II 1970</LINK>), or was greater than 10% (<LINK REF="STD-Carter-1970" TYPE="STUDY">Carter 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EWPHE-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EWPHE 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSCSG-1974" TYPE="STUDY">HSCSG 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1966</LINK>), the treatment effect for total cardiovascular events was not different. For first-line ACE inhibitors, <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-HYP-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE HYP 2000</LINK> was predominantly secondary prevention, and the relative benefit with treatment was similar to the other two primary prevention trials (<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-pilot-2003" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET pilot 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK>).</P><P>For sensitivity analyses, we deselected trials that were not placebo controlled and blinded, trials that were restricted to patients with isolated systolic hypertension, small trials, and trials using supplemental drugs from other defined classes. In all of these instances, there was no clinically important change in the treatment effect estimate.</P><P>The data on withdrawals due to adverse effects were incomplete and heterogeneous. Therefore, it was difficult to compare the different drug classes for this outcome. However, there was nothing to suggest that other classes of drugs were better tolerated than first-line low-dose thiazides.</P><P>The blood pressure data in this systematic review were heterogeneous. This was because the number of drugs used in the trials differed, and only 16 of the 24 trials were double-blinded. Blood pressure measurements are subject to bias if the observer and the patient know what is being administered. Because of these factors, it was not possible to use the blood pressure data to assess the blood pressure lowering efficacy of the different classes of drugs, or to compare low-dose and high-dose first-line thiazides.</P><P>There is growing evidence that the surrogate marker - the lowering of blood pressure - is inadequate to predict health outcomes with antihypertensive therapy. Despite similar reductions in blood pressure, we found that first-line low-dose and high-dose thiazide therapy had different impacts on the incidence of coronary heart disease. </P><P>In the 15 of the 24 trials where it could be assessed, despite dose titration and the addition of supplemental drugs, about 40% of the patients did not achieve the target blood pressure. Four trials reported that 34% of the patients did not achieve the target systolic pressure of less than 160 mm Hg (<LINK REF="STD-Kuramoto-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kuramoto 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC_x002d_O-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC-O 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHEP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SHEP_x002d_P-1989" TYPE="STUDY">SHEP-P 1989</LINK>). In two trials, over 50% did not achieve the target systolic pressure of less than 150 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-pilot-2003" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET pilot 2003</LINK>). The other nine trials reported that 40% of the patients did not achieve the target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mmHg (<LINK REF="STD-ATTMH-1980" TYPE="STUDY">ATTMH 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-EWPHE-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EWPHE 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HSCSG-1974" TYPE="STUDY">HSCSG 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC_x002d_TMH-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC-TMH 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-OSLO-1986" TYPE="STUDY">OSLO 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USPHSHCSG-1977" TYPE="STUDY">USPHSHCSG 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_I-1967" TYPE="STUDY">VA-I 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_II-1970" TYPE="STUDY">VA-II 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1966</LINK>). This observation is extremely important clinically, as it means that physicians can only expect to achieve blood pressure targets in about 60% of the patients they treat. However, this does not mean that the patients who do not achieve the target will benefit less than those who do, as blood pressure reduction is only partly responsible for the risk reduction from antihypertensive treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Boissel-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boissel 2005</LINK>).</P><P>The evidence showed that starting with a low dose of thiazide, and only titrating up if necessary, significantly reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. In contrast, starting with a high dose (50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or the equivalent) did not. Since the high-dose therapy has no proven advantages, there is no justification for using high doses, or for comparing low-dose and high-dose thiazide therapies in a future trial. Therefore, the current recommendation for the use of thiazides in the management of hypertension is justifiable, based on the evidence presented here: start with a low dose (12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or the equivalent), increase the dose if necessary, and do not exceed a dose of 50 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, or the equivalent.</P><P>The fact that thiazides are similarly, or more effective than other drug classes in reducing mortality and morbidity, and that the evidence is most robust for thiazides, is reason by itself to prescribe them first for most patients with hypertension. The value of this approach is further supported by the fact that of the drug classes studied, the thiazides are the least expensive drug class in most countries. If more than one thiazide or thiazide-like drug is available, then the least expensive one is the most rational choice.</P><P>Additional information supporting the use of thiazides was recently published by <LINK REF="REF-Puttnam-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Puttnam 2017</LINK>. By using data from a national database, a post-trial cohort surveillance study of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack trial (ALLHAT) examined whether the use of thiazide diuretics for the treatment of hypertension was associated with reduced risk of fracture, compared with non-use. ALLHAT was a large randomized clinical trial that compared the effect of first-step therapy with different classes of antihypertensive drug therapy (chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril) in preventing fatal coronary heart disease (CHD), nonfatal myocardial infarction (primary outcome), or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Hospitalized hip and pelvic fractures were chosen as endpoints, because they are almost always associated with hospitalization. A total of 22,180 participants, with a mean age of 70.4 years, were followed for up to eight years (mean 4.9 years) during masked therapy. Participants randomized to receive chlorthalidone versus amlodipine or lisinopril had a lower risk of fracture on adjusted analyses (hazards ratio (HR) 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98; P = 0.04). The authors concluded that "findings from a large randomized clinical trial provide evidence of a beneficial effect of thiazide-type diuretic therapy in reducing hip and pelvic fracture compared with treatment with other antihypertensive medications".</P></APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS><QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2018-03-23 11:37:05 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><P>We graded the overall quality of the evidence and developed 'Summary of findings' tables, using GRADEpro GDTsoftware (<LINK REF="REF-GRADEpro-GDT" TYPE="REFERENCE">GRADEpro GDT</LINK>).</P><P>We created five 'Summary of findings' tables to display the quality of evidence and summary of the effects on clinically important outcomes, for first-line low-dose thiazides (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>), high-dose thiazides (<LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>), beta-blockers (<LINK REF="SOF-03" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 3</LINK>), ACE inhibitors (<LINK REF="SOF-04" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 4</LINK>), and calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P><P>We found high-quality evidence that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality, stroke, CHD, and total cardiovascular events more than placebo.

In two trials, the first-line therapy was a combination of a thiazide plus a potassium sparing diuretic (<LINK REF="STD-EWPHE-1985" TYPE="STUDY">EWPHE 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC_x002d_O-1992" TYPE="STUDY">MRC-O 1992</LINK>). Deselecting these two trials had no impact on the treatment effect. In five trials, a reserpine derivative was combined with the thiazide as first-line therapy (<LINK REF="STD-HSCSG-1974" TYPE="STUDY">HSCSG 1974</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-USPHSHCSG-1977" TYPE="STUDY">USPHSHCSG 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_I-1967" TYPE="STUDY">VA-I 1967</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-VA_x002d_II-1970" TYPE="STUDY">VA-II 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1966</LINK>. When these five trials were deselected, the treatment effect did not change either. Therefore, the data for first-line thiazides appear robust, and the benefits achieved are most likely attributable to the first-line thiazide therapy.</P></POTENTIAL_BIASES><AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2018-03-27 13:08:27 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]"><P>It is important in this type of analysis not to include trials in which there is significant contamination by drugs from other drug classes of interest. In our opinion, <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1997</LINK> incorrectly included the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK> and the <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1991</LINK> trial in their beta-blocker group. In the trial by <LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK>, 67% of patients in the active treatment group received bendrofluazide, and 70% received atenolol; in the <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1991</LINK> trial, more than 70% in the active treatment group received thiazides and more than 70% received beta-blockers. Therefore, in those two trials, the treatment effect could not be attributed to first-line thiazides or first-line beta-blockers. Other minor differences in the trials in this review and that by <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1997</LINK> are as follows. We classified <LINK REF="STD-Kuramoto-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kuramoto 1981</LINK> as a low-dose trial, and they classified it as high-dose trial. It fit into our low-dose category, based on the starting dose of 1 mg of trichlormethiazide. Moving the trial from the low-dose to the high-dose group did not change our findings. Unlike <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1997</LINK>, we excluded the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program trial because it did not have an untreated control group, and the intervention group was treated with life-style therapies in addition to drug therapy (<LINK REF="STD-HDFP-1984" TYPE="STUDY">HDFP 1984</LINK>). We included one small trial by <LINK REF="STD-Wolff-1966" TYPE="STUDY">Wolff 1966</LINK>, not referenced by <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 1997</LINK>. This trial was also included in the meta-analysis in <LINK REF="REF-Collins-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1990</LINK> and in <LINK REF="REF-Gueyffier-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gueyffier 1996</LINK>, The meta-analysis by the blood pressure trialists group was incomplete and misleading because of their decision to exclude all trials prior to 1995 (<LINK REF="REF-BBLTTC-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">BBLTTC 2005</LINK>).</P><P>The network meta-analysis included most of the trials comparing treatment versus placebo or no treatment that were included in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK>). However, they again incorrectly included two trials in their beta-blocker group (<LINK REF="STD-Coope-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Coope 1986</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STOP-1991" TYPE="STUDY">STOP 1991</LINK>), and in our opinion, inappropriately included <LINK REF="STD-PROGRESS-2001" TYPE="STUDY">PROGRESS 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-IDM-2001" TYPE="STUDY">IDM 2001</LINK>, and <LINK REF="STD-Lewis-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lewis 2001</LINK> as evidence for first-line treatment in hypertension, when most patients did not have hypertension. Most importantly, this review includes four trials not included in the <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK> review (<LINK REF="STD-HOPE-HYP-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE HYP 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-pilot-2003" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET pilot 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK>).</P><P>Our reasons for classifying <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK> in this review deserve mention. First, in <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK>, the treatment target for the control group was over 200/105 mmHg for the first five years, after which it was lowered to over 180/105 mmHg. This was similar to the escape therapy in other trials that classified the control group as no treatment. For example, in the <LINK REF="STD-OSLO-1986" TYPE="STUDY">OSLO 1986</LINK> trial, drug treatment in the control group was started if blood pressure exceeded 179/109 mmHg and was sustained. Second, the <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK> target in the intervention group (less than 150/85 mmHg) was very similar to the targets in the intervention groups of the included studies in this review (less than 140 to 160/less than 80 to 90 mmHg). Third, the difference in blood pressure achieved between the treatment and control group over the nine years of the trial (10 to 11/4 to 6 mmHg) is similar to the difference in BP for other included trials in this review (9 to 12/3 to 6 mmHg; (<LINK REF="STD-ATTMH-1980" TYPE="STUDY">ATTMH 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kuramoto-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Kuramoto 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-MRC_x002d_TMH-1985" TYPE="STUDY">MRC-TMH 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SYST_x002d_EUR-1997" TYPE="STUDY">SYST-EUR 1997</LINK>)).</P><P><LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2017</LINK> also included <LINK REF="STD-UKPDS-39-1998" TYPE="STUDY">UKPDS 39 1998</LINK> in their beta-blocker review, published in 2007. In contrast to <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2017</LINK>, we did not include <LINK REF="STD-IPPPSH-1985" TYPE="STUDY">IPPPSH 1985</LINK> as representing first-line beta blockers, as more than 65% of the patients also received a thiazide. We did include <LINK REF="STD-Dutch-TIA-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Dutch TIA 1993</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-TEST-1995" TYPE="STUDY">TEST 1995</LINK>, which <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2017</LINK> did not. Other reviews did not include <LINK REF="STD-HOPE-HYP-2000" TYPE="STUDY">HOPE HYP 2000</LINK>, as the data separated for the hypertensive group had not been published. We are thankful to the authors of HOPE for providing these data. The <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-pilot-2003" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET pilot 2003</LINK> trial and the <LINK REF="STD-HYVET-2008" TYPE="STUDY">HYVET 2008</LINK> trial are more recent trials included in our review. Despite these differences, the conclusions and interpretation of the findings in this review are concordant with <LINK REF="REF-Psaty-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Psaty 2003</LINK>, who concluded that thiazides were the first-line drug of choice, and <LINK REF="REF-Wiysonge-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wiysonge 2017</LINK>, who concluded that beta-blockers were not an appropriate first-line drug choice. Refer to <LINK REF="TBL-02" TYPE="TABLE">Table 2</LINK> for further details. </P><P>The recent <LINK REF="REF-Taverny-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taverny 2016</LINK> review assessed the effects of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy on three separate cardiac outcomes - sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal myocardial infarction in hypertensive individuals. In our review, these three outcomes were combined as total CHD events. In <LINK REF="REF-Taverny-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taverny 2016</LINK>, based on 15 randomized placebo-controlled trials, in 39,908 patients, for a mean duration of 4.2 years, moderate-quality evidence showed that antihypertensive therapy did not reduce sudden cardiac death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15), but did reduce both nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98), and fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.90). However, they did not report results separately for specific first-line antihypertensive drug classes. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased in the drug treatment group to 12.8%, compared with 6.2% in the no treatment group. A Cochrane review, Pharmacotherapy for mild hypertension, has been published and is being updated (<LINK REF="REF-Diao-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Diao 2012</LINK>). A systematic review, Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults (18 to 59 years), has recently been published (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2017</LINK>). The Cochrane review, Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in the elderly (60 years or older), is being updated (<LINK REF="REF-Musini-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Musini 2009</LINK>). </P><P>Since more trials comparing drug therapy with a placebo or no treatment are unlikely to be forthcoming, future evidence of effectiveness of first-line therapy will need to come from head-to-head comparisons. Two Cochrane reviews have compared first-line calcium channel blockers (<LINK REF="REF-Chen-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chen 2010</LINK>) and first-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system (<LINK REF="REF-Xue-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Xue 2015</LINK>) with first-line thiazides. These reviews confirm the likely morbidity benefits of first-line thiazides. We are also currently working on a meta-analysis of head-to-head trials in a separate systematic review. That review will focus on head-to-head trials comparing first-line thiazides with other classes of drugs (<LINK REF="REF-Reinhart-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reinhart 2011</LINK>).<BR/></P></AGREEMENT></DISCUSSION><CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2018-03-23 12:14:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2018-03-23 12:14:11 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><P>Choice of first-line treatment versus placebo or no treatment: the evidence for morbidity and mortality.<BR/></P><UL><LI>Most of the available evidence justifying treatment of patients with elevated blood pressure used a thiazide as the first-line drug.</LI><LI>First-line low-dose thiazides were more effective than first-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers.</LI><LI>The treatment effect for first-line ACE inhibitors was similar to low-dose thiazides but less robust, and ACE inhibitors are more expensive than thiazides.</LI><LI>Evidence for effectiveness of first-line calcium channel blockers was insufficient.</LI><LI>There were no RCTs comparing first-line use of angiotensin receptor blockers or alpha blockers.</LI><LI>Morbidity and mortality benefit with antihypertensive treatment depended on the drug class received, not the blood pressure achieved.</LI></UL><P>Blood pressure measurement.<BR/></P><UL><LI>Blood pressure must be measured (average of multiple readings) using proper technique, with the patient non-stimulated and resting for at least five minutes.</LI></UL><P>Population.<BR/></P><UL><LI> Secondary prevention, survivors of transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or myocardial infarction, aged 55 to 80 years, with an average blood pressure of 155/94 mmHg (five-year ARR 5.5%) (Moderate quality evidence).</LI><LI>Primary prevention in adult patients with moderate to severe hypertension, with an average systolic blood pressure of 175 mmHg (five-year ARR 5.1%) (High quality evidence).</LI><LI>Primary prevention in adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with an average systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg (five-year ARR 0.8% to 1.2%) (Low quality evidence).</LI><LI>Blood pressure targets are only achieved in about 60% of patients with mild, moderate, and severe hypertension treated with stepped-care antihypertensive drugs.</LI></UL></IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE><IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2018-03-23 12:14:52 -0700" MODIFIED_BY="James M Wright"><P>At the present time, RCT data for antihypertensives as first-line treatment versus placebo or no treatment are lacking for all classes other than thiazides. Since we have clear evidence of effectiveness of first-line low-dose thiazides in primary prevention, patients with blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or higher, and in secondary prevention, in patients with lower blood pressures, it would be unethical to do further trials for this population compared to a placebo or untreated control group. Future RCTs in these populations should be done with low-dose first-line thiazides as the comparison group. The benefits and harms of primary prevention treatment of patients with lower blood pressures remains uncertain at the present time.

Kuramoto 1981 study is a placebo-controlled single site study conducted in ambulatory patients in home for the aged in Tokyo, Japan. This study was included as a randomised study in the "Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in the elderly" original review by <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1998</LINK> based on unpublished information as per personal conversation with study author. <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1998</LINK> review stated that "Allocation of individuals within matched pairs to treatment and control groups was made by a blinded statistical coordinator, thought to be randomised but not entirely clear. Both patients and providers were blinded." Based on this information from <LINK REF="REF-Mulrow-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mulrow 1998</LINK> review we have decided to include this study and reassessed the risk of bias for the two domains -
