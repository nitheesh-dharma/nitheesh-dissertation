<P>Clot busting drugs are effective at restoring blood flow in blocked leg arteries. Intravenous infusion (injection into veins) causes more haemorrhagic complications (risk of serious bleeding) than injection into arteries (arterial infusion). Acute reduction in blood flow to a limb (peripheral arterial ischaemia) is usually caused by a blood clot blocking an artery. The condition can be life threatening if not treated promptly. Infusion of clot-busting drugs (thrombolysis) can restore blood flow by dispersing the clot. This review found evidence suggesting that arterial infusion is more effective than intravenous infusion. The risk of haemorrhage with intravenous infusion is high. However, none of the different arterial infusion techniques studied have been shown to be more effective in preventing limb loss, amputation or death. More research is needed to confirm these findings.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Thrombolytic therapy is a useful tool in the management of acute peripheral arterial ischaemia. Fibrinolytic drugs are used to disperse blood clot to clear arterial occlusion. A variety of techniques are used to deliver these agents.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 10:12:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in their Specialised Register (February 6, 2006) and CENTRAL in <I>The Cochrane Library</I> (Issue 1, 2006). We searched Vascular Surgical and Radiological Societies' meetings proceedings. Reference lists of identified studies were also searched for relevant trials. Major pharmaceutical firms and trialists were asked about unpublished trials.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Two authors independently selected RCTs comparing infusion techniques of fibrinolytic agents in the treatment of acute peripheral arterial ischaemia. Trials with poor quality methodology were excluded.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>We included the following data: limb salvage, amputation, death, vessel patency, time to achieve thrombolysis, and reduction in the need for surgical intervention. We compared complication rates for major haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident and distal embolization. </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Intra-arterial delivery of thrombolytic agents appeared to be more effective than intravenous administration. Thrombolysis was more effective when the angiographic catheter was placed within the thrombus. Although 'high dose' and 'forced infusion' techniques achieved vessel patency in less time than 'low dose infusion', there were more bleeding complications, and no increase in patency rates or improvement in limb salvage at 30 days.</P>

<I>Implications for practice</I>
</B> <BR/>
</P>
<P>Thrombolysis should be reserved for patients with limb threatening ischaemia, due to the high risk of haemorrhage or death. <BR/>Greater benefit is seen when the thrombolytic agent is delivered into the thrombus. Systemic intravenous thrombolysis is less effective than intra-arterial thrombolysis and is associated with an increase in bleeding complications. <BR/> 'High dose' and 'forced infusion' techniques, or adjunctive agents such as platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may speed up thrombolysis, but these are not accompanied by lower amputation rates or a decreased need for adjunctive endovascular or surgical procedures. <BR/>'Low dose continuous infusion', following initial lacing of the thrombus with a high dose of the thrombolytic agent, is the least labour intensive technique. </P>

<P>Only large multicentre trials with carefully controlled inclusion criteria will be sufficiently powerful to demonstrate genuine benefit for a particular thrombolytic regime.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2008-10-20 10:40:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<BACKGROUND>
<P>Acute peripheral arterial ischaemia results from an abrupt reduction in blood flow to a limb. It is usually caused by blood clot (thrombosis) which may form in a diseased artery or a bypass graft, or travel there from a remote site via the bloodstream. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the severity of the ischaemia. Relatively minor reduction in perfusion results in calf pain during exercise (intermittent claudication). More significant ischaemia leads to pain at rest, and if flow is not promptly restored, this may lead to tissue death requiring amputation. Peripheral arterial thrombolysis is the process of using fibrinolytic drugs to dissolve the occluding blood clot.<B> </B>Thrombolysis has become established as a useful tool in the management of acute peripheral arterial ischaemia. It is particularly useful for those cases of less than two weeks duration (<LINK REF="REF-STILE-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">STILE 1994</LINK>). Although data from randomised controlled studies are not extensive, much has been learnt about indications, risks and benefits of thrombolysis. Different thrombolytic agents have been used and are the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Berridge-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berridge 1998</LINK>), and techniques of drug administration have become increasingly sophisticated. Originally, peripheral arterial thrombolysis was performed using intravenous administration of the drug, and relatively high doses of the drug were used to achieve therapeutic levels at the site of arterial occlusion (blockage). Subsequently, low dose intra-thrombus infusion became more popular. This aimed to achieve higher local drug concentrations for a smaller total dose. Success rates appeared much improved and conversely complication rates became more acceptable. In an attempt to achieve faster thrombolysis, high dose bolus (the initial dose) and forced injection techniques such as 'pulse spray' were developed. Forced infusion techniques use special catheters with multiple side holes to inject the fibrinolytic agent at high pressure with the intention that the drug penetrates deep into the thrombus. Relatively few studies have compared these different techniques and there is still much debate concerning the optimal method of drug delivery.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine which is the most effective infusion technique for peripheral arterial thrombolysis. The logistics of the various techniques are discussed. This review does not try to determine the optimal thrombolytic agent since that is the subject of a separate review (<LINK REF="REF-Berridge-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berridge 1998</LINK>). </P>
<P>The specific hypotheses tested are:<BR/>1) There is no overall additional benefit from any of the different techniques available to the majority of patients suitable for peripheral arterial thrombolysis.<BR/>2) Complication rates are higher with the high or rapid dose techniques.</P>

<INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
<P>The clinical heterogeneity and disparate outcome measures used in the reporting of these studies limits their power and their likelihood of achieving a statistically significant result. This is particularly true for vessel patency and time to achieve thrombolysis which were interpreted in different ways in each study. Likewise, both angiographic and clinical success were often based on subjective and arbitrary criteria which cannot be precisely measured. These factors make direct comparison difficult. </P>
<P>In these circumstances, the most meaningful method of assessment is to compare the most clinically relevant outcome measures, i.e. limb salvage, amputation, death, and major and minor complications. The limb salvage and amputation figures are not readily interpreted due to inclusion of patients without limb threatening ischaemia. Major bleeding defined as a fall in haemoglobin of more than 4 g/dl or requiring transfusion or surgery is perhaps the best defined of the outcomes.</P>

<B>Intravenous rt-PA versus intra-arterial rt-PA</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>)<BR/>Sixty patients with acute thrombotic arterial insufficiency were recruited to three different thrombolytic regimes. All the occlusions were in native arteries. The comparison between intravenous (i.v.) and intra-arterial (i.a.) rt-PA is relevant to this review. Intravenous rt-PA was infused at four different rates of 1, 2, 5 or 10 mg/h, i.a. rt-PA was infused via a catheter embedded in the distal thrombus at a rate of 0.5 mg/h. The catheter was repositioned periodically during treatment. </P>

<B>Low dose infusion versus high dose bolus and high dose infusion with rt-PA </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK>)<BR/>One hundred patients with acute limb ischaemia of less than 30 days duration were recruited. Nineteen (19%) of the patients were claudicants, the remainder (81%) had critical limb ischaemia (CLI). Thirty-nine (42%) patients had occlusion of a bypass graft. Seven were excluded due to: duration of ischaemia (1), patent graft hence no lysis (1), moribund patient (1), breach of infusion protocol (4). Complete lysis was achieved in 22 (45%) and 21 (48%) patients in the high and low dose groups respectively. The median duration of infusion was 4 (range 1 to 46) hours for the high dose group and 20 (range 2 to 46) hours for the low dose group (P &lt; 0.0001).</P>
<P>Limb salvage: The 30 day limb salvage rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (high dose 80%; low dose 84%). </P>
<P>Amputation: The 30 day amputation rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (high dose 6 (12%); low dose 2 (5%), (P = 0.19).</P>
<P>Death: The 30 day mortality rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (high dose 8%; low dose 9%).</P>

<B>Low dose bolus and low dose infusion versus high dose bolus and high dose infusion with urokinase </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>)<BR/>Seventy-two episodes of thrombolysis were performed in 63 patients (nine patients had two separate admissions). Thirty-four patients (47%) had native arterial occlusion and 38 (53%) graft thrombosis. Twenty-four (71%) of the native arterial occlusions and 37 (97%) of the grafts were treated within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. Angiographic outcome was graded as none (less than 10% clot lysis), partial (10 to 90% clot lysis) and complete (antegrade flow with less than 10% residual thrombus). Clinical and haemodynamic measures were clinical ischaemia grade and ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI). Thrombolysis was deemed to be clinically successful if: a) in patients with acute ischaemia the patient returned to the pre-ischaemic condition; or b) in chronic ischaemia "it aided the performance of a subsequent revascularization procedure". The time to restore antegrade flow or to achieve "complete lysis" in the high dose group was not significantly different to the low dose group. All groups had similar increases in ABPI following lysis and there was no significant difference in "clinical success". </P>
<P>Limb salvage: Could not be calculated from the results due to the heterogeneous study population. As the groups were well matched for ischaemia category and "success rates" were not significantly different, it can be inferred that the limb salvage rates were broadly similar.</P>
<P>Amputation: Five (6.9%) patients had major amputation; the majority of these appear to have come from the high dose group (only one could have been on the low dose regime).<BR/> <BR/>Death: A single death occurred, but it is not clear in which group.</P>
<P>Major bleeding complications were more frequent in the high dose group: two patients had a fall in haemoglobin of more than 4 g/dl, one haematoma (localised collection of blood usually due to bleeding at a site where an artery has been punctured to place a catheter for diagnosis and treatment)<B> </B>required evacuation and one patient required transfusion for puncture site bleeding. In the low dose group a single patient had a drop in haemoglobin of more than 4 g/dl.</P>
<P>Minor bleeding complications: 68% occurred in the high dose group. Haematoma and puncture site bleeding were much more frequent in the high dose group than the low dose group (20% versus 2.7% respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). </P>

<LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK>)<BR/>Seventy patients with less than 42 days ischaemia were recruited. Approximately 80% of patients had native arterial occlusion with two thirds due to thrombosis and one third due to embolism. Treatment groups were intra-arterial urokinase alone (control) or in combination with abciximab (treatment), a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Randomisation was performed on a 5:2 (treatment:control) ratio. Both groups had initial pulse spray (PS) lacing of the thrombus with 25,000 units of urokinase per 10 cm occlusion and subsequent infusion of 4000 units/minute (80 ml/h) for two hours then 2000 units/minute for two hours. The study group received the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist abciximab as an intravenous bolus and infusion. The control group received intravenous saline solution. Thrombus aspiration and angioplasty were used if there was no recanalization at four hours. Outcomes were vessel patency ("brisk flow with less than 30% stenosis") and time to restore flow. The median duration of thrombolysis was 120 minutes in each group.</P>
<P>Limb salvage: amputation-free survival was significantly higher at 90 days in the group receiving abciximab than in the group receiving urokinase alone. However, at the time of treatment, 40% of patients in the study group had non limb threatening ischaemia compared to only 15% in the control group. </P>

<P>
<B>Forced infusion (pulse spray) bolus followed by continuous infusion versus forced infusion with urokinase </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK>)<BR/>Twenty-five patients with less than 30 days ischaemia were recruited. Treatment groups were forced infusion (pulse spray, PS) and continuous infusion (CI). Both groups had initial pulse spray (PS) lacing of the thrombus with 25,000 units of urokinase per 10 cm occlusion delivered as 5 x 0.2 ml aliquots of 25,000 units/ml solution. Subsequently, CI patients had infusion of 4000 units/minute (80 ml/h) for two hours then 2000 units/minute for two hours. Pulse spray patients had equivalent doses of urokinase in pulses of 0.2 ml every 30 seconds for two hours then every minute for two hours. Outcomes at four hours were recorded, if further therapy was required urokinase was infused at 1000 units/min (20 ml/h) as required. Outcomes were "recanalization", i.e. a lumen of at least the diameter of a guidewire, with or without good flow; "patency", i.e. 95% or greater clearance with brisk flow; and "complete", i.e. no residual thrombus. There were no significant differences in times to recanalization, patency within four hours, or complete lysis between the two groups. There were no significant differences in complication rates: distal embolization occurred in five patients in each group. Two patients in the "continuous infusion" group developed significant muscle swelling (compartment syndrome) requiring fasciotomy (surgical division of the overlying soft tissues of the calf to relieve pressure and improve perfusion of the swollen muscle). "Positive clinical outcome", i.e. improvement or resolution of ischaemic symptoms was similar in each group (7 (59%) in PS group; 9 (69%) in CI group).</P>
<P>Limb salvage: there was no significant difference between the two groups. Limb salvage occurred in 11/13 (85%) patients in the CI group and 10/12 (83%) in the PS group.</P>
<P>Amputation: there was no significant difference between the two groups. There were two amputations in the CI group, but none in the PS group (P = 0.2).</P>
<P>Death: there was no significant difference between the two groups. There were two deaths in the PS group, and none in the CI group (P = 0.2)</P>
<P>Major bleeding complications: there were no significant differences between the two groups. Three patients in the PS group, and one in the CI group (P = 0.27) suffered major bleeding complications.</P>
<P>Minor bleeding complications: there were no significant differences as two patients in each group had groin haematomas.</P>

<B>Conventional infusion versus forced infusion (pulse spray) with rt-PA</B> (<LINK REF="STD-Yusuf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yusuf 1995</LINK>)<BR/>Eighteen patients with less than 42 days ischaemia were recruited. Five (28%) had viable limbs and 13 (72%) had threatened limb viability. Conventional low dose infusion was performed with the catheter tip embedded in the distal end of the occlusion. rt-PA was infused in a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml at a rate of 10 ml/h. Angiography was performed at intervals of three to eight hours to check on progress. After each angiogram the catheter was repositioned to ensure it remained within the thrombus. Pulse spray was performed with rt-PA at a concentration of 0.33 mg/ml delivered in aliquots (small doses) of 0.2 ml (0.066 mg) every 15 seconds for 15 minutes and every 30 seconds subsequently, equivalent to 10 mg/hour. Clinical observations were taken every 15 minutes and angiography was performed at intervals of 30 to 120 minutes. </P>
<P>Criteria for clinical success included: radiological evidence of lysis with arterial recanalization at least as far as the next major arterial collateral branch; increase in ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) of more than 0.2 indicating haemodynamic improvement; limb salvage at 30 days without surgery at the level at which lysis was performed; no clinical evidence of re-thrombosis at 30 days. Median duration of therapy was significantly less with pulse spray, 195 minutes (range 90 to 1260 minutes), compared to conventional infusion, 1350 minutes (range 240 to 2400 minutes), P &lt; 0.002. Median ABPI increased significantly following thrombolysis, from zero to 0.5 (P &lt; 0.02) in the conventional group, and zero to 0.9 (P &lt; 0.0001) in the pulse spray group. Patients with an ABPI of 0.9 would be expected to be free of ischaemic symptoms whilst those with an ABPI of 0.5 would probably have intermittent claudication. "Success" rates were not significantly different, 88.8% in the pulse spray group and 55.5% in the conventional infusion group (P &lt; 0.9). </P>
<P>Limb salvage could not be calculated from the data provided.</P>
<P>Amputation: there was no significant difference between the groups. Two major amputations were performed in the conventional therapy group, none in the pulse spray group.</P>
<P>Death: there was no significant difference between the groups. A single death occurred in the conventional therapy group.</P>

</INTERVENTION_EFFECTS>
</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Six randomised studies detailing different techniques of thrombolysis were included in this review. The power of the individual studies to deliver clinically relevant results was limited. The study populations were small and heterogeneous; each study used different inclusion criteria in terms of the degree and duration of ischaemia. The outcome measures also differed considerably between trials. Different agents were used: the studies from the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yusuf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yusuf 1995</LINK>) used rt-PA whilst those from the USA and Germany (<LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK>) used urokinase. For many years, urokinase was the agent of choice in the USA. However, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew urokinase in 1998 due to theoretical fears of viral disease transmission. For a period, rt-PA or newer drugs were used in the USA. Urokinase is now available again in the USA.</P>
<P>The combination of these factors made the studies unsuitable for meaningful statistical comparison. For this reason the discussion considers, initially, the most clinically relevant outcome measures of treatments for patients with peripheral arterial ischaemia (limb salvage, amputation, major complications and death). Subsequently, other "surrogate" outcome measures are considered.</P>
<P>
<B>Key outcome measures</B>
<BR/>
<B>
<I>Limb salvage</I>
</B>
<BR/>Limb salvage can only truly be identified in the studies from <LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK>. The analysis by <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK> included limb salvage rates but their validity is questionable as the study included so many patients with intermittent claudication, which is not a limb-threatening condition. Limb salvage rates were equivalent at about 80% for each treatment regime, except for intravenous "systemic therapy" in which the limb salvage rate was only 45%. In addition, <LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK> showed a significant increase in ankle brachial pressure index in patients treated with i.a. rt-PA compared to i.v. rt-PA (0.57 versus 0.18, P &lt; 0.001). This is in keeping with the fact that five (20%) patients in the systemic therapy group had ongoing critical ischaemia at 30 days. This clearly indicates that local intra-arterial drug delivery is more effective than systemic intravenous therapy. The actual method of local delivery (pulse spray, infusion, dose rate) does not affect the rate of limb salvage.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Amputation</I>
</B>
<B> </B>
<BR/>Amputation rates varied considerably between the studies (0 to 16%). However, none of the studies showed a significant effect on amputation rate related to the technique of drug delivery. Once again it is noteworthy that amputation should only be required in patients with critically ischaemic limbs and the inclusion of patients with intermittent claudication makes interpretation of some of the results unclear.</P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Major complications</I>
</B>
<BR/>These included cerebrovascular accident and major bleeding, defined as a fall in haemoglobin of more than 4 g/dl, requiring transfusion or surgery. Only intravenous therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>) resulted in a significant increase in major complications. The studies of <LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK> each had more incidents of major bleeding in the "accelerated regimes" compared to the conventional treatment groups, but these changes were not statistically significant. Minor bleeding complications were significantly more frequent in systemic (i.v.) therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>) and in high dose therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>). </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Death</I>
</B>
<BR/>Death rates varied considerably between the studies (0 to 16%). However, none of the studies showed a significant effect related to the technique of drug delivery. It would be worrying if any patients with intermittent claudication were to die as a result of therapy, but unfortunately these patients could not be extracted from the data set. </P>
<P>
<B>
<I>Surrogate endpoints</I>
</B>
<BR/>Surrogate endpoints were used in the analysis of several of the trials. Although initially they seem to be important, they do not appear to affect the key clinical endpoints of limb salvage, amputation, complications and death. Such parameters have included:<BR/> <BR/>(1) Angiographic outcome<BR/>Several of the studies included the degree of thrombolysis and volume of thrombus cleared. These features are difficult to quantify objectively and can only be calculated retrospectively. <LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Yusuf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yusuf 1995</LINK> both included "radiological evidence of lysis with arterial recanalization at least as far as the next major arterial branch". Whilst this is an objective measure, it ignores the level of the occlusion and does not indicate whether direct in-line runoff (continuous arterial flow to the foot) was restored. Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK>) tried to quantify the proportion of thrombus cleared. Only <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK> appears to have tried to calculate this from the angiogram. Broadly speaking the authors agreed on the following categories: none, partial and complete clearance. Only removal of thrombus with restoration of brisk forward arterial flow is clinically useful. In <LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>, intra-arterial infusion was associated with a significant increase in partial and complete radiological success (100% versus 45%) with intravenous infusion (P &lt; 0.01). <LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK> showed a non significant increase in the median number of arterial segments cleared with low dose infusion (three segments) compared to high dose (two segments). <LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK> failed to show any difference in clearance with the different thrombolytic regimes. </P>
<P>(2) Duration of thrombolysis<BR/>Intuitively it would seem that the more rapid the restoration of flow the better, but once again this has not been shown to affect the key outcome measures of limb salvage, amputation and death. Duration of thrombolysis varied considerably in the different studies. This might well reflect the fact that study endpoints were inconsistent. <LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK> continued thrombolysis until all thrombus had been cleared, whilst others stopped when little thrombus remained or when antegrade flow had been restored. In the PROMPT study (<LINK REF="STD-Duda-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Duda 2001</LINK>) thrombus aspiration and angioplasty were performed if there was no clearing after four hours, the median duration of treatment was 120 minutes in each group. The trend in the studies was for thrombolysis to be more rapid with the high dose and pulse spray regimes. Braithwaite (<LINK REF="STD-Braithwaite-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Braithwaite 1997</LINK>) showed a significant reduction in the median duration of infusion with the high dose regime (median four hours, range 0.24 to 24 hours) compared to a median of 20 hours (range 2 to 46 hours) in the low dose group (P &lt; 0.0001). Similar low dose rt-PA regimes at the same centre yielded different results: median 40 hours, range 14 to 64 (<LINK REF="STD-Berridge-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Berridge 1991</LINK>); median 22.5 hours, range 5 to 40 (<LINK REF="STD-Yusuf-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Yusuf 1995</LINK>). This contrasted with a median duration of lytic therapy 3.25 hours (range 1.5 to 21) in Yusuf's forced infusion group. Kandarpa (<LINK REF="STD-Kandarpa-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Kandarpa 1993</LINK>) failed to show any difference in the mean time to recanalization (40 minutes continuous infusion, 42 minutes forced infusion), mean time to patency (92 versus 95 minutes respectively) and total duration of thrombolysis (28  26 versus 20  14 hours respectively) with continuous infusion and pulse spray regimes. Some of the difference between the results of Kandarpa and Yusuf may be explained by the preliminary use of forced infusion in both the control and treatment groups in Kandarpa's study. </P>
<P>The two excluded studies<B> </B>(<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2003</LINK>) highlight the limitations of small studies to give clear conclusions, in spite of the fact that the techniques used were identical. In the first study (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2000</LINK>) the use of abciximab significantly reduced the duration of thrombolysis to a median of 75 minutes compared to 110 minutes in the control group. In the second study (<LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2003</LINK>) comparing the use of abciximab and an alternative platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist tirofiban, the median duration of thrombolysis was 149 and 139 minutes respectively. It would appear that thrombolysis was not as rapid in <LINK REF="STD-Schweizer-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schweizer 2003</LINK> regardless of the regime chosen.</P>
<P>Cragg (<LINK REF="STD-Cragg-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Cragg 1991</LINK>) used another non-specific endpoint of treatment, namely "it aided the performance of a subsequent revascularization procedure". This is also subjective and cannot be compared with absolute outcomes such as amputation and mortality. </P>

<UL>
<LI>The evidence indicates that intravenous systemic lysis should not be used for the treatment of peripheral arterial ischaemia, due to poor clinical outcome and a high incidence of bleeding complications. </LI>
<LI>High dose and forced infusion regimes reduce the duration of thrombolysis. These protocols are generally more labour intensive and seem to be associated with increased bleeding complications compared to low dose regimes. </LI>
<LI>The use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists remains unproven in peripheral vascular thrombolysis.</LI>
<LI>The power of the studies is insufficient to show that any thrombolytic regime has a genuine benefit in terms of clinical outcome. </LI>
