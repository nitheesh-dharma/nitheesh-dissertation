I am very pleased with the result, especially as this is ground-breaking in moving forward the correct analysis of cross-over results. I have had some useful statistical input from Stephen Senn, and I will now send this version to Toby for peer review. I have re-run spell check.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;============================================================&lt;br&gt;JW 18.04.05 Blair 1984 agree the variablility looks much more like SE so calculated SD for placebo group and OS group (combined OS 2 groups same dose different frequency but authors state results were comparable for lung function). Entered into analyses.&lt;br&gt;Rechecked Mitchell 86 and Mitchell 84. Entered ORs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JW 13/04/05 I recalculated the binary outcomes in crossover trials using Curtins method. &lt;br&gt;this has altered the ORs slightly in some outcomes, but not in direction. Recalculated NNT and inserted new additional figure. Added information to statistics section re Curtin. &lt;br&gt;Made clearer distinction between short and long term results. Commented on heterogeneity in QOL results. spell checked.&lt;br&gt;No response from Weiner.&lt;br&gt;So this represents up to date review for the next stage. Sending cross over results fro checking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC editing 10 mar 2005&lt;br&gt;Thanks for amending this. It the Weiner triallists get back to you their data could be used later in relation to the thorny issue of reversibility, but you may wish to only include the non-reversibles for the main outcomes of the review when the time comes as this fits better with the other studies that used reversibility as an exclusion criterion for patients?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could I clarify a point of methodology for dichotomous data in cross-over studies. The marginal OR needs responders and non responders for each treatment group (not all lumped together). Were you able to get this data or did you just use OR as if the trials were parallel and then GIV to pool the studies (the data entered for Weir would seem to suggest the latter). I will enclose a note about this from Julian Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have slightly altered the NNT calculated from the baseline risk using Visual Rx and put in a figure to demonstrate the NNT(B).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you soon in Perth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;========================================================&lt;br&gt;Editing by CJC 1 mar 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors' Contribution: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;References: /fine / Vestbo authors and title pasted into correct fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Table of included studies: fine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metaview Labels: look fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synopsis: mild removed from the diabetes risk. Reads well but how far can the results be justified from the findings in the review?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abstract: What baseline risk did you use to calculate the NNT from the OR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Julia Walters] The baseline risk from analysis by MH method for 10 studies is 0.133 or for 9 (without Weir 1990) is 0.14;  RD 0.13 (0.05 to 0.21). NNT= 8(5-20) Weir based response on FEV1 or FVC or PEF (unable to isolate FEV1 only). I also discovered an error in one trial entry (Syed) for this outcome so the OR is corrected to 2.68 95% CI 1.74 to 4.11 from all studies pooled, omitting Weir 1990 changed the OR slightly, 2.36; 95% CI 1.50 to 3.72. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How did you test between the eosinophil subgroups? [Julia Walters]  The paper reports using linnear regression to analyse the trend between tertlies in the change in FEV1 and gives p value. I did not repeat this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was the whole confidence interval less than the minimal clinically important level for QOL or just the point estimate? [Julia Walters]  For overall score mastery and emotional function score the whole confidence interval was less than the MICD  fatigue and dyspnoea scores did overlap though dyspnoea was not significant &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;BAckground: see red text for 10% increase in numbers with 20% rise in FEV1 (could you clarify if this is an absolute risk difference or a risk ratio of 1.1?). [Julia Walters] Callaghan 1991 uses the absolute risk difference .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods:  Could Liz check the search strategy and add date of last search please. I have moved the results of the Kappa tests down to quality of included studies section. Could you put links in for the studies graded 5,4 etc in this section as it would help the readers to see easily which were the higher quality studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cross-over studies it is important that the paired t statistics are used, is this what you did? ?[Julia Walters]  Cross over studies report using paired T tests but not all reported the mean difference. Some were taken by entering as continuous outcome in MH analysis and using MD in GIV analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read the subgroup section of the methods as meaning that the eosinophil and bronchodilator reversibility subgroups are both post-hoc?  [Julia Walters] Yes correct.&lt;br&gt;Thank you for reporting separately the pre-planned subgroups and those used in the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Heterogeneity well discussed in the primary FEV1 outcome but I am not clear how the non-significant trial findings reported in the text (in red)  become a highly significant GIV entry into RevMan for Weiner. I have looked at the Weiner paper and I am very perplexed. How exactly did you derive the results that are entered from this study? I cannot see any paired t-test results and the data entered for the two sub-groups in  2#2 do not total to the same as the overall entry for the study in outcome 1. Moreover the SEM results stated in the paper indicate lower SD for the responders which is intuitively unlikely to me? Did you contact the authors for paired data? I think as it stands the confidence intervals for this study are wrong in this outcome. Moreover there is not a significant difference in outcomes in 2#2, so this should not be reported in the abstract as a difference. The data in 2#2 look more correct than those in 1#1 and 1#2 for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am quite worried that Table 2 looks odd in view of the similarity between the SEM from the two groups of very different sizes!!! Can you cross check this with the authors ASAP to see if paired test results are available?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Julia Walters] Weiner- I wrote to authors in September 2004 requesting clarification of table 2 whether it gave SEM or SDs. Data said to be analysed by anova repeated measures. No reply recieved at all. I did not then specifically ask for paired t test data but have written again today asking for it. Do not hold out much hope so meanwhile have re done FEV1 anayses without it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;HRQ reports on eosinophil subgroups need reporting for betwen group differences not individual subgroup p values. See Altman DG, Bland JM. Statistics Notes: Interaction revisited: the difference between two estimates. BMJ 2003;326(7382):219 [Julia Walters]  have changed text- does this reflect correct interpretation?. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussion: I have reported the result of formal subgroup testing for eosinophilia subgroups (obtained from 1#2 by turning on the totals and leaving out the Weiner trial results).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contentious issues: /see above re Weiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spellchecked: not yet. JW done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next action: Back to authors for clarification. If this cannot be sorted I think you either need to leave Weiner out  completely? ?[Julia Walters]  I agree for now &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;==========================================================&lt;br&gt;Original protocol author&lt;br&gt;Dr Matthew Stanbrook &lt;br&gt;Fellow Divison of Respirology, Department of Medicine&lt;br&gt;University of Toronto&lt;br&gt;Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) &lt;br&gt;G139, 2075 Bayview Ave. &lt;br&gt;Toronto &lt;br&gt;M4N 3M5 &lt;br&gt;Ontario &lt;br&gt;CANADA &lt;br&gt;tel: 1 416 480-6100 &lt;br&gt;m.stanbrook@utoronto.ca&lt;br&gt;fax: 1 416 480-6048 &lt;br&gt;External suport -Medical Research Council of Canada CANADA &lt;br&gt;internal support-University of Toronto CANADA &lt;br&gt;Old title: CARS Systemic Corticosteroids for stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added UoT as internal support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggest adding some information on washout periods for crossover studies in the description section OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was the symptom score scale the same for both studies, if not SMD should be used&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably me being thick, but it is not immediately clear to me what the difference between outocmes 27 and 28 is?

<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, progressive lung disorder with mainly non-reversible limitation of airflow. Corticosteroids improve airflow limitation in asthma and have been tried in COPD. This review found treatment with oral steroids improved lung function and symptoms more than placebo, but not all people benefited equally. Long-term use did not slow the decline in lung function and there was an increased risk of side-effects such as diabetes and osteoporosis.</P>
</SUMMARY_BODY>
</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT MODIFIED="2008-08-15 11:28:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disorder, usually related to cigarette smoking, representing a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality. It is defined "as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases". The use of corticosteroids for their anti-inflammatory effects has been suggested. </P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids on the health status of patients with stable COPD.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Searches of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and MEDLINE were carried out in December 2003 and 2004. Review articles and bibliographies were searched. </P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>Randomised controlled prospective studies in adults with stable COPD ( post-bronchodilator FEV1 &lt;80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC &lt;70%) and a history of smoking, excluding known asthmatics, in which oral steroid use was compared with placebo and use of co-interventions was matched in both groups.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2008-08-15 11:28:20 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Data was extracted independently by two reviewers. All trials were combined using Review Manager.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>From 459 titles 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Treatment lasted three weeks or less in 19 studies, high dose oral steroid was used in 21 studies and subjects had moderate or severe COPD in 15 studies. There was a significant difference in FEV1 after two weeks treatment, WMD 53.30 ml; 95% confidence interval 22.21 to 84.39 favouring oral steroid use compared to placebo when 14 studies with available data (n=396) were combined, with no significant heterogeneity. There was a significant increase in odds for individual patient FEV1 response greater than 20% from baseline with high dose oral steroid treatment compared to placebo, OR 2.71; 95% CI 1.84 to 4.01 (9 studies) . It would be necessary to treat 7 patients (95% CI 5 to 12) with oral corticosteroids to achieve one extra case of increasing FEV1 by more than 20%, with a placebo group risk of 0.13. All differences in health-related quality of life were less than the minimum clinically important difference.</P>
<P>There were small statistically significant advantages for functional capacity and respiratory symptom of wheeze with oral steroid treatment but no significant difference in risk of withdrawal from study due to an exacerbation or rate of serious exacerbations over 2 years with low dose oral steroid treatment. There was an increased risk of adverse effects, including increased blood glucose, adrenal suppression and reduced serum osteocalcin.<BR/>
</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>There is no evidence to support the long-term use of oral steroids at doses less than 10-15 mg prednisolone though some evidence that higher doses (&#8805; 30 mg prednisolone) improve lung function over a short period. Potentially harmful adverse effects e.g.. diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis would prevent recommending long-term use at these high doses in most patients.</P>
</ABS_CONCLUSIONS>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-08-15 11:28:36 +0200" MODIFIED_BY="Toby J Lasserson">
<P>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic lung disorder, usually caused by cigarette smoking, representing a major and increasing cause of morbidity and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-NHLBI-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHLBI 1998</LINK>). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COPD is currently the seventh leading cause of death and disability worldwide, but will rise to the fifth position by 2020 (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1997</LINK>). The estimated prevalence of COPD worldwide in 2001 was 1013 per 100,000 population; it was highest in the Western Pacific Region and lowest in Africa.</P>
<P>The diagnosis and management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has been hindered over many years by lack of agreement on definition and classification. The definition of COPD has varied historically but generally included the presence of airflow obstruction, which was described as mostly irreversible and was progressive. (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-BTS-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">BTS 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Siafakas-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Siafakas 1995</LINK>). These definitions attempted to link the clinical syndrome of chronic bronchitis, i.e. cough and sputum production on most days for three consecutive months in each of two consecutive years with the pathological processes leading to pulmonary emphysema (destruction of the lung parenchyma with widening and loss of the terminal air spaces). In the late 1990s the need to raise awareness of COPD and decrease morbidity and mortality from the disease led to the establishment of an international initiative between the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to form the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). GOLD defines COPD "as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases" (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2001</LINK>). This definition includes a recognition that COPD is characterised by chronic airway inflammation. It was based on well documented pathologic changes found in central airways (trachea, bronchi and bronchioles &gt;2 mm diameter) of inflammatory cell infiltrates (<LINK REF="REF-Saetta-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saetta 1993</LINK>) , in peripheral airways (small bronchi and bronchioles with a diameter &lt; 2 mm ) of injury and repair cycles (<LINK REF="REF-Saetta-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Saetta 1998</LINK>) and enlargement of mucus-secreting glands (<LINK REF="REF-Mullen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mullen 1985</LINK>). Macrophages, T lymphocytes (predominantly CD8+ suppressor/killer cells) and neutrophils were found to be increased in various parts of the airways and lung.</P>
<P>Inflammation as the basis for the pathogenesis of COPD is now incorporated into clinical guidelines for the management of COPD (GOLD, COPDX, NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-McKenzie-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">McKenzie 2003</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2004</LINK>). Corticosteroids have historically been used empirically in patients with COPD. However, in a 1978 a review of studies apparently showing a positive effect of systemic therapy in COPD, included only one non-blinded controlled trial (<LINK REF="REF-Sahn-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sahn 1978</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Hudson-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hudson 1990</LINK> suggested that one rationale for corticosteroid use in COPD was their anti-inflammatory action. In 1991 a review and meta-analysis including ten studies of oral corticosteroid therapy for patients with stable COPD concluded that patients receiving oral steroids had a 20% or greater improvement in baseline FEV1 in 10% more cases that those on placebo (reported as an absolute increase), (<LINK REF="REF-Callahan-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Callahan 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The natural history of COPD has been classically portrayed as one of chronic progressive decline in lung function with time (<LINK REF="REF-Fletcher-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fletcher 1977</LINK>) with the decrease being accelerated in continuing smokers. It has been shown that smoking cessation slows progression of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Anthonisen-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anthonisen 1994</LINK>) but there is evidence that the structural and inflammatory changes initiated by smoking persist even after smoking cessation has been achieved (<LINK REF="REF-Sutherland-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sutherland 2003</LINK>). The clinical course is punctuated by acute respiratory exacerbations, often triggered by upper respiratory tract infections (<LINK REF="REF-ATS-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATS 1995</LINK>), which further decrease lung function.</P>
<P>A recent Cochrane Review has concluded that systemic steroids are of benefit in acute exacerbations of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Wood_x002d_Baker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wood-Baker 2003</LINK>). Four randomised studies of inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD are inconclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Burge-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burge 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-LungHealth-Stdy-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">LungHealth Stdy 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pauwels-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pauwels 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vestbo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vestbo 1999</LINK>) and a protocol for a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of their use in stable COPD is currently on the Cochrane Library (<LINK REF="REF-Yang-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yang 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>In developed countries with adequate availability of health care, more costly inhaled corticosteroids have replaced the use of readily available and easy to administer oral corticosteroids for long-term use in respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. However, the rise in morbidity and mortality from COPD will be most dramatic in Asian and African countries over the next two decades, mostly due to progressive increase in the prevalence of smoking (<LINK REF="REF-Chan_x002d_Yeung-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan-Yeung 2004</LINK>). As these regions include many poor developing countries, if the use of oral steroids in COPD can be justified, they may be able to make considerable financial savings.</P>
<P>However, there are well known adverse effects to the use of systemic corticosteroids. These include increased risk of infections, glucose intolerance, hypertension, osteoporosis, adrenal suppression and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.<BR/>This review examines whether oral corticosteroids have any benefit in stable COPD and what long term adverse consequences their use may have.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES>
<P>The objectives of this review are to determine whether systemic oral corticosteroids improve the health status of patients with stable COPD in terms of lung function, quality of life, functional capacity, rate of exacerbations requiring treatment and to examine the negative effects of treatment. </P>

<P>Data from crossover studies was extracted according to published results. If the data from the first period was available separately this was used as a parallel group comparison. Where this was not available, the effect estimate for continuous variables calculated using methods for paired data were sought . For dichotomous variables, the marginal method of Becker-Balgatas was used to calculate the crossover OR and variance (<LINK REF="REF-Curtin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Curtin 2002</LINK>). For analyses involving crossover studies the effect estimates were pooled using the generic inverse variance method in which the weight for each study is taken to be the inverse variance of the effect estimate (<LINK REF="REF-Deeks-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Deeks 2004</LINK>). In order to allow dichotomous and continuous data to be pooled together for outcomes not presented in the same manner the method of <LINK REF="REF-Chinn-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chinn 2000</LINK> was used, a statistical approach which re-expresses odds ratios as standardised mean differences (and vice versa) subject to particular distributional assumptions.</P>

For parallel group studies alone, the pooled fixed effect weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. For pooled effects, a Breslow-Day test of heterogeneity was carried out, and a P value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. The <I>I<SUP>2 </SUP>

<P>Results in <LINK REF="STD-Brightling-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Brightling 2000</LINK> were reported by subgroups based on stratification of patients into tertiles by baseline sputum eosinophil count. The lowest eosinophil tertile count at baseline was &lt;1.3%, the middle tertile 1.3-4.5% and highest tertile &gt; 4.5%. The mean difference between oral steroid and placebo increased progressively for FEV1 from the lowest to highest eosinophilic tertile: -5 ml; 95%CI -83.40 to 73.40 for the lowest tertile, 55 ml; 95%CI -23.40 to 33.40 for the middle tertile and 190 ml; 95%CI 60.0 to 230.0 for the highest tertile, which was the only group to demonstrate a statistically significant difference to placebo [ P=0.03]. Formal subgroup testing indicated significant heterogeneity of response between the three tertiles of eosinophilia (Chi<SUP>2</SUP> 6.36, df = 2, P = 0.04). This study excluded any subject with a clinical diagnosis of asthma, a history of acute wheeze, breathlessness or deterioration associated with allergens, or any subjects with significant bronchodilator reversibility after 2.5 mg nebulised salbutamol (&lt;15% FEV1 or if FEV1 &lt;1.2 L, &lt;200 ml improvement) .</P>

All subjects (n=19) in the oral steroid group also used inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide 1600 mcg). When the change in FEV1 with time was compared, the median slope was -60 ml/year; range -570 to 140 on placebo while in the actively treated groups on inhaled corticosteroids or oral steroid plus inhaled corticosteroids the slopes were -30 ml/year; range -180 to 870 and -40 ml/year; range -340 to 60 respectively.

All studies contributing to this outcome had a treatment period of three weeks or less. Using the odds ratio from all studies combined with a baseline risk in the placebo group of 0.13, it would be necessary to treat 7 patients (95% CI 5 to 12) with oral corticosteroids to achieve one extra case of increasing FEV1 by more than twenty percent.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION>
<P>Overall this review found a significant increase in FEV1 on treatment with short term oral corticosteroids at reasonably high dose (&#8805; 30 mg prednisolone) compared to placebo. However, it was not a uniform effect with marked individual variation in response. Sub-group analyses suggested that the variation in response might be related to increased sputum eosinophil counts but this hypothesis requires further investigation. The improvement in FEV1 was mirrored by a significant increase in peak expiratory flow, although this was measured in only three studies. There were few studies of long duration, which limited our ability to reach conclusions about any long-term benefit on lung function, though results from <LINK REF="STD-Renkema-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Renkema 1996</LINK> also indicated marked individual variation in response when FEV1 changes were monitored over two years.<BR/>
<BR/>The improvement in overall quality of life measures was not significant, and any differences in the domains of health-related quality of life were too small to be clinically meaningful, except in the sub-group with the highest level of sputum eosinophilia with formal subgroup testing indicating significant heterogeneity of response between the three tertiles of eosinophilia (Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>6.36, df = 2, P = 0.04). Differences in symptom scores were not significant except for that of wheeze, though there was a trend for all scores in the subgroups to increase with increasing sputum eosinophil counts. </P>
<P>There was a significant effect of oral steroid treatment on functional capacity, with individual variation in response. However, the clinical importance of the differences found in 12 minute walk distance and shuttle walk distance is uncertain and it probably depends on the severity of COPD (<LINK REF="REF-Solway-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Solway 2001</LINK>). No difference in withdrawal due to exacerbations of COPD, frequency or duration of exacerbations was found. </P>
<P>Individual studies found increased risks of adverse effects on blood pressure, blood glucose, plasma cortisol and serum osteocalcin. These changes would be likely to have long term consequences for the development of diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and adrenal suppression if treatment were continued over long periods in a chronic disease such as COPD, especially with the high dose of oral corticosteroids that seems to be needed. </P>
<P>The absence of a washout period in many of the trials with a crossover design is of concern, particularly as the duration of improvement in outcomes detailed above is not clear. Fortunately, from the perspective of meta-analysis, this is likely to minimise rather than exaggerate the difference between active intervention and control.</P>
<P>Most studies used high doses of oral corticosteroids over relatively short periods and there was no evidence to support clinical benefit to the use of lower doses (&lt; 15 mg prednisolone daily) over a long term period. The requirement for high doses of corticosteroids to be administered in order to achieve benefits in lung function, symptoms and exercise capacity means the adverse effects would likely outweigh any general positive benefit for all COPD patients. This may not apply to a subgroup of COPD patients with larger positive effects, providing the risk of adverse events is not also increased. The existence of a subgroup or groups of COPD patients who may benefit significantly more than others from oral corticosteroid has been investigated in other studies not included in thus review. Two non-randomised studies, <LINK REF="STD-Pizzichini-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Pizzichini 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Shim-1978" TYPE="STUDY">Shim 1978</LINK> also found sputum eosinophilia to be a predictor of positive response in FEV1 to treatment with oral corticosteroids. This would need to be tested before treatment recommendations could be based on the level of sputum eosinophils. In addition, it is not clear what occurs to subjects after cessation of corticosteroids. If the benefits are lost over time, there seems little point to a short term intervention in what is a chronic disease. On the other hand, if high doses need to be continued over long periods to maintain any benefit, the cumulative risk of adverse effects, particularly osteoporosis, is likely to increase. In addition, there is evidence from observational studies that people with COPD taking long term oral corticosteroids have a higher mortality than those not using them (<LINK REF="REF-Sin-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schols-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schols 2001</LINK>) although this could be a reflection of disease severity. Even so, this possibility is an additional disincentive to long-term use.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Short-term oral corticosteroid in stable COPD produces statistically significant benefits in lung function, symptoms and exercise capacity, but at the cost of increased adverse events, and at doses which are unlikely to be acceptable in the long-term. The benefit of these short term gains to people living with COPD is unclear.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>Whether there are long term benefits to be gained from the short term use of high dose oral corticosteroids needs to be established for them to become useful in the management of COPD. While this review did not set out to investigate whether responsiveness to oral steroids is a predictor of long term response to other interventions with a lower adverse event profile, such as low dose oral corticosteroid or inhaled corticosteroid, this needs to be established. A clearer definition of "responders", for example in terms of bronchodilator responsiveness or eosinophil sputum counts may allow subsequent studies of long term oral corticosteroids in subjects with a potentially better risk-benefit profile to be performed. Unfortunately, at present the number of studies of oral corticosteroids with data available is very small, although they are widely prescribed COPD, a disease with a high prevalence. Further studies in well defined populations are needed to establish their role, if any, in the long term management of the disease.</P>
