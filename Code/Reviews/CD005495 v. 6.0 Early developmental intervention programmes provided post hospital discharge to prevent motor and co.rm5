<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2015-11-15 14:43:42 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>Review question:</B> In preterm infants, do early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge compared with standard medical follow-up better improve cognitive and motor development at infancy (zero to &lt; three years), preschool age (three to &lt; five years), school age (five to &lt; 18 years) and adulthood (&#8805; 18 years)?</P>
<P>
<B>Background: </B>Preterm infants (babies born before 37 weeks) are at risk for developmental problems, including cognitive and motor delays. Cognitive development refers to thinking and learning abilities, and motor development refers to the ways children move, such as by sitting, crawling and walking. Early developmental interventions aim to reduce cognitive and motor problems; however, the benefits of these programmes are not clear.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics: </B>Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was noted with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up.</P>
<P>
<B>Key findings:</B> Evidence suggests that early developmental interventions improve cognitive outcomes up to preschool age. Evidence also indicates that early developmental interventions improve motor outcomes during infancy; however, these effects are small. Little evidence was found of an effect on long-term cognitive or motor outcomes (up to school age). The early developmental intervention programmes described in this review had to begin within the first 12 months of life, had to focus on the parent-infant relationship and/or infant development and, although they could begin while the baby was still in hospital, had to include a component that was delivered post discharge from hospital. The early developmental intervention programmes included in this review vary by content and by frequency and focus of the intervention.</P>
<P>
<B>Conclusions:</B> This review of 25 trials supports early developmental intervention programmes provided to preterm infants post hospital discharge with the goal of improving cognitive development over the short to medium term (up to preschool age). Variability among these early developmental intervention programmes limits the conclusions that can be drawn about their effectiveness.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2015-11-11 03:41:28 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and EMBASE (1966 to August 2015).</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2015-11-11 03:43:25 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2015-11-11 03:49:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to &lt; three years), preschool age (three to &lt; five years), school age (five to &lt; 18 years) and adulthood (&#8805; 18 years). Meta-analysis using RevMan 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-11-15 14:39:35 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient (DQ): standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.47; P value &lt; 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient (IQ); SMD 0.43 SDs, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.54; P value &lt; 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age (IQ: SMD 0.18 SDs, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale DQ: SMD 0.10 SDs, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2015-11-11 03:58:00 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2015-11-15 14:48:14 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Infants born preterm or at low birth weight (LBW) are at increased risk of developing motor, cognitive and behavioural impairment compared with infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Pedersen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pedersen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spittle-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spittle 2013</LINK>). Despite improving rates of survival for extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants since the 1990s, the rate of disability has remained relatively constant, with up to 50% of these infants later exhibiting developmental disabilities such as motor, cognitive or behavioural impairment (<LINK REF="REF-Bhutta-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bhutta 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Doyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Doyle 2004</LINK>). Five to fifteen per cent of children will have cerebral palsy (CP) (<LINK REF="REF-Tin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vohr-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spittle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spittle 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>These neurosensory impairments are complex and are often subtle, and may affect various aspects of the child's development. At school age, children born preterm experience problems across most educational domains. They tend to have difficulty learning, particularly in applying mathematical concepts (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2003</LINK>). Attentional problems and hyperactivity are commonly reported in children born prematurely (<LINK REF="REF-Horwood-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Horwood 1998</LINK>). These can substantially affect academic achievement and social integration (<LINK REF="REF-Hoy-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoy 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sommerfelt-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sommerfelt 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Botting-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Botting 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Spittle-2009b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spittle 2009b</LINK>). Minor motor impairments, which are similar to those seen in children with developmental co-ordination disorder (<I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition</I> (DSM-IV)), have been found to be more prevalent in very preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Williams-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Williams 2010</LINK>). These motor problems persist into adolescence and can affect school performance and self esteem (<LINK REF="REF-Powls-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Powls 1995</LINK>). In adulthood, very low birth weight (VLBW) infants continue to exhibit higher rates of neurosensory impairment, with lower academic scores and a lower high school graduation rate compared with adults born at normal birth weight (<LINK REF="REF-Hack-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hack 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Learning, behaviour and motor impairment in preterm children can be associated with medical risk factors (e.g. birth weight, gestational age, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)); however, such problems account for only a portion of the variance associated with these long-term outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Vohr-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vohr 2000</LINK>). Non-medical factors such as social class, parental education, parenting style, parental mental health, family structure, family functioning and the home environment are also associated with developmental outcomes of children born preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Laucht-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Laucht 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hogan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hogan 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Treyvaud-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Treyvaud 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>Early developmental interventions have been used in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. As a result of the complex biological, medical and environmental elements that contribute to development, early intervention may encompass many different components, and services may be provided through a variety of disciplines (<LINK REF="REF-Berger-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berger 1998</LINK>). Early intervention for preterm infants may focus on different aspects of early development, depending on targeted outcomes.</P>
<P>Developmental care, an intervention that focuses on the environment and the infant, is designed to minimise stress for the infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (<LINK REF="REF-Als-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Als 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Symington-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symington 2003</LINK>). Several systematic reviews have described variable short-term benefits of developmental care such as reduced oxygen dependency and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes up to 12 months; however, benefits were not sustained at two years (<LINK REF="REF-Jacobs-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jacobs 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Symington-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Symington 2003</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2015-11-15 14:51:48 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Early intervention programmes that focus on development post hospital discharge and into the community setting may have a greater impact on long-term morbidity, as they focus more on family factors and the home environment. Interventions aimed at enhancing the parent-infant relationship focus on sensitising parents to infant cues and on teaching appropriate and timely responses to infant needs. Evidence suggests that early high-quality parent-infant interactions positively influence cognitive and social development in children (<LINK REF="STD-Melnyk-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Melnyk 2001</LINK>). Recent evidence also shows that effects of early intervention on cognitive outcomes for preterm children do not appear to be specific to the type of therapy received, and receipt of any early intervention for preterm infants is associated with improved cognitive function at between one and two years (<LINK REF="REF-McManus-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McManus 2012</LINK>). Several types of interventions such as physiotherapy and infant stimulation programmes focus on infant development. Physiotherapy trials aim to optimise motor development but vary in the theoretical rationale underlying the intervention programme. Some physiotherapy interventions are based on principles of neuro-developmental therapy (NDT), which aims to modify sensory input and/or abnormal movement patterns with the goal of improving motor outcomes through active and/or passive techniques (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Blauw_x002d_Hospers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw-Hospers 2005</LINK>). Systematic reviews of the effects of NDT in children with neurological dysfunction have been inconclusive. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Brown-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 2001</LINK> showed that NDT was beneficial in six out of 15 studies. A review by <LINK REF="REF-Ottenbacher-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ottenbacher 1986</LINK> showed a small treatment effect on motor outcomes compared with the comparison group. Infant stimulation programmes may involve multi-sensory stimulation such as auditory, visual, vestibular and tactile stimulation. Environmental and social factors are well recognised as influencing the development of children, especially those at increased biological risk (<LINK REF="REF-Shonkoff-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Shonkoff 2003</LINK>). Increasing evidence supports implementation of environmental enrichment programmes in which the intervention aims to improve at least one aspect of cognitive or motor outcomes by providing an optimal environment for learning. Early intervention programmes that include enhancement of parent-infant interactions; adaptation of the environment to promote motor, social or cognitive skills; and parent education about supporting skill development comprise strategies that provide an infant with an enriched environment. This approach has been shown to be of benefit for infants with CP, but less is known about these interventions for children born preterm (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2013</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2015-11-15 15:14:52 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For the purposes of this review, an early developmental intervention is considered to be a programme beginning within the first year of life, with or without an inpatient hospital component, for which the aim is to enhance infant development. Interventions have been grouped to focus on the parent-infant relationship, development of the infant or both. Although some interventions may specifically target motor or cognitive development, a strong relationship between these areas has been noted. For example, by influencing motor function, such interventions may improve cognitive outcomes, as they allow infants greater opportunity to interact with their environment (<LINK REF="REF-Thelen-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thelen 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Becker-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Becker 1999</LINK>). Different models of intervention programmes may have different goals such as prevention, remediation or treatment of a specific delay or disability (<LINK REF="REF-Majnemer-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Majnemer 1998</LINK>). When an intervention is begun at an early age for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental problems, the intervention has a preventative focus, with strategies aimed at minimising the effects of prematurity and promoting optimal development. However, during the course of an intervention, if a specific dysfunction becomes apparent or a diagnosis is made, strategies are then focused on preventing further delay and compensating for deficits to promote best function and independence for the child. It is important for the care provider to understand the effectiveness of these intervention programmes in the high-risk preterm infant population.</P>

<P>We evaluated the methodological quality of included trials by using the CNRG methodological scheme, whereby each article was assessed for selection (blinding of randomisation), performance (blinding of intervention), attrition (completeness of follow-up) and detection (blinding of outcome measures). We classified allocation concealment as adequate (A), unclear (B), inadequate (C) or not used (D) as another criterion for assessment of validity.

<P>We assessed risk of bias of included studies by using the following criteria. </P>
<UL>
<LI>Sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<LI>Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias): For each included study, we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as: </LI>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); or</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<LI>Blinding (checking for possible performance bias): For each included study, we categorised methods used to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised methods as:</LI>

<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for participants;</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for personnel; and</LI>
<LI>low risk, high risk or unclear risk for outcome assessors.</LI>

<LI>Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations): For each included study and for each outcome, we described data completeness including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported, numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total number of randomly assigned participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion when reported and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. When sufficient information was reported or supplied by trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses.

<LI>Selective reporting bias: For each included study, we described how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed methods as:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>low risk (when it was clear that all of the study's prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review had been reported); </LI>
<LI>high risk (when not all of the study's prespecified outcomes had been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; or study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or</LI>

<LI>Other sources of bias: For each included study, we described important concerns that we had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether a potential source of bias was related to the specific study design, whether the trial was stopped early because of some data-dependent process).

<P>We used Review Manager 5.1 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2011</LINK>) software to conduct data management and analysis. We used the standard methods of CNRG to synthesise the data. For data analysis, 'intervention group' refers to infants who were involved in early developmental intervention programmes, and 'follow-up group' refers to infants who had received standard medical follow-up. Standard follow-up varied between studies, as different hospitals/institutions used different standard follow-up procedures. For individual trials, when possible, we reported mean values for treatment and control groups (and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for continuous variables. For the meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs), as a variety of outcome measures (with different standard deviations (SDs)) measured the same outcome. For example, cognitive outcomes at infancy can be measured by Bayley MDI (Edition I, II or III). For dichotomous outcomes, we reported risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) (and 95% CIs) for treatment and follow-up groups. We pooled cognitive and motor outcome data into four age groups - infancy (zero to &lt; three years), preschool age (three to &lt; five years), school age (five to &lt; 18 years) and adulthood (&#8805; 18 years). When studies reported data at more than one time point within an age group, we used data from the latest assessment. For example, if a study reported cognitive outcomes at 12 months and 24 months, we used only 24-month data.</P>

<P>The 25 trials that met the inclusion criteria yielded a total of 58 publications, as most studies had published several papers related to cognitive and motor outcomes at different ages. Following is a description of each of these studies.</P>
<P>The 'Avon Premature Infant Program' (APIP) (<LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK>) conducted a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing two interventions versus standard follow-up. All eligible infants (N = 309) born over a two and one-half year period were randomly assigned to one of three groups at seven to 10 days after birth (Portage = 111, Parent Advisor = 99, standard follow-up = 99). Consent to participate in the study was obtained post randomisation to evaluate the acceptability and impact of the intervention in population terms. This resulted in 284 families of infants consenting to participate in the study, among the 309 infants randomly assigned to the three groups (Portage = 97, Parent Advisor = 90, standard follow-up = 97). Families of infants who did not consent to the intervention were invited to participate in outcome assessments, and outcome data at two years (but not at five years) and results were reported on an intention-to-treat basis. Both intervention groups were enrolled in a programme directed by research nurses at home upon discharge from hospital until two years. Visits were weekly for the first two months, were reduced to one or two per month for the next 12 months, then to one per month until two years of corrected age. The frequency of visits was tailored to suit the family. The Portage programme is a home visiting educational service for children with additional support needs and their families. It takes place in the child's own home and aims to equip parents with the skills and confidence that they need to help their child. Portage offers practical help and ideas to encourage a child's interests while making learning fun for the entire family. The primary focus of the Portage group was the developmental progress of the child, although parental support was provided as part of the delivery. A second intervention group was used to control for the parent support given through the Portage group. The parent support group received supportive counselling for parents but no advice on infant development. Details of care for the standard follow-up group were not given. At two years, cognitive development was assessed using the Griffiths GCI, and at five years with the BAS. Motor outcome was assessed at five years with the Movement ABC. A cutoff equivalent to the upper quartile of term reference group scores was used to define motor impairment. Rates of CP were also reported at five years. All outcomes were measured by a blinded assessor. Data from the two intervention groups were combined and compared with those from the standard follow-up group for all analyses, except for the subgroup analysis of 'Focus of intervention'.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Bao-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Bao 1999</LINK> conducted a multi-centre quasi-randomised controlled trial of an intervention package that focused on infant development versus standard follow-up. Parents of infants in the intervention group (n = 52) were taught to carry out the programme, as implemented by a doctor, from term equivalent age to two years of age. The programme aimed to enhance motor, cognitive and speech development, and to improve social behaviour. This programme involved checking development of the infant, then instructing parents on how to carry out a home programme until the next examination. The home programme included exercise and suggestions for toys, books and pictorials appropriate to the child's age. One visit occurred per month for the first year, and one every two months for the second year. Parent education classes were reported to occur "sometimes". Details of care for the standard follow-up group (N = 51) were not given. Cognitive and motor outcomes were measured by a blinded assessor at 18 months and at 24 months using the BSID-II MDI and PDI.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Barrera-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Barrera 1986</LINK> conducted a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing two types of intervention programmes versus standard follow-up. Eighty preterm infants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: parent-infant intervention (N = 22), developmental intervention (N = 16) or standard follow-up (N = 21). Twenty-one infants did not complete the study for a variety of reasons (e.g. death of infant, family moved). The number of infants in each group was reported only for infants who completed the programme. The parent-infant intervention aimed to improve the quality of interaction between parents and child by enhancing parents' observational skills and teaching them to be mutually responsive to their infant. The developmental programme aimed to improve infants' cognition, communication, gross and fine motor development, socio-emotional skills and self help skills. Parents worked with therapists to plan and implement developmental activities. Both interventions were implemented by one of four therapists with training in speech pathology, occupational therapy or early childhood education. Sessions were provided weekly for three to four months, bi-weekly for the next six months, then monthly for three months. The mean number of home visits was 23 (range 12 to 28). The standard follow-up group received home visits for assessment purposes only. During these visits, the examiner answered parents' questions about their child's development and about reading material or community resources. Cognitive and motor outcomes were obtained at four, eight, 12 and 16 months through the BSID-I MDI and PDI. At 4.5 to 5 years, the child's cognitive development was assessed with McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities - GCI. All outcome assessors were blinded to children's group allocation. Data from the two intervention groups were combined and were compared with data from the standard follow-up group for all relevant analyses.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2005</LINK> conducted a single-centre randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of a physiotherapy early intervention programme versus standard follow-up. The intervention group (N = 34) received a physiotherapy programme that aimed to improve motor outcomes by promoting symmetry, muscle balance and movement using postural support and facilitation techniques. The intervention began while the infant was an inpatient, with daily (weekdays) sessions provided from birth to discharge. It was then provided on a needs-oriented basis post discharge up to four months. This included advice on play activities to encourage the infant's development based on infant progress. The standard follow-up group (N = 38) received no physiotherapy and no placebo interventions. Investigators assessed motor development at four months by using the AIMS, and assessors blinded to the child's group allocation reported rates of CP at 18 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Dusing-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Dusing 2015</LINK> performed a small pilot randomised trial to assess the feasibility of completing a trial of the Supporting Play Exploration and Early Development Intervention (SPEEDI). A group of 10 infants born at &lt; 34 weeks' gestational age (GA) were recruited from a single-centre NICU and were randomly assigned. Intervention (SPEEDI) and usual care groups received standard care in the NICU and in the community. The SPEEDI group received the intervention in two phases. Phase 1 commenced in the NICU from 35 weeks' GA to term or hospital discharge, and Phase 2 from the latter point to three months of age. Phase 1 provided infants with daily movement experiences designed to vary positioning and to support interaction and early development. These were supported by a physiotherapist at a frequency of five 20-minute sessions per week. Parents received 10 study visits and two meetings with the therapist during phase 1 to develop goals for the intervention and to demonstrate activities, and parents received a booklet that provided details of the interventions. Phase 2 aimed to assist parents in developing a routine for developmentally appropriate play, and to teach parents about infants' cues and readiness for interaction. Parents were encouraged to complete the intervention for 20 minutes a day, five times a week. The therapist met with each parent and infant every two weeks until three months post discharge. The frequency of therapist intervention and of parent intervention was monitored in a log book for phase 1 and phase 2. Information about other community services received was gathered through a questionnaire. The Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) was performed at baseline (recruitment age), then at zero, three and four months' corrected age (CA). The Bayley III was performed at six months' CA by a blinded assessor for the purpose of assessing motor and cognitive outcomes.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Field-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1980</LINK> carried out a randomised controlled study to assess the effects of combined risks of being born preterm to a teenage mother and to evaluate the effects of an intervention programme. The study comprised 60 preterm infants with teenage mothers who were randomly assigned to intervention (N = 30) or to standard follow-up (N = 30). Teenage mothers were younger than 19 years of age, had an average of 10 years of education and were unmarried but living with a parent. The intervention consisted of home visits made by a two-person team: a trained interventionist and a female student. Aims were to educate the mother regarding developmental milestones and child-rearing practices, to teach the mother age-appropriate stimulation to facilitate cognitive and social interaction and communication skills and to facilitate mother-infant relationships. Some tasks were based on infant assessments. Intervention was targeted to the at-risk mother, even when the infant was cared for by grandparents during the day. Home activities were prescribed, and adherence to the programme monitored. The intervention began post discharge and was provided biweekly for four months, then once a month for the next four months (up to eight months). Details of care for the standard follow-up group were not given. An assessor blinded to group allocation measured cognitive and motor outcomes at eight months using the BSID-I MDI and PDI.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Gianni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni 2006</LINK> performed a pilot randomised controlled trial on the effects of an early post-discharge developmental intervention on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12, 24 and 26 months of age versus standard follow-up. Of the 61 infants initially assessed for eligibility, 25 were excluded from and 36 were included in the analysis at 36 months. The intervention group (N = 18) was seen by a psychologist and by a psychometrician twice a month in the outpatient department for 1.5 hours. The psychologist's intervention involved supporting mental health issues associated with preterm birth, and the psychometrician's intervention targeted the infant and the mother-child interaction. It is reported that mother-child pairs (four to six pairs) attended group meetings from three to 12 months' corrected age. The control group (N = 18) and the intervention group received periodic paediatrician follow-up but no other interventions. The Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale (no reference to the version is given) assessed developmental outcomes at 12 and 24 months' corrected age and at 36 months' chronological age.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1985</LINK> conducted a quasi-randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of early NDT versus standard follow-up. A total of 107 infants were assessed as being 'normal' or 'at risk' on the basis of a neurodevelopmental score and were then alternatively assigned to intervention or control groups. Study authors stated that before beginning the study, their intention was to study 40 infants in the intervention and follow-up groups. To allow for attrition, they enrolled 107 infants into the study at three months. However, the formal study ceased when 40 infants in each category had been followed for 12 months. Therefore, investigators presented data for only 80 of the 107 infants enrolled in the study. The intervention group (N = 40) received monthly outpatient NDT at the hospital as provided by a physiotherapist for 12 months. Duration of treatment was at least 45 minutes, during which time parents were shown exercises for use at home, where they were expected to carry out the programme on a daily basis. Infants in both treatment and standard follow-up groups (N = 40) were seen at the hospital's follow-up clinic, which was staffed by neonatologists, physiotherapists, speech and hearing therapists, ophthalmologists, public health nurses and social workers, at six weeks' and at three, six, nine and 12 months' corrected age. In addition to scheduled visits, infants in either group could attend when clinically indicated. At 12 months and at six years of age, a blinded assessor measured motor and cognitive development by using the Griffiths GCI and Locomotor Subscales.</P>
<P>The 'Infant Health and Development Program' (IHDP) (<LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK>) is the largest multi-centre trial conducted to investigate the effects of early intervention versus standard follow-up. To minimise the cost of the study, investigators randomly assigned one-third of participants to intervention (N = 377) and two-thirds to standard follow-up (N = 608). The intervention programme began post discharge from the neonatal nursery and continued until 36 months' CA. Education professionals provided the intervention. The intervention group received home visits, visited a child development centre and attended parent group meetings. Home visits were provided weekly for the first year and biweekly for the second and third years. These visits emphasised cognitive, linguistic and social development via a programme of games to be used by the parent with the child and aimed at helping parents manage self identified problems. Children in the intervention group attended child development centres five days per week from 12 to 36 months' corrected age. Teachers at the centre continued with the above curriculum, while taking into account the child's needs and developmental levels. Parent group meetings held bi-monthly from 12 months provided information on child rearing, health and safety and other parental concerns. The standard follow-up group underwent medical, developmental and social assessments, with referral to other services as indicated. Compliance with the programme was variable. The mean number of home visits in the first year was 34.0 (SD 10.2, range 0 to 51); second year 17.4 (SD 7.2, range 0 to 29) and third year 15.4 (SD 7.4, range 0 to 26). Mean number of visits to child centres for the second year was 132.5 (SD 76.2, range 0 to 235) and for the third year 134.9 (SD 78.5, range 0 to 241). The mean number of attendances at parent meetings in the second year was 2.1 (SD 1.9, range 0 to 7) and in the third year 1.6 (SD 1.7, range 0 to 6). Cognitive outcome was measured at 12 and 24 months with the BSID-I MDI, at three years with the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, at five years with the WPPSI, at eight years with the WISC-III and at 18 years with the WASI and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test Edition III (PPVT-III). Motor outcome was assessed at 12 and 24 months with the BSID-I PDI. Not all data were published, and we requested missing data from study authors. All outcome assessors were blinded to children's group allocation.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK> carried out a cluster-randomised controlled trial with a cross-over design that included six neonatal units across the UK and commenced the intervention from the first weeks after birth. The intervention programme consisted of weekly one-hour sessions, beginning in hospital and continuing up to a maximum of six sessions post discharge. The intervention programme (N = 112), which was called the 'Parent Baby Interaction Program', included strategies to enhance parent-infant interaction and facilitate attachment, while sensitising parents to their baby's cues and providing education about developmental care. The intervention was targeted at the mother and was delivered by a research nurse who was trained in the intervention. Of 112 infants recruited to the treatment group, 108 attended at least one intervention session, for a median of eight sessions (interquartile range (IQR) five to 11). Most sessions occurred in hospital, and a median of two sessions were provided post discharge (IQR two to seven). Families in the control group received standard care (N = 121); however, details of this care were not provided. Assessors blinded to group allocation assessed development at two years using the BSID-II.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kaaresen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaaresen 2006</LINK> modified the Mother-Infant Transaction Program as originally described by <LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK> in a randomised controlled trial of 146 infants born at &lt; 2000 grams. The intervention group (N = 72) received an initial briefing session, which was followed by daily one-hour sessions with both parents and infants on seven consecutive days, starting one week before discharge, and four home visits at three, 14, 30 and 90 days after discharge. A team of nurses implemented the programme, which included education on behavioural cues, parent-infant interactions and appropriate stimulation of the infant. The control group received standard care provided by a physiotherapist and doctor consultation at discharge. Investigators assessed cognitive and motor outcomes at two and three years by using the Norwegian version of the BSID-II, and at five years with the WPPSI and McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Assessors blinded to children's group allocation assessed cognitive outcomes at seven and nine years of age using the WISC-III.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Koldewijn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koldewijn 2009</LINK> carried out a multi-centre (seven sites) randomised controlled trial of the effects of the 'Infant Behavioural Assessment and Intervention Program' (IBAIP) in infants born at &lt; 32 weeks' gestational age, at &lt; 1500 grams or both. The intervention group (N = 86) received one-hour sessions, with the first session provided just before discharge, followed by six to eight home visits up to six months' CA. The intervention was available as part of a commercially available training package intended to enhance parents' abilities to read and respond to their infants' cues throughout everyday life. The intervention is described in detail in the referenced publications. The control group (N = 90) and the intervention group received standard care, which consisted of regular paediatrician outpatient visits. The paediatrician could refer the child for physiotherapy if necessary, but for infants in the control group, referral could not be made to an IBAIP-trained physiotherapist, and those in the intervention group could receive only an additional three home visits with their IBAIP-trained physiotherapist. At six and 24 months, investigators blinded to group assignment assessed infants using the BSID-II, and at 44 months using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). At 44 months, they assessed motor co-ordination using the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). At 5.5 years, 76% of children returned for follow-up and were assessed with the WPPSI-III, the MABC-2 and the Developmental Test of VMI.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Kyno-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Kyno 2012</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial for preterm infants (30.0 to 35.6 weeks' GA) using the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP), originally described by <LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK>. Researchers randomly assigned infants in the NICU to intervention (n = 61) and control (n = 57) groups. The MITP consisted of 11 one-hour sessions of semi structured pre-discharge and post-discharge interventions. The first seven sessions, which were provided during the last week of hospitalisation and were followed by four home visits at 3, 14, 30 and 90 days after discharge, focused on infant development and the parent-infant relationship. Investigators reported no details about the control group with regards to the intervention. At 36 months, researchers assessed infants by using the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL), which includes gross motor, fine motor, visual reception and receptive and expressive language. The early learning composite score is a measure of global cognitive function. The assessor was not blinded to group allocation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Lekskulchai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Lekskulchai 2001</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a physiotherapy motor development programme in improving motor performance among preterm infants. Investigators used the TIMP assessment to classify the 84 infants in terms of risk of developmental delay. The motor developmental programme (N = 43) began at 40 weeks' postmenstrual age, and three additional visits were provided at one, two and three months' corrected age. A physiotherapist instructed primary caregivers on how to perform three activities with the infant during each session that were to be carried out at home. Before the next visit, the principal researcher evaluated the previous month's programme with caregivers through an interview and demonstration of activities by the caregiver. A research assistant assessed the standard follow-up group (N = 41) (using the TIMP) at one, two, three and four months, and parents were able to discuss any concerns with the principal researcher. A physiotherapist blinded to group allocation at one, two, three and four months' corrected age used the TIMP to assess motor outcomes.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Melnyk-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Melnyk 2001</LINK> carried out a quasi-randomised pilot project to compare the 'creating opportunities for parent empowerment' (COPE) programme versus placebo intervention. The intervention programme was carried out in blocks (related to date of admission) to avoid contamination of the comparison group by staff and parents in the treatment group. The COPE programme (N = 26) was a four-phase programme that consisted of audiotaped and written information and workbooks on infant behaviour and parental roles. The first three sessions occurred two to four days after admission to hospital, and the last session occurred approximately one week after discharge. The comparison programme (N = 29) was delivered at the same four time points and involved audiotaped and written information on hospital services, routine discharge and immunisations. An assessor blinded to infant group allocation measured cognitive outcomes by using the BSID-II MDI at three and six months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled study to investigate the effects of an infant stimulation programme versus standard follow-up. Infants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (N = 21) or to standard follow-up (N = 16) at 33 weeks of age and were eligible to commence the intervention programme after this point. The intervention group received a multi-sensory stimulation programme that included auditory, tactile, visual and vestibular stimuli in response to infant behavioural and physiological cues. A research assistant provided the intervention in the hospital twice daily five days per week until discharge. Mothers were taught the intervention, which they continued to administer at home until infants reached two months' corrected age. Standard follow-up and intervention groups received a baseline of care in the nursery that was designed to optimise development, reduce stress and facilitate sleep cycles and motor development. All infants also received a home programme of physiotherapy intervention. Investigators used the BSID-II MDI and PDI to assess cognitive and motor outcomes at 12 months.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK> was the first randomised controlled trial of the 'the Mother-Infant Transaction Program' (MITP), also known as the Vermont Intervention Program. The intervention group (N = 38) received a programme designed to enhance mother-infant interaction and infant development by teaching mothers to be more sensitive and responsive to babies' physiological, behavioural and social cues. Intervention consisted of a total of 11 sessions delivered by a trained neonatal intensive care nurse. Seven sessions were conducted in hospital before discharge, and four were provided at home during the first three months following discharge. The first seven inpatient sessions focused on educating the mother (and the father if available) with regard to the infant's motor system, state regulations, social interaction, daily care and preparation for home. Information given at these sessions was then consolidated into the first session provided post discharge. The remaining three sessions at home involved discussion regarding mutual enjoyment through play and understanding of temperamental patterns. Researchers did not report details of care for the standard follow-up group (N = 40). They observed a significant difference in SES between intervention and standard follow-up groups despite randomisation. Study authors provided data that had been adjusted to account for differences in SES. They measured cognitive and motor outcomes at six, 12 and 24 months by using the BSID-I MDI and PDI. At three and four years, they assessed cognitive development by using the McCarthy Scale of Children's Abilities. At seven and nine years, they assessed cognitive development by using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children. All outcome assessors were blinded to children's group allocation.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Ohgi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ohgi 2004</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial to determine the effects of an early intervention programme for preterm infants at high risk for CP versus standard follow-up. The intervention group (N = 12) received a behaviour-based intervention combined with developmental support designed to enhance infants' development and parent-infant relationships. The intervention began in the NICU and lasted until six months' corrected age. The programme had two components. The first was designed to facilitate mother-infant interactions and involved three or four 30-minute sessions provided at 36 to 40 weeks' postmenstrual age, before the time of discharge. The second component was presented to parents during visits to the hospital and focused on advising mothers on how to handle their infants according to infant abilities and developmental needs. After discharge, the intervention group received weekly or biweekly outpatient sessions, each for 40 to 60 minutes. The standard follow-up group (N = 12) received the same care as the treatment group with respect to attendance at clinics and referral to developmental services, if infants showed signs of neurological dysfunction or developmental delay. An assessor blinded to infants' group allocation assessed motor and cognitive outcomes at six months using the BSID-I MDI and PDI.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1988</LINK> conducted a quasi-randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate a programme of hospital- and home-based intervention versus standard follow-up care. An early childhood development specialist delivered two developmental interventions per day to infants in the treatment group (N = 21) while infants were in the NICU. These interventions involved a stimulation programme (auditory, visual, vestibular and tactile) and passive movements. After discharge, a nurse visited the home weekly until infants reached term-corrected age. From term age until 12 months' corrected age, an early childhood developmental specialist visited the infant and caregiver twice monthly for 60 to 90 minutes. The post-discharge programme focused on language enrichment, social skills, cognitive development, parenting activities and muscular development. The standard follow-up group (N = 20) received a full range of services, including social services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy based on the baby's condition. For outcome assessments at six and 12 months of age, investigators used the BSID-I MDI and PDI.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Rice-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1979</LINK> conducted the first randomised controlled trial of infant stimulation for preterm infants versus standard follow-up. The intervention group (N = 15) received a tactile-kinaesthetic stimulation programme administered by their mothers, which was designed to enhance parent-infant relationships while giving infants appropriate levels of stimulation. The programme consisted of a stroking treatment for 15 minutes, followed by infant rocking and cuddling for another five minutes. Nurses taught mothers to deliver the intervention four times a day for a period of 30 days, beginning the day the infant was discharged from the hospital. The standard follow-up group (N = 15) received normal discharge information and was visited regularly (number of visits was not reported by study authors) by the researcher and by other public health nurses, who provided social reinforcement for appropriate mothering behaviour. An assessor blinded to group allocation assessed cognitive and motor development at four months by using the BSID-I MDI and PDI.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Sajaniemi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sajaniemi 2001</LINK> aimed to assess the effects of an early occupational therapy intervention in a randomised controlled trial of infants born at &lt; 1000 grams. Investigators matched infants in pairs in accordance with their perinatal risk scores and allocated them successively to intervention or non-intervention groups. The intervention group (N = 63) received a one-hour weekly home-based intervention from six to 12 months aimed at supporting parent-infant interactions and enhancing motor control. The average number of sessions was 20. The non-intervention group (N = 63) and the intervention group could access additional occupational therapy or physiotherapy. Children with CP and mental retardation were excluded from the study as diagnoses were made. Infants were followed up at 24 months' corrected age with the BSID-I MDI, and at four years' CA with the WPPSI.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Spittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Spittle 2009</LINK> performed a randomised controlled trial of a preventive care programme for infants born at &lt; 30 weeks' gestational age, called 'VIBeS Plus' (Victorian Infant Brain Studies Plus). The intervention group (N = 61) received nine visits at home post hospital discharge by a team consisting of a physiotherapist and a psychologist; each session lasted 90 to 120 minutes from one week post hospital discharge until 11 months' corrected age. The preventive care programme aimed to improve infant development while supporting parents' mental health. The standard follow-up group (N = 59) and the intervention group were seen by their maternal child health nurses and could be referred for early intervention services if their paediatrician or nurse believed it was needed. At 12 months' corrected age, researchers used the AlMS and the Neuro Sensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA) to assess motor development. At 24 months' corrected age, they used the Bayley III to assess cognitive, language and motor performance. At four years' corrected age, investigators assessed cognitive development by using the Differential Abilities Scale (DAS-II) and used the General Cognitive Ability score as the primary outcome. Motor outcome was assessed with the MABC-2. An assessor blinded to group allocation performed all follow-up assessments.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Teti-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teti 2009</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial to assess the effects of an intervention on low birth weight infants of African American mothers. The study recruited 173 infants and mothers, 171 of whom were premature. Mothers were excluded if they had a positive toxicology screen or were younger than 18 years of age, and infants were excluded if they had a chromosomal abnormality. The intervention began in the NICU at 32 weeks' GA for infants born at &lt; 32 weeks and at between 32 and 36 weeks' GA for infants born at &#8805; 32 weeks. Investigators used the NBAS and video to provide eight sessions over a 20-week period to the intervention group (N = 99), which included an infant tactile stimulation component and two psychoeducational components. Care details for the control group (N = 95) were not described. The intervention continued until approximately four months' corrected age, and infants were assessed with the BSID-II MDI and PDI at between three and four months. Whether assessors were blinded to group allocation is not reported.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2014</LINK> conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing three interventions - a clinic-based intervention programme (CBIP; n = 57), a home-based intervention programme (HBIP; n = 63) and a standard care programme (n = 58) - in very low birth weight infants from the first week after birth until 12 months of age. Infants were low-risk preterm infants born at &lt; 1500 grams, at &lt; 37 weeks' GA, singleton or first born of multiple births, with no congenital or brain abnormalities. The CBIP and the HBIP provided similar child-, parent- and dyad-focused services and interventions but differed in terms of the location at which the intervention was provided. All three groups received health surveillance for five sessions during the hospitalisation period and attended a neonatal clinic visit for eight sessions post discharge. These began at one week and were spaced out until 12 months post discharge. In addition, CBIP and HBIP groups had eight sessions with a physiotherapist at the time of the neonatal visits, which focused on environment modulation, developmental skills, feeding, massage, parental support and education. Investigators assessed cognitive, motor and language outcomes at 24 months by using the Bayley-III.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Yigit-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Yigit 2002</LINK> carried out a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of early physiotherapy intervention versus standard follow-up for low-risk preterm infants. Study authors did not report how many infants were initially randomly assigned to each group; however, they did report that 39 infants were dropped from the study within the first 12 months for lack of participation. This resulted in 80 infants in the physiotherapy intervention group and 80 infants in the standard follow-up group at 12 months. Infants were registered for the study before the time of hospital discharge; however, it is unclear when the study began. The physiotherapy intervention was based on the principles of infant stimulation and NDT. It is reported that infants attended an early intervention programme and were also given a home programme; however, researchers provide no details on either programme. It is reported that all study infants were seen by the same physiotherapist once a month for the first nine months, then once every three months until 18 to 24 months of age. However, it is unclear whether the physiotherapist provided intervention or assessments at these sessions. No further details of care provided for the standard follow-up group were reported. Motor outcomes were assessed throughout the intervention on the basis of reflexes and motor milestones, and rates of CP were reported. It is not clear whether assessors were blinded to infants' group allocation.</P>

<P>This review found 21 quasi-randomised or randomised controlled trials involving 3133 infants. The primary objective was to determine the effects of early developmental intervention programmes post hospital discharge for preterm infants on cognitive and motor development compared with standard medical follow-up during infancy (zero to two years of age), preschool age (three to &lt; five years of age), school age (five to 17 years of age) and adulthood.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-11-17 15:42:45 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The primary goal of this updated review was to compare effects of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge for preterm infants on cognitive and motor development versus standard medical follow-up at infancy (zero to &lt; three years), preschool age (three to &lt; five years), school age (five to &lt; 18 years) and adulthood (&#8805; 18 years). We included in this review 25 randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions for preterm infants; however, not all studies provided sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis demonstrated a treatment effect of early intervention on cognitive outcomes at infancy of approximately one-third of SD on standardised cognitive tests, and at preschool age of approximately one-half of SD on standardised IQ tests; however, no difference at school age or into adulthood was noted. With regards to motor outcomes, this updated review demonstrated a small but significant difference in favour of intervention at infancy; however, only a few studies reported longer-term outcomes and described conflicting results. The size of the reported effect on cognitive outcomes is considered to be of clinical importance; however, the effect on motor development is small.</P>
<P>This updated 
review includes four new trials and longer-term outcomes of three trials that were included in previous versions of the review. Although data from an additional seven studies have been included in this review update, overall results have not changed.</P>
<P>The previous updated review included six new studies - one study that was not previously identified (<LINK REF="STD-Sajaniemi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sajaniemi 2001</LINK>) and five that were completed more recently (<LINK REF="STD-Gianni-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gianni 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Kaaresen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaaresen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Johnson-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Johnson 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koldewijn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koldewijn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Spittle 2009</LINK>) and had not reported outcomes when the original review was published (<LINK REF="REF-Spittle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spittle 2007</LINK>). The addition of these studies to the meta-analysis for the second update at infancy led to a change in effect size for both cognitive and motor outcomes when compared with the previous review but resulted in no further change with the third update.</P>
<P>The study by <LINK REF="STD-Kaaresen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaaresen 2006</LINK> of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP) showed diminished differences between intervention and control in time as related to cognitive outcome. The intervention group showed significantly higher cognitive outcomes at five years, and these data were included in the meta-analysis of school-age outcomes for the second update of this Cochrane review. However, when the cohort was assessed at seven and nine years of age, no differences in cognitive outcomes were noted between groups. The current review has demonstrated diminishing effects of early developmental interventions over time. These diminishing effects support the need for further intervention around school age possibly targeted towards school readiness.</P>
<P>Considerable debate has examined how best to reduce or prevent long-term impairments while improving cognitive and motor outcomes for children born preterm. This high level of interest is reflected in the large numbers of randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews on the topic. To our knowledge, our first review provided the first reported meta-analysis of early developmental interventions provided post discharge from hospital for preterm infants. However, <LINK REF="REF-Vanderveen-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vanderveen 2009</LINK> more recently published a systematic review on early intervention programmes for preterm infants involving parents. The Vanderveen review also included interventions that were based only in the hospital, such as the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP), along with interventions post hospital discharge, and their findings were similar to those reported in our review. The Vanderveen review identified 25 studies that used a variety of interventions including parent education, infant stimulation, home visits and individualised developmental care. Meta-analysis showed early improvement in cognitive and motor performance that was not sustained at school age. <LINK REF="REF-Blauw_x002d_Hospers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw-Hospers 2005</LINK> published a systematic review investigating the effects of early intervention on motor outcomes for all infants at risk for, or diagnosed with, developmental motor disorders. Review authors defined early intervention as "multidisciplinary services provided to children from birth to five years of age to promote child health and well-being, enhance emerging competencies, minimise developmental delays, existing or emerging disabilities, prevent functional deterioration, and promote adaptive parenting and overall family functioning". They reported that NIDCAP, an inpatient programme comprising interventions that focus on specific motor training such as treadmill training, and general development programmes that aim to increase the child's exploration have a positive effect on motor outcomes for high-risk infants. The <LINK REF="REF-Blauw_x002d_Hospers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw-Hospers 2005</LINK> systematic review was broader than the current review in that it included all early intervention programmes that began from birth to 18 months for all infants at risk for, or diagnosed with, developmental motor disorders. Review authors did not include preterm infants at 'low risk' of developmental motor disorders; therefore, many of the studies included in the current review were not included by <LINK REF="REF-Blauw_x002d_Hospers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw-Hospers 2005</LINK>. Inclusion criteria for early developmental interventions programmes applied in the current review were very specific in an attempt to limit variability among intervention programmes. As <LINK REF="REF-Blauw_x002d_Hospers-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Blauw-Hospers 2005</LINK> reported, the term 'early intervention' can be understood in one of two ways: intervention that occurs early in life, or intervention that occurs early in expression of the condition. We have included only intervention programmes that began early in life - within the first 12 months, when the brain is highly plastic (<LINK REF="REF-Hadders_x002d_Algra-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hadders-Algra 2001</LINK>). These intervention programmes are more likely to be targeted at prevention because longer-term problems may not be apparent and specific diagnoses are less likely.</P>
<P>The current review has a number of limitations. Interventions received by 'treatment groups' in this review varied in theoretical content, environmental context, intensity and duration of follow-up. This contributed to significant levels of heterogeneity when cognitive outcomes were pooled and, therefore, limits the conclusions that can be drawn from these results. Subgroup analysis was useful for investigating areas of variation between trials.</P>
<P>In our first review, most of the included studies recruited infants in the 1980s, when the mean gestational age (GA) at entry was older than in studies conducted in the 1990s. Advances in perinatal care meant that pooling results across eras may have resulted in comparisons of different groups of infants with respect to outcomes. With the addition of nine studies in the second and third updates of this review, effects on cognitive development have decreased, although they are still significant, and effects on motor development have increased. However, this may reflect differences in the types of early intervention programmes provided, for example, the fact that two studies included physiotherapy, rather than differing characteristics among participants. To account for differences in GA and birth weight of infants across studies, subgroup analysis was planned for both of these factors. Most studies did not report outcomes according to GA or birth weight, thus limiting subgroup analysis. <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> reported that infants who were born at between 2000 grams and 2500 grams had greater response to intervention. <LINK REF="STD-Barrera-1986" TYPE="STUDY">Barrera 1986</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK> found the opposite response, with infants born at very low birth weight (VLBW) having greater cognitive response at infancy. <LINK REF="STD-Sajaniemi-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sajaniemi 2001</LINK> included only extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and reported significant effects on cognitive development. No studies reported differences in motor outcomes between intervention and control groups related to GA or birth weight. The presence of brain injury is important to consider when effects of interventions on preterm infants are assessed. Only two studies included infants with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) or intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), and these studies reported no differences in cognitive and motor outcomes between intervention and control groups (<LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohgi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ohgi 2004</LINK>). The standard follow-up group in both of these studies received physiotherapy as required, which may have affected the motor outcomes of these infants. <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK> reported that infants with abnormal cranial ultrasound findings had a positive cognitive response to intervention, but infants who received intervention or standard follow-up with normal cranial ultrasound showed no differences in outcomes. The other studies did not report whether they excluded infants with abnormal imaging, PVL or IVH; therefore, they could not be included in the subgroup analysis.</P>
<P>Other variables such as socioeconomic status (SES) are also important to consider when different studies are compared. <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1979</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Field-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1980</LINK> included only infants who were born to mothers of low SES. <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK> reported significant differences in SES between groups despite randomisation. The control group in the study by <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK> included a higher percentage of mothers who were educated beyond 16 years of age, were in non-manual occupations and had use of a car compared with the intervention groups. All three of these variables were independently associated with Griffiths quotients and may explain some of the variance in outcomes. Using a regression model to account for SES differences between groups, study authors reported improvement in IQ scores for both Portage and Parent Advisor groups compared with the standard follow-up group. <LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK> reported that results were adjusted to account for differences in SES between groups. <LINK REF="STD-Koldewijn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koldewijn 2009</LINK> reported both unadjusted and adjusted results for several variables, including SES. When results were adjusted, a significant effect on motor development was noted at infancy, but not when results were unadjusted. <LINK REF="STD-Teti-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Teti 2009</LINK> targeted infants of African American mothers because of associated high rates of premature birth and noted that at least half of families were living below the poverty threshold. When adjusted for poverty status, results revealed a greater intervention effect on cognitive outcome (Mental Development Index (MDI)) for infants of mothers living above the poverty threshold. <LINK REF="STD-Field-1980" TYPE="STUDY">Field 1980</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rice-1979" TYPE="STUDY">Rice 1979</LINK> included only families of low SES, which limits generalisability of these results to the general population.</P>
<P>Two types of subgroup analyses were performed in relation to types of intervention programmes provided. The first subgroup analysis compared interventions that were begun while the infant was still in hospital versus those that were begun post hospital discharge. Both types of programmes had a significant effect on cognitive outcomes at infancy and preschool age. At school age, the only study that demonstrated a difference in favour of the intervention group began with participants belonging to an inpatient group. Interventions that began when infants were inpatients were more homogenous, as all focused on improving the parent-infant relationship and on enhancing parents' abilities to read and respond appropriately to infants' behavioural cues. Significant heterogeneity between interventions that occurred post hospital discharge can be explained by the variety of intervention programmes provided. Interventions that began post hospital discharge had a greater impact on motor outcomes in infants; however, this effect was not significant. The second subgroup analysis was related to the focus of the intervention programme as parent-infant relationship, infant development or both. Interventions with a component that focused on the parent-infant relationship had a greater impact on cognitive outcomes at infancy and preschool age when compared with interventions that focused on infant development or parent support alone.</P>
<P>This review has compared early developmental interventions versus standard follow-up; however, details of standard follow-up were not always reported. Many of the studies that reported details of follow-up indicated that infants and families still had access to developmental services such as physiotherapy and social services. Although evidence for some of these services is limited (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2006</LINK>), it could be considered unethical to prevent access to them. Services received by the standard follow-up group may improve outcomes, making a treatment effect more difficult to detect. For example, the standard follow-up group in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Goodman-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Goodman 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Resnick-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Resnick 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohgi-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Ohgi 2004</LINK>) received physiotherapy in accordance with institutional policies, which may have influenced motor outcomes of the standard follow-up group. Contamination of control and intervention groups with additional treatments or other therapies is also problematic, as families of preterm infants may seek additional treatment for a child who is perceived to be 'at risk' for developmental difficulties. None of the included studies reported the 'dosage' of other interventions received by the standard follow-up group, and none performed analyses in relation to services accessed by the follow-up group.</P>
<P>The extent of intervention received by infants and families in treatment groups varied greatly between studies (from four to 336 sessions) and within studies. The relationship between intervention dosage and compliance with the intervention is important. Compliance may be estimated by attendance at designated visits or by therapists' recordings of impressions of compliance. <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> reported that higher levels of participation were related to better outcomes on the MDI and higher IQ scores at 24 and 36 months. In the study by <LINK REF="STD-Cameron-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cameron 2005</LINK>, a better motor outcome was reported at four months for families with good compliance. However, subjective measurement of compliance by study investigators may be biased, and more objective measurements would be optimal. <LINK REF="STD-Dusing-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Dusing 2015</LINK> used parent recording and questionnaires to record dosage and to monitor compliance, and decided a priori that infants who received less than 70% of the prescribed intervention would be dropped from the study. Study authors reported that one infant was excluded from analysis on the basis of this premise. Although this approach may provide a more objective analysis of the effects of an intervention, it may create bias by increasing attrition to unacceptable levels.</P>
<P>A wide variety of measurement tools were used in these studies, restricting the ability of review authors to pool data. Fewer measurement tools were utilised to assess cognitive development than were used to assess motor development; this made it possible for review authors to pool cognitive data for meta-analysis at different ages. Effects of early intervention on motor development could be subjected to meta-analysis at infancy only when the Bayley (Edition I, II or III) or Griffiths Locomotor Subscale was used. Bayley and Griffiths provide broad measures of motor development and do not specifically evaluate minor motor problems, which are common among preterm infants. These studies might have no effect on motor outcomes, or measures used may not have been sensitive enough to allow detection of effects of interventions on motor problems. Other motor measurement tools that assess movement quality and motor performance in greater detail, such as the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) and Movement ABC, were used by individual studies; however, pooling these data for meta-analysis would not have been appropriate. The diversity of motor assessment tools and lack of data at older ages limit the ability of review authors to compare results between studies. The meta-analysis of long-term effects of early developmental interventions on motor and cognitive outcomes was limited not only by the small number of studies, but by the low rates of follow-up reported.</P>
<P>The meta-analysis in this review sought to examine motor and cognitive outcomes using standardised assessments. Since the 2000s, a shift has occurred in how disability is measured. Instead of measurement via a medical framework, disability is measured on the basis of functional outcomes, activity limitations and participation restrictions as part of a social and environmental framework (<LINK REF="REF-Simeonsson-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simeonsson 2003</LINK>). The World Health Organization now uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, rather than the old model of International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2001</LINK>). Early intervention may not be able to change the physical outcomes of a motor disorder such as cerebral palsy (CP); however, it may change how affected individuals function and participate in society. Intervention may affect motor outcomes in a functional way. For example, the infant may be able to play outside on uneven surfaces, whereas without intervention the child may be restricted to indoor activities. Outcome measures such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development - Psychomotor Development Index (BSID-PDI), Bayley-III and the Griffiths Locomotor Subscale measure global motor development in a controlled environment. The controlled environment in which these assessments occur is often a quiet room set up to allow the infant or the child to perform in the best way possible. The skill level achieved in this setting may not be achievable in another setting, so it is important that skills are assessed away from the testing situation and in children's own specific environments. This review has included only traditional outcome measures of motor and cognitive outcomes; however, as functional measures become more widely used, review authors must consider their inclusion. Furthermore, early developmental interventions may affect other areas of development, seen in improvements in behaviour, or parents themselves, seen in decreased levels of anxiety and depression; this has been demonstrated by several studies (<LINK REF="STD-Kaaresen-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Kaaresen 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Koldewijn-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Koldewijn 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Spittle 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The methodological quality of included studies was variable, and only eight randomised controlled trials reported adequate concealment allocation and greater than 85% follow-up. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess effects of study quality on cognitive and motor outcomes. When only higher-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis, an intervention effect on cognitive outcomes was evident at infancy and at preschool age. However, no significant effects on motor outcomes were noted. Trials of developmental interventions have had some limitations. It is not feasible to mask the person implementing the intervention nor the recipient of the intervention (in this case, mother and baby) unless a comparison group providing an alternative intervention is used instead of a control group. Only one study provided a comparison treatment instead of a non-treatment control (<LINK REF="STD-Melnyk-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Melnyk 2001</LINK>); however, this was not a randomised trial. When interventions are delivered, whether they focus on infant development or on the parent-infant relationship, the component of parental support may affect outcomes. <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK> was the only study to control for parent support by including three groups: one that received an infant development programme, one that received parent support only and a control group. Methodological quality assessments used in this review did not take sample size into account. Sample size is important the outcomes of individual programmes are assessed, as some studies may not have had enough power to demonstrate differences between groups. <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> was by far the largest, including 985 infants, followed by <LINK REF="STD-APIP-1998" TYPE="STUDY">APIP 1998</LINK>, with 308 infants. Significant results reported by <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> and a large sample size influenced overall results of the meta-analysis. <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> is very different from other early developmental programmes in terms of frequency and duration of interventions; this should be considered when results of this review are interpreted. <LINK REF="STD-Spittle-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Spittle 2009</LINK> involved all of the authors of this systematic review, and although we have adopted Cochrane review methods in conducting this review, readers must consider that we may be biased.</P>
<P>This systematic review has not investigated which aspect of early developmental interventions has a greater effect on outcome - optimal duration, timing, frequency or focus of the intervention. Further research is needed to identify components of intervention that are most effective on the basis of cost and benefit. <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK> was estimated to cost USD15,146 per year per child. Investigators suggest that this value could be reduced to USD8806 if centres were located in the community, and if teacher-child ratios were decreased. However, this remains a costly intervention as compared with interventions provided by <LINK REF="STD-Nurcombe-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Nurcombe 1984</LINK>, which reported better long-term outcomes and was less costly to implement, as only 11 sessions were provided over four months versus an intensive programme provided over three years for infants in the intervention group in <LINK REF="STD-I.H.D.P.-1990" TYPE="STUDY">I.H.D.P. 1990</LINK>.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2015-11-15 21:51:59 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Meta-analysis demonstrated that early developmental interventions post hospital discharge for preterm infants have a significant impact on cognitive and motor development at infancy and preschool age, and have a small effect on motor development at infancy. At school age, only five studies have investigated the long-term effects of intervention on cognitive outcomes, and three have investigated these effects on motor outcomes, with none demonstrating substantial differences in long-term outcomes. Interventions that focus on both the parent-infant relationship and infant development have the greatest impact on cognitive development over the short to medium term. Heterogeneity between early developmental intervention programmes with regards to content, focus and intensity limits the conclusions that can be drawn in this review.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2015-11-15 21:54:09 -0500" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Additional high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to identify effective components of successful early developmental interventions for preterm infants. Greater selectivity of high-risk populations may reveal those infants who may benefit the most from an intervention. Targeting an intervention to address the needs of the infant and family more specifically may reduce costs and increase effectiveness. Further research is required to determine effects of intervention programmes on long-term motor outcomes, as only limited conclusions could be made from this review. Long-term follow-up high-quality randomised controlled trials of interventions focusing on both motor and cognitive outcomes for preterm infants are needed. Measurement tools must be sensitive enough to detect changes in motor performance and to identify minor neurological problems. This review has not investigated effects on behaviour, parental outcomes (such as depression and anxiety), function, activity levels or participation, all of which may be influenced by early developmental intervention programmes.</P>

To minimise the cost of the study, one-third of participants were randomly assigned to intervention (N = 377) and two-thirds were randomly assigned to standard follow-up (N = 608). Intervention group had home visits, attended a child development centre and attended parent group meetings. Home visits were made weekly for the first year and biweekly for the second and third years. Home visits emphasised cognitive, linguistic and social development via a programme of games for the parent to use with the child, and aimed to help parents manage self identified problems.
