<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-07-12 14:46:41 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Most strokes and heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood supply to part of the brain (to cause stroke) or to the heart (to cause a heart attack). Aspirin prevents blood clots forming, and it can reduce the risk of a further heart attack or stroke in people who have had a stroke or heart attack or other symptoms of vascular disease. Clopidogrel and ticlopidine are two similar drugs called thienopyridines which prevent clots in a different way to aspirin. This review of 10 trials comparing either clopidogrel or ticlopidine with aspirin in about 27,000 people found that clopidogrel and ticlopidine were at least as effective as aspirin for the prevention of stroke and heart attacks, and might be slightly more effective. In terms of adverse effects, compared with aspirin, clopidogrel and ticlopidine caused less stomach upset and less bleeding from the gut, but more diarrhoea and skin rash. Ticlopidine produced more of these last two adverse effects than clopidogrel when compared with aspirin. Ticlopidine can also cause suppression of the bone marrow production of blood cells, which can be a serious complication. Clopidogrel is therefore the thienopyridine of choice since it is safer and better tolerated. However, since it is substantially more expensive than aspirin and not clearly more effective, it should generally only be used instead of aspirin in patients who are unable to take aspirin.<BR/>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:23:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Aspirin is the most widely studied and prescribed antiplatelet agent for preventing serious vascular events, reducing the odds of such events among high vascular risk patients by about a quarter. Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit platelet activation by a different mechanism and so may be more effective.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:23:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>To determine the effectiveness and safety of thienopyridine derivatives (ticlopidine and clopidogrel) versus aspirin for preventing serious vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or vascular death) in patients at high risk, and specifically in patients with a previous TIA or ischaemic stroke.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:24:19 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Stroke, Heart and Peripheral Vascular Diseases Cochrane Review Groups (last searched July 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2008). We also searched reference lists of relevant papers, and contacted other researchers and the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-BMS (December 2008).<BR/>

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:24:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All unconfounded, double blind, randomised trials directly comparing a thienopyridine derivative with aspirin in high vascular risk patients.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:24:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We sought additional data from the principal investigators of the largest trials.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:28:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included 10 trials involving 26,865 high vascular risk patients. The trials were generally of high quality. Aspirin was compared with ticlopidine in nine trials (7633 patients) and with clopidogrel in one trial (19,185 patients). Compared with aspirin, allocation to a thienopyridine produced a modest, just statistically significant, reduction in the odds of a serious vascular event (11.6% versus 12.5%; odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.99), corresponding to the avoidance of 10 (95% CI 0 to 20) serious vascular events per 1000 patients treated for about two years. However, the wide confidence interval includes the possibility of negligible additional benefit. Compared with aspirin, thienopyridines significantly reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, thienopyridines increased the odds of skin rash and diarrhoea, ticlopidine more than clopidogrel. Allocation to ticlopidine, but not clopidogrel, significantly increased the odds of neutropenia. In patients with TIA/ischaemic stroke, the results were similar to those for all patients combined.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:25:30 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The thienopyridine derivatives are at least as effective as aspirin in preventing serious vascular events in patients at high risk, and possibly somewhat more so. However, the size of any additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible. Clopidogrel has a more favourable adverse effects profile than ticlopidine and so is the thienopyridine of choice. It should be used as an alternative to aspirin in patients genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin.</P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2009-08-12 09:46:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-08-12 09:46:58 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The burden of cardiovascular disease (mainly due to stroke and myocardial infarction (MI)) on patients, carers and communities is enormous. One strategy of reducing this burden is the effective prevention of serious vascular events (i.e. stroke, MI, or vascular death) among individuals who are at high risk as a result of previous clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic arterial disease (i.e. patients with a history of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) of the brain or eye, ischaemic stroke, MI or angina, or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)).</P>
<P>The most recently published systematic overview of the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (ATT) includes data from 287 randomised trials comparing antiplatelet therapy with control or one antiplatelet with another, in more than 200,000 individuals (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). Many additional trials of aspirin at various doses and other antiplatelet drugs and also trials comparing the effects of adding aspirin to another antiplatelet drug with a different mechanism of action have been included since the previous published overview of the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (APT). The additional data strengthens the findings from the APT that antiplatelet therapy for individuals with clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic arterial disease reduced the odds of a subsequent serious vascular event by about a quarter (<LINK REF="REF-APT-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APT 1994</LINK>).</P>
<P>The proportional odds reductions were similar for patients with arterial disease of the brain, heart or peripheral circulation, but the absolute risk reductions varied according to the baseline risk of a subsequent vascular event. For example, among patients with prior TIA or ischaemic stroke, antiplatelet therapy reduced the three-year risk of a subsequent serious vascular event from 21% to 18% (a 22% relative odds reduction and 3% absolute risk reduction), indicating that treating 1000 such patients for about three years prevented or delayed about 30 major vascular events (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the most recent ATT overview, two-thirds of the data comparing an antiplatelet regimen with control came from trials comparing aspirin alone with no antiplatelet therapy. Overall, aspirin reduced the relative odds of a serious vascular event by about a quarter. Neither indirect nor direct comparisons of different aspirin regimens showed any evidence of differences in effectiveness throughout a range of doses from 75 mg to 1500 mg per day (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). The number of participants in trials assessing doses of less than 75 mg were relatively small and hence the results for benefits versus risks at this dose were not entirely conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>). Doses of 75 to 150 mg daily have been much more widely assessed and since higher doses are significantly more gastrotoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 1989</LINK>) the current evidence supports the use of aspirin 75 to 150 mg daily for the prevention of vascular events in high risk individuals.</P>
<P>Indirect comparisons with aspirin of various different antiplatelet drugs in the most recent ATT overview showed no clear evidence of differences in the occurrence of vascular events, but the most promising drug in such comparisons was ticlopidine, which produced a 32% (95% confidence interval (CI) 21% to 42%) odds of a serious vascular event compared to a 23% (95% CI 19% to 27%) odds reduction with aspirin alone. However, indirect comparisons are unreliable and direct comparisons between ticlopidine and aspirin among a total of 3791 high vascular risk patients in four trials showed no definite difference, although there was a non-significant trend toward a lower rate of serious vascular events in those treated with ticlopidine (odds reduction 12%, 95% CI -3% to 25%) (<LINK REF="REF-ATT-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">ATT 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>Whilst these results may reflect a truly greater benefit of ticlopidine compared with aspirin, they may merely reflect the play of chance. Nevertheless, it is biologically plausible that ticlopidine is a more effective antiplatelet agent than aspirin because it inhibits a completely different pathway of platelet activation. Aspirin inhibits platelet activation by inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase, and thromboxane production (<LINK REF="REF-Patrono-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patrono 1994</LINK>). By contrast, ticlopidine inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its receptor on platelets, thereby inhibiting ADP-dependent activation of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, the major receptor for fibrinogen on the platelet surface and the final common pathway of platelet activation (<LINK REF="REF-McTavish-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">McTavish 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>The ATT overview also included a large randomised trial directly comparing another thienopyridine antiplatelet drug, clopidogrel, versus aspirin (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>). Clopidogrel is chemically related to ticlopidine and also inhibits platelet activation by selectively and irreversibly blocking the binding of ADP to its receptor on platelets. In platelet aggregation studies, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily produced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation equivalent to that of ticlopidine, 250 mg twice daily (<LINK REF="REF-Hebert-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hebert 1993</LINK>). It was licensed in the USA and Europe following the results of the large randomised, blinded trial of clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) versus aspirin (325 mg once daily) in 19,185 patients at risk of ischaemic events (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>). After a mean follow up of 1.91 years, an intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients randomised to take clopidogrel had an annual risk of ischaemic stroke, MI, or non-haemorrhagic vascular death (the primary outcome event) of 5.3%, compared with 5.8% for patients taking aspirin (relative risk reduction: 8.7%, 95% CI 0.3 to 16.5%; P = 0.04; absolute risk reduction: 0.5% per year). There were no major differences in terms of safety. In particular, there was no excess neutropenia or thrombocytopenia among patients treated with clopidogrel. This is in contrast to ticlopidine, which is associated with an excess of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (<LINK REF="REF-Moloney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moloney 1993</LINK>), and is no longer widely used in Europe, USA, or Australasia.</P>
<P>Since thienopyridine drugs are chemically related, and have very similar modes of action on platelets, we have considered all the available randomised trials comparing any thienopyridine derivative with aspirin together in order to (1) minimise bias that may arise from considering the results of one trial rather than all relevant trials addressing a similar question, and (2) reduce the effects of random error in the assessment of the benefits and risks of treatment. In general, because the relative difference between the clinically relevant benefits of two active treatments is likely to be small (say about 10%), large numbers of outcome events, and thus very large numbers of randomised patients (several tens of thousands), are required to assess any such difference reliably. In this updated version of our review we have been able to include several relevant randomised trials that have become available since the ATT overview was published.</P>

<P>Two authors (CLMS and GH or GM) independently reviewed potentially eligible studies, and extracted available details on the types of patients enrolled, the entry and exclusion criteria, the randomisation method (i.e. generation and concealment of the randomisation sequence), the number of patients originally allocated to the treatment group (thienopyridine) and the control group (aspirin), the method and duration of follow up, the number of patients in each group lost to follow up, information on compliance with the treatment allocated, the definitions of outcome events, the number of outcome events in each treatment group, and any method used for blinding patients, treating clinicians and outcome assessors to treatment allocation.</P>
<P>We resolved any disagreements among the authors by discussion and mutual consensus.</P>
<P>We analysed data on the basis of intention to treat, including every patient who was assigned to each treatment group, regardless of whether they actually complied with the allocated treatment, were subsequently deemed ineligible or otherwise excluded, or subsequently lost to follow up. In the main analyses we assumed that patients who were randomised and then either excluded or lost to follow up had no outcome event.</P>
<P>We calculated a weighted estimate of the odds ratio (OR) for each outcome using the Peto fixed-effect method.</P>
<P>We calculated absolute risk reductions (ARR) using the risk difference and expressed these as events prevented per 1000 patients treated.</P>
<P>We used the Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics to assess heterogeneity between trials.</P>
<P>For the primary outcome we carried out subgroup analyses in which we assessed the effects of each thienopyridine drug versus aspirin separately. We performed similar subgroup analyses for the safety outcomes of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, skin rash and diarrhoea, since we had identified differences between clopidogrel and ticlopidine with respect to these outcomes in the previous version of this review.</P>
<P>To assess for consistency of the main effects in participants presenting with a stroke or TIA, we repeated analyses for the primary outcome and for stroke outcomes for these participants only.</P>
<P>We performed a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness to losses to follow up of the result for the primary outcome of serious vascular events in all high risk patients. For each trial we assumed that amongst patients lost to follow up from the thienopyridine group, the proportion of vascular events experienced was the same as in the aspirin group, and that amongst patients lost to follow up from the aspirin group, the proportion of vascular events experienced was the same as in the thienopyridine group.</P>

All trials were conducted in the past 20 years, and included a total of 26,865 patients, most of whom participated in <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK> (19,185), <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK> (3069), <LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK> (1809) and <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK> (1470).</P>
<P>The patients were on average about 62 years of age, and 70% were men.</P>
<P>Aspirin was compared with clopidogrel in one trial of 19,185 patients with a qualifying diagnosis of recent (within one week to six months) ischaemic stroke (6431 patients), recent (within 35 days) MI (6302 patients) or PAD (6452 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>). Aspirin was compared with ticlopidine in the remaining nine studies in a total of 7,633 patients. These patients had recently diagnosed TIA or mild ischaemic stroke (5828 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-De-Lucia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Lucia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Japanese_x002d_B" TYPE="STUDY">Japanese-B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>), MI or angina (1790 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Sadowski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sadowski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>) or PAD (62 patients) (<LINK REF="STD-Schoop-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop 1983</LINK>). In one trial, three different doses of aspirin were each compared to ticlopidine (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). The most common dose of aspirin used in the 10 trials was 325 mg.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>, some of the patients who presented with a recent MI had also experienced a previous stroke, and likewise, some patients with a recent ischaemic stroke had also had a previous MI.</P>
<P>The duration of follow up varied between three and 40 months, with an average of about two years.</P>
<P>All trials recorded death, stroke, MI, and vascular death as major outcome events with the exception of two (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>).

<P>The methodological quality of the <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK> studies was high. Treatment allocation was randomised in all studies but the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were not stated in seven (<LINK REF="STD-De-Lucia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Lucia 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Japanese_x002d_B" TYPE="STUDY">Japanese-B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadowski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sadowski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoop-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>).

There were no important imbalances in known prognostic factors at baseline that might invalidate the results.</P>
<P>Seven trials reported losses to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Japanese_x002d_B" TYPE="STUDY">Japanese-B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>). The proportion of patients lost to follow up was low, averaging 2% of the total number of patients. However, in <LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK> the proportion lost to follow up may have been as high as 14% as it was unclear how many patients in each arm were actually lost to follow up and how many withdrew but were still followed up to the end of the trial. In order to account for these losses we performed a sensitivity analysis. We were unable to include one trial that contributed to the primary outcome in the sensitivity analysis as it did not include any information on losses to follow up (<LINK REF="STD-Sadowski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sadowski 1995</LINK>).</P>
<P>In three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Japanese_x002d_B" TYPE="STUDY">Japanese-B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>) including a total of 850 patients, losses to follow up were not included in the analyses presented in the trial reports making true intention-to-treat analysis impossible. However, we included all patients lost to follow up in the analyses in the denominator for all but one trial for which the number in each treatment arm was unavailable (<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>Of the 26,865 patients randomised in the 10 trials, the qualifying event was a recent TIA or ischaemic stroke in 12,259 patients, recent MI in 8092 patients, and PAD in 6514 patients.</P>
<P>The results presented below are derived from data extracted from publications (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Japanese_x002d_B" TYPE="STUDY">Japanese-B</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sadowski-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Sadowski 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schoop-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2001</LINK>), supplemented by additional unpublished data provided by the principal investigators of the <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK> trial, and one internal report (<LINK REF="STD-Schoop-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop 1983</LINK>). No numerical data was available for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-De-Lucia-2000" TYPE="STUDY">De Lucia 2000</LINK>). The results are illustrated in the figures.</P>
<P>The <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK> study presented its results for outcomes of effectiveness in terms of first outcome events. For composite outcome events (e.g. stroke, MI or vascular death) this strategy ensures that no patient is counted more than once. However, for specific single outcome events (e.g. stroke) this strategy can lead to undercounting (e.g. a patient with a non-fatal MI followed by a non-fatal stroke during the follow-up period will only be counted as having a non-fatal MI). Therefore, in <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>, the absolute number of strokes and MIs may have been undercounted. This strategy should not affect the estimates of the proportional effects of treatment because it applies to patients in both treatment groups, and without bias.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Serious vascular events (stroke, MI, or vascular death)</HEADING>
<P>Data from seven trials including 26,255 patients (98% of the total) showed that allocation to a thienopyridine was associated with a modest, just significantly lower risk of the composite outcome stroke, MI or vascular death (thienopyridine 1519/13119 (11.6%) versus aspirin 1641/13136 (12.5%), OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99), corresponding to the avoidance of about 10 (95% CI 0 to 20) serious vascular events per 1000 patients treated with a thienopyridine rather than aspirin for an average of about two years (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). There was moderate but not statistically significant heterogeneity between results for the seven trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 38%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>(6 df) = 9.7; P = 0.1).

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Stroke of all types</HEADING>
<P>Data were available from seven trials including 98% of the total number of patients in the 10 included trials. Allocation to a thienopyridine was associated with a modest but non-significant reduction in the combination of fatal and non-fatal stroke (758/13114 (5.8%) versus 827/13130 (6.3%)) (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.01), corresponding to the avoidance of about 5 (95% CI 0 to 10) strokes per 1000 patients treated for about two years (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>

There was a significant reduction in the combination of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic or unknown stroke among patients allocated a thienopyridine (622/11355 (5.5%)) compared with those allocated aspirin (704/11423 (6.2%)) (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>

Overall, there were slightly fewer vascular deaths (539/13119 (4.1%)) in the thienopyridine group than in the aspirin group (569/13136 (4.3%)) but the reduction was not statistically significant (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Death from any cause</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials including 26,255 patients (98% of the total) reported death during follow up. The mortality among patients allocated a thienopyridine (793/13119 (6.04%)) was not significantly different from that among patients allocated aspirin (824/13136 (6.27%)) (OR: 0.96, 95%CI 0.87 to 1.06) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data were available on any extracranial haemorrhage from three trials including 22,316 patients (83% of the total), and on severe extracranial haemorrhage from two trials including 19,505 patients (73% of the total). There was no significant difference in either severe extracranial haemorrhage (100/9753 (1.03%) versus 102/9752 (1.05%); OR: 0.98, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.29) or any extracranial haemorrhage (986/11159 (8.84%) versus 988/11157 (8.86%); OR: 1.0, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>) in 22,254 patients (83% of the total) reported results for any GI haemorrhage and both revealed a statistically significant reduction among patients allocated a thienopyridine (198/11128 (1.8%)) compared with those allocated aspirin (276/11126 (2.5%)) (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.86). Many fewer patients experienced severe GI haemorrhage (reported in three trials: <LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Schoop-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Schoop 1983</LINK>, in a total of 21,056 patients, 78% of the total), but the odds reduction was similar (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>). These odds reductions correspond to around seven (two severe) fewer gastrointestinal haemorrhages per 1000 patients treated for about two years with a thienopyridine instead of aspirin.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Indigestion/nausea/vomiting</HEADING>
<P>Thienopyridines were also associated with a lower rate of indigestion, nausea and vomiting (1666/11893 (14%)) than aspirin (1925/11893 (16%)) (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.90; 20 fewer patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms per 1000 treated for about two years with a thineopyridine instead of aspirin). Many fewer patients experienced severe indigestion, nausea or vomiting, but the odds reduction was similar (<LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Neutropenia</HEADING>
<P>Two trials (22,254 patients, 83% of the total) reported results for any neutropenia (&lt; 1.2 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) and three trials (24,063 patients, 90% of the total) reported results for severe neutropenia (&lt; 1 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L). Pooled results suggested an excess of neutropenia in patients allocated a thienopyridine (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.55 for any neutropenia; OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.21 for severe neutropenia) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). However, since there was substantial and significant heterogeneity between the results of the trials included (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 89%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>(1 df) = 8.9; P = 0.003 for any neutropenia; I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 71%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>(2 df) = 6.9; P = 0.03 for severe neutropenia), the pooled results are difficult to interpret. The heterogeneity may arise in part from different effects on neutropenia of clopidogrel and ticlopidine; considering these two thienopyridines separately, the results do not suggest an excess risk of any neutropenia for clopidogrel versus aspirin (10/9599 (0.1%) versus 16/9586 (0.17%), OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.36), but show an excess risk of any neutropenia for ticlopidine versus aspirin (35/1529 (2.3%) versus 12/1540 (0.8%), OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.84, excess of about 15 per 1000 treated for about two years with ticlopidine versus aspirin) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Thrombocytopenia</HEADING>
<P>Three trials (22,464 patients, 84% of the total) reported results for severe thrombocytopenia and two (20,655 patients, 77% of the total) for any thrombocytopenia. The data for any thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) showed no significant excess among patients treated with a thienopyridine. There was a non-significant trend towards an excess of severe thrombocytopenia (&lt; 80 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>/L) among patients treated with a thienopyridine (22/11235 (0.2%) versus 13/11229 (0.12%), OR: 1.67, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.25). There was no detectable heterogeneity between the trials included or between subgroups of trials grouped according to the thienopyridine compared with aspirin (ticlopidine or clopidogrel) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>).</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Skin rash</HEADING>
<P>Five trials (25,595 patients, 95% of the total) reported results for skin rash. Compared with aspirin, allocation to a thienopyridine was associated with an excess of any skin rash, but there was substantial heterogeneity between the results for the different trials (I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 80%; Chi<SUP>2 </SUP>(4 df) = 19.6; P = 0.0006) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>). Much of this heterogeneity appeared to arise from differences between ticlopidine and clopidogrel in their effects on skin rash. Subgroup analyses found that, compared with aspirin, ticlopidine produced about a twofold excess in skin rash (213/3196 (6.7%) versus 106/3214 (3.3%), OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.61, excess of about 30 patients per 1000 treated for about two years with ticlipodine versus aspirin) while clopidogrel produced about a one-third excess (578/9599 (6.0%) versus 442/9586 (4.6%), OR 1.32, 95% CI 17 to 1.50, excess of about 15 patients treated for about two years with clopidogrel versus aspirin) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>). Only one trial reported results for occurrence of severe skin rash (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>), revealing a higher rate with clopidogrel than aspirin, but this outcome occurred much less frequently (<LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Diarrhoea</HEADING>
<P>Five trials (25,595 patients, 95% of the total) reported results for diarrhoea. Allocation to a thienopyridine was associated with an excess of diarrhoea, but there was substantial heterogeneity between the results for the different trials (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>). This heterogeneity appeared to be accounted for by differences between ticlopidine and clopidogrel in their effects on diarrhoea. Subgroup analyses found that, compared with aspirin, ticlopidine produced about a twofold excess of diarrhoea (332/3196 (10.4%) versus 160/3214 (5%); OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.89 to 2.77, excess of about 50 patients per 1000 treated for about two years with ticlopidine versus aspirin), while clopidogrel produced about a one-third excess (428/9599 (4.5%) versus 322/9586 (3.4%); OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55, excess of about 10 patients per 1000 treated for about two years with clopidogrel versus aspirin) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.19" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.19</LINK>). Data from the <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK> trial also revealed a trend towards a higher rate of severe diarrhoea with clopidogrel, compared with aspirin, but this outcome occurred much less frequently (<LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>).</P>

The odds reduction is very similar to the result for this outcome for all high vascular risk patients (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>) but the higher overall risk of stroke in this subgroup of patients means that the absolute reduction in stroke is about twice as large, albeit estimated with substantial uncertainty with a wide confidence interval.</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:35:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>This review summarises the available data from the 10 published randomised trials of a thienopyridine versus aspirin in patients at high risk of vascular events. Although data were incomplete for some of the outcome events, they were available for all outcomes of interest from the largest trial, contributing 71% of the patients randomised (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>), and for almost all of these outcomes for the second largest trial, contributing 11% of the patients randomised (<LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>). Data were available for most outcomes of interest from the third and fourth largest trials contributing 12% of the patients randomized (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>). However, information on the type of stroke was unavailable for both these trials and since the <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK> trial was undertaken in participants with previous MI it did not contribute to analyses in the subset of patients with recent TIA or ischaemic stroke. The remaining trials were small and contributed in total only 6% of the patients randomised so most of the data reflect the results of the four largest studies (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-STAMI" TYPE="STUDY">STAMI</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-TASS" TYPE="STUDY">TASS</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pooling the data from trials of clopidogrel and ticlopidine (the thienopyridines) versus aspirin increases the sample size and therefore the accuracy of the estimates. Similarly, combining the vascular outcome events into a composite outcome of stroke, MI or vascular death also increases the statistical power and it is this analysis which provides the most reliable (i.e. statistically robust) estimate of the effect of thienopyridines in high risk patients. This analysis reveals that the thienopyridines are just statistically significantly more effective than aspirin in preventing serious vascular events among high vascular risk patients, but the magnitude of the additional benefit is uncertain and could be negligible. The proportional odds (and risk) reduction was about 8%, but may be as low as 1% or as high as 15% (the 95% confidence limits). If the average absolute annual risk of a serious vascular event with aspirin therapy is about 6% per year (<LINK REF="STD-CAPRIE" TYPE="STUDY">CAPRIE</LINK>), our best estimate would be that substituting aspirin with a thienopyridine may reduce this rate to about 5.5% (92% of 6%), but could reduce it to anywhere between 5.1% (85% of 6%) and 5.9% (99% of 6%). This corresponds to an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of about 0.5%, ranging between 0.1% and 0.9%, and means that treating 1000 patients with thienopyridines may prevent between one and nine extra events each year compared with aspirin. The number of high vascular risk patients who would need to be treated with a thienopyridine to prevent one event per year, compared with aspirin, may therefore vary from 100 to 900.</P>
<P>In high vascular risk patients, the proportional effect of the thienopyridines, compared with aspirin, on each of the separate outcomes of stroke, MI and vascular death was similar to the effect on the primary outcome of serious vascular events (i.e. about 10% odds reduction). The reduction in stroke seems to be mainly due to a reduction in ischaemic stroke, since the thienopyridines were associated with a 11% reduction in the odds of ischaemic stroke and had no clear effect on haemorrhagic stroke compared with aspirin.</P>
<P>Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of subgroup analyses (e.g. in TIA/ischaemic stroke patients), particularly when the overall magnitude of the treatment effect (in all high vascular risk patients) is substantially uncertain. However, among patients with previous TIA/ischaemic stroke, the proportional reduction in the odds of the primary outcome of serious vascular events (and of each of the separate outcomes of stroke, MI and vascular death) associated with the thienopyridines was similar to that in all high risk patients.</P>
<P>Most of the trials included in this review included mainly white patients, although not all gave specific details of the ethnicity or ethnicities of the participants. One trial specifically included Black African-Americans only (<LINK REF="STD-AAASPS" TYPE="STUDY">AAASPS</LINK>). Interestingly, in this trial there was a non-significant trend towards aspirin being more effective than ticlopidine for the primary outcome of vascular events as well as for its separate components. However, while it is possible that black and white patients respond differently to different antiplatelet drugs, perhaps because of their different distributions of ischaemic stroke subtypes, it is important to note that there was no statistically significant heterogeneity between the seven trials contributing data to the primary outcome, so that any apparent differences between trials (and between ethnic groups) may well have arisen due to chance alone.</P>
<P>In terms of adverse effects, the results of this review show that aspirin is associated with a greater risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and upper gastrointestinal adverse effects. It is worth bearing in mind that the most common dose of aspirin used in the trials included in this review was 325 mg daily. The lower doses of 75 to 150 mg daily that are generally in widespread use for prevention of vascular events in high risk patients nowadays may compare more favourably with clopidogrel with respect to gastrointestinal adverse effects. On the other hand, the thienopyridines are associated with a greater risk of skin rash and diarrhoea (ticlopidine more so than clopidogrel) and ticlopidine is associated with an excess of neutropenia while clopidogrel appears not to be. Observational studies have found ticlopidine to be associated with a significant excess both of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moloney-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moloney 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhubl-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhubl 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Torok-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Torok 1995</LINK>), and have shown clopidogrel to be associated with a very small (but not negligible) risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (<LINK REF="REF-Zakarija-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zakarija 2004</LINK>). The data from these observational studies, as well as from our review, and from short-term direct randomised comparisons between clopidogrel and ticlopidine, both in the presence of aspirin, among patients undergoing coronary stenting procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Bertrand-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bertrand 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-M_x00fc_ller-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mller 2000</LINK>), show that clopidogrel and ticlopidine have similar efficacy but clopidogrel has a more favourable safety and tolerability profile,</P>
<P>For every 1000 patients treated for about two years with either clopidogrel or aspirin, aspirin causes around seven more patients to have a gastrointestinal haemorrhage (two severe) and around 20 more to have upper gastrointestinal symptoms, while clopidogrel causes around 15 more patients to have a skin rash and around 10 more to have diarrhoea. It is difficult to compare these different outcomes directly, but these data would suggest that the two drugs have approximately similar safety and tolerability.</P>
<P>Clopidogrel is substantially more expensive than aspirin (460 versus 2 per patient per year) (<LINK REF="REF-BNF-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">BNF 2008</LINK>). Since it is not clearly more effective than aspirin, it should generally only be used as monotherapy in patients who are genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin. Furthermore, in patients developing upper gastrointestinal adverse effects with aspirin, the addition of a proton pump inhibitor to aspirin is both safer and cheaper than switching to clopidogrel (<LINK REF="REF-Chan-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Chan 2005</LINK>). Proton pump inibitors reduce the risk of upper gastrointestinal peptic ulcer bleeding for patients taking either aspirin or clopidogrel (<LINK REF="REF-Lanas-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lanas 2007</LINK>), but there are concerns about the effectiveness of clopidogrel given together with a proton pump inhibitor because these drugs are thought to inhibit the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel, and a large observational study has suggested that this may adversely affect clinical outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Ho-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ho 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The combination of clopidogrel with aspirin has now been demonstrated in randomised trials to be of net benefit compared with aspirin alone in the early months after an acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention (<LINK REF="REF-Sabatine-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sabatine 2005</LINK>). But, in patients with a prior ischaemic stroke or TIA the combination increased the risk of haemorrhage without increasing net benefit compared with cloidogrel alone (<LINK REF="REF-MATCH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MATCH 2004</LINK>), and in high vascular risk patients with a prior ischaemic stroke or TIA, peripheral arterial disease, stable coronary artery disease or vascular risk factors the combination was not superior to aspirin alone (<LINK REF="REF-CHARISMA-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">CHARISMA 2006</LINK>). However, there were promising results for the combination from the subgroup of patients randomised within a week of onset of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack in the MATCH trial of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus clopidogrel alone (<LINK REF="REF-MATCH-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">MATCH 2004</LINK>), from a small randomised pilot trial of clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone started within 24 hours of minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (<LINK REF="REF-FASTER" TYPE="REFERENCE">FASTER</LINK>), and from a randomised trial showing that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced transcranial Doppler ultrasound signals (thought to represent asymptomatic emboli) in patients with severe carotid stenosis (<LINK REF="REF-CARESS" TYPE="REFERENCE">CARESS</LINK>). Together these suggest that the combination may be beneficial very early after ischaemic stroke or TIA when the recurrence risk is particularly high.</P>
<P>Newer thienopyridine derivatives are now becoming available that may improve on the benefits of clopidogrel by producing a more consistent antiplatelet effect. Recent randomised trials have shown superiority of the combination of the new thienopyridine drug, prasugrel, plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes, although at the expense of a higher haemorrage risk (<LINK REF="REF-TRITON_x002d_TIMI-38-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">TRITON-TIMI 38 2007</LINK>). However, there are no direct randomised comparisons of any thienopyridine other than ticlopidine or clopidogrel with aspirin, and no current evidence base to support the use of prasugrel as antiplatelet monotherapy.</P>
<P>Current guidelines for prevention of further vascular events after ischaemic stroke or TIA suggest that the combination of aspirin with modifed release dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily is the antiplatelet regimen of choice, based on the results of two randomised trials comparing these two regimens in a total of about 6000 patients (<LINK REF="REF-ESPRIT" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESPRIT</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ESPS_x002d_2" TYPE="REFERENCE">ESPS-2</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-Guidelines" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE Guidelines</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCP-Guidelines" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCP Guidelines</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-SIGN-Guidelines" TYPE="REFERENCE">SIGN Guidelines</LINK>). However, a subsequent large trial in about 20,000 patients with a prior ischaemic stroke or TIA compared this combination with clopidogrel alone and found no difference in effects on vascular events (<LINK REF="REF-PRoFESS" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRoFESS</LINK>). When the available data from randomised trials of all three relevant comparisons (aspirin versus clopidogrel, aspirin versus aspirin plus modified release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel versus aspoirin plus modified release dipyridamole) were considered together in a network meta-analysis (<LINK REF="REF-PRoFESS-Editorial" TYPE="REFERENCE">PRoFESS Editorial</LINK>), there were no overall significant differences, suggesting that there is still no antiplatelet regimen that is clearly superior to aspirin alone in long-term prevention in high vascular risk patients.</P>
<P>Finally, there remains the question of what to do about antiplatelet treatment when high vascular risk patients have further events while taking aspirin alone. This will to some extent be determined by the ASCET study, in which 1000 patients with documented coronary heart disease will be randomised to either continued treatment with aspirin 160 mg daily or change to clopidogrel 75 mg daily and followed for two years after initial determination of their platelet reactivity while on aspirin treatment (<LINK REF="STD-ASCET" TYPE="STUDY">ASCET</LINK>). However, further large trials addressing this question will be needed to generate reliable answers.</P>
<P>A further randomised trial, in which around 1000 patients with heart failure (mainly due to ischaemic heart disease) were randomised between aspirin and clopidogrel and followed for about two years, was published after the searches for the current version of this review had been completed (<LINK REF="STD-WATCH" TYPE="STUDY">WATCH</LINK>). It found no significant differences in the effects of the two antiplatelet drugs on the trial's stated primary outcome of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke (hazard ratio clopidogrel versus aspirin 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.40), on any of the separate components of this primary outcome, or on intracranial or extracranial haemorrhages. From these results, it seems very unlikely that the formal inclusion of this trial in our systematic review would materially alter the results or conclusions.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:36:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The role of thienopyridines in clinical practice should be determined by the proportional reduction in risk of serious vascular events compared with alternative antiplatelet drugs, the absolute benefit they confer, their cost, and safety. Thienopyridines are at least as effective as aspirin and possibly somewhat more so. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel appear to be very similar in terms of efficacy and safety, except that ticlopidine is associated with more skin rash and diarrhoea as well as a risk of bone marrow suppression and thrombotic throbocytopenic pupura, making clopidogrel the thienopyridine of choice on safety and tolerability grounds. However, since clopidogrel is substantially more expensive than aspirin and the magnitude of any additional benefit ove aspirin is uncertain, it should generally only be used as monotherapy in patients who are genuinely intolerant of or allergic to aspirin.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-07-17 13:36:40 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Future large trials are needed to address two important, unresolved issues.</P>
<P>1. What clinicians should do about antiplatelet treatment when high vascular risk patients have further vascular events while taking aspirin alone. It remains unclear whether increasing the daily dose of aspirin, substituting aspirin with an alternative antiplatelet drug (eg. a theinopyridine such as clopidogrel) or adding another antiplatelet drug to aspirin are of net benefit in this situation.</P>
<P>2. Whether combining a thienopyridine derivative, such as clopidogrel, with aspirin is safe and more effective than either alone in the early very high risk period after acute ischaemic stroke or TIA when the recurrence risk is particularly high and the benefits may outweigh the risks. Despite this being a potentially promising strategy, at present there is no clear evidence to support the use of the combination in such patients.</P>
