<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-09-29 13:15:39 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. For this reason, women are encouraged to try and prevent malaria infection during pregnancy by sleeping under mosquito bed-nets, and by taking drugs effective against malaria throughout pregnancy as chemoprevention.</P>
<P>This Cochrane Review looked at all drug regimens compared to placebo. The review authors sought to summarise and quantify the overall effects of chemoprevention. Seventeen trials were included, all conducted between 1957 and 2008, and all but two in countries of Africa.</P>
<P>For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention prevents moderate to severe anaemia (<I>high quality evidence</I>); and prevents malaria parasites being detected in the blood (<I>high quality evidence</I>). It may also prevent malaria illness. We don't know if it prevents maternal deaths, as this would require very large studies to detect an effect.</P>
<P>In their infants, malaria chemoprevention improves the average birthweight (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and reduces the number of low birthweight infants (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>). We are not sure if chemoprevention reduces mortality of babies in the first week, month and year, as again studies would need to be very large to show these effects.</P>

<P>Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and third trimesters.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive regimens for <I>Plasmodium vivax.</I>
</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2014-09-29 13:41:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and reference lists up to 1 June 2014.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2014-09-29 13:15:25 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality, severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice, three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.</P>
<P>For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials,, 3662 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (<I>low quality evidence</I>). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (<I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials, 2830 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.</P>
<P>In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, <I>high quality evidence</I>)but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.</P>
<P>In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (defined by authors, but at least &lt; 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, <I>low quality evidence), </I>but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes. </P>
<P>In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.</P>
<P>A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against <I>P. vivax </I>showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants).</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-10-03 12:19:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:26:43 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Approximately 125 million women living in malaria-endemic areas become pregnant each year (<LINK REF="REF-Dellicour-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dellicour 2010</LINK>), and pregnancy is known to increase the risk of malaria infection and the severity of the illness compared to non-pregnant women in the same age group (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2007</LINK>). Studies have also shown a strong association between malaria infection in pregnancy and consequent maternal anaemia, and low birthweight in infants, particularly in women in their first or second pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Desai-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desai 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steketee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steketee 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>To reduce the burden and consequences of malaria in pregnancy, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas: i) sleep under a long lasting insecticide-treated bednet (ITN; <LINK REF="REF-Gamble-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gamble 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-WHO-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2012</LINK>); ii) are treated when anaemic or when ill with malaria; and iii) receive some form of malaria chemoprevention. Currently the WHO recommends 'intermittent-preventive therapy' with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during the second and third trimesters in Africa (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2013</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>Over the years a variety of drugs have been evaluated for malaria chemoprevention in pregnancy, including amodiaquine, chloroquine, dapsone-pyrimethamine, mefloquine, proguanil, pyrimethamine as monotherapy and as the fixed dose combination SP, and others. All have specific toxic and adverse effects, which are outlined in standard texts (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 2010</LINK>), and these may be important factors influencing maternal adherence. For example, proguanil can cause mouth ulcers, chloroquine can cause itch, and mefloquine can cause dizziness and headaches.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2014-10-03 12:19:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Chemoprevention encompasses malaria chemoprophylaxis, and also the use of treatment courses given regularly to women. This is termed intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), defined as a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine given to pregnant women at routine prenatal visits, regardless of whether the recipient is infected with malaria. combines elements of a treatment effect through clearance or suppression of existing malaria infections in the placental and peripheral blood of mother, and a post-treatment prophylactic effect by preventing new infections for several weeks after each dose (<LINK REF="REF-White-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">White 2005</LINK>). Daily, weekly, or bi-weekly malaria chemoprophylaxis is thought to work primarily through the prevention of new malaria infections. However, a reduction in malaria infections per se may be insufficient to justify the use of chemoprevention for widespread use without subsequent benefits on clinically important outcomes in the mother and her baby. These may include a reduction in clinical malaria episodes, a reduced risk of anaemia, improved birthweight, or more substantive outcomes such as a reduction in severe maternal illness, or fewer deaths in the mother and infant (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The effects of malaria chemoprevention may differ between settings dependent on the local malaria epidemiology. In highly endemic areas with stable transmission, mothers may have partial immunity to malaria, and chronic subclinical placental infection are common leading to maternal anaemia and low birthweight, especially in primi- and secundigravidae. In contrast, where malaria transmission is low or unstable, the degree of life-long acquired and pregnancy-specific protective immunity may be lower and malaria infections are more likely to result in clinical episodes or severe illness, leading to low birthweight due to a preterm birth, foetal loss or maternal death.</P>
<P>Another potential effect modifier is HIV status. Many malaria-endemic areas, especially in east and southern Africa, also have a high prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women. Compared to HIV negative women, HIV positive women are more likely to carry malaria parasites in their blood, have higher parasite densities, and are more likely to have placental parasitaemia, anaemia, and malaria symptoms and deliver low birthweight babies (<LINK REF="REF-Nkhoma-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nkhoma 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nkhoma-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nkhoma 2012b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ter-Kuile-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Kuile 2004</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:35:56 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This Cochrane Review aims to address the following questions:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does chemoprevention reduce mortality and substantive outcomes in the mother and infant?</LI>
<LI>What is the potential reduction in the burden of malaria in pregnancy that can be achieved by successful malaria chemoprevention in pregnancy?</LI>
<LI>Are the effects consistent in low parity and high parity women?</LI>
</OL>
<P>This review summarises the underpinning evidence of the protective efficacy achieved with antimalarial chemoprevention regimens on the effects on malaria and its consequences on the mother and baby when compared against placebo or no chemoprevention (case-management strategies only). It does not compare different regimens. These were included in earlier editions of this Cochrane Review (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2006</LINK>); a more recent review has examined the effects of different IPT regimens in pregnant women (<LINK REF="REF-Kayentao-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayentao 2013</LINK>).</P>

<P>We applied inclusion criteria to all trials, including those in the previous edition of this Cochrane Review. DR-P and PG independently screened all trials identified by the search strategy (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>). Using a form based on the inclusion criteria, DR-P and PG assessed eligibility independently. FK checked the completeness of the included trials. We retrieved full text articles for all potentially relevant trials, applied the inclusion criteria, and then compared decisions. We resolved any differences by discussion and, when necessary, consulted with co-authors.Trials identified in the initial abstract screening which did not meet the inclusion criteria are listed in the '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>'.</P>

<P>DR-P and PG independently extracted data using a data extraction form. We extracted data on trial characteristics, including trial site, year, local malaria transmission and resistance, trial methods, participants, interventions, doses and outcomes and entered this data into <LINK REF="REF-Review-Manager-5.1" TYPE="REFERENCE">Review Manager 5.1</LINK>. The number of participants randomized and the number analysed in the experimental and control arms were extracted in each group for each outcome. For dichotomous outcomes, we recorded the number of participants experiencing the event and the number assessed in each treatment group. For continuous outcomes, we extracted the arithmetic means, standard deviations for each treatment group and the number of participants assessed in each group. We calculated and reported the loss to follow-up in each group.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>We independently assessed the trials' methodological quality (risk of bias) of each trial, using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following six components were assessed for each trial: generation of allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding (of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors), incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Each component was classified by 'yes' (low risk of bias), 'no' (high risk of bias), or 'unclear' to indicate level of bias. Where our judgement was 'unclear', we attempted to contact the trial authors for clarification.</P>
</QUALITY_ASSESSMENT>
<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>We used the risk ratio (RR) to summarise dichotomous outcomes, reported the mean difference for continuous outcomes, and used the rate ratio for count outcomes. We presented all measures of effect with 95% confidence intervals (CI). One trial had four arms: one a comparison of IPT with nets, and a second comparison with no nets, and these were treated as separate comparisons (<LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2003i-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2003i KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2003ii-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2003ii KEN</LINK>); a second trial had two intervention comparisons, so in meta-analysis we split the control group in half for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we split the denominator of the control in half, but applied no correction to the standard deviation.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2014-09-29 16:01:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>If the original trial analyses had not adjusted for clustering, we planned to adjust the results for clustering by multiplying the standard errors of the treatment effect by the square root of the design effect. The design effect would be calculated as 1+(m-1)*ICC where m was the average cluster size and ICC was the intra-cluster correlation coefficient. We planned to estimate the ICC from other trials included in the review or by contacting trial investigators. We also planned to include trials with multiple treatment arms if relevant to any of the comparisons. One trial randomized by compound in The Gambia (<LINK REF="STD-Greenwood-1989-GMB" TYPE="STUDY">Greenwood 1989 GMB</LINK>). However, we know that compounds are quite small, are grouped around families, and that, even if two women were pregnant at the same time in one family, this would not be quantitatively important in terms of overestimating the precision of the effect estimate.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>We planned to use intention-to-treat (ITT) data from the original trials, but it was more practical to use a complete-case analysis, such that we excluded participants for whom no outcome was reported from the analysis. This analysis assumes that the participants for whom an outcome is available are representative of the original randomized patients. If data from the trial reports were insufficient, unclear, or missing, we attempted to contact the trial authors for additional information. In one trial with no standard deviation for birthweight, we used the average of the standard deviation for the other included trials.</P>

<P>Seventeen chemoprevention trials, enrolling 20,256 pregnant women, met our inclusion criteria (see '<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>'). These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and Thailand (two trials).</P>
<P>Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo or no preventive intervention (ie passive case detection and treatment of clinical cases only); chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), SP (given twice, monthly or intermittently for up to four doses at least one month apart), and mefloquine (weekly) (see <LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>). Fifteen trials reported that drug administration was supervised, and in two trials it was unsupervised (<LINK REF="STD-Fleming-1986-NGA" TYPE="STUDY">Fleming 1986 NGA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2000-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2000 UGA</LINK>).</P>
<P>Eight trials recruited women in all parity groups; four reported aggregate results, and four disaggregated by parity. The rest only recruited low parity women: six were parity 0, and two were women of parity 0-1. One trial only recruited multigravidae (see <LINK REF="APP-03" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In four trials, all women in both intervention and control groups received a long-lasting ITNs at recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Menendez-2008-MOZ" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 2008 MOZ</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2000-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2000 UGA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2011-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2011 UGA</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2003i-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2003i KEN</LINK>).

<P>
<B>Maternal outcomes </B>(see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>)</P>
<P>Only 15 maternal deaths were reported across all trials with no difference between groups (three trials, 2097 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <I>very low quality evidence</I>). Maternal death, even in these settings, is a relatively rare event occurring in less than five women per 1000 pregnancies. Consequently trials would need to enrol over 125,000 women to be adequately powered to detect or exclude effects as large as a 25% relative reduction (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trials reported on episodes of severe malaria, but three trials reported moderate to severe anaemia (defined as Hb &lt; 7/8 g/dL or PCV &lt; 21%). Overall, chemoprevention was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of moderate to severe anaemia in the third trimester (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <I>high quality evidence</I>). This effect was consistent despite variation in doses, and differences in the definition and timing of assessment for severe anaemia (I<SUP>2</SUP> =0); <LINK REF="STD-Parise-1998ii-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Parise 1998ii KEN</LINK> recorded severe anaemia at delivery (after three doses of SP); <LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1999-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1999 KEN</LINK> at 34 weeks (after three doses of SP); <LINK REF="STD-Menendez-2008-MOZ" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 2008 MOZ</LINK> at delivery (after two doses of SP), and <LINK REF="STD-Parise-1998i-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Parise 1998i KEN</LINK> at the beginning of the third trimester clinic visit (when the second dose of SP was due, and these women had only had one SP dose).</P>
<P>Chemoprevention was also associated with a reduction in the risk of any anaemia (defined as Hb &lt; 10/11/12 g/dL or PCV &lt; 33%/30%), although this reduction was generally of smaller magnitude (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials, 3662 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <I>high quality evidence</I>). In addition, measures of mean haemoglobin in the third trimester were higher in those receiving chemoprevention (MD 0.41 g/dL, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.54; five trials, 3363 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Chemoprevention was associated with fewer episodes of presumed clinical malaria (history of fever), but this outcome was only reported in two small trials (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; two trials, 307 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>). Instead most trials reported antenatal parasitaemia, defined as either parasitaemia at delivery or parasitaemia at 34 to 36 weeks, with most trials showing benefits but wide variation in the size of the reduction (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; eight trials, 3663 participants, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 82; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <I>high quality evidence</I>) This heterogeneity is probably not unexpected given the differences in chemoprevention regimens and malaria endemicity.</P>
<P>
<B>Infant outcomes </B>(see <LINK REF="SOF-02" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 2</LINK>).</P>
<P>The trials and the meta-analyses are underpowered to confidently detect or exclude effects on spontaneous abortion, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths (see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>). The CIs range from important benefits to no evidence of any harm in four outcomes: spontaneous abortions (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.02; five trials, 2876 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>); perinatal deaths (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; two trials, 1620 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>); neonatal deaths (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.05; two trials, 2156 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>).

<P>Chemoprevention was associated with fewer low birthweight infants (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87; eight trials, 3619 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). and mean birthweight was higher with chemoprevention (MD 92.72 g, 95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>One very small trial reported no difference in the prevalence of cord blood anaemia (64 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>), and a lower cord blood haemoglobin in babies born to women receiving chemoprevention (MD -1.80 g/dL, 95% CI -3.46 to -0.14; one trial, 64 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>, <I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>

<P>Four trials provided data on multigravidae women.

<P>No trials reported episodes of severe malaria, but two reported severe anaemia. In one trial more women had severe anaemia in the chemoprevention group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.57; one trial, 1954 participants), and the second trial had few events and consequently very wide CIs (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.09; one trial, 728 participants). The 95% CIs of the overall meta-analysis does not exclude effects as large as those seen in women in their first or second pregnancy but this is probably unlikely (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.25; two trials, 2682 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trials reported the risk of mild anaemia, but two trials reported mean haemoglobin at delivery without clinically important differences between groups (MD 0.01 g/dL, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.24; two trials, 676 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>No trial measured malaria or febrile episodes in the mother.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Chemoprevention for all women</HEADING>
<P>To evaluate the population effects of a policy of chemoprevention for all pregnant women, regardless of parity, this third analysis includes all trials which recruited women of any parity. Some of these presented results stratified by parity and were included in the analyses above, but a few additional trials did not provide their outcome data stratified by parity.</P>
<P>
<B>Maternal outcomes </B>(see <LINK REF="SOF-05" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 5</LINK>).</P>
<P>For maternal mortality, only nine maternal deaths were recorded in trials recruiting women of all parities; 4/3019 with chemoprevention and 5/3007 without (four trials, 6026 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For severe anaemia in the mother, there were very few events recorded in the two trials but the risk was lower with chemoprevention (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two trials, 1327 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>). For any anaemia, no population differences were demonstrated (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; three trials, 3027 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). Three trials reported mean haemoglobin, with only one very small trial from the early 1990s finding benefit with chemoprevention (three trials, 2223 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Clinical malaria (or history of fever) was reported in four of the trials across all parity groups. The older, and smaller trials, suggested a population benefit on clinical malaria but this was not seen in the two recent and much larger trials using two doses of SP (four trials, 3455 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For parasitaemia at delivery, there was considerable heterogeneity between trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 79%). Of the two most recent trials, both large, and both administering two doses of SP, one trial from Mozambique demonstrated a benefit with chemoprevention and one from Uganda did not (five trials, 3961 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>
<B>Infant outcomes </B>(see <LINK REF="SOF-06" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 6</LINK>).</P>
<P>In trials recruiting women of all parities, no differences were demonstrated for spontaneous abortions (three trials, 5767 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>), stillbirths (five trials, 7130 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), perinatal deaths (four trials, 5216 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), or neonatal and infant deaths (five trials, 6313 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>). We also pooled across all trials for these outcomes (including those which only recruited women in their first or second pregnancies), and no differences were demonstrated.</P>
<P>Population benefits for the infants were not demonstrated for pre-term birth (two trials, 1174 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.13" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.13</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>), low birthweight (four trials, 3644 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.14" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.14</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>), or mean birthweight (five trials, 6007 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.15" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.15</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>The effects of chemoprevention on placental parasitaemia were mixed (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 94%), with large effects in two older trials administering monthly pyrimethamine or weekly chloroquine, and no effect demonstrated in the two more recent trials administering two doses of SP (four trials, 3200 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.18" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.18</LINK>, <I>low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>One trial in Mozambique found a large effect in reducing the risk of cord blood anaemia (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.80; one trial, 870 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.16" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.16</LINK>), and increase in mean cord PCV (MD 1.01%, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.97; one trial, 990 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-001.17" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.17</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Adverse effects</HEADING>
<P>We aggregated adverse effects across all parity groups. Reporting of adverse effects was generally poor. Only five trials specifically stated that no adverse effects attributable to the drugs were observed in the mothers, and the rest either did not report adverse effects or the information was unclear. Four trials reported adverse events following SP (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>), and one trial following mefloquine (<LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). No differences were seen between the treatment and control groups.</P>
<P>Again, reporting of adverse events in the neonate was generally poor. Episodes of neonatal kernicterus were reported in two trials, and congenital anomalies in two trials, with no differences detected (<LINK REF="CMP-001.20" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.20</LINK>).</P>

<P>The above analysis examines the effects of drugs known to be effective in preventing malaria at the particular time the trials were carried out. As the WHO currently recommends intermittent dosing with SP, we performed an additional analysis to provide the effect estimates for SP compared to no drug or placebo. The analysis is exactly the same as comparison one, but we included only the six SP trials. These trials administered SP in two doses (<LINK REF="STD-Parise-1998i-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Parise 1998i KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2003i-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2003i KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Njagi-2003ii-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Njagi 2003ii KEN</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Challis-2004-MOZ" TYPE="STUDY">Challis 2004 MOZ</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Menendez-2008-MOZ" TYPE="STUDY">Menendez 2008 MOZ</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ndyomugyenyi-2011-UGA" TYPE="STUDY">Ndyomugyenyi 2011 UGA</LINK>), three doses (<LINK REF="STD-Shulman-1999-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Shulman 1999 KEN</LINK>), or monthly (<LINK REF="STD-Parise-1998ii-KEN" TYPE="STUDY">Parise 1998ii KEN</LINK>).</P>

<P>For maternal death, no effect was demonstrated but the analysis is underpowered (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>For women of low parity, restricting the analysis to trials of SP did not substantially change the estimates of benefit on severe anaemia (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>, <I>high quality evidence</I>), mild anaemia (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.96; three trials, 3219 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.3</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>), or mean haemoglobin (MD 0.41 g higher, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.54; three trials, 2995 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Similarly, the reduction in antenatal parasitaemia is consistent with the overall effect from trials of any chemoprevention (RR 0.38, 95% 0.24 to 0.59; four trials, 2832 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>, <I>high quality evidence</I>), but there is insufficient data to draw conclusions on clinical malaria (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.12; one trial, 174 participants, <I>very low quality evidence</I> (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>).</P>

<P>Overall, chemoprevention with SP reduced the incidence of low birthweight but this effect seems to be reducing over time, with large effects in the older trials and no effect seen in the more recent trials using two doses of SP (four trials, 3043 participants, <LINK REF="CMP-002.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.12</LINK>, <I>moderate quality evidence</I>).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-09-29 13:57:29 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>We included 17 trials, enrolling 14,481 pregnant women, in this Cochrane Review.</P>
<P>For women in their first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate to severe anaemia by around 40% (<I>high quality evidence</I>), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17% (<I>high quality evidence</I>). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by around 61% (<I>high quality evidence</I>), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (<I>low quality evidence</I>). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (<I>very low quality evidence</I>).</P>
<P>For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (<I>moderate quality evidence</I>), and reduces placental parasitaemia by around 46% (<I>high quality evidence</I>). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.</P>
<P>In multigravid women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (<I>high quality evidence</I>) but there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.</P>
<P>In trials giving chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia (<I>low quality evidence), </I>but consistent benefits have not been shown for other outcomes. </P>
<P>In an analysis confined only to intermittent preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the evidence were similar.</P>
<P>A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis against vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.20; 942 participants).</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>Trials were almost exclusively from Africa and published between 1964 and 2011. These trials, from a variety of settings and using varied chemoprevention regimens, found fairly consistent clinically important benefits for low parity women and their infants.</P>
<P>However, it is possible that with the introduction of ACTs, declining malaria transmission in some areas of Africa, and increasing quality of antenatal services, that the attributable fraction of malaria towards maternal anaemia and low birthweight has been reduced and the large effects seen in these trials may be attenuated by less malaria and better individualized care of women during pregnancy.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-09-18 17:23:31 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="PAUL A GARNER">
<P>The evidence for effects on maternal, foetal and neonatal mortality is generally considered of low or very low quality because the trials and the meta-analysis remain significantly underpowered to confidently prove or exclude clinically important effects.</P>
<P>For women of low parity, we considered the evidence of clinically important effects on anaemia and antenatal parasitaemia to be of high quality, meaning we can have confidence in these results. For the infants of women of low parity, we considered the effects on birthweight to only be of moderate quality because of the high risk of bias of most of the older trials. This means we can have only moderate confidence in the magnitude of these effects.</P>
<P>Trials did not describe the routine health services available to detect and treat malaria infection in both intervention and control arms, but many trials were done some years ago in areas with very basic curative health services available. However, in the future with declining levels of malaria the individual management of illness and malaria at clinic may become an important option to control malaria in pregnancy.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-09-29 15:59:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anne-Marie Stephani">
<P>It seems unlikely that we have missed any trials. As trials did not systematically document adverse effects, it is likely that these have been underestimated in this review.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:36:24 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The findings of this Cochrane Review are consistent with previous editions (<LINK REF="REF-Garner-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garner 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ter-Kuile-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Kuile 2007</LINK>). The findings are also consistent with the findings of a review comparing observational and randomized evidence (<LINK REF="REF-McClure-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2013</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-McClure-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClure 2013</LINK> points out that the fairly modest effects seen in RCTs, where delivery of care is often strengthened and adherence assured, were attenuated in the observational studies where, the authors surmise, delivery of the intervention and adherence to it may be attenuated. However, this contrasts with a study estimating the effects of IPT with SP on low birthweight and neonatal mortality from survey data: the trial estimates are remarkably similar to the results observed with IPT with SP from the trial data reported in this and previous analysis (<LINK REF="REF-Eisele-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisele 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-ter-Kuile-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">ter Kuile 2007</LINK>).</P>

<P>Routine chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in the mother, and on birthweight in infants.</P>
<P>The data also assists in showing the potential attribution of malaria towards key endpoints, and what can be achieved by successful prevention to assist in modelling studies examining the impact of malaria on pregnancy.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-10-03 09:36:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Identifying current effective chemoprevention regimens remains a challenge, especially with the spread of drug-resistant malaria, in particular against SP which is the only antimalarial currently recommended for IPT in pregnant women. There is justification for assessing the safety and efficacy of effects of alternative drugs that can replace SP in areas with high SP resistance, or alternative strategies that could replace IPT during pregnancy, such as intermittent screen and treat (IST) approaches that focus on prompt accessible treatment for anaemia and asymptomatic parasitaemia (<LINK REF="STD-Tagbor-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Tagbor 2010</LINK>).</P>
<P>All new trials should systematically and carefully collect adverse effects of regimens.</P>
<P>The data on the longer term impact on infants is poor and needs further study: currently the evidence mainly relates to effects on clinically important outcomes, such as preterm birth and birthweight.</P>
<P>There is a dearth of data from endemic areas outside of Africa, such as Asia and Latin America.</P>

<P>The study is a part of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, village-randomized malaria transmission-reduction trial, comparing the efficacy of a single dose of artesunate and SP against placebo. However, target group is the general population (14,017 villagers). Women who were "thought that they might be pregnant", were advised not to take the study drugs. Some of them unknowingly took the drugs and their outcomes are reported. There is no specific method of randomization of the pregnant women who "accidentally" took the drugs, to ensure similarity of the groups. Also, distribution is uneven: N = 287 in the intervention group versus N =40 in the control group.</P>

<P>
<SUP>1</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for risk of bias: Only one of these trials adequately described allocation concealment to be considered at low risk of selection bias.<BR/>
<SUP>2</SUP> Downgraded by 2 for imprecision: These trials were not adequately powered to detect a difference in mortality. Only 15 deaths occurred in these three trials.To confidently detect a 25% reduction in maternal mortality in a setting of 350 deaths/100,000 would require a sample size of over 100,000.<BR/>
<SUP>3</SUP> No serious risk of bias: Exclusion of the trials at high risk of bias did not change the statistical significance or clinical importance of the result.<BR/>
<SUP>4</SUP> No serious inconsistency: This finding was consistent across all trials and statistical heterogeneity was low.<BR/>
<SUP>5</SUP> No serious indirectness: These trials were conducted in Kenya and Mozambique between 1996 and 2005, all three trials administered IPT with SP. The definition of severe anaemia was variable; Hb &lt; 8 g/dL, Hb &lt; 7 g/dL, or PCV &lt; 21%.<BR/>
<SUP>6</SUP> No serious imprecision: This result is statistically significant and the meta-analysis is adequately powered to detect this effect.<BR/>
<SUP>7</SUP> No serious inconsistency: Although statistical heterogeneity was high, all trials favoured chemoprevention but there was variability in the size of the effect.<BR/>
<SUP>8</SUP> No serious indirectness: These trials were conducted in Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda between 1978 and 1999. Three trials administered IPT as SP, one gave weekly chloroquine, and one gave daily proguanil. The definition of anaemia was variable: Hb &lt; 12 g/dL, Hb &lt; 11 g/dL, Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, PCV &lt; 33% and PCV &lt; 30%.<BR/>
<SUP>9 </SUP>Downgraded by 1 for risk of bias. Both trials had high or unclear risk of selection bias and an attrition rate above 20%.<BR/>
<SUP>10</SUP> Downgraded by 1 for indirectness: Both these trials, from Cameroon 1993 and Mozambique 2002, measured fever history only as proxy for malaria illness.<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> Not downgraded for inconsistency. Despite substantive quantitative heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> 69% across six trials), all show at least a reduction of 23%, often more<BR/>
<SUP>11</SUP> No serious indirectness: These trials were conducted in The Gambia, Nigeria, Kenya and Mozambique between 1978 and 2005. Five trials gave IPT as SP, one gave pyrimethamine-dapsone, one pyrimethamine, and one proguanil.<BR/>
