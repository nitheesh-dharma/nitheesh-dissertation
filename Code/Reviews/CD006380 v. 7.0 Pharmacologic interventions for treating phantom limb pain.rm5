<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>People can experience pain in a missing body part, for example after limb amputation. This is known as phantom limb pain. Various medications have been tried as treatments for phantom limb pain. It is uncertain whether any of the following medications work: botulinum toxin A, opioids, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (e.g. ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan), anticonvulsants, antidepressants, calcitonin, and local anaesthetics. It is unclear whether these medications can help with pain, function, mood, sleep, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and safety (e.g. adverse events) in the short and long term.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>For this updated review, we repeated the search for relevant clinical trials in April 2016. We found one new trial, including 14 studies with a total of 269 participants. One small initial report showed that botulinum toxin A did not reduce phantom limb pain compared to lidocaine/methylprednisolone. Morphine, gabapentin, and ketamine provided short-term pain relief compared with placebo, but the findings were mostly based on small studies. The results for calcitonin (versus placebo; versus ketamine) and local anaesthetics (versus placebo) were variable. The trials were very different, which made it difficult to combine results for the different drugs. Most studies did not report sleep, depression or mood, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment, or the number of people who did not finish the study.</P>
<P>As they relied on a few small studies, results must be interpreted with caution. There was not enough information about long-term effectiveness and safety. Large, good-quality studies with longer follow-ups and outcomes that are important to patients are needed. Bigger and better studies will help us to make firmer conclusions on the best pain relief available for these patients.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:19:38 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2011. Phantom limb pain (PLP) is pain that arises in the missing limb after amputation and can be severe, intractable, and disabling. Various medications have been studied in the treatment of phantom pain. There is currently uncertainty in the optimal pharmacologic management of PLP.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:20:09 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review aimed to summarise the evidence of effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions in treating PLP.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:20:20 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and Embase for relevant studies. We ran the searches for the original review in September 2011 and subsequent searches for this update up to April 2016. We sought additional studies from clinical trials databases and reference lists of retrieved papers.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:21:33 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials studying the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions compared with placebo, another active treatment, or no treatment, in established PLP. We considered the following outcomes: change in pain intensity, function, sleep, depression or mood, quality of life, adverse events, treatment satisfaction, and withdrawals from the study.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:21:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We independently assessed issues of study quality and extracted efficacy and adverse event data. Due to the wide variability in the studies, we did not perform a meta-analysis for all the interventions and outcomes, but attempted to pool the results of some studies where possible. We prepared a qualitative description and narrative summary of results. We assessed clinical heterogeneity by making qualitative comparisons of the populations, interventions, outcomes/outcome measures, and methods.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 13:28:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>We added only one new study with 14 participants to this updated review. We included a 14 studies (10 with low risk of bias and 4 with unclear risk of bias overall) with a total of 269 participants. We added another drug class, botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), in particular botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A), to the group of medications reviewed previously. Our primary outcome was change in pain intensity. Most studies did not report our secondary outcomes of sleep, depression or mood, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, or withdrawals from the study.</P>
<P>BoNT/A did not improve phantom limb pain intensity during the six months of follow-up compared with lidocaine/methylprednisolone.</P>
<P>Compared with placebo, morphine (oral and intravenous) was effective in decreasing pain intensity in the short term with reported adverse events being constipation, sedation, tiredness, dizziness, sweating, voiding difficulty, vertigo, itching, and respiratory problems.</P>
<P>The N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists ketamine (versus placebo; versus calcitonin) and dextromethorphan (versus placebo), but not memantine, had analgesic effects. The adverse events of ketamine were more serious than placebo and calcitonin and included loss of consciousness, sedation, hallucinations, hearing and position impairment, and insobriety.</P>
<P>The results for gabapentin in terms of pain relief were conflicting, but combining the results favoured treatment group (gabapentin) over control group (placebo) (mean difference -1.16, 95% confidence interval -1.94 to -0.38; 2 studies). However, gabapentin did not improve function, depression score, or sleep quality. Adverse events experienced were somnolence, dizziness, headache, and nausea.</P>
<P>Compared with an active control benztropine mesylate, amitriptyline was not effective in PLP, with dry mouth and dizziness as the most frequent adverse events based on one study.</P>
<P>The findings for calcitonin (versus placebo; versus ketamine) and local anaesthetics (versus placebo) were variable. Adverse events of calcitonin were headache, vertigo, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and hot and cold flushes. Most of the studies were limited by their small sample sizes.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 13:30:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Since the last version of this review, we identified another study that added another form of medical therapy, BoNTs, specifically BoNT/A, to the list of pharmacologic interventions being reviewed for clinical efficacy in phantom limb pain. However, the results of this study did not substantially change the main conclusions. The short- and long-term effectiveness of BoNT/A, opioids, NMDA receptor antagonists, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, calcitonins, and local anaesthetics for clinically relevant outcomes including pain, function, mood, sleep, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, and adverse events remain unclear. Based on a small study, BoNT/A (versus lidocaine/methylprednisolone) does not decrease phantom limb pain. Morphine, gabapentin, and ketamine demonstrate favourable short-term analgesic efficacy compared with placebo. Memantine and amitriptyline may not be effective for PLP. However, results must be interpreted with caution, as they were based mostly on a small number of studies with limited sample sizes that varied considerably and also lacked long-term efficacy and safety outcomes. The direction of efficacy of calcitonin, local anaesthetics, and dextromethorphan needs further clarification. Overall, the efficacy evidence for the reviewed medications is thus far inconclusive. Larger and more rigorous randomised controlled trials are needed for us to reach more definitive conclusions about which medications would be useful for clinical practice.</P>

<P>Phantom limb pain is pain that is experienced in the missing limb and is a well-recognised phenomenon after amputation. It is a major cause of morbidity and has a profound impact on patients&#8217; well-being, activity, lifestyle, functioning, activity, employment, and quality of life (<LINK REF="REF-Darnall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Darnall 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Desmond-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Desmond 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ephraim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ephraim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Millstein-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Millstein 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nikolajsen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikolajsen 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Penn_x002d_Barwell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Penn-Barwell 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pezzin-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pezzin 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robbins-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robbins 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sin-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sin 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2011a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2011a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sinha-2011b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sinha 2011b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Whyte-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Whyte 2002</LINK>). Phantom limb pain is present in more than 70% of amputees (<LINK REF="REF-Burgoyne-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgoyne 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Clark-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ephraim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ephraim 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hanley-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanley 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Reiber-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Reiber 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2006</LINK>). About 92% of patients experience the onset of phantom pain within a week following amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2006</LINK>). In more than 65% of patients, it occurs within the first six months of amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Richardson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Richardson 2006</LINK>). Approximately 39% of patients report severe pain intensity, and 27% complain that it is "extremely bothersome" (<LINK REF="REF-Ephraim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ephraim 2005</LINK>). Phantom limb pain has been described as aching, cramping, burning, tingling, sharp, shooting, stabbing, mixed burning-tingling or burning-cramping (<LINK REF="REF-Clark-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Clark 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ehde-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ehde 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 1983</LINK>).††††††††</P>
<P>The aetiology and pathogenesis of phantom limb pain is complex and not well understood, although there is agreement that peripheral and central mechanisms are involved. A cascade of changes at several levels of the nervous system occur, from the transected afferent fibres that exhibit spontaneous and abnormal evoked activity to the heightened activity in spinal dorsal horn and then to more central relays in the thalamus and cortex. Processes such as central sensitisation, cortical reorganisation, neuroplasticity, and gray matter changes are implicated (<LINK REF="REF-Bolognini-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bolognini 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbert-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbert 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Giummarra-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giummarra 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Montoya-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montoya 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moseley-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moseley 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prei_x00df_ler-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Preiﬂler 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Woolf-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woolf 2011</LINK>). Phantom limb pain is often considered neuropathic pain because of the changes that involve the central and peripheral nervous systems.†</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-10-01 12:51:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Unfortunately, the optimal treatment for phantom limb pain is far from satisfactory and remains a challenge to this day, as the pathomechanism is still unclear.†The rationale for the use of various pharmacologic agents lies in the multifactorial theorised origins of phantom pain, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as the awareness of the affective, cognitive, and biologic triggers of phantom limb pain and chronic pain.† Pharmacologic interventions that have been studied in the treatment of phantom limb pain include beta-blockers, calcitonins, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anaesthetics, opioids, tramadol, analgesics, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, nerve blocks, synthetic cannabinoids, and botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs).</P>

<STUDY_SELECTION MODIFIED="2016-10-01 13:01:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Initially, we (MJA,TAH, MD) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all the articles identified by the literature search for relevance to the research question. From the titles and abstracts, we assessed if the study satisfied the inclusion criteria regarding the design, participants, diagnosis, and interventions. We then retrieved the full text of relevant titles and abstracts, and the non-English language articles were translated. Next, we independently performed a final selection of the studies to be included in the review using a predesigned study eligibility form.†We resolved any disagreements by discussion.†For clarifications and missing information, we contacted authors of the selected studies.</P>

<P>We (MJA, TAH) independently extracted the data from the studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria and quality standards. Data extraction included study name; design; sample size; study duration (including follow-up period); participant characteristics (demographic and clinical); intervention including dosage, route, and treatment duration; comparator or control interventions; short- and long-term outcome measures; secondary outcome measures; number of participants analysed and dropouts/withdrawals in the different treatment groups; and duration of follow-up. We extracted data onto a specially designed data extraction form. We resolved differences in data interpretation between review authors through discussion.</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2016-10-01 13:03:28 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We (MJA, TAH, MD) independently assessed risk of bias for each included study using the criteria outlined in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> with regard to random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding (performance bias and detection bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other types of biases (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>
<UL>
<LI>Random sequence generation (selection bias): We assessed the methods used to generate random sequence and graded the risk as follows: low (e.g. computer-generated random numbers, table of random numbers); unclear (method not clearly stated).</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment (selection bias): We assessed the methods used to implement the sequence. Proper allocation sequence concealment gives the assurance that treatments or interventions were allocated without knowing the intervention assignments ahead of time. We graded the risk as follows: low (e.g. use of a third party; use of consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes); unclear (method not clearly stated).</LI>
<LI>Blinding (performance bias and detection bias): We assessed the methods used in blinding the participants and evaluators from knowing which intervention was received. We graded the risk as follows: low (e.g. placebo not distinguishable from treatment in colour, dosage, smell, route; evaluators not the same as those who administered the intervention); unclear (method not clearly stated); high (e.g. no blinding; treatment and placebo are distinguishable in colour, dosage, smell, route; outcome assessors are the same as the treating physician or those who administered the intervention). We excluded studies that were not double-blind.</LI>
<LI>Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias): We assessed methods used in blinding evaluators in outcome assessment. We graded the risk as follows: low (e.g. described as blinded; evaluators not the same as those administering intervention); unclear (method not clearly described or stated); high (e.g. no blinding; outcome assessors are the same as the treating physician or those who administered intervention).</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias): We assessed the methods used to handle incomplete outcome data. We graded the risk as follows: low (e.g. all participants accounted for in the analysis; intention-to-treat analysis; less than 10% did not complete study); unclear (method not clearly stated; 'last observation carried forward' analysis); high (exclusion of participants, e.g. those who failed to follow up in the final analysis).</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting (reporting bias): We graded the risk as follows: low (results for outcomes intended to be assessed as per methods in the full article or publication are reported); unclear (missing outcomes; results not reported or described for outcomes intended to be assessed as per methods in the full article or publication).</LI>
<LI>Other types of biases (such as carry-over effect in cross-over design, baseline characteristics): For carry-over effect in cross-over design, we assessed studies as being at low risk when efforts were made to minimise carry-over effect (e.g. adequate wash-out period); or high risk (e.g. no wash-out period; baseline or starting clinical characteristics, such as pain intensity, are significantly different with each intervention); or unclear (strategies are not described).</LI>
<LI>Size of study (checking for possible biases confounded by small size): We assessed studies as being at low risk of bias (i.e. 200 participants or more per treatment arm); unclear risk of bias (50 to 199 participants per treatment arm); or high risk of bias (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm).</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2016-10-01 13:04:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We initially intended to analyse continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) in the outcome measures with standard deviations (SDs) to quantify the effects of the pharmacologic intervention (change in pain intensity, sleep, mood, depression, function, quality of life, satisfaction); and dichotomous outcomes using risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) for 50% pain relief. However, due to the extensive variation in the outcomes/outcome measures, analyses, follow-ups, study designs, interventions, and the reporting of results in the 14 studies included in the review, pooling of the results into a fully satisfactory meta-analysis was not possible. For some outcomes in a few studies, we combined results where possible.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2016-10-01 13:05:06 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We incurred a unit of analysis error for combining the results of some cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>), which we acknowledged in the <LINK TAG="DISCUSSION" TYPE="SECTION">Discussion</LINK>. For the mentioned studies, we considered all measurements from treatment (memantine) periods and all measurements from control periods and analysed as if the trial was a parallel-group study of treatment versus control. With this approach, the number of observations in the analysis did not correspond to the number of 'units' (participants) that were randomised. In these cross-over studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>), a participant underwent more than one intervention (treatment and control), and therefore there is not just one but two measurements for each outcome from each participant analysed. There was thus doubling of the sample size in the analysis. However, as the studies combined using this approach were underweighted, this unit of analysis error may be regarded as less serious than other types of unit of analysis error (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>).</P>

<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2016-10-01 13:05:42 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">

<P>We also initially intended to assess the amount of statistical heterogeneity among the studies by computing the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic. However, this was not possible for all studies and outcomes due to the differences in the methods as well as in the reporting and presenting of outcomes and results that could not be combined and analysed. We therefore assessed clinical heterogeneity by making qualitative comparisons in terms of the populations, interventions, outcomes/outcome measures, and methods.</P>

Fourteen participants with PLP or RLP, or both were randomised into two groups to receive either BoNT/A injections or lidocaine/methylprednisolone injections.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">2. Opioids</HEADING>
<P>Two cross-over studies investigated the effectiveness of morphine in treating phantom pain (<LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>). One compared oral morphine with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK>), and the other compared morphine infusion with lidocaine and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pain intensity (mean (SD)) on a 0-to-100 visual analogue scale (VAS) was significantly reduced during the oral morphine phase compared with the placebo phase (P = 0.036) at four weeks (3.26 (1.59) versus 3.99 (1.23)). About 42% (5) of participants experienced equal to or greater than 50% pain relief (considered responders in study) with morphine versus one participant in placebo (P &lt; 0.05) (<LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK>). Significantly lower pain intensity was also seen with intravenous morphine compared to placebo (P &lt; 0.01) in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>).†Furthermore, subjective, self reported percentage pain relief was significantly higher with morphine. The NNTB for 30% pain relief for morphine in this study was 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.7) (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>).</P>
<P>As for secondary outcomes, scores on self rating depression scale, West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory, and Brief Stress Scale were not significantly associated with pain reduction (<LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK>).

<P>Six studies investigated the effectiveness of NMDA receptor antagonists in established PLP: memantine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwenkreis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenkreis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>); dextromethorphan versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 2003</LINK>); ketamine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolajsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolajsen 1996</LINK>); and ketamine versus calcitonin, combination ketamine and calcitonin, and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pain intensity was not significantly decreased with 30 mg/day of memantine for three to four weeks in traumatic amputees with chronic pain (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Schwenkreis-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Schwenkreis 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>). Combining the results of two memantine studies for the outcome change in pain intensity showed a standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.24 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.79) (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>), which is an overall effect of no difference between treatment and control groups (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). In so doing, however, a unit of analysis error was incurred. The cross-over study was treated as though it was a parallel study by taking all measurements from memantine periods and all measurements from placebo periods and analysing these data as in a parallel study comparing memantine versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>In the dextromethorphan study, 4 participants on 120 mg dextromethorphan/day and 1 participant on 180 mg/day reported 50% pain relief compared with placebo (P = 0.01) after 10 days of treatment in the double-blind phase (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg given once as intravenous infusion significantly reduced pain intensity in a population of 11 participants with chronic phantom pain that was mostly malignant in aetiology (P &lt; 0.05) compared with placebo. In another study, pain intensity was significantly decreased with ketamine alone at 0.4 mg/kg and combination ketamine-calcitonin after infusion compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.05) in a group of 20 participants with chronic phantom pain of various aetiologies.†Ketamine alone and its combination with calcitonin had significant pain reduction of greater than 50% versus placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Two studies assessed change in mood (depression scores and feelings of well-being scores) (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>). One study found no significant difference in the change in depression scale score between memantine and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>). On the other hand, the scores of feelings of well-being were significantly better in the dextromethorphan group compared with placebo (P = 0.025) (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 2003</LINK>).†Only one study assessed change in function or disability, where the pain disability index (recreation, social activity, family and home responsibilities, sexual behaviour, occupation, life support) did not change significantly in either group (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>Severe adverse events such as loss of consciousness and other mild/moderate effects such as light sedation, light visual hallucination, hearing impairment, and position impairment were reported with ketamine in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>). Insobriety, discomfort, and mood elevation were described in another (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolajsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolajsen 1996</LINK>). Adverse effects such as nausea, fatigue/tiredness, dizziness/vertigo, agitation/restlessness, and headaches were observed with memantine (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>).†No adverse events were observed in any of the participants during dextromethorphan treatment and at one-month follow-up (<LINK REF="STD-Abraham-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Abraham 2003</LINK>). No dropouts or withdrawals were reported in the NMDA antagonists studies, except in one study, where two participants dropped out in the memantine group due to adverse events and three from the placebo group due to insufficient analgesia (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>) .</P>

In the first study, pain intensity difference on the 100-millimetre VAS (mean (SD)) (converted and presented as centimetre VAS in <LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>) was significantly higher with gabapentin at 2.4 g/day at the end of six weeks compared with placebo in a population of 19 participants with chronic phantom pain (3.2 (2.1) versus 1.6 (0.7), P = 0.03) (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>).†In the second study of 24 participants with chronic phantom and stump pain following amputation of various aetiologies, average phantom pain intensity differences on the0-to-10 numerical rating scale (mean (SD)) in the gabapentin phase did not differ significantly from placebo (0.94 (1.98) versus 0.49 (2.20), t = 0.70) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>).†Combining the results of these two studies using the generic inverse variance method for the outcome change in pain intensity showed a mean difference of -1.16 (95% CI -1.94 to -0.38) (P = 0.004), favouring gabapentin (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>Change in mood/depression and function were evaluated using different outcome scales, so the results could not be combined. The end-of-treatment median (interquartile range) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Barthel Index, and Sleep Interference Scale were not significantly different between gabapentin and placebo (12 (4 to 22) versus 14 (5 to 25); 85 (70 to 105) versus 87 (65 to 105); 3 (1 to 5) versus 4 (1 to 5)) (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>), respectively. Average scores for Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (mean (SD)) were not significantly different between gabapentin and placebo (4.22 (9.20) versus 3.78 (10.13), t = -0.11), respectively (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>). Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART) and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) change scores were not significant (no values shown) (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>). Somnolence (n = 7), dizziness (n = 2), headache (n = 2), and nausea (n = 1) reported in the gabapentin group were not significantly different from control group (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>).</P>

One study compared it to saline placebo in a group of 21 participants with severe phantom pain developing within a week after amputations of various aetiologies (<LINK REF="STD-Jaeger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jaeger 1992</LINK>). Another study compared it to ketamine, combination ketamine and calcitonin, and placebo in 20 participants with chronic phantom pain (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Median pain intensity on a 0-to-10 numerical analogue scale (NAS) was significantly reduced 24 hours after 200 international units (IU) calcitonin infusion (P &lt; 0.001) (<LINK REF="STD-Jaeger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jaeger 1992</LINK>). Four participants in the group where calcitonin infusion was the first of the matched pair of infusions given (one consisting of calcitonin and the other of saline placebo) did not require a second infusion, as they had a NAS of less than 3.†In the other study, pain intensity on the 10-centimetre VAS did not significantly decrease with 200 IU calcitonin infusion compared with placebo at 48 hours. Also, the number of responders (equal to or greater than 50% pain relief) to calcitonin did not differ significantly from placebo (2 of 20 versus 1 of 19) (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 13:39:36 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>In this update we added another class of drugs, botulinum neurotoxins, in particular botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A), to the list of pharmacologic interventions for treating established phantom limb pain. However, the results of the lone eligible investigation on BoNT/A did not substantially change the main results of the original version of the review.</P>
<P>Firstly, the short- and long-term effectiveness of most pharmacologic interventions in established PLP remains unresolved for clinically relevant outcomes that include pain, function, mood or depression, sleep, quality of life, satisfaction, and safety. Botulinum toxin A was ineffective in phantom limb pain (based on a pilot study) in both short- and long-term (up to six months) time frames. Of the remaining six drug classes reviewed, only morphine consistently demonstrated short-term analgesia (based on two studies: n = 12 (<LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK>); n = 31 (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>)), although only one study was adequately powered. The various NMDA receptor antagonists had differential efficacy, in that ketamine and dextromethorphan provided pain relief, and memantine did not. Gabapentin was shown to be beneficial with the pooled results, but these results should be interpreted with caution as computations were based on approximations. The studies on calcitonin and local anaesthetics had conflicting results.</P>
<P>Secondly, there was extensive variation in the methods, interventions, outcomes, outcome measures/scales, follow-ups, data analyses, and reporting and presenting of results. This limited the pooling of results. Clinically relevant outcomes that include function, mood, sleep, quality of life, and satisfaction were missing in the majority of the studies, including the newly identified study.</P>

<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-10-12 13:46:47 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>Botulinum toxin A injections did not lower phantom limb pain intensity assessed monthly for six months. Botulinum neurotoxins comprise a group of nerve-blocking biologic agents that exert their blocking effect at the neuromuscular junction by preventing the release of acetylcholine (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-2001a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Aoki-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 2001b</LINK>). Of the existing seven serotype botulinum toxins, BoNT/A and botulinum toxin B have been studied in amputation-related complications such as pain, hyperhydrosis, and involuntary movements (<LINK REF="REF-Charrow-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Charrow 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2011</LINK>). The rationale for using BoNT/A in phantom limb pain relates to the peripheral mechanisms contributing to PLP. Phantom limb pain is often associated with neuroma, excessive muscle tightness, and spasm. Botulinum toxin A reduces muscular activity as a result of the neuromuscular blockade (<LINK REF="REF-Aoki-2001b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Aoki 2001b</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Brin-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brin 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Silberstein-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Silberstein 2001</LINK>). The negative results of this pilot study, <LINK REF="STD-Wu-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2012</LINK>, are not congruent with earlier studies (<LINK REF="STD-Jin-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kern-2004b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kern 2004b</LINK>). The authors of the study cited the small sample size, low baseline VAS scores, and the heterogeneous patient population included in the study. As this was only a preliminary study, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion regarding the effectiveness and clinical applicability of BoNT/A in phantom limb pain.</P>
<P>Both oral and intravenous forms of morphine significantly reduced pain intensity. The percentage of participants responding to oral morphine in <LINK REF="STD-Huse-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Huse 2001</LINK> was comparable to that of another study on morphine for postamputation pains (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>). As for adverse events, reviews on opioids for chronic non-cancer and neuropathic pain also found constipation, along with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness as the most common and significant adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNicol-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNicol 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moore-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>The rationale for the use of opioids in PLP stems from the observed efficacy of these medications in neuropathic pain states. As with neuropathic pain, peripheral and central neural mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PLP. Also, reviews investigating the prescription and use of opioids, in <LINK REF="REF-Hall-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 2013</LINK>, as well as the effectiveness of opioids in neuropathic pain conditions (e.g. diabetic neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia) included evidence from PLP trials, albeit results on their effectiveness including long-term adverse events in these conditions have not been strong and conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Furlan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Furlan 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kalso-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kalso 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McNicol-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNicol 2013</LINK>). The reasons why opioids might work in phantom pain are not well-understood.†Peripherally and at the spinal level, opioids act via presynaptic nerve terminals and postsynaptic neurons involved in pain transmission. Centrally, these drugs may decrease cortical reorganisation, a phenomenon where the topographic representation of lost extremity is shifted to other areas of the cortex and taken over by sensory input from other areas of the body, leading to perceptual remapping following the amputation (<LINK REF="REF-Birbaumer-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Birbaumer 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Elbert-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Elbert 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Flor-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flor 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramachandran-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramachandran 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results for the NMDA receptor antagonists as a group were at best equivocal. Blocking the NMDA receptors in the dorsal horn, which play a significant role in central sensitisation, hyperexcitability, and wind-up phenomenon, can decrease pain manifestations. Among the NMDA receptor antagonists, dextromethorphan and ketamine had short-term analgesic effects compared with placebo, but these findings were based on underpowered studies. On the other hand, memantine did not have the same positive effects (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>). The issues raised were low drug dosage, short run-in period, other probable mechanisms that maintain phantom pain aside from the NMDA receptor activation (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>), time-dependent effect of memantine on neural transmission via NMDA receptor pain maintenance, and the differential affinity of the various NMDA receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The differences in the results for ketamine and memantine are not easily explained. Firstly, the type of†neuropathic pain involved could be a factor. Ketamine significantly decreased pain evoked by mechanical stimulation and increased pressure pain thresholds (<LINK REF="STD-Nikolajsen-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Nikolajsen 1996</LINK>). Conversely, memantine in neuropathic pain after amputation, surgery, and postherpetic neuralgia neither decreased mechanical and cold allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia, and wind-up-like pain nor increased thresholds to mechanical pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Eisenberg-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eisenberg 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nikolajsen-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nikolajsen 2000</LINK>). However, in the included memantine studies, the detailed characteristics of the neuropathic pain were not explicit nor were there outcomes on allodynia, hyperalgesia, wind-up-like pain and pressure pain thresholds. Secondly, the timing of the intervention might be important. Memantine given in combination with brachial plexus blockade in the early postoperative stage significantly decreased the intensity and prevalence of PLP at four weeks and six months (<LINK REF="REF-Schley-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schley 2007</LINK>).†On the other hand, memantine given in established PLP in the current review led to negative findings. A characteristic of the populations was continuous pre-existing pain of at least 12 months. Pre-existing pain results in the formation of a somatosensory &#8220;pain memory&#8221; that indicates long-term changes in the central nervous system (<LINK REF="REF-Katz-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Katz 1990</LINK>). When this pain memory is in place, functional and structural changes in nociceptive structures have already occurred (<LINK REF="REF-Lei-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lei 2004</LINK>). NMDA antagonism might thus no longer be useful in longstanding phantom pain where the neuroplastic changes are already fixed. Thirdly, the route of administration might also be an issue. In this review, intravenous ketamine during the chronic phase of phantom pain altered the pain intensity favourably.†On the other hand, all three memantine studies used the oral preparation and demonstrated consistent negative findings.</P>
<P>The results for the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin were contradictory. An earlier study, <LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>, indicated positive findings in favour of gabapentin, while a later study, <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>, showed otherwise. Combining the results of the two studies entailed estimating certain parameters that include the treatment effect and its standard error (SE) from each study (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>). We approximated the SE in one study given the standard deviations of the pain intensity differences and n for treatment and placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>). In the later study, we computed the SE by dividing the mean difference between placebo and treatment by the given value of the t statistic (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>). We performed the generic inverse variance method for pooled analysis. The pooled estimate suggested a trend favouring gabapentin, but this should be interpreted with caution for reasons mentioned above. A recent review on gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain that included PLP found that gabapentin was better than placebo and that 34% to 38% of participants experienced at least 50% pain relief with the drug (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014</LINK>). Adverse events were also significantly more frequent with gabapentin in this review (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2014</LINK>), compared to the Bone study.</P>
<P>The negative results for amitriptyline (based on only one study) were attributed to a missed a small treatment effect, insufficient duration of treatment (six weeks), and the type of participants included (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 2004</LINK>). Tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline have been considered first-line drugs for neuropathic pain (<LINK REF="REF-Finnerup-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Finnerup 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Moulin-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moulin 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 2010</LINK>). However, a recent meta-analysis that focused on amitriptyline in neuropathic pain showed a lack of good-quality studies to support its beneficial effects or lack of effect (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015</LINK>). Furthermore, the review suggested that it may benefit a few and select group of patients, but not the majority (<LINK REF="REF-Moore-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moore 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>The findings on the analgesic action of calcitonin were contrasting. The earlier study involved participants with acute phantom pain (developing within seven days after amputation) (<LINK REF="STD-Jaeger-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Jaeger 1992</LINK>), whereas the later study included participants with years of history of phantom pain (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>). The mechanism involved in the analgesic action of calcitonin is unclear, although its direct central action is likely the main mechanism, as suggested by its inhibitory effect on the neuronal firing in response to peripheral stimulation and the finding of its receptors in the central nervous system structures (<LINK REF="REF-Azria-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azria 2002</LINK>). The ineffectiveness of calcitonin in one study was attributed to its possible lack of effect on central sensitisation processes, which are important in phantom pain pathophysiology (<LINK REF="STD-Eichenberger-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Eichenberger 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results for the local anaesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine) were variable. While both are sodium channel blockers, they were administered via different routes. Lidocaine at 4 mg/kg was administered systemically as an infusion, whereas bupivacaine at 2.5 mg was given locally as an injection. Lidocaine infusion was ineffective in PLP, as the mechanisms responsible for PLP are primarily considered to be central, although peripheral inputs are important in maintaining pain. Lidocaine is considered to act for the most part in the periphery by decreasing ectopic discharge following peripheral nerve injury (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2002</LINK>). Conversely, bupivacaine injection to contralateral myofascial hyperalgesic areas decreased phantom pain intensity (<LINK REF="STD-Casale-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Casale 2009</LINK>). The mechanism of pain relief from local anaesthetic contralateral injection is not clear. In animal experiments, blocking afferent inputs on the contralateral side can decrease the spontaneous hyperactivity and after discharges following noxious evoked responses in the wide dynamic response neurons in the† ipsilateral (injured) side (<LINK REF="REF-Bileviciute_x002d_Ljungara-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bileviciute-Ljungara 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>Aside from the type of medication, the dosing, route, and ease of administration are also of clinical importance. While some of the drugs were given for a period of days to weeks (oral medications), others were administered as a single dose via relatively more invasive manner (e.g. infusion, injection) such as ketamine, calcitonin, intravenous morphine, and bupivacaine injection. Thus far, outcome assessment, including adverse events, for these single-dose drugs given intravenously or as injections, have been within short time frames (e.g. at the end of infusion, within 30 minutes to 48 hours). Also, the duration of their analgesic effects has not been documented. This may put some degree of uncertainty on the clinical value of such drugs at this stage for this type of pain, which is generally considered chronic.</P>
<P>Other issues that can impact on applicability of evidence are the characteristics of the population and the phantom limb pain. The majority of studies included populations with mixed amputation aetiologies, although predominantly traumatic. In the United States, dysvascular disease accounts for most amputation cases, followed by trauma (motor vehicular accidents) (<LINK REF="REF-Sheehan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sheehan 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler_x002d_Graham-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler-Graham 2008</LINK>). Also, as aftermath of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, major limb amputations constitute 7.4% of major limb injuries, and about 88% of these are attributed to explosive device (<LINK REF="REF-Stansbury-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stansbury 2008</LINK>). Phantom limb pain is more likely in traumatic amputees (<LINK REF="REF-Ephraim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ephraim 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Phantom limb pain chronicity (four months to 12 years) was a feature of the included studies, except for one that dealt with acute phantom pain. None of the studies provided analyses that explored the relationship between chronicity and treatment response, although in general, people with chronic pain usually have a more protracted course of treatment, as there are other associated problems such as mood and sleep disorders. Furthermore, none of the studies described the phantom pain in detail (e.g. frequency, quality, mechanism, severity, etc.). The association between characteristics of the phantom limb pain and response to particular drugs needs further investigation.</P>
<P>The second main finding in this review relates to heterogeneity.†The study populations varied, from acute PLP to chronic phantom pain, although most were of the chronic type. Seven groups of interventions examining 10 individual drugs of dissimilar doses (e.g. gabapentin at 2.4 g/day or 3.6 g/day; single intravenous morphine infusion), of differing routes (e.g. oral morphine versus morphine infusion; intravenous lidocaine versus myofascial injection of bupivacaine), and of variable duration of administration (minutes versus weeks or months) were studied. A wide range of pain scales and measures were utilised (e.g. 11-point numerical rating scale, 0-to-100 VAS, NNTB for 30% or 50% pain relief, McGill Pain Questionnaire). A variety of scales were used to assess secondary outcomes as well (e.g. Functional Independence Measure or Barthel Index for function; the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale or Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for depression). Outcomes were measured at different time points ranging from 30 minutes to 6 months. The majority of studies had a cross-over design that differed in number of treatment arms, phases (blinded and open), and analyses of the data. The results for outcomes were reported and presented in various ways.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-10-01 14:22:14 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Studies were generally small and of short duration. Adequately powered studies yield more accurate and reliable estimates of treatment effect. The clinical applicability of interventions for phantom limb pain that is considered chronic would rely on the assessment of clinically relevant outcomes including adverse events over the long term. Also, the completeness of outcome data was questionable in some studies, as the attrition and exclusions from the analyses were not explicit. Another issue was that the majority of the studies had a cross-over design, and the possibility of carry-over effects could not be entirely eliminated. Evaluation of carry-over effects is not straightforward, as statistical techniques to analyse such effects are far from satisfactory and rely for the most part on judgement (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). To reduce the risk of carry-over effects, most of the studies utilised sufficient wash-out periods between treatment periods, except for the dextromethorphan study, which did not report any wash-out periods. Some studies also reported no significant differences in the baseline pain intensity levels between the start of each treatment period to indicate that carry-over effect was unlikely.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-10-12 13:46:52 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Anna Erskine">
<P>This review has several limitations. Firstly, all of the included studies had small sample sizes, which made it problematic to form generalisations and conclusions.†Secondly, we did not include studies where populations included participants with a diagnosis of postamputation pains with analyses that did not distinguish PLP from the other pains (e.g. postoperative pain, stump pain, etc.). One study found oral morphine to be more effective than placebo and mexiletine in improving pain but not function in people with postamputation pains (<LINK REF="STD-Wu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Wu 2008</LINK>). The exclusion of such a study might have led to an underestimation of the analgesic effect of oral morphine in this review. Also, we did not include a negative study on another class of drugs being investigated for phantom limb pain, synthetic cannabinoids, due to the lack of information regarding methods, data, and actual study results, as it was published only as an abstract (<LINK REF="REF-Khanahmadi-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Khanahmadi 2012</LINK>). Thus, the possibility of publication bias thus cannot be entirely discounted. However, the general results of that study based on the abstract would not have changed the main conclusions of this update. Thirdly, we were not able to do a fully satisfactory meta-analysis due to the variability in designs, outcomes and outcome measures, and analyses and reporting of the results. For example, for the opioid and anaesthetic studies, different routes of administration were studied. By combining the results of the memantine studies (<LINK REF="STD-Maier-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Maier 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>), we incurred a unit of analysis error, as we treated the cross-over study, <LINK REF="STD-Wiech-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Wiech 2004</LINK>, as though it was a parallel study by taking all measurements from memantine periods and all measurements from placebo periods and analysing these data as in a parallel study. The analysis assumed that this study had 16 participants, when in reality it had only 8. We thus see in the forest plot that the confidence interval is very wide and that the study has very little weight (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). But to start with, the trial has a very small sample size, so the presentation of forest plot here does not in fact add more to what the individual results show. The strategy of combining the two gabapentin studies was also not without shortcomings (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>). Ideally, the estimates of the treatment effect with their SEs are available in the study, but in this case, they were not; we therefore performed imputations. We noted, however, that the SE estimate of the positive study with the smaller sample, <LINK REF="STD-Bone-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Bone 2002</LINK>, was slightly smaller, and hence the weight was larger than that of the study with a slightly bigger sample size. It is possible that there was a little more variability in measurement in the other study (<LINK REF="STD-Smith-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2005</LINK>). These pooled results should therefore be interpreted with caution.</P>

<P>Several reviews have also identified and discussed various modalities of treatment in phantom pain but without firm recommendations on which is the best for clinical use (<LINK REF="REF-Foell-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foell 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Halbert-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Halbert 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Manchikanti-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Manchikanti 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sherman-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sherman 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolff-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolff 2011</LINK>).
