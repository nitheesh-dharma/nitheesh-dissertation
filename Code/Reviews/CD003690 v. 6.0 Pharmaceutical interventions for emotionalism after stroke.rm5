<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-10-12 12:56:51 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Emotionalism often occurs after stroke. Emotionalism means that the person has difficulty controlling their emotional behaviour. Patients with stroke may suddenly start crying or, less commonly, laughing for no apparent reason. This is distressing for that particular person and their carers. Antidepressants, known to be helpful in patients with depression, may be an effective treatment for emotionalism after stroke, but there have been very few randomised controlled trials in this area. This review of seven trials, involving 239 participants, found that antidepressant drugs appear to reduce outbursts of crying or laughing. More trials with systematic assessment and reporting of adverse events are needed to ensure that these benefits outweigh the risks.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:09:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched August 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), CINAHL (1982 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2008), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to May 2008), BIOSIS Previews (2002 to May 2008), Science Citation Index (1992 to May 2008), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to May 2008), Sociological Abstract/Sociofile (1974 to May 2008), ISI Web of Science (2002 to May 2008),<I> </I>reference lists, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings and dissertation abstracts. We also contacted authors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-10-12 12:54:34 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing psychotropic medication to placebo in people with stroke and emotionalism (also known as emotional lability or pathological crying and laughing).</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:09:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We obtained data for people who no longer met the criteria for emotionalism, and on reduction in frequency of crying. Primary analyses were the proportion of patients who met the criteria for emotionalism at the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included emotionalism and depression scores, cognitive function, death, activities of daily living and adverse effects.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-10-12 14:02:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We included seven trials involving 239 participants. Data were available for five trials with 213 participants. Five trials showed large effects of treatment: 50% reduction in emotionalism, diminished tearfulness, improvements (reduction) in lability, tearfulness and scores on the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale. However, confidence intervals were wide indicating that treatment may have had only a small positive effect, or even a small negative effect (in one trial). Only two studies systematically reported adverse events; no discernible differences were seen between groups.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-19 02:16:44 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Antidepressants can reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes. The effect does not seem specific to one drug or class of drugs. Our conclusions must be qualified by several methodological deficiencies in the studies. More reliable data are required before recommendations can be made about the treatment of post-stroke emotionalism.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:09:28 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Disturbances of emotional behaviour, such as difficulty controlling crying or laughing, are common after stroke (<LINK REF="REF-House-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1989</LINK>). Poeck (<LINK REF="REF-Poeck-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Poeck 1969</LINK>) distinguished two main types of disturbed emotionality associated with brain lesions: one he called pathological crying and laughing, and the other emotional lability. The main differences were that in the former provocation was by non-emotive or incongruous stimuli and the emotional display was socially abnormal and unstable, while in the latter, emotional behaviour was more socially familiar and provoked by typically emotive stimuli. The terminology is used inconsistently in the literature (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1989</LINK>), and the evidence to support Poeck's dichotomy is not strong. In order to avoid prejudging the issue we have preferred a general term for all such disorders of emotionality and have called the problem 'emotionalism' - the habit of weakly yielding to emotion (<LINK REF="REF-House-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1989</LINK>). The essential feature of emotionalism is an increase in emotional behaviour - usually crying, but sometimes laughing - that the patient reports as being outside normal control, so that he or she cries or laughs in situations that would not previously have provoked such behaviour. Onset of episodes is often reported as being more sudden and unpredictable than usual but, even so, the majority of sufferers report precipitants, which usually, but not always, are congruent with their emotional response.</P>
<P>There are other disturbances of emotional behaviour after stroke, especially irritable or anxious behaviours. By convention, however, they are not included in the present category, which is restricted to crying and laughing. Emotionalism is associated with an increase in depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, the majority of sufferers from emotionalism do not have a diagnosable depressive disorder and many do not have significant depressive symptoms at all (<LINK REF="REF-Calvert-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Calvert 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kim-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>Emotionalism affects about 20% to 25% of survivors in the first six months after stroke. It tends to decline in frequency and severity over the first year, but even at 12 months about 10% to 15% of survivors remain affected, and a few have persistent severe problems. Sufferers describe distress and embarrassment, and thereby social avoidance and impaired quality of contact with friends and family.</P>
<P>There are case reports and case series suggesting that disorders of emotionality (variously named and defined) may respond to mirtazepine (<LINK REF="REF-Kim-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kim 2005</LINK>), imipramine (<LINK REF="REF-Allman-1992a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Allman 1992a</LINK>), amitriptyline (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 1983</LINK>), doxepin (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 1983</LINK>), nomifensine (<LINK REF="REF-Sandyk-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandyk 1985</LINK>), fluoxetine (<LINK REF="REF-Hanger-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanger 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nahas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Panzer-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Panzer 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sloan-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sloan 1992</LINK>), sertraline (<LINK REF="REF-Benedek-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Benedek 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mukand-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mukand 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Muller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Muller 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Nahas-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nahas 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Tan-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tan 1996</LINK>), paroxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Muller-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Muller 1999</LINK>) and also to lithium (<LINK REF="REF-Massey-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massey 1981</LINK>), L-dopa (<LINK REF="STD-Udaka-1984" TYPE="STUDY">Udaka 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wolf-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wolf 1997</LINK>) and venlafaxine (<LINK REF="REF-Smith-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Smith 2003</LINK>). This response does not appear to be the result of a simple antidepressant action, although amelioration of co-existing depression which is exacerbating the emotionalism may be the mechanism of action for some. However, recovery occurs in people without a depressive disorder; at times it occurs in a dramatic fashion, within 24 to 48 hours of starting a low dose, and abnormal laughter may also respond to treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Lauterbach-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lauterbach 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 1983</LINK>). There are case reports suggesting that withdrawal of antidepressants leads to re-emergence of emotionalism, while reinstatement leads to resolution (<LINK REF="REF-Schiffer-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schiffer 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seliger-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seliger 1989</LINK>). However, drug treatment is not always effective and may be complicated by common unacceptable side effects. We have been able to find two case reports of psychological therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Brookshire-1970" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brookshire 1970</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sacco-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sacco 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Because of uncertainty over the balance of benefits and risks of therapy, we undertook a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (published and unpublished) of pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of emotionalism associated with stroke. We did not find any RCTs evaluating non-drug (psychological) interventions; any future trials in this area will be considered in a separate review.</P>
<P>This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004.</P>
</BACKGROUND>
<OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2009-10-09 16:07:46 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The main objectives of this review were to determine if pharmaceutical treatment: </P>
<OL>
<LI>reduces the frequency of emotionalism in patients with stroke; or</LI>
<LI>reduces the frequency of emotional displays in patients who continue to suffer from the disorder.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The secondary objectives were to determine whether treatment improves social functioning or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in either patients or their principal caregivers. We also aimed to determine the safety, adherence to, and acceptance of treatment.</P>

<METHODS MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:10:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<CRIT_STUDIES MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:09:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We considered all relevant RCTs or quasi-RCTs in patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke, where a pharmaceutical agent used specifically for the treatment of emotionalism was compared with placebo. We excluded trials in which the allocation to treatment or placebo was not random. We excluded trials that compared two or more antidepressant drugs, but which did not include a placebo group. We identified RCTs and cross-over trials in all languages. There was no restriction on eligibility of RCTs on the basis of sample size, duration of follow up or publication status.</P>
<P>When we found studies meeting all the criteria for inclusion but not presenting any outcome data (and such data were not available from the authors) and could therefore not contribute to any pooled estimate of effect, we regarded these studies as 'dropouts' rather than ineligible, and they are listed in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> to indicate that they have not been overlooked.</P>
</CRIT_STUDIES>
<CRIT_PARTICIPANTS MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:09:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>All participants had to have established emotionalism at entry into the trial. The essential feature of emotionalism is an increase in emotional behaviour - usually crying, but sometimes laughing - that the patient reports as being outside normal control, so that he or she cries or laughs in situations that would not previously have provoked such behaviour. Onset of episodes is often reported as being more sudden and unpredictable than usual, but even so the majority of sufferers report precipitants, which usually are congruent with their emotional response.</P>
<P>We included all participants with a confirmed history of stroke, at any stage after onset, where there was an explicit intention to provide a pharmacological agent to treat emotionalism associated with stroke. Stroke was defined according to standard clinical criteria. The criteria include cerebral infarction, intracerebral haemorrhage and uncertain pathological subtypes, but exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage, which has a different natural history and management strategy to other stroke subtypes. There were no restrictions on the basis of age, sex or other characteristics. We excluded trials that included mixed populations (such as stroke and head injury or other central nervous system disorders) unless separate results for the stroke patients could be identified. We included patients with a diagnosed mood disorder or a mood score above the standard cut-off scores at baseline provided it was clear that they also met criteria for emotionalism. We excluded patients who were being treated primarily for a stroke-associated pain syndrome or for stroke-associated depression, even if emotionalism was measured as a secondary (post hoc) outcome.</P>
</CRIT_PARTICIPANTS>
<CRIT_INTERVENTIONS MODIFIED="2009-06-19 02:29:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included any trial that attempted to evaluate a comparison between a pharmacological agent and placebo for the treatment of emotionalism following stroke. Specific pharmacological agents considered included tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (e.g. nortriptyline, imipramine, and clomipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline, citraline and paroxetine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g. moclobemide), and other antidepressant medications. We found no trials of psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate), mood stabilizers (e.g. lithium), benzodiazepines or combined preparations. Any future trials will be included but analysed separately.</P>

<CRIT_OUTCOMES MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:10:07 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of the problem, there is no widely accepted standardised set of diagnostic criteria for emotionalism. Therefore, the primary emotionalism endpoint was planned to be the proportion of patients who, at the end of treatment, met the criteria for emotionalism that were applied by the authors in recruiting to the trial. However, data for this endpoint were not available. In the current review, the primary emotionalism endpoints were as follows.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The proportion of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in abnormal emotional behaviour at the end of treatment (<LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>, subgroup 1.1.1).</LI>

<P>See the 'Specialized register' section in the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/STROKE/frame.html">Cochrane Stroke Group</A> module.</P>
<P>We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group (last searched by the Managing Editor in August 2009) and the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group (last searched August 2009). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I> Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008) (<LINK REF="APP-01" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</LINK>), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), CINAHL (1982 to May 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to May 2008), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to September 2002), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to May 2008), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), BIOSIS Previews (January 2002 to May 2008), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to May 2008), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to May 2008), Sociological Abstract/SocioFile (1974 to May 2008) and ISI Web of Science (January 2002 to May2008). Biological Abstracts has now been superseded by BIOSIS Previews and ISI Web of Knowledge includes the Arts and Humanities Index, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. We have not updated the searches on Applied Science and Technology and General Science Plus as this electronic database is currently not available to the review authors.</P>
<OL>
<LI>We searched Dissertations and Theses (previously called Digital Dissertations), a database of abstracts from doctoral theses from within the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom (1980 to May 2008).</LI>
<LI>We searched the proceedings of the European Stroke Conferences (2000 to 2008) and the Stroke Society of Australasia Annual Scientific Meetings (1999 to 2008).</LI>
<LI>In 2002 we wrote to several of the researchers active in the area of stroke-associated mood disorders in the previous 10 years. We identified these researchers by scanning author lists of the relevant published trials, reviews and conference proceedings. We asked them to verify that all relevant trials had been identified and also if they had knowledge of any other relevant published or unpublished trials. We have not contacted them for this review update.</LI>
<LI>In 2002, we wrote to major pharmaceutical companies to ask whether they had any unpublished RCTs that should be included in the review. We have not contacted them for this review update. However, we searched the online Clinical Trial Results and Clinical Trial Registries for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Forest, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Organon, Pfizer, Roche and Wyeth (to May 2008).</LI>
<LI>We searched the online clinical trials and research registers <A HREF="http://www.strokecenter.org/trials">www.strokecenter.org/trials</A>, <A HREF="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</A>, <A HREF="http://www.clinicalstudyresults.org/">www.Clinicalstudyresults.org</A> and <A HREF="http://www.anzctr.org.au/">www.anzctr.org.au</A> (to May 2008). The compulsory registration of clinical trial protocols on these sites before recruitment of the first patient enabled us to elect not to contact researchers and pharmaceutical companies.</LI>
<LI>We searched the reference lists of relevant trials and reviewed chapters in books on the prevention and treatment of depression and management of stroke, including but not limited to, reviews of the management of stroke, books specifically directed at the treatment or prevention of depression, and those on stroke and old age.</LI>

<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:11:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>One review author (MY) discarded irrelevant citations based on the title of the publication and its abstract. In the presence of any suggestion that an article could possibly be relevant, we retrieved the full-length article for further assessment. Two review authors (MY and MH) independently selected the trials for inclusion in the review from the culled citation list. We obtained translations of potentially relevant non-English articles. We resolved disagreements by discussion, and one author (MH) confirmed the final list and adjudicated any persisting differences.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Data extraction</HEADING>
<P>Two review authors (MY and MH) extracted, cross-checked and entered the data independently, on specially designed forms. We discussed any discrepancies. We entered the data into Review Manager 5 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2008</LINK>). We planned to assess the quality of the coding process (inter- and intra-coder reliability) using kappa. However, due to heterogeneity in the presentation of results across studies, two review authors (MY and MH) resolved all differences by discussion and did not perform kappa.</P>
<P>We collected data on:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the report: author, year and source of publication;</LI>
<LI>the study: sample characteristics, social demography, definition and criteria used for emotionalism;</LI>
<LI>the patients: stroke sequence (first ever versus recurrent), social situation, time since stroke onset, prior history of psychiatric illness, current neurological status, current treatment for depression, coronary artery disease;</LI>
<LI>the research design and features: sampling mechanism, treatment assignment mechanism, adherence rates, non-response rates, length of follow up;</LI>
<LI>the intervention: type, duration, dose, timing, mode of delivery;</LI>
<LI>the effect size: sample size, nature of outcome, estimate and standard error.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we sought data irrespective of adherence, whether or not the patients were subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from treatment or follow up.</P>
<P>We checked all of the extracted data for agreement between review authors. We obtained missing information from the study investigators whenever possible. To avoid introducing bias, we requested this unpublished information in writing, and it was entered into Review Manager 5.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Study characteristics</HEADING>
<P>Although there are a number of scales devised for assessing the quality of RCTs, there is no convincing evidence that complex and time-consuming scales are more effective than simple scales (<LINK REF="REF-Verhagen-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verhagen 2001</LINK>). As we extracted data, we documented specific details about the following five points, and gave one point for each criterion met.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Generation of the randomisation sequence: the method used, was the study described as randomised and a genuine randomisation process described, was this adequate, inadequate or unknown. If the randomisation was blocked, was the size of the blocks known to those entering patients.</LI>
<LI>Concealment of the random sequence from those entering patients into the trial: the method used, was it one that ensured tamper-free concealment of allocation, was it adequate, inadequate or unknown.</LI>
<LI>Who was blinded and how successful blinding was: were the patient, health worker treating the patient, or the follow-up raters blinded and were attempts made to check blinding was successful.</LI>
<LI>How many patients in each treatment group who were initially randomised were not included in the analysis: whether an intention-to-treat analysis was possible on all patients from the published data (i.e. whether there were any exclusions from the trial after randomisation, or for cross-over treatment groups).</LI>
<LI>How many patients were withdrawn from the trial, crossed over treatment groups, or were lost to follow up.</LI>
</OL>
<P>We planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to determine whether the trial design (randomised, quasi-randomised) made a difference to the results.</P>
<P>Two review authors (MH and MY) independently assessed the methodological characteristics of each trial using the above checklist. For each included trial we described features that influenced the degree of bias, as well as differences in baseline prognostic variables that might invalidate the results.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Statistical analysis</HEADING>
<P>The main outcomes of interest were the proportion of participants who meet the diagnostic categories for emotionalism at the end of follow up, and the proportion that show a 50% reduction in crying or laughing at follow up. For all dichotomous outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate, using fixed-effect analyses.</P>
<P>For continuous outcomes, if ordinal scale data appeared to be approximately normally distributed or if the analysis suggests parametric tests were appropriate, we treated the outcome measures as continuous. If there were at least two studies that reported the same outcomes, then we calculated a mean difference (MD) across the trials. Where different outcomes measures were used, we planned to calculate a standardised mean difference (SMD).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<P>If there were at least two trials that reported the same outcomes, we reviewed the data for appropriateness of pooling. If there was definite evidence of heterogeneity (I<SUP>2 </SUP>&gt; 50%), we explored the potential reasons for the differences by performing subgroup or sensitivity analyses. If the heterogeneity could not be explained, we combined the trials using random-effects analyses with cautious interpretation, or did not combine them at all. Where possible, we had planned to perform subgroup analyses to examine the impact of treatment type and duration, and of stroke severity. We planned to undertake sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of date of publication, sample size, duration of follow up, treatment type, high (over 20%) number of dropouts, and blinded versus unblinded outcome assessors. We planned to explore the sensitivity of the combined estimate to individual trials by leaving one study out, calculating the combined effect of the remaining trials, and comparing the results with the combined effect based on all the trials. If meta-analyses are undertaken in updates of this review, we will use funnel plots to detect the presence of publication bias. We did not complete these for our current review.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Additional requested data</HEADING>
<P>We wrote to the authors of all included studies requesting data that were unavailable or ambiguous in the published articles. Three authors responded with the requested additional data (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>).

<P>We have included two new trials (<LINK REF="STD-Choi_x002d_Kwon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Choi-Kwon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>) since the previous published version of this review, resulting in seven trials with 239 participants at entry (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi_x002d_Kwon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Choi-Kwon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>). Two trials were of cross-over design (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>) and outcome data were not available from the first phase (pre- cross-over) in an appropriate format for inclusion as a parallel RCT. Therefore, this review primarily reports data from five trials with 213 participants.<I> </I>See the <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK> table for more detailed information.</P>
<P>We identified two additional trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aizawa-1977" TYPE="STUDY">Aizawa 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohtomo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtomo 1985</LINK>), which met the inclusion criteria for this review. However, both trials included participants with cerebral arteriosclerosis and neither presented outcome data by those diagnosed with emotionalism at entry. These two studies are considered 'dropouts'. See <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK> for more detailed information on these trials.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All trials in this review included both males and females. The mean or median age of participants ranged from 57.8 to 73 years. Five trials reported the time between stroke and randomisation into the trial, with the range covering three days to 13 years (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Five trials assessed the efficacy of SSRIs: citalopram (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>), fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi_x002d_Kwon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Choi-Kwon 2006</LINK>) and sertraline (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>); two assessed tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): amitriptyline (<LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>) and nortriptyline (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>). Duration of treatment ranged from 10 to 182 days. Only one study did not compare the active intervention with a placebo-matched control, but combined the active treatment with a 'stomach medicine' to disguise taste and smell with the control group receiving the stomach medicine only (<LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Emotionalism</HEADING>
<P>No standard criteria were used to define emotionalism at entry across the trials. Emotionalism was measured in seven different ways in the seven trials (<LINK REF="STD-Andersen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Andersen 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brown-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi_x002d_Kwon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Choi-Kwon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ohkawa-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Ohkawa 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>) and no more than two trials used the same method of assessment.<I> </I>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>A variety of additional outcomes were assessed in each trial.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:11:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>The results of this review indicate that antidepressants reduce the frequency and severity of crying episodes. While these findings appear straightforward, our conclusions are guarded by several methodological deficiencies in the studies. These deficiencies include the type of participants included, the definition and diagnosis of emotionalism used, the inclusion of some co-morbidities, and the generally poor trial design and reporting of results.</P>
<P>In general, clinical trials are carried out on selected groups of individuals, while the usefulness of the information derived lies primarily in the ability to generalise the data to a wide range of individuals. This review included trials with participants whose index stroke varied from six days to 13 years prior to randomisation. It may not be appropriate to consider that the response to treatment is consistent across such mixed populations, as the aetiology (and underlying pathology) of emotionalism may differ between patients early after acute stroke and those who survive in the long term. For example, survivors in the acute phase have recently experienced a potentially life-threatening event and are coping with the psychological consequences, as well as recovering from the disabling effects of the stroke itself. On the other hand, survivors of stroke at several months or longer after the event are adjusting to the prospects of long-term disability and changes in social and financial circumstances, as well as the cumulative effects of cerebrovascular disease or vascular dementia, or both. The natural history of emotionalism after stroke is for spontaneous resolution over a few months, whereas it is reasonable to suppose that it may be a more chronic state in those with chronic cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, since the balance of risks and benefits and the effectiveness of treatment for emotionalism may change with time from the onset of stroke, mixing individuals at very different stages after stroke makes interpretation difficult. Future trials should include homogeneous patient groups with respect to time from the onset of stroke, or sufficient numbers of participants in the early and late stages after stroke.</P>
<P>Defining the disorder of interest is key to the conduct of a clinical trial. A widely agreed definition usually exists for most clinical conditions. However, no such standard definition is available for emotionalism. For example, it does not feature in a clearly defined way in the DSM (<LINK REF="REF-APA-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-APA-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 1994</LINK>) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (<LINK REF="REF-ICD-10" TYPE="REFERENCE">ICD 10</LINK>). In the clinical setting the diagnosis is generally made during interview. The commonly accepted criteria for emotionalism include: (1) sudden onset of crying (and less commonly, laughing); (2) not under usual control (a change in behaviour has occurred); and (3) the crying is not simply an expression of depression or grief. Given the resource-intensive nature of conducting psychiatric interviews on all participants in clinical trials, we considered it acceptable to determine caseness during a psychiatric interview and to measure frequency and severity using a validated questionnaire. Two standardised scales were used to assess emotionalism: the Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale (PLCS) (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>) and the Lawson and Macleod Scale (<LINK REF="STD-Lawson-1969" TYPE="STUDY">Lawson 1969</LINK>). An attempt to validate the PLCS was made (<LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>), but neither scale has been externally validated using traditional methods. The 'severity' score on the PLCS includes items recording the quality of crying, not just frequency of occurrence. In the absence of a validated questionnaire, the most appropriate method to diagnose and determine severity of emotionalism is likely to be a simple and easily replicable assessment of the frequency of crying episodes, or laughing episodes (assessing these elements separately), combined with an a priori cut-off score for entry into the trial. The nature of precipitants should be assessed in separate questions to those assessing frequency of crying and laughing.</P>
<P>Emotionalism is known to be confounded by depression (<LINK REF="REF-House-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">House 1989</LINK>). Tearfulness can be the result of an underlying depressive disorder. The inclusion of participants with depression and emotionalism limits our ability to draw conclusions regarding the treatment of emotionalism alone. While all included studies assessed depression, only two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Robinson-1993a" TYPE="STUDY">Robinson 1993a</LINK>) reported results. Ideally, future studies should limit inclusion to participants with emotionalism alone, or recruit sufficient participants to allow adjustment for depression in the results, and report the results from all questionnaires administered.</P>
<P>As is often noted in reviews of the literature, there were several deficiencies in trial methodology that further limit our findings. Firstly, most trials (with the exception of <LINK REF="STD-Ohtomo-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Ohtomo 1985</LINK>) were small, with only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Brown-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Brown 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Choi_x002d_Kwon-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Choi-Kwon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Murray-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Murray 2005</LINK>) reporting adequate concealment of the randomisation sequence. The duration of treatment was short for most studies. Observational studies suggest that many cases of emotionalism resolve over the first months after stroke, so the impact of short-term therapy may be difficult to assess. Furthermore, case histories report relapse in emotionalism upon withdrawal of treatment, so it would be useful to have information on longer-term results and relapse rates in future studies. We also included cross-over studies if the washout period was deemed appropriate. While the benefits and risks of treatment with antidepressants appear to be balanced, only one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 1999</LINK>) systematically recorded and reported all adverse events in the study, making an accurate presentation of the benefits and risks impossible.</P>
<P>In summary, these trials appear to add little to case reports and case series. They provide suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that antidepressants can reduce the frequency of crying (sometimes abolishing it altogether). The effect does not seem specific to one drug or class of drugs.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:11:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>Antidepressants appear to reduce the frequency of emotionalism after stroke. However, there is continued uncertainty about who might benefit the most from treatment among those who meet the clinical features indicative of emotionalism. There are no data to guide recommendations about how long patients should remain on treatment, or what rate of side effects may be expected. Under these circumstances, the current evidence indicates that it would be reasonable to use antidepressants in a therapeutic trial in the individual patient with persistent emotionalism that is sufficiently frequent and severe to warrant taking the known overall risks of prescribing antidepressants in the elderly.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-02 15:11:35 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Hazel Fraser">
<P>We recommend that future trials investigating the effect of antidepressants in people with emotionalism after stroke should address the following:<BR/>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>use a standardised method to diagnose emotionalism, determine severity and assess change over time: this would assume development of a standard definition of emotionalism;</LI>
<LI>use a standard measure of depression as the major confounder to be considered in analyses;</LI>
<LI>recruit an adequate number of participants so that variables such as 'concomitant depression' and 'time passed between stroke and recruitment' can be controlled;</LI>
<LI>provide treatment for a sufficient duration and follow up, so that rates of relapse or maintenance of remission can be assessed;</LI>
<LI>include careful assessment and complete reporting of adverse events;</LI>
<LI>limit the number of outcomes to three or four and report results for all outcomes;</LI>
<LI>make the outcomes relevant to the patient by, for example, being clear whether reduction in crying frequency or change in crying behaviour represented a satisfactory outcome for the patient.</LI>
