<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-01-28 12:56:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in a leg, forming a deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which may cause pain and swelling. This is very rarely fatal, but if part of the clot breaks off it may be carried to the lungs by the blood and block vessels there (this is called a pulmonary embolism (PE)), which can result in death. Normally occurring changes to the clotting system during pregnancy can increase the risk of a thromboembolic event (DVT or PE), and some groups of women have a higher risk of developing VTE (including older and obese women; women with previous VTE; women with thrombophilia (a condition predisposing individuals to developing clots); and women following a caesarean birth). Preventive treatments include drugs to prevent clots, support stockings, and physical activity soon after birth to keep the circulation moving. However, some drugs might cause problems such as increased blood loss after birth. Drugs used include unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin and aspirin.</P>
<P>We included 19 randomised controlled trials in this review but only 16 trials with 2592 women could be included in the analysis. The trials were of a moderate quality, and assessed drugs including unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy and after caesarean birth. We found no evidence to suggest that using heparin in pregnancy or after a caesarean birth reduces the risk of maternal death, DVT or PE, and no differences were shown for these outcomes when different types of heparin were compared. Women who received low molecular weight heparin seemed to be less likely to have bleeding episodes (bruises of more than 1 inch; injection site haematoma (a localised collection of blood outside blood vessels) of at least 2 cm in diameter, bleeding at birth and other bleeding), were less likely to have injection site burning, excess bruising and allergic rashes, and less likely to have a fetal loss, than women who received unfractionated heparin; however, the trials that showed these results were not of high quality.</P>
<P>We did not find enough evidence from the trials to be sure about the effects of these preventive treatments. This means there is not enough evidence to show which are the best ways to prevent VTE (including DVT and PE), during or following pregnancy, including after a caesarean birth.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-11-27 02:07:18 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), although rare, is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and methods of prophylaxis are therefore often used for women considered to be at risk. This may include women who have given birth by caesarean section, those with a personal or family history of VTE and women with inherited or acquired thrombophilias (conditions that predispose people to thrombosis). Many methods of prophylaxis carry risks of adverse effects, and as the risk of VTE is often low, it is possible that the benefits of thromboprophylaxis may be outweighed by harms. Guidelines for clinical practice have been based on expert opinion rather than high-quality evidence from randomised trials.</P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:07:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Sonja L  Henderson">
<P>Nineteen trials, at an overall moderate risk of bias, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Only 16 trials, involving 2592 women, assessing a range of methods of thromboprophylaxis, contributed data to the review. Six trials compared methods of antenatal prophylaxis: heparin versus no treatment/placebo (two trials), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) (four trials). Nine trials assessed prophylaxis after caesarean section: four compared heparin with placebo; three compared LMWH with UFH; one compared hydroxyethyl starch (HES) with UFH; and one compared five-day versus 10-day LMWH. One study examined prophylaxis with UFH in the postnatal period (including following vaginal births).</P>
<P>For antenatal prophylaxis, none of the included trials reported on maternal mortality, and no differences were detected for the other primary outcomes of symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo or when LMWH was compared with UFH. The risk ratios (RR) for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: antenatal LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 2.99 (two trials, 56 women); and antenatal LMWH versus UFH, RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.49 (four trials, 404 women). No differences were shown when antenatal LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo for any secondary outcomes. Antenatal LMWH was associated with fewer adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54; two trials, 226 women), and fewer fetal losses (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; three trials, 343 women) when compared with UFH. In two trials, antenatal LMWH compared with UFH was associated with fewer bleeding episodes (defined in one trial of 121 women as bruises &gt; 1 inch (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36); and in one trial of 105 women as injection site haematomas of &#8805; 2 cm, bleeding during delivery or other bleeding (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53)), however in a further trial of 117 women no difference between groups was shown for bleeding at delivery. The results for these secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution, being derived from small trials that were not of high methodological quality.</P>
<P>For post-caesarean/postnatal prophylaxis, only one trial comparing five-day versus 10-day LMWH after caesarean section reported on maternal mortality, observing no deaths. No differences were seen across any of the comparisons for the other primary outcomes (symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic PE and symptomatic DVT). The RRs for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: post-caesarean LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.39 to 4.27 (four trials, 840 women); post-caesarean LMWH versus UFH, RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99 (three trials, 217 women); post-caesarean five-day versus 10-day LMWH, RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.78 (one trial, 646 women); postnatal UFH versus no heparin, RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.36 (one trial, 210 women). For prophylaxis after caesarean section, in one trial (of 580 women), women receiving UFH and physiotherapy were more likely to have bleeding complications ('complications hémorragiques') than women receiving physiotherapy alone (RR 5.03; 95% CI 2.49 to 10.18). In two additional trials, that compared LMWH with placebo, no difference between groups in bleeding episodes (major bleeding; major bruising; bleeding/bruising reported at discharge) were detected. No other differences in secondary outcomes were shown when LMWH was compared with UFH post-caesarean, nor when post-caesarean HES was compared with UFH, post-caesarean five-day LMWH was compared with 10-day LMWH, or when UFH was compared to no heparin postnatally.</P>

<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2013-11-27 02:10:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and the early postnatal period, with the small number of differences detected in this review being largely derived from trials that were not of high methodological quality.

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy and the early postnatal period</HEADING>
<P>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which the blood clots inappropriately, and which is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The term VTE encompasses a continuum, including both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (the formation of clots in the deep veins of the body - predominately in the legs), and pulmonary embolism (PE) (which occurs when a clot in a deep vein breaks free and is carried to the arteries of the lungs) (<LINK REF="REF-Goldhaber-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Goldhaber 2012</LINK>). Two of the most common initial symptoms of DVT are pain and swelling in an extremity (such as the lower leg), while symptoms and signs of PE include dyspnoea (shortness of breath), tachypnoea (rapid breathing), chest pain and haemoptysis (coughing up blood). Severe cases of PE can include signs of cyanosis (blue discolouration, particularly of the lips and fingers), and may results in collapse and sudden death (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pregnancy is associated with a number of physiological and anatomic changes that can increase the risk of VTE (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lussana-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lussana 2012</LINK>). During pregnancy there is a switch in the global haemostatic balance towards a hypercoagulable state (plasma levels of coagulation factors, fibrinogen, Von Willebrand factor and other markers of thrombin generation are increased in pregnancy) (<LINK REF="REF-Andersson-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersson 1996</LINK>); a mechanism which protects the mother against excessive bleeding during birth. Other factors contributing to the higher risk of VTE in pregnancy include increased venous stasis, decreased venous outflow (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Macklon-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklon 1997</LINK>), compression of the inferior vena cava and pelvic veins by the enlarging uterus, and decreased mobility (<LINK REF="REF-Kovacevich-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kovacevich 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>VTE is one of the most common causes of maternal mortality in high-income countries (<LINK REF="REF-Atrash-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Atrash 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-CMACE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMACE 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dept-of-Health-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dept of Health 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-H_x00f6_gberg-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Högberg 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sultan-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sultan 2011</LINK>), with most of the maternal deaths being due to PE. As well as directly causing maternal mortality, VTE can also lead to serious long-term maternal morbidity (<LINK REF="REF-Lindhagen-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindhagen 1986</LINK>), including venous insufficiency, often manifesting as a painful and sometimes ulcerating leg, due to the compromised blood flow to the limb.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Epidemiology</HEADING>
<P>The risk of VTE in women during pregnancy and the immediate postnatal period is substantially higher than in non-pregnant women of the same age. A case-
control study (of 285 patients and 857 control participants) reported that compared with non-pregnant women, the risk of VTE was increased five-fold during pregnancy, and by 60-fold during the first three months after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Pomp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomp 2008</LINK>). While the relative risk of VTE is greatly increased for women during pregnancy, the absolute risk remains low, estimated at around one to two in 1000 pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-Arya-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arya 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Greer-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greer 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindqvist 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lussana-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lussana 2012</LINK>). Although much evidence has suggested that the incidence of VTE is roughly similar across the three trimesters, a recent study has suggested that the risk may in fact increase exponentially across the duration of the pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Virkus-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Virkus 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the best estimates of the incidence of VTE is believed to have come from the <LINK REF="REF-Lindqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindqvist 1999</LINK> study, conducted in Sweden, which linked maternity and hospital admission data, thus avoiding problems of underestimation (of events not recorded as pregnancy-related) faced by earlier studies. The incidence in this study was 0.13% (<LINK REF="REF-Lindqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindqvist 1999</LINK>), compared with other figures of 0.11% (<LINK REF="REF-Macklon-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Macklon 1996</LINK>), 0.09% (<LINK REF="REF-Andersen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Andersen 1998</LINK>), 0.06% (<LINK REF="REF-Gherman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherman 1999</LINK>) and 0.06% (<LINK REF="REF-Rutherford-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutherford 1991</LINK>). Each of these estimates related to all pregnant women rather than to any particular group of women at risk; and much of their variation may be accounted for by differences between populations in their risk factors for VTE, along with differences in use of preventative measures.</P>
<P>In pregnancy, acute DVT is believed to be three to four times more common than acute PE in the antepartum period, with approximately 80% of pregnancy-associated VTE being DVT and 20% to 25% being PE (<LINK REF="REF-James-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2001</LINK>). The incidence of VTE, especially PE, however is believed to be much higher during the immediate postpartum period (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>) (strongly associated with caesarean birth) (with between 40% and 60% of all acute PE cases reported to occur postpartum; and an estimated 15-fold increased risk of PE postpartum, compared with antepartum) (<LINK REF="REF-Gherman-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gherman 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>A study examining trends over time suggested that the incidence of VTE during pregnancy remained fairly constant between 1966 and 1995, while the incidence in PE during the postnatal period decreased (<LINK REF="REF-Heit-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Heit 2005</LINK>). The most recent report from the United Kingdom Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (reviewing maternal deaths in the United Kingdom) encouragingly supported a decline overall in deaths associated with VTE in recent years; with a maternal mortality rate (for VTE) of 0.79 per 100,000 pregnancies (<LINK REF="REF-CMACE-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">CMACE 2011</LINK>).<BR/>

<HEADING LEVEL="3">Risk factors</HEADING>
<P>Some groups of women have a higher risk of developing VTE. The most important individual risk factor for VTE in pregnancy is a personal history of thrombosis (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>). For women who have had a previous thrombosis in pregnancy, the risk of VTE increases considerably in subsequent pregnancies if antenatal thromboprophylaxis is not used (<LINK REF="REF-Brill_x002d_Edwards-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brill-Edwards 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-De-Stefano-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">De Stefano 2006</LINK>), with an estimated increased risk of recurrence of three- to four-fold (<LINK REF="REF-Pabinger-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pabinger 2002</LINK>). Another important individual risk factor for VTE in pregnancy is the presence of an inherited or acquired thrombophilia (a condition that predisposes individuals to developing thromboses) (<LINK REF="REF-ACOG-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">ACOG 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Alfirevic-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alfirevic 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-James-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Larciprete-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Larciprete 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 2006</LINK>). The risk of a thromboembolic event occurring during pregnancy has been shown to differ according to the nature of the thrombophilia, with estimates of risk varying from 5% to 33% (<LINK REF="REF-Conard-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Conard 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friederich-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friederich 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pomp-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pomp 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Other pregnancy-related factors shown to increase the risk of pregnancy-related VTE include multiple gestation, pre-eclampsia, prolonged labour and caesarean section (especially in the emergency setting). In a case-control study conducted in the United Kingdom, the overall risk of VTE was 0.09%, but there was a much higher risk of events in the postnatal period following caesarean birth. In this study, the risk in the antenatal period was estimated as 0.18% following caesarean section compared with 0.03% without caesarean section (<LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2001</LINK>). Obesity, smoking, advanced maternal age, heart disease, family history of VTE, and prolonged immobilisation are other commonly reported risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-James-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">James 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knight-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lindqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lindqvist 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Simpson-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Simpson 2001</LINK>).</P>

<P>While the evidence correlating risk factors and the occurrence of pregnancy-related VTE has to date been imprecise, there is currently broad agreement (as shown in one recent review of guidelines from the United States and from other international organisations (<LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>)) that women should be assessed for VTE risk preconception and again during pregnancy in order to guide VTE thromboprophylaxis (any measures taken in order to prevent thrombosis).</P>
<P>A recent review of international guidelines acknowledged the uncertainties surrounding recommendations for thromboprophylaxis globally (<LINK REF="REF-Wu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2013</LINK>), highlighting differences both within current United Kingdom recommendations (between the recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>) and from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) (<LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2009</LINK>), and between the United Kingdom guidelines and a variety of international guidelines. Inconsistencies in international guidelines include advice regarding which groups of women to offer thromboprophylaxis to, and which options should be offered to pregnant women. Recommendations for the duration of prophylaxis also vary. Women who have had a previous episode of VTE may, for example, be recommended long-term antenatal prophylaxis as well as prolonged postnatal prophylaxis, while women undergoing caesarean section may, for example, only be recommended postnatal prophylaxis for a few days.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="3">Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy and the early postnatal period</HEADING>
<P>Pharmacological agents, such as heparin, warfarin and aspirin have been used in VTE prevention due to their anticoagulant properties. Thrombin has a key role in haemostasis and thrombosis, and thus anticoagulant strategies to inhibit thrombogenesis focus on either inhibiting thrombin or its generation. UFH, LMWH and coumarin derivatives (such as warfarin) prevent the generation of thrombin through a variety of mechanisms (<LINK REF="REF-Ansell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansell 2004</LINK>). Heparins (such as UFH and LMWH) exert their anticoagulant activity by activating antithrombin, which subsequently inhibits thrombin (and Factor Xa). Coumarin derivatives (such as warfarin) however, produce their anticoagulant effect by interfering with the cyclic conversion of vitamin K (which is required as a co-factor for the 'carboxylation' of vitamin K dependent proteins, which include a number of coagulation factors); by blocking this process, the coagulation factors that are produced have no/little biological activity. Selective inhibitors of activated Factor Xa (such as fondaparinux), exert their antithrombotic activity by neutralisation of Factor Xa, which interrupts the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting thrombin formation and thrombus development (<LINK REF="REF-Ansell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ansell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Non-pharmacological methods, such as graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression or venous foot pumps have been used for their ability to reduce venous statis and blood stagnation by promoting venous blood flow through external compression (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The pharmacologic agents and non-pharmacologic methods of thromboprophylaxis discussed above have been used, and have been shown to be effective, in reducing the risk of VTE in a variety of non-pregnant patient groups, such as those with chronic illness and in individuals following surgery. The effectiveness of these agents/methods have been demonstrated in a number of Cochrane reviews, for example: the <LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2010</LINK> review supported the use of heparin thromboprophylaxis in medical patients presenting with acute medical illness (with a significant risk reduction in DVT and PE shown); the <LINK REF="REF-Testroote-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Testroote 2008</LINK> review supported the use of LMWH in outpatients to significantly reduce VTE when immobilisation of the lower leg is required; and the <LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2008</LINK> review revealed that compared with compression alone, and compared with pharmacologic prophylaxis, combined prophylactic modalities can significantly decrease the incidence of VTE and DVT respectively.</P>
<P>Despite previously established benefits of these methods of thromboprophylaxis for VTE in non-pregnant patient groups, there is ongoing debate about whether thromboprophylaxis for VTE in pregnancy is cost-effective and beneficial (with particular concern as to whether benefits outweigh the potential harms); routine screening of all pregnant women to identify women with thrombophilias, for example, has not been recommended (<LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>), and antenatal prophylaxis for all women with known thrombophilias remains controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Brenner-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brenner 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Middeldorp-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middeldorp 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Pharmacological methods may cause adverse effects that could be sufficiently severe or common to outweigh the benefits of thromboprophylaxis. Heparin does not cross the placenta and is believed to be safe for the fetus, and therefore, has generally been used for antenatal therapy. However, it can cause adverse effects for the mother (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson_x002d_Piercy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson-Piercy 1997</LINK>); there is a risk of thrombocytopenia (low platelets), bleeding and allergic reactions and symptomatic osteoporosis (loss of bone density, leading to fractures) in the longer term. When used after caesarean section, heparin may increase the frequency of bleeding and wound complications. Originally, UFH was used, but this now appears to have been largely superseded, at least for use in pregnancy and postnatally, by LMWH. The advantages of LMWH over UFH include a longer half-life (allowing once or twice-daily subcutaneous dosing), high bioavailability, and predictable anticoagulant response; avoiding the need for dose adjustment, or laboratory monitoring in most patients. In addition, LMWHs are thought to be associated with a lower risk of adverse effects (e.g. osteoporosis, and thrombocytopenia) (<LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2009</LINK>). Warfarin is known to cause congenital abnormalities (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1980</LINK>) and it has, therefore, rarely been used in the first trimester or in the last few weeks of pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2009</LINK>). Both heparin and warfarin have been used for postnatal thromboprophylaxis, as they have been considered as safe for mothers who are breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Letsky-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Letsky 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orme-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orme 1977</LINK>).</P>
<P>Low-dose (e.g. 60 mg to 75 mg) aspirin has been widely used in pregnancy in an attempt to prevent the development of pre-eclampsia (<LINK REF="REF-Knight-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knight 2001</LINK>). Aspirin is usually well-tolerated and has few adverse effects, and its use for thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery (<LINK REF="REF-PEP-Trial-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">PEP Trial 2000</LINK>) suggests that it may have a role to play in the prevention of VTE in pregnancy (<LINK REF="REF-Bauersachs-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bauersachs 2009</LINK>). Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) has been used for thromboprophylaxis in the past however, it is believed to be no longer in use because of the risk of anaphylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Paull-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paull 1987</LINK>).</P>

<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:12:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>This review updates a previously published Cochrane review on interventions for the prophylaxis of VTE in pregnancy and the early postnatal period (<LINK REF="REF-Tooher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tooher 2010</LINK>), which concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and the early postnatal period, and that large scale randomised trials of currently-used interventions should be conducted.</P>
<P>Thromboembolic disease, although rare, is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity; hence methods of prophylaxis are often used for women at risk. Many methods of prophylaxis carry a risk of adverse effects, and as the risk of VTE is low, it is possible that the benefits of thromboprophylaxis may be outweighed by harm. Current guidelines for clinical practice are based largely on expert opinion, rather than high-quality evidence from randomised trials.</P>
<P>It is therefore important to examine the use of thromboprophylaxis in women who are pregnant or have recently given birth and are at increased risk of VTE, exploring both the incidence of VTE and adverse effects of treatment.</P>

<P>This is one of a series of Cochrane reviews looking at women at increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">(7) Overall risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it is likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses - <I>see </I>

<P>We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2012</LINK>).

Had there been clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or where substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we planned to use random-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment effect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.

<P>For this update, the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group&#8217;s Trials Register identified 20 reports, relating to 14 new studies.

In one trial two women were excluded because of withdrawal of consent (<LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK>), and no data were available for these individuals. In the other trial (<LINK REF="STD-Howell-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Howell 1983</LINK>), the number of exclusions varied between the tables in the original paper, but it was possible from the text to establish the outcomes for all randomised women. In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Casele-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casele 2006</LINK>) 22 of 120 (18%) women were lost to follow-up; however, data were available for some outcomes. As a result, all women were accounted for in some analyses, but not for the main study outcome (bone mass of the proximal femur), and denominators were not always clear.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Primary outcomes</HEADING>
<P>While there were more symptomatic thromboembolic events in the UFH group compared with in the LMWH group, the difference between groups was not statistically significant, and all events occurred in the two groups of one of the four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Casele-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casele 2006</LINK>). There was considerable uncertainty about the treatment effect, suggesting that the studies may have lacked power to detect a difference between groups for this outcome (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.49; four trials, 404 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>).

<P>Considering the need for blood transfusions, there was no difference observed between the antenatal LMWH and UFH groups in one trial of 105 women (<LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK>) (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.47) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.4</LINK>). As the definitions for "bleeding episodes" across the three trials reporting on this outcome varied and/or were unclear, we did not combine results from the individual trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Casele-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Casele 2006</LINK>, no difference between the two groups was shown for "bleeding at delivery", with four of the 60 women in the LMWH experiencing bleeding at delivery compared with one of the 57 women in the UFH group (RR 3.80; 95% CI 0.44 to 32.99; 117 women). In both the <LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK> trials there were more cases of bleeding in the UFH group, compared with the LMWH group. In <LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK>, reporting on "Bruises &gt; 1 inch", there were 39 events among the 60 women in the UFH group, compared with seven events among the 61 women in the LMWH group (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36; 121 women); in <LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK>, measuring "bleeding complications" (which included injection-site haematomas (&#8805; 2 cm in diameter), bleeding during delivery and other bleeding), 35 of the 55 women in the UFH group experienced complications compared with nine of the 50 women in the LMWH group (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53; 105 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.5</LINK>). Caution should be taken when interpreting these results, with both <LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK> being at a high risk of performance bias, and unclear risk of detection bias.</P>
<P>Significantly fewer adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment (including excess bruising/allergic rashes), were observed for LMWH compared with UFH (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54; two trials, 226 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.6</LINK>), however no difference was observed in the <LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK> trial of 121 women in regards to adverse effects not sufficient to stop treatment (injection burning) (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.18) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.7</LINK>).</P>
<P>Fewer fetal losses occurred for women who received LMWH as compared with UFH (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; three trials, 343 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.9</LINK>). While there was no observed statistical heterogeneity for this outcome, the trials that contributed data to this outcome were not of high quality, and the <LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK> trial (with over 60% of the weight in the meta-analysis), has been published in abstract form only, and thus the risk of bias in this trial has largely been judged as unclear (with inadequate information detailed regarding trial methods). This result should thus be interpreted with caution.</P>
<P>No differences were detected between the two groups for the outcomes symptomatic osteoporosis (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.18; two trials, 188 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.8</LINK>) and thrombocytopenia (RR 0.18; 95% CI 0.01 to 3.64; three trials, 287 women) (<LINK REF="CMP-002.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.10</LINK>).

These three trials were included in three different comparisons in the review, comparing different interventions, and thus their results could not be pooled.</P>
<P>When antenatal LMWH was compared to placebo in <LINK REF="STD-Gates-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Gates 2004b</LINK>, no difference was detected for symptomatic thromboembolic events (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.02 to 7.14; 16 women), as in the main analysis (of two trials).</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK> no symptomatic thromboembolic events were observed when antenatal LMWH was compared to UFH, and thus similar to in the main meta-analysis (of four trials), no difference between the two treatments was shown.</P>
<P>When LMWH was compared to placebo for prophylaxis following caesarean section in <LINK REF="STD-Gates-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gates 2004a</LINK>, no differences in symptomatic thromboembolic events or symptomatic PE were shown (for both, the RR was 3.09; 95% CI 0.13 to 74.51; 134 women); similar to in the main analysis of four trials. In <LINK REF="STD-Gates-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gates 2004a</LINK>, no DVT was observed in either group.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:21:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, few differences in any of the seven comparisons were detected from the 16 included studies that contributed data to this review. In particular, we were unable to detect differences in any of the four primary outcomes of the review (maternal death; symptomatic thromboembolic events; symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE); symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT)).</P>
<P>Maternal deaths were reported in only one of the included studies (and no deaths occurred in this trial) (<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2011</LINK>), and symptomatic thromboembolic events, including PE and DVT, were not reported by every included study, so that for many comparisons only one or two studies contributed data to the analyses. As a consequence, given the small number of included studies in each comparison and their relatively small sample sizes, most analyses lacked power to detect differences in these rare outcomes.</P>
<P>For secondary outcomes, many of the included studies did not provide data, and where they did, mostly we did not detect differences between groups. Due to differences in the terminology and definitions used, some comparisons between studies were also difficult. Some results did appear to show differences between the groups. For antenatal prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) seemed to be associated with fewer adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment (including excess bruising/allergic rashes), and fewer fetal losses; and in two trials, LMWH seemed to be associated with fewer bleeding episodes. However, results for these three outcomes were derived from three small studies, and while high rates of bleeding for women receiving UFH were reported in two trials, definitions of bleeding episodes were unclear and varied ("Bruises &gt; 1 inch" (<LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK>); injection-site haematomas (&#8805; 2 cm), bleeding during delivery and other bleeding (<LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK>)). Further, the lack of blinding (or unclear blinding) in these studies means that the potential for bias cannot be excluded (<LINK REF="STD-De-Veciana-2001" TYPE="STUDY">De Veciana 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pettila-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Pettila 1999</LINK>). For prophylaxis for women undergoing caesarean section there was some evidence, from one trial of over 500 women that, compared with placebo control, women receiving UFH had more "complications hémorragiques" (<LINK REF="STD-Welti-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Welti 1981</LINK>). A difference in bleeding episodes (major bleeding/major bruising (<LINK REF="STD-Burrows-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Burrows 2001</LINK>) or bleeding/bruising reported at discharge (<LINK REF="STD-Gates-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Gates 2004a</LINK>)) between groups was not however detected in the other two trials that compared LMWH with placebo for women undergoing caesarean section.</P>
<P>Overall, in view of the small number of studies included, the number of different comparisons, and the generally small sizes of the included trials, there is insufficient evidence of the benefits or harms associated with interventions for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:34:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>As already noted, there is a lack of evidence about key indicators of thromboprophylaxis benefit and harm, in particular maternal mortality. However, we cannot assume that because maternal deaths were largely not reported, that none occurred. There was a general lack of information about the performance of thromboprophylactic agents in regard to other important secondary outcomes such as asymptomatic thromboembolic events (which may be related to rates of symptomatic events) and bleeding complications; and unclear definitions made some comparisons between studies difficult.</P>
<P>None of the included studies focused on mechanical methods of prophylaxis (graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression devices). Furthermore, many of the studies were quite dated and included thromboprophylaxis methods which are no longer used (such as hydroxyethyl starch (<LINK REF="REF-Paull-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Paull 1987</LINK>)), or are not used as frequently in current thromboprophylactic practice (such as the use of UFH rather than LMWH).</P>
<P>In general the sample sizes of the trials were small. The three largest trials recruited 646 women (<LINK REF="STD-Cruz-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Cruz 2011</LINK>), 580 women (<LINK REF="STD-Welti-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Welti 1981</LINK>), and 210 women (<LINK REF="STD-Segal-1975" TYPE="STUDY">Segal 1975</LINK>). Sample sizes of this order are generally inadequate to detect any differences in the incidences of rare outcomes such as thromboembolic events. This is particularly true for trials comparing two thromboprophylactic regimens, rather than comparing prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment (as the difference expected between two methods of prophylaxis is likely to be much smaller than that between prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment). Meta-analysis could not greatly increase the power of individual comparisons because of the variety of different treatments being compared in different populations of women.</P>
<P>The focus of this review was on the prevention of VTE in pregnancy and the postpartum period; further evidence on the use of heparin and other thromboprophylactic drugs on the prevention of miscarriage and other pregnancy outcomes are examined in related Cochrane reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Empson-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Empson 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kaandorp-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kaandorp 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Walker-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walker 2003</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-27 02:01:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The small number of differences detected in this review are largely derived from small trials which are not of high methodological quality. Hence, there is a strong possibility that they may be caused by bias or chance. These results need to be confirmed by larger studies before they can be regarded as reliable. Furthermore, these trials were too small to assess the effects of their interventions on other outcomes such as death and thromboembolic events. It is therefore unsafe to conclude that the interventions that appear superior are in fact to be preferred, as they may have important undetected effects on other outcomes.</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-27 03:49:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The evidence for this review has been derived from trials identified through a detailed search process. It is possible (but unlikely) that additional trials assessing prophylaxis for VTE in pregnancy have been published but not identified. It is also possible that other studies have been conducted but not published. Should such studies be identified we will include them in future updates of this review.</P>
<P>We attempted to reduce bias wherever possible by having at least two review authors independently working on study selection, data extraction and quality assessment.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:35:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Related Cochrane reviews examine pharmacological and non-pharmacological means of thromboprophylaxis in a range of patient groups including those with chronic illness or following surgery (e.g. <LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kakkos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kakkos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ramos-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ramos 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Testroote-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Testroote 2008</LINK>). In a review focusing on thromboprophylaxis in general medical patients, <LINK REF="REF-Alikhan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Alikhan 2010</LINK> et al suggested that both LMWH and UFH may reduce risk of thromboembolism, but are associated with increased risks of both minor and major bleeding episodes; this increased risk of haemorrhage was less with LMWH.</P>
<P>However, reviews that examine outcomes in non-pregnant groups at risk of VTE may not be relevant during pregnancy when the physiological mechanisms controlling blood coagulation are altered, and the risks of VTE and the adverse effects of thromboprophylaxis may be different. Further, during pregnancy the risk to the developing fetus from pharmacologic agents is an important consideration in the choice of method.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:35:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence available from the randomised controlled trials included in this review to guide clinical decision-making. In the absence of clear randomised controlled trial evidence practitioners must rely on consensus-derived clinical practice guidelines or recommendations, such as those produced or endorsed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom (<LINK REF="REF-Hill-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hill 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-RCOG-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">RCOG 2009</LINK>), the American College of Chest Physicians (<LINK REF="REF-Bates-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bates 2008</LINK>), the Australian National Medical Research Council (<LINK REF="REF-NHMRC-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NHMRC 2009</LINK>), the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand and the Australasian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (<LINK REF="REF-McLintock-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McLintock 2012</LINK>) and other international bodies (<LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>).</P>
<P>In a review of guidelines for the prevention of VTE in pregnancy from the United States and other international bodies, eight of the nine guidelines assessed recommended that all women should undergo risk factor assessment for VTE either in pregnancy or preconception; seven of the nine guidelines recommended that pregnant women with more than one additional known VTE risk factor should be considered for thromboprophylaxis (<LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>. The guidelines assessed included those from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP); European Genetics Foundation (EGF); Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Clinical Guidelines Program (QMNC); RCOG; NICE; the French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (SFAR); Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN); Society for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC); and the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET)).</P>
<P>This review also showed variation in regards to recommendations for preventing VTE after caesarean section, for example, with the ACCP recommending against the use of specific thromboprophylaxis (other than early mobilisation) in women with no additional risk factors; NICE recommending combined (pharmacologic and mechanical) prophylaxis; and a number of other organisations (ACCP; RCOG; SIGN; SOGC) recommending initiating thromboprophylaxis for women undergoing caesarean section if additional risk factors are present (<LINK REF="REF-Okoroh-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Okoroh 2012</LINK>).</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-01-24 11:35:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is a clear need for rigorously conducted large scale randomised controlled trials with sample sizes sufficiently large to assess the effects of methods of thromboprophylaxis on rare outcomes such as thromboembolic events (<LINK REF="REF-Barbour-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbour 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2013</LINK>). Future trials should first compare prophylaxis with no prophylaxis and ideally should use a placebo controlled and fully blinded design, to minimise the risk of bias, which may be substantial if clinicians are aware of the allocations. The low number of eligible women makes conducting trials of antenatal thromboprophylaxis extremely challenging. To achieve an adequate sample size, a trial may need to be conducted in a very large number of centres, which might require international collaboration. Trials of prophylaxis after caesarean section may be more feasible, even though the incidence of VTE is lower and the sample size would therefore need to be even larger (<LINK REF="REF-Barbour-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barbour 1997</LINK>). The very high number of caesarean section operations performed means that a trial could be completed within a relatively short time frame and in a reasonable number of centres. Given the difficulties in recruiting women to trials of prophylaxis for VTE in pregnancy and the early postnatal period, if all women being considered for prophylaxis could be randomised (with appropriate informed consent), the required evidence about safety and effectiveness could be obtained.</P>
<P>A number of placebo (or no treatment) controlled trials are currently ongoing (see <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of ongoing studies</LINK>) including one assessing LMWH in women considered at high risk of VTE (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01274637" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01274637</LINK>); one assessing LMWH for prophylaxis in women at moderate to high risk of VTE following caesarean section (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00225108" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00225108</LINK>); and two assessing LMWH for prophylaxis in women with thrombophilia (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00967382" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00967382</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01019655" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01019655</LINK>). Three other ongoing trials are comparing doses of LMWH: in women at high risk of VTE (<LINK REF="STD-NCT00878826" TYPE="STUDY">NCT00878826</LINK>); for the prevention of recurrent VTE in women with a previous history of VTE (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01828697" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01828697</LINK>); and in women with a thrombophilia (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01068795" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01068795</LINK>).</P>
<P>While no completed trials have yet assessed non-pharmacological methods of thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy and the postnatal period, one such pilot study is underway (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01793194" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01793194</LINK>).</P>

<P>The guidelines for anticoagulation during pregnancy and post partum by the American College of Chest Physicians [1] and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists[ 2] are arguably the standard for care in the USA and UK, respectively. Despite the lack of evidence from randomised trials, these opinion-based guidelines recommend anticoagulants in many instances, and they can be referenced in medico-legal cases.</P>
<P>This review appropriately concludes that anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy is not supported by evidence that it is safe and effective. Since anticoagulation carries risks of bleeding, osteoporosis, and fetal deformity, the appropriate implication for practice would be that thromboprophylaxis with anticoagulants should not be used outside of a randomised trial. The implications for research should state that any randomised trial of anticoagulation conducted in pregnant women should be placebo-controlled.</P>

<P>Thanks for these comments. We accept that there remains a need for further randomised trials looking at thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women; as the lack of blinding in previous studies has meant that results are difficult to interpret ideally trials should be placebo-controlled although the use of placebo may not always be practicable or ethical. We acknowledge that anticoagulation carries risk of bleeding, and several related Cochrane reviews provide evidence of this. However, reviews which examine thromboprophylaxis in non-pregnant groups at risk of thromboembolism may not be relevant during pregnancy, as the physiological mechanisms controlling blood coagulation are altered, and the risks of thromboembolic disease and side effects may be different.</P>
<P>In this review, we did not have sufficient evidence from trials to assess the harms and benefits associated with the use of anticoagulants, or with different types of anticoagulant. In the absence of evidence from trials, guidelines based on a range of evidence have been used to underpin clinical practice.<I> </I>While we do not believe it is appropriate for this review to make recommendations about what such guidelines should say, we note under Implications for research, that if all pregnant women being considered for thromboprophylaxis were entered into randomised trials (with appropriate consent) this would help to obtain the needed evidence about safety and effectiveness as quickly as possible.</P>
