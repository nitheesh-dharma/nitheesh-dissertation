<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-23 11:03:44 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>
<B>What is Crohn's disease?</B>
</P>
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It can affect people of any age. When people have active Crohn's disease they experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. When symptoms stop, people are considered to be in remission. Active Crohn's disease can be treated by medical therapy (e.g. drugs such as steroids, immunosuppressives or biologics) or by surgery to removed the diseased portions of the intestine. The goal of medical therapy of Crohn's disease is to induce remission and to maintain this remission for as long as possible.</P>
<P>
<B>What are 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs?</B>
</P>
<P>5-ASA drugs are a group of compounds that are thought to treat Crohn's disease by reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. These drugs are often taken orally (i.e. by mouth).</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers investigate?</B>
</P>
<P>We studied whether oral 5-ASA maintains remission in patients with Crohn's disease and whether it causes any harms (side effects). We searched the medical literature extensively up to 8 June 2016.</P>
<P>
<B>What did the researchers find?</B>
</P>
<P>We found 12 studies that included a total of 2146 participants. Eleven studies including 2014 adult participants compared oral 5-ASA to a placebo (i.e. inactive pills or tablets). One study including 132 children compared oral 5-ASA to a placebo. Eleven studies were conducted for 12 months and one study was conducted for 24 months. Seven studies were judged to be of high quality and the other studies were judged to be of unclear quality because insufficient details were reported to allow for a judgement about quality. The studies with insufficient details were generally older studies that were published 20 or more years ago. A combined analysis of eleven studies including 2014 adult participants found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at daily doses between 1.6 g to 4 g) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 12 months. Similarly, a study including 161 adult participants found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at a dose of 2 g per day) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 24 months. The study involving children found no difference between oral 5-ASA (at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg) and placebo in the proportion of participants who remained in remission at 12 months. There does not appear to be an increased risk of side effects in people who take oral 5-ASA compared to placebo. Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash.</P>
<P>In conclusion, there is no evidence that oral 5-ASA is superior to placebo for helping people with Crohn's disease remain in remission that was achieved by medical therapy.</P>

<P>The prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids, the mainstay of treatment of acute exacerbations, are not effective for maintenance of remission and its chronic use is limited by numerous adverse events.

<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2016-09-23 11:41:22 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>We included randomised controlled trials that compared oral 5-ASA agents to either placebo or sulphasalazine in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease. The trials had to have a treatment duration of at least six months.</P>

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-23 11:41:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Two authors independently extracted data and performed the risk of bias assessment. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of relapse as defined by the primary studies. Secondary outcomes included time to relapse, adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events. We calculated the pooled risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using a fixed-effect model. All data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and drop-outs were considered to be relapses. Sensitivity analyses included an available case analysis where drop-outs were ignored and using a random-effects model. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes using the GRADE criteria. </P>

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-09-23 11:41:19 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Twelve studies (2146 participants) that compared 5-ASA to placebo were included. We did not identify any studies that compared sulphasalazine to placebo. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. The other studies were judged to have an unclear risk of bias for various items due to insufficient details to allow for a judgement. There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Fifty-three per cent (526/998) of 5-ASA patients (dose 1.6 g to 4 g/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 54% (544/1016) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07; 11 studies; 2014 patients; moderate-quality evidence). Sensitivity analyses based on an available case analysis and a random-effects model had no impact on the results. One study found no difference in relapse rates at 24 months. Fifty-four per cent (31/57) of 5-ASA patients (dose 2 g/day) relapsed at 24 months compared to 58% (36/62) of placebo patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.29, 119 patients; low-quality evidence). One paediatric study found no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Sixty-two per cent (29/47) of paediatric 5-ASA patients (dose 50 mg/kg/day) relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (35/55) of paediatric placebo patients (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31; 102 patients; moderate-quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event, withdrawal due to adverse events or serious adverse events. Thirty-four per cent (307/900) of 5-ASA patients had at least one adverse event compared to 33% (301/914) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 10 studies; 1814 patients). Fourteen per cent (127/917) of 5-ASA patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 13% (119/916) of placebo patients (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.38; 9 studies; 1833 patients). One per cent (3/293) of 5-ASA patients had a serious adverse event compared to 0.7% (2/283) of placebo patients (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.83; 3 studies; 576 patients). Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash. </P>

<BODY MODIFIED="2016-09-28 12:00:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:59:13 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Crohn's disease is characterized by chronicity and recurrences. There is no cure for Crohn's disease.Thus, treatment is directed towards inducing and maintaining remission, and addressing complications.</P>
<P>The prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids, the main treatment for acute exacerbations, are not effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhart 2003</LINK>), and long-term use of corticosteroids is limited by numerous adverse events.</P>
<P>5-aminosalicylates are a group of compounds that have long been used in inflammatory bowel disease. The first 5-aminosalicylate agent used in clinical practice was sulphasalazine, which is composed of sulphapyridine linked by an azo bond to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Sulphasalazine was first used in the 1940s as a treatment for arthritis (<LINK REF="REF-Svartz-1942" TYPE="REFERENCE">Svartz 1942</LINK>). Improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms was noted in patients who had concurrent ulcerative colitis leading to further use of this agent in inflammatory bowel disease.</P>
<P>The majority of an oral dose of sulphasalazine reaches the colon where the azo-bond is split by an azo reductase released by colonic bacteria, yielding 5-ASA and sulphapyridine. Virtually all the sulphapyridine is absorbed from the colon whereas most of 5-ASA remains within the colon and is excreted in the stool. Several studies have shown that 5-ASA is the active therapeutic moiety of sulphasalazine and that sulphapyridine acts only as a carrier molecule to deliver 5-ASA to the colon (<LINK REF="REF-Azad-Khan-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Azad Khan 1977</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klotz-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klotz 1980</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-Hees-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">van Hees 1980</LINK>). Yet it is the sulphapyridine which is responsible for most of the severe adverse effects of sulphasalazine (<LINK REF="REF-Schroder-1972" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schroder 1972</LINK>). Sulphapyridine undergoes acetylation in the liver with subsequent excretion in the urine. Slow acetylators show more of the adverse effects of this component secondary to accumulation of sulphapyridine in the blood prior to excretion in the kidneys (<LINK REF="REF-Das-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Das 1973</LINK>).</P>
<P>Recognition that 5-ASA is the active ingredient of sulphasalazine and that sulphapyridine is responsible for most of the side effects led to several investigations of the use of 5-ASA as a single agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. 5-ASA in an unprotected form is, however, readily absorbed in the proximal small intestine (<LINK REF="REF-Myers-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Myers 1987</LINK>), and does not reach the distal bowel in therapeutic concentrations. There have been several formulations of 5-ASA designed to inhibit proximal absorption and to ensure delivery to distal sites of inflammation. There are two basic ways in which 5-ASA can be protected: by linking it to itself or to another carrier and by the use of slow release preparations of 5-ASA. Different 5-ASA preparations may allow delivery of 5-ASA to different locations in the gastrointestinal tract.</P>
<P>5-ASA formulations include azo compounds, mesalazine delayed-release agents and mesalazine slow-release formulations. For azo compounds a carrier molecule is linked to 5-ASA by an azo bond using the same principle as sulphasalazine. Olsalazine consists of two molecules of 5-ASA joined together whilst balsalazide is a pro-drug in which a 5-ASA molecule is linked to 4-aminobenzoyl-B-alanine, an inert and biologically inactive carrier molecule. Like sulphasalazine, the azo bond of these drugs is split in the colon by bacterial azo-reductases, releasing 5-ASA to exert local therapeutic activity. Mesalazine delayed-release agents (Eudragit-coated) are coated with a resin designed to dissolve at a certain pH. Asacol is coated with Eudragit S which dissolves above pH 7.0 to release 5-ASA in the terminal ileum and colon. Eudragit-L coated mesalazine (Salofalk) dissolves above pH 6.0 to release 5-ASA in the terminal ileum and colon. Mesalazine slow-release formulations include drugs such as Pentasa. Pentasa contains microgranules of 5-ASA that are individually coated with ethylcellulose. The microgranules are dispersed in the gut providing a slow, steady release of 5-ASA along the length of the intestine from the upper small bowel to the colon.</P>
<P>These 5-ASA preparations were intended to avoid the adverse side effects of sulphasalazine whilst maintaining its therapeutic benefits. Several randomised controlled trials have been published, comparing various 5-ASA agents to placebo, with conflicting results (<LINK REF="STD-De-Franchis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Franchis 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmud-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>). Three previous meta-analyses have suggested that 5-ASA may be beneficial for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="STD-Camma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Camma 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Messori-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messori 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Steinhart-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhart 1994</LINK>), but in one report the only bibliographic database searched was MEDLINE (<LINK REF="STD-Camma-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Camma 1997</LINK>), and another did not report how the quality of included studies was assessed (<LINK REF="REF-Messori-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Messori 1994</LINK>). Furthermore, a number of recent randomised controlled trials have been published since these meta-analyses were reported. An up to date systematic review using the Cochrane Collaboration format is indicated to summarise the current evidence on the use of 5-ASA agents for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease. When possible, data on outcomes were pooled together for meta-analyses. This systematic review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Akobeng-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Akobeng 2005</LINK>). The use of 5-ASA agents for the prevention of recurrences following surgery for Crohn's disease was not the subject of this review and is covered by a separate systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2011</LINK>).</P>

</SEARCH_METHODS>
<DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:57:20 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>Papers (or abstracts) that appeared to be potentially relevant were identified by two authors (DZ and JKM). The authors (DZ and JKM), after reading the full texts, independently assessed the eligibility of all trials identified using the inclusion criteria above. Disagreement among authors was discussed and agreement reached by consensus.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality assessment</B>
<BR/>The methodological quality of the included studies was independently evaluated by two authors (DZ and JKM) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). Each trial was rated as high, low, or unclear risk of bias for each of the following criteria:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Randomisation sequence generation;</LI>
<LI>Allocation concealment;</LI>
<LI>Blinding;</LI>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data;</LI>
<LI>Selective reporting; and</LI>
<LI>Other sources of bias.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE approach (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>). Randomised trials are considered to provide high quality evidence, but may be downgraded due to: (1) risk of bias, (2) indirectness of evidence, (3) inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity), (4) imprecision (sparse data), and (5) reporting bias (publication bias). The different quality ratings are interpreted as the likelihood that future research would change the effect estimate. Further research is unlikely to change the effect estimate if the evidence is high quality. If the overall evidence is of moderate quality further research may have an impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate when the evidence is rated as low quality. Very low quality research means that we are very uncertain about the finding (<LINK REF="REF-Guyatt-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guyatt 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sch_x00fc_nemann-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schünemann 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>DATA COLLECTION<BR/>A data extraction form was developed and used to extract information on relevant features and results of included studies. Two authors (DZ and JKM) independently extracted and recorded data on the predefined checklist. Extracted data included the following items:</P>
<P>a. characteristics of patients: age, sex, disease distribution, disease duration, disease activity index;<BR/>b. total number of patients originally assigned to each treatment group;<BR/>c. intervention: type and dose of 5-aminosalicylate;<BR/>d. control: placebo, other drugs;<BR/>e. concurrent medications; and<BR/>f. outcomes: time of assessment, length of follow up, type of Crohn's disease activity index used, definitions of remission and relapse, relapse rates, adverse events.</P>
<P>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<BR/>The Cochrane Collaboration review manager (RevMan) software (version 5.3.5) was used for data analysis. Patients with final missing outcomes were assumed to have relapsed. Analyses were grouped by length of follow-up.</P>
<P>Dichotomous variables<BR/>We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled studies for meta-analysis when patients, outcomes, and interventions were deemed to be sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). A fixed-effect model was used to pool data.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity<BR/>Heterogeneity among trial results was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots and by calculating the Chi<SUP>2</SUP> and I<SUP>2</SUP> statistics. We aimed to further investigate potential sources of heterogeneity.<B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Publication Bias<BR/>The possibility of a publication bias was investigated through the construction of funnel plots (trial effects versus trial size).</P>
<P>Sensitivity analyses<BR/>Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the following:<BR/>a. only including patients whose outcome is known (i.e. an available case analysis where the number of patients who completed the study are used as the denominator); and<BR/>b. random-effects versus fixed-effect models.</P>
<P>We also planned to consider the effect of:<BR/>c. allocation concealment;<BR/>d. type of 5 ASA;<BR/>e. dose of 5 ASA; and<BR/>f. concurrent medications (especially immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil).</P>

<P>A literature search conducted on 8 June 2016 identified 10,137 studies. Five additional studies were identified through searching of references. After duplicates were removed a total of 7023 reports remained for review of titles and abstracts. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts and 37 potentially relevant reports on the use of 5-ASA agents for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease were selected for full text review (See <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>). Twenty reports of 15 studies were excluded (See <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of excluded studies</LINK>).

<B>Efficacy</B>
</P>
<P>Occurrence of relapse<BR/>For the main analysis, we used as the denominator the total number of patients randomised. We assumed that participants who dropped out of the study, and on whom there were no post withdrawal information, had relapsed during the study period. There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates in patients who were followed for 12 months. Fifty-three per cent (526/998) of 5-ASA patients relapsed at 12 months compared to 54% (544/1016) of placebo patients (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07; 11 studies; 2014 patients; <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>). No significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33%, P = 0.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to an unknown risk of bias in some studies in the pooled analysis (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). A sensitivity analysis using a random-effects model had little effect on the results (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 24 months. Sixty-eight per cent (54/80) of 5-ASA patients relapsed at 24 months compared to 68% (55/81) of placebo patients (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.23, 1 study; 161 patients). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to an unknown risk of bias (i.e. random sequence generation, allocation concealment and selective reporting) and sparse data (109 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months in the paediatric study (<LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK>). Seventy-four per cent (50/68) of paediatric 5-ASA patients relapsed at 12 months compared to 69% (44/64) of paediatric placebo patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33; 1 study; 132 patients). <B>
<BR/>
</B>
</P>
<P>In further sensitivity analyses, we analysed only participants who completed the study and ignored the dropouts (i.e. an available case analysis). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates in patients who were followed for 12 months. Thirty-eight per cent (263/689) of 5-ASA patients relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% (316/749) of placebo patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01; 11 studies; 1438 patients). Significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%, P = 0.09). A sensitivity analysis using a random-effects model had little effect on the results (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 24 months. Fifty-four per cent (31/57) of 5-ASA patients relapsed at 24 months compared to 58% (36/62) of placebo patients (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.29, 1 study; 119 patients). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months in the paediatric study (<LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK>). Sixty-two per cent (29/47) of paediatric 5-ASA patients relapsed at 12 months compared to 64% (35/55) of paediatric placebo patients (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31; 1 study; 102 patients).</P>
<P>Time to relapse<BR/>Although the initial intention was to summarise time to relapse using the log hazard ratio, since a relationship between treatment and withdrawal of treatment was evident we did not consider this further.</P>
<P>
<B>Safety</B>
</P>
<P>Adverse events<BR/>There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event. Thirty-four per cent (307/900) of 5-ASA patients had at least one adverse event compared to 33% (301/914) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17; 10 studies; 1814 patients; <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>). Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 55%, P = 0.02). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to an unknown risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analysis and unexplained heterogeneity (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Common adverse events reported in the studies included diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmud-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1995</LINK>), nausea or vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1995</LINK>), abdominal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Thomson-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Thomson 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wellman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wellman 1988</LINK>), headache (<LINK REF="STD-Arber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wellman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wellman 1988</LINK>); skin rash (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wellman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Wellman 1988</LINK>), constipation (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>), bloating (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>), loss of appetite (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>), and arthralgia (<LINK REF="STD-Prantera-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Prantera 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>Withdrawal due to adverse events<BR/>There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who withdrew due to an adverse event. Fourteen per cent (127/917) of 5-ASA patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 13% (119/916) of placebo patients (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.38; 9 studies; 1833 patients). Statistically significant heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 55%, P = 0.02). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to an unknown risk of bias in some studies in the pooled analysis and unexplained heterogeneity (See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Common adverse events leading to withdrawal included diarrhoea (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmud-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>), headache (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Arber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>), nausea and vomiting (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>) and abdominal pain (<LINK REF="STD-Anonymous-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anonymous 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Serious adverse events<BR/>There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had a serious adverse event. One per cent (3/293) of 5-ASA patients had a serious adverse event compared to 0.7% (2/283) of placebo patients (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.83; 3 studies; 576 patients). No heterogeneity was detected for this comparison (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%, P = 0.70). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (5 events; See <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>). Of the three studies that reported on serious adverse events, <LINK REF="STD-De-Franchis-1997" TYPE="STUDY">De Franchis 1997</LINK> reported that there were no serious adverse events in either group. There were two serious adverse events in the <LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK> study including one interstitial nephritis in the 5-ASA group and one interstitial pneumopathy in the placebo group. <LINK REF="STD-Mahmud-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmud 2001</LINK> reported three serious adverse events, two in the 5-ASA group and one in the placebo group. None of these serious adverse events were thought to be related to the study medication.</P>
<P>
<B>Subgroup analysis </B>
<BR/>Due to the potential impact of the unknown outcome of patients who withdrew early on the treatment effect, we did not feel it was valid to consider effects within subgroups.</P>
<P>
<B>Heterogeneity</B>
<BR/>When all dropouts are assumed to have relapsed, there was no significant heterogeneity (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 33%; P =0.14) across the 11 trials that followed up participants for 12 months . However, there was significant heterogeneity in the sensitivity analyses where dropouts were ignored (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 40%; P = 0.09). Further investigations of heterogeneity were not felt applicable given the implication of the unknown outcomes on the treatment effect.</P>
<P>
<B>Funnel Plots</B>
<BR/>A funnel plot analysis for the primary outcome (relapse) provides no convincing evidence of publication bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2016-09-28 12:00:14 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>There is no known cure for Crohn's disease, and the disorder is characterised by recurrent flare-ups of symptoms. <LINK REF="REF-Lichtenstein-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lichtenstein 2004</LINK> demonstrated in a recent study that being in remission is associated with improved quality of life in patients with Crohn's disease. Preventing relapses should, therefore, be an important goal in the management of this disease.</P>
<P>Whilst a number of treatment regimens are efficacious in inducing clinical remission in active Crohn's disease, no treatment is available that can completely prevent relapse of the disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Biancone-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Biancone 2003</LINK>). Corticosteroids, the mainstay of treatment for active Crohn's disease are not effective as maintenance therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Steinhart-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Steinhart 2003</LINK>). Although the antimetabolites, 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine are effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, these drugs might cause significant adverse events (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2003</LINK>). Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor, is an effective maintenance therapy for patients with Crohn's disease with or without fistulas (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rutgeerts-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rutgeerts 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sands-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sands 2004</LINK>). Methotrexate is also effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (<LINK REF="REF-Feagan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Feagan 2000</LINK>). 5-ASA preparations have been found to be superior to placebo for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Wang-2016" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wang 2016</LINK>), but its efficacy in Crohn's disease is controversial (<LINK REF="REF-Sandborn-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sandborn 2003</LINK>). Randomised controlled trials which compared 5-ASA agents with placebo for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease have yielded conflicting results (de Franchis 1997; <LINK REF="STD-Gendre-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Gendre 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mahmud-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mahmud 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sutherland-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Sutherland 1997</LINK>). In this review, we have summarised the findings of available randomised controlled trials on the subject.</P>
<P>For the main analyses, we used as the denominator the total number of patients randomised, and assumed that participants who dropped out of the study, and on whom there were no post withdrawal information, had relapsed during the study period. This main analysis demonstrated that, in 11 randomised controlled trials where 2014 participants were followed up for 12 months, there was no statistically significant difference between 5-ASA agents and placebo with regard to the prevention of relapse (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07). A GRADE analysis indicates that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate. Sensitivity analyses using a random-effects model and an available case analysis had no impact on the results. A single paediatric study (132 participants) did not find any difference in relapse rates between 5-ASA and placebo treated participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK>). A single study in which patients were followed up for 24 months also did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in relapse rates between the two groups in either the main analysis or sensitivity analyses. We therefore found no evidence from this study to suggest that 5-ASA agents are superior to placebo for maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease.</P>
<P>The primary studies had a number of limitations. The drop-out rates in most studies were quite high and as no follow-up information was available on these patients, we assumed in the main analysis that drop out patients had relapsed. Exactly how this assumption might have affected the results of the meta-analysis is unclear. This highlights the importance of following-up patients after they withdraw from a study. The assessment of disease activity was not uniform amongst the primary studies. Whilst 10 of the included studies used the CDAI to measure disease activity, two studies used the Harvey Bradshaw Index (<LINK REF="STD-Arber-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Arber 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cezard-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Cezard 2009</LINK>). The studies which used CDAI defined relapse as a CDAI &gt; 150 or a variable minimum rise in the CDAI score between 50 and 100 points from baseline along with a CDAI &gt; 150.</P>
<P>We found no evidence to suggest that more adverse events occurred in patients on 5-ASA agents compared to placebo. Although the reporting of adverse events was somewhat inconsistent across the studies we were able to pool data for the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse events. There was no statistically significant differences between 5-ASA and placebo for any of these outcomes. GRADE analyses indicate that the overall quality of the evidence supporting these outcomes was low.</P>
<P>Different preparations and different doses of 5-ASA were used in the included studies. The doses ranged from 1 g to 3 g per day. A linear dose-response relationship has been suggested for 5-ASA agents in the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (<LINK REF="REF-Hanauer-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanauer 2004</LINK>). None of the included studies compared different doses of 5-ASA, and there was no evidence to suggest that studies which used higher doses of 5-ASA preparations demonstrated greater benefits or more adverse events. There was no strong indication to suggest that more adverse events occurred in patients on 5-ASA agents compared to placebo. Future studies should report adverse events in a more consistent manner.</P>
<P>We found no evidence in this review to suggest that 5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in Crohn's disease. The use of 5-ASA agents for the prevention of recurrences following surgery for Crohn's disease was not the subject of this review and has been assessed in a separate systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Gordon-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gordon 2011</LINK>).</P>

<P>We found no evidence in this review to suggest that 5-ASA preparations are superior to placebo for the maintenance of medically-induced remission in patients with Crohn's disease. The incidence of adverse events did not appear to be different in patients receiving 5-ASA compared with those receiving placebo. </P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-09-28 11:49:21 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="John K MacDonald">
<P>The effect sizes that were found even when drop-outs were ignored were small. Therefore it appears that additional randomised trials may not be justified. Any further studies of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease should ensure allocation concealment and complete follow-up of patients, and include more detailed and standardised reporting of safety results. A more uniform way of measuring relapse should also be adopted. </P>
