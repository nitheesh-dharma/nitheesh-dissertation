<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:53:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>
<B>Background</B>
</P>
<P>Very preterm (less than 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (less than 1500 g) infants are at risk of developing a severe bowel disorder called necrotising enterocolitis, where parts of the bowel become inflamed and start to die. One possible way to prevent this condition is to delay the introduction of milk feeds until several days (or longer) after birth.</P>
<P>
<B>Study characteristics</B>
</P>
<P>We search scientific databases for clinical trials assessing the effect of delayed (more than four days after birth) versus earlier introduction of progressive enteral feeds (where breast or formula milk is fed directly by a tube into the stomach) on the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis, death and general health in very low birth weight infants. The evidence is current to September 2014.</P>
<P>
<B>Key results</B>
</P>
<P>We found nine trials with 1106 infants that assessed the effect of delayed rather than early introduction of milk feeds for very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Data from these trials did not provide any evidence that delaying enteral feeding reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
</P>
<P>The included trials were generally of reasonable methodological quality but, in common with other trials of feeding interventions in infants, it was not possible to mask carers and clinical assessors to the given treatment. </P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2014-11-19 12:59:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The introduction of enteral feeds for very preterm (less than 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (VLBW; less than 1500 g) infants is often delayed for several days or longer after birth due to concern that early introduction may not be tolerated and may increase the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). However, delaying enteral feeding could diminish the functional adaptation of the gastrointestinal tract and prolong the need for parenteral nutrition with its attendant infectious and metabolic risks.</P>

</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2014-11-19 12:53:40 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and undertook data extraction. We analysed the treatment effects in the individual trials and reported the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference for dichotomous data and mean difference for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used a fixed-effect model in meta-analyses and explored the potential causes of heterogeneity in sensitivity analyses.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-19 13:03:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We identified nine randomised controlled trials in which 1106 infants participated. Few participants were extremely preterm (less 28 weeks' gestation) or extremely low birth weight (less than 1000 g). The trials defined delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds as later than four to seven days after birth and early introduction as four days or less after birth. Meta-analyses did not detect statistically significant effects on the risk of NEC (typical RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; 8 trials; 1092 infants) or all-cause mortality (typical RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.88; 7 trials; 967 infants). Four of the trials restricted participation to growth-restricted infants with Doppler ultrasound evidence of abnormal fetal circulatory distribution or flow. Planned subgroup analyses of these trials found no statistically significant effects on the risk of NEC or all-cause mortality. Infants who had delayed introduction of enteral feeds took longer to establish full enteral feeding (reported median differences two to four days).</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-19 13:00:53 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The evidence available from randomised controlled trials suggested that delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds beyond four days after birth did not reduce the risk of developing NEC in very preterm or VLBW infants, including growth-restricted infants. Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds resulted in a few days' delay in establishing full enteral feeds but the clinical importance of this effect was unclear. The applicability of these findings to extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight was uncertain. Further randomised controlled trials in this population may be warranted.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-11-19 12:56:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and neuro-disability in very preterm (less than 32 weeks' gestation) or very low birth weight (VLBW: less than 1500 g) infants. Extremely low birth weight (ELBW: less than 1000 g) and extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks' gestation) infants are at greatest risk (<LINK REF="REF-Bisquera-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bisquera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Holman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Holman 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Rees-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Rees 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Berrington-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berrington 2012</LINK>). Intrauterine growth restriction may be an additional specific risk factor, especially if associated with circulatory redistribution demonstrated by absent or reversed end-diastolic flow velocities in antenatal Doppler studies of the fetal aorta or umbilical artery (<LINK REF="REF-Bernstein-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bernstein 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Garite-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garite 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Dorling-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dorling 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kamoji-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kamoji 2008</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2014-11-19 12:57:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Most very preterm or VLBW infants who develop NEC have received enteral milk feeds. Evidence exists that feeding with artificial formula rather than human milk increases the risk of developing NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2014</LINK>). The timing of the introduction and the rate of progression of enteral feed volumes may also be modifiable risk factors for the development of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Uauy-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Uauy 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Henderson-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Henderson 2009</LINK>). Data from observational studies suggest that using feeding regimens that include delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds until beyond about four to seven days after birth reduces the risk of NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Patole-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2008</LINK>).</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:10:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>In current clinical practice, the introduction of progressive enteral feeds for very preterm or VLBW infants is often preceded by a period of enteral fasting or 'minimal enteral nutrition' (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Patole-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Klingenberg-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Klingenberg 2012</LINK>). However, there may also be potential disadvantages associated with delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds. Because gastrointestinal hormone secretion and motility are stimulated by enteral milk, delayed enteral feeding could diminish the functional adaptation of the gastrointestinal tract (<LINK REF="REF-Berseth-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berseth 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Burrin-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burrin 2002</LINK>). Prolonging the duration of use of parenteral nutrition may be associated with infectious and metabolic complications that increase mortality and morbidity, prolong hospital stay, and adversely affect growth and development (<LINK REF="REF-Flidel_x002d_Rimon-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flidel-Rimon 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Stoll-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Stoll 2004</LINK>). It has been argued that the risk of NEC should not be considered in isolation of these other potential clinical outcomes when determining feeding policies and practice for very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Flidel_x002d_Rimon-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flidel-Rimon 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hay-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hay 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hartel-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hartel 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review focused on the comparison of delayed versus earlier introduction of progressive enteral feeding; that is, advancing the volume of milk feeds beyond minimal enteral nutrition levels. We addressed the effect of minimal enteral nutrition, the early introduction of small volume enteral feeds (up to 24 mL/kg/day) without advancing the feed volumes for at least five days versus enteral fasting in another Cochrane review (<LINK REF="REF-Morgan-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morgan 2013a</LINK>).</P>

<QUALITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-19 14:01:48 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We used the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of any included trials (<A HREF="http://neonatal.cochrane.org/">neonatal.cochrane.org/</A>). We requested additional information from the trial authors to clarify methodology and results as necessary. We evaluated and reported the following issues in the 'Risk of bias' tables:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Sequence generation: we categorised the method used to generate the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk: any random process (e.g. random number table, computer random number generator);</LI>
<LI>high risk: any non-random process (e.g. odd or even date of birth, participant case-record number);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Allocation concealment: we categorised the method used to conceal the allocation sequence as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);</LI>
<LI>high risk (e.g. open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Blinding: we assessed blinding of participants, clinicians and carers, and outcome assessors separately for different outcomes and categorised the methods as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk;</LI>
<LI>high risk;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>
</OL>
<LI>Incomplete outcome data: we described the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis for each outcome and any reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported. We assessed whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses. We categorised completeness as:</LI>
<OL>
<LI>low risk: less than 20% missing data;</LI>
<LI>high risk: 20% or greater missing data;</LI>
<LI>unclear risk.</LI>

<EFFECT_MEASURES MODIFIED="2014-11-19 13:59:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>We calculated risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We planned to determine the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or additional harmful outcome (NNTH) for any statistically significant differences in the RD.</P>

<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2014-11-19 14:01:19 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>If we included more than one trial in a meta-analysis, we examined the treatment effects of individual trials and heterogeneity between trial results by inspecting the forest plots. We calculated the I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic for each analysis to quantify inconsistency across studies and describe the percentage of variability in effect estimates that may be due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. If we detected substantial (I<SUP>2</SUP> greater than 50%) heterogeneity, we explored the possible causes (e.g. differences in study design, participants, interventions or completeness of outcome assessments) in sensitivity analyses.</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2014-11-20 09:43:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Analyses of data from nine randomised controlled trials with 1106 infants did not provide evidence that delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds reduced the risk of NEC. The boundaries of the 95% CI for the estimate of effect are consistent with either four fewer or three extra cases of NEC in every 100 infants who had delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds. Meta-analysis of data from these trials did not indicate an effect on all-cause mortality with the 95% CI boundaries being consistent with either two fewer or four more deaths in every 100 infants who had delayed introduction of progressive enteral feeds. Similarly, pre-specified subgroup meta-analyses showed no effect of delayed introduction of enteral feeds on NEC or mortality in infants with growth restriction or antenatal evidence of absent end-diastolic flow velocities.</P>
<P>Infants who had delayed introduction of feeds achieved full enteral feeding several days later than infants who had earlier introduction. Whether this was associated with important clinical adverse consequences, such as a higher rate of nosocomial infection secondary to prolonged use of parenteral nutrition or a longer duration of hospital admission, remains unclear.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:22:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>These data are relevant to current practice since most of the included trials were conducted in the 2000s with infants receiving 'modern' antenatal care including exposure to antenatal corticosteroids and exogenous surfactant, interventions that reduce the risk of NEC or death in this population (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Seger-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seger 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Soll-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Soll 2010</LINK>). Four of these trials specifically recruited infants thought to be at higher risk of developing NEC due to intrauterine growth restriction and abnormal fetal circulatory distribution or flow. This widens the applicability of the findings since this is the population for which most clinical uncertainty and variation in practice with regard to early feeding strategies exists (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2004</LINK>). Previously, this population of infants has been specifically excluded from participating in many trials of early enteral feeding practices (<LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Evidence exists that artificial formula feeding increases the risk NEC (<LINK REF="REF-Quigley-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Quigley 2014</LINK>). The risk-benefit balance of enteral feeding strategies may differ between human milk-fed and formula-fed very preterm or VLBW infants. Currently there are insufficient data to comment on whether there is a differential effect of the timing of the introduction of enteral feeds depending on whether infants received human breast milk versus formula.</P>
<P>It is also unclear whether the findings can be applied to infants who receive continuous infusion of intragastric feeds, as most of the infants in the included trials received enteral feeds as interval gastric boluses. Randomised controlled trials have reported conflicting findings about the effect on continuous enteral infusion on feed tolerance in VLBW (and especially ELBW) infants (<LINK REF="REF-Premji-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Premji 2011</LINK>).</P>
<P>Most of the included trials were undertaken in neonatal care centres in middle- or high-income countries. It is less clear how applicable this evidence is to neonatal care practices in low-income countries. Conservative strategies, such as delayed introduction of enteral feeds, may confer substantial nutritional disadvantage in settings with less technologically developed healthcare provision where adjunctive parenteral nutrition is not readily and safely available. In some low- or middle-income countries where severe infection (diarrhoea, pneumonia, septicaemia) is a much more important cause of mortality and morbidity, the nutritional and immunological advantages of early feeding, particularly with breast milk, may outweigh any risks associated with enteral feeding for very preterm or VLBW infants (<LINK REF="REF-Narayanan-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Narayanan 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-de-Silva-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">de Silva 2004</LINK>). We identified two feasibility trials undertaken in India in the late 2000s/early 2010s that compared exclusive enteral feeding (no parenteral fluid) from birth with gradual introduction of enteral feeds over several days in VLBW infants with birth weight greater than 1000 g (<LINK REF="STD-Sanghvi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Sanghvi 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chetry-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Chetry 2014</LINK>). While these trials were not eligible for inclusion in this review, neither found evidence of an effect on NEC or other adverse outcomes.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2014-11-20 09:34:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The included trials were generally of reasonable methodological quality but, in common with other trials of feeding interventions in this population, it was not possible to mask carers and clinical assessors to the nature of the intervention. Although the lack of blinding may have resulted in surveillance and ascertainment biases, this is more likely to have caused an underestimation of the incidence of NEC in infants whose enteral feeding was delayed. The assessment of abdominal radiographs was masked in three studies to ensure that the diagnosis of stage II/III NEC (confirmed by the radiological detection of gas in the bowel wall or portal tract) was not prone to bias. However, since the microbial generation of gas in the bowel wall is substrate dependent, infants who received more enteral milk (substrate) may have been more likely to demonstrate this radiological sign than infants with equally severe bowel disease who had less intraluminal substrate. This 'substrate effect' is also more likely to cause under-ascertainment of NEC in the infants whose enteral feeding was delayed (<LINK REF="REF-Tyson-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tyson 2007</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2014-11-20 14:59:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The definition of delayed introduction of progressive feeds may vary between different subpopulations of very preterm or VLBW infants who have different empiric risks for developing feed intolerance and NEC. The effects of enteral feeding are likely to be very different for a mechanical ventilator-dependent or inotrope-dependent infant of birth weight less than 700 g compared with a clinically stable infant of birth weight greater than 1400 g. For this Cochrane review, we defined delayed introduction as later than four days after birth since some observational studies have found the risk of NEC to be lower when feeds are introduced five to seven days after birth (<LINK REF="REF-Patole-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Patole 2005</LINK>). For ELBW or extremely preterm infants, it may be more appropriate to define delayed introduction as more than seven days after birth (or even later). Small-intestinal motility is poorly organised before about 28 weeks' gestation resulting in a higher risk of feed intolerance. In addition, enteral feeds are often delayed in this population because of respiratory or metabolic instability or because of other putative risk factors for NEC, such as the existence of a patent ductus arteriosus, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the presence of an umbilical arterial catheter (<LINK REF="REF-Boyle-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Boyle 2004</LINK>).</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2014-11-20 15:00:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2014-11-20 09:38:29 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>The available data from randomised controlled trials do not provide evidence that delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds beyond four days after birth reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), mortality, and other morbidities in very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Delaying the introduction of progressive enteral feeds may result in several days' delay in establishing full enteral feeds but the long-term clinical importance of these effects is unclear. Subgroup analyses of trials in which participating infants had evidence of intrauterine growth restriction or abnormal circulatory distribution or flow did not find any statistically significant effects. However, only limited data are available on the effect of this intervention on outcomes for extremely preterm or extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2014-11-20 15:00:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne Lawson">
<P>Further randomised controlled trials of delayed versus early introduction of progressive enteral feeds could provide more precise estimates of the effects on important outcomes for extremely preterm or ELBW infants. With regard to stable VLBW infants with birth weight greater than 1000 g (or very preterm infants with gestational age 28 to 31 weeks), the key research question is now whether exclusive enteral feeding from birth is better than gradual introduction.</P>
<P>Masking carers and investigators to the nature of this intervention is unlikely to be possible. Since the unblinded evaluation of feed intolerance and NEC is subject to surveillance and ascertainment biases, trials could aim to assess more objective outcomes, principally mortality and long-term growth and development. Furthermore, since conservative feeding strategies may result in other 'competing outcomes', such as invasive infection that may affect long-term survival and neuro-disability rates, it is essential that trials are powered and structured to assess these outcomes.</P>
