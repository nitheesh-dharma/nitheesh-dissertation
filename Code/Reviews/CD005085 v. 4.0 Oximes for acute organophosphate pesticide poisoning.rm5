<TITLE>No evidence that oximes are a useful treatment for organophosphate pesticide poisoning</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2010-10-21 05:54:04 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nick A Buckley">
<P>Many thousands of people die every year because of poisoning by organophosphate pesticides. Most of the deaths are in developing countries. Drugs known as oximes are used as part of the standard recommended treatment, even though many doctors have said that they don't seem to have any benefit. This research has produced mixed evidence. Many of the studies had substantial limitations. Generally, the studies done to date do not support the routine use of oximes, however, they cannot exclude that there would be some doses or situations where a benefit would occur. The reviewers found that not enough research has been done to see whether oximes are actually effective or to define the doses that are more likely to be helpful. More research is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-17 02:46:54 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nick A Buckley">
<P>Acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning causes tens of thousands of deaths each year across the developing world. Standard treatment involves administration of intravenous atropine and oxime to reactivate inhibited acetylcholinesterase. The clinical usefulness of oximes, such as pralidoxime and obidoxime, has been challenged over the past 20 years by physicians in many parts of the world.</P>

<P>To quantify the effectiveness and safety of the administration of oximes in acute organophosphorus pesticide-poisoned patients.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2011-01-14 13:13:13 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>We searched both English and Chinese databases: Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (<I>The Cochrane Library</I>), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and the Chinese language databases CNKI and WANGFANG.

<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2011-01-19 17:43:21 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>The published methodology of three RCTs was not clear. We contacted the principal authors of these, but did not obtain further information.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2011-01-17 03:12:34 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nick A Buckley">
<P>Seven pralidoxime RCTs were found. Three RCTs including 366 patients studied pralidoxime vs placebo and four RCTs including 479 patients compared two or more different doses. These trials found quite disparate results with treatment effects ranging from benefit to harm. However, many studies did not take into account several issues important for outcomes. In particular, baseline characteristics were not balanced, oxime doses varied widely, there were substantial delays to treatment, and the type of organophosphate was not taken into account. Only one RCT compared the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended doses with placebo. This trial showed no clinical benefits and a trend towards harm in all sub-groups, despite clear evidence that these doses reactivated acetylcholinesterase in the blood.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-19 17:26:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Current evidence is insufficient to indicate whether oximes are harmful or beneficial. The WHO recommended regimen (30 mg/kg pralidoxime chloride bolus followed by 8 mg/kg/hr infusion) is not supported. Further RCTs are required to examine other strategies and regimens. There are many theoretical and practical reasons why oximes may not be useful, particularly for late presentations of dimethyl OP and those with a large excess of OP that simply re-inhibits reactivated enzymes. Future studies should screen for patient sub-groups that may benefit and may need flexible dosing strategies as clinical effectiveness and doses may depend on the type of OP.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2011-01-14 13:14:50 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Acute poisoning with organophosphorus pesticides causes severe toxicity. They act primarily by inhibiting an enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) in the nervous system. Oximes are drugs designed to reactivate this enzyme.</P>
<P>Deliberate self-poisoning has reached epidemic proportions in parts of the developing world where the toxicity of available poisons and sparse medical facilities ensure a high fatality rate (<LINK REF="REF-Murray-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Murray 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2000</LINK>). Many deaths are due to organophosphorus pesticides (OP) and occur in the young economically active age group (<LINK REF="REF-Singh-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-der-Hoek-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van der Hoek 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2003</LINK>). Case fatality of &gt;20% is commonly reported and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 200,000 people die each year from pesticide poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-WHO-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">WHO 1990</LINK>). Even higher figures have been estimated based on more recent data (<LINK REF="REF-Gunnell-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gunnell 2007</LINK>). Unfortunately, the widespread use of OP pesticides in the developing world's agricultural communities will make reduction of deaths by primary prevention a difficult task.</P>
<P>OP pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the muscarinic and nicotinic synapses by depositing a phosphoryl group at the enzyme's active site. This results in an accumulation of acetylcholine and uncontrolled activation of cholinergic synapses. Standard therapy involves attempts to reduce absorption with gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal, plus administration of atropine and oxime to counter the effects of absorbed pesticide (<LINK REF="REF-Ballantyne-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ballantyne 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2008</LINK>). The use of high doses of atropine is well established, the use of oximes more controversial.</P>
<P>Oximes reactivate acetylcholinesterase by removing the phosphoryl group. Pralidoxime is the oxime most often used worldwide and occurs in four forms: pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM; molecular weight 173; used worldwide), pralidoxime mesylate (P2S; MW 232; used in the UK), pralidoxime metilsulfate (MW 248) and pralidoxime iodide (MW 264; used in Japan, India &amp; Australia) (<LINK REF="REF-Eyer-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyer 2008</LINK>). The great majority of its effects are on the peripheral nervous system since its lipid solubility is low and entry into the CNS limited. Atropine works at muscarinic synapses, competitively antagonising the accumulated acetylcholine. The main therapeutic effect of pralidoxime is predicted to be recovery of neuromuscular transmission at nicotinic synapses.</P>
<P>In vitro experiments have shown that oximes are effective reactivators of human AChE inhibited by OP compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Worek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1996</LINK>). In some situations, however, reactivation of inhibited AChE by oximes will likely be absent or limited, for example where there is:</P>
<OL>
<LI>poor affinity for the particular OP-AChE complex</LI>
<LI>insufficient dose or duration of treatment</LI>
<LI>persistence of the OP within the patient and therefore rapid re-inhibition of newly reactivated enzyme <I>and</I>
</LI>
<LI>ageing of the inhibited AChE (<LINK REF="REF-Willems-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willems 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiermann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiermann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eyer-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eyer 2009</LINK>).</LI>
</OL>
<P>In 1961, Sundwall reported that the minimum effective plasma concentration of P2S was 4 mg/L in cats poisoned with a quaternary analogue of the nerve agent sarin (<LINK REF="REF-Sundwall-1961" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sundwall 1961</LINK>). This result has since been uncritically extrapolated to all oxime and OP interactions. It has now become clear, however, that the degree of reactivation is dependent on the specific identity and concentrations of both the oxime and OP (<LINK REF="REF-Willems-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willems 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worek-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>). For example, most OP pesticides can be classified as compounds that form either a dimethylphosphoryl- or a diethylphosphoryl-AChE complex. In vitro studies have shown that while seven times as much pralidoxime as obidoxime is required for reactivation of dimethyl-OP inhibited AChE, diethyl-OPs require 20 times more pralidoxime than obidoxime (<LINK REF="REF-Thiermann-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiermann 1999</LINK>). Both reactivation and ageing are significantly slower for diethyl-OP inhibited AChEs than the dimethyl analogue. In addition, OP are a highly variable toxicological class in many other respects. This is reflected both in very large differences in their case-fatality (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2005</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-Dawson-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dawson 2010</LINK>), and also in very marked differences in the timecourse of AChE inhibition and resulting spectrum of adverse effects (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2009a</LINK>). Thus in evaluating the evidence, particularly where it appears to be conflicting, it is necessary to consider the possibility that any effects of oximes are not consistent across all OPs.</P>
<P>The 'ageing' of inhibited AChE is particularly important since aged enzyme cannot be reactivated by oximes. Ageing refers to a process whereby phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase may lose an alkyl side chain non-enzymatically, leaving a hydroxyl group in its place. Regeneration is then no longer possible. The therapeutic window for oximes is, therefore, very much determined by the rate of ageing. The half-life of ageing of dimethylphosphorylated and diethlyphosphorylated AChE, as determined in isolated human red cells in vitro, is 3.7 hours and 33 hours, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Worek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worek-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1999</LINK>) and the therapeutic window therefore (taken as four times the half-life of ageing) is a maximum of 13 or 132 hours, respectively (<LINK REF="REF-Bismuth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bismuth 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1997</LINK>). For some other OP classes ageing may be much quicker than this and therapeutic window closed at the time the patient arrives to hospital (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2009a</LINK>). Clinical data of OP-poisoned patients treated with obidoxime illustrate the importance of poison load, time elapsing between poisoning and oxime administration, and influence of the poison type (in particular dimethyl versus diethyl) on the effectiveness of reactivation of erythrocyte AChE in vivo (<LINK REF="REF-Thiermann-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiermann 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>However, clinical experience in the developing world has led to doubt about the clinical relevance of oximes for any form of OP poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Nalin-1973" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nalin 1973</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ganendran-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ganendran 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-du-Toit-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">du Toit 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Delilkan-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Delilkan 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1992" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Singh-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Singh 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Sungur-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Sungur 2001</LINK>). In particular, Senanayake's group, using a historical control design, reported no difference in outcome in Sri Lanka when pralidoxime was unavailable in their hospital (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1992" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1992</LINK>). They argued that pralidoxime was of no clinical benefit and should not be used. Proponents of oximes responded that these physicians were using too low a dose and that a loading dose of at least 30 mg/kg followed by an infusion of &gt;8 mg/kg/hr was required for clinical benefit (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Vale-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Vale 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>).</P>

<P>The Injuries Group Trials Search Co-ordinator ran the searches and collated the search results before passing them on to the review authors (ME &amp; JR) for screening. All randomised controlled trials involving acute poisoning with organophosphorus compounds treated with oximes, regardless of severity, with adequate or unclear allocation concealment were examined. Two authors (ME &amp; JR) independently completed the GRADE evaluation and summary of findings table with any differences resolved by a third reviewer (NB).</P>
<P>In total, we found five published RCTs in English (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). There were also conference abstracts describing small clinical studies, where the methodology is unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Dadan-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Dadan 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Duval-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Duval 1991</LINK>). We think these very small studies are very unlikely to be RCTs and were excluded after attempts to contact the authors failed to yield a response to clarify the methodology. All identified studies assessed pralidoxime; clinical trials of obidoxime or other oximes have not been reported.</P>
<P>For this 2010 update, two reviewers (JR &amp; MB) independently extracted from each trial information on the number of randomised patients, types of participants, the dose and duration of the intervention, and the primary and secondary outcomes of the trial. YL performed the same procedure on the Chinese studies identified through Chinese language database searches. A pooled odds ratio (OR) for the presence of death, intermediate syndrome and pneumonia were calculated using a random effects model if more than one adequate quality trial included the same comparison (e.g. pralidoxime vs placebo) and outcome. A random effects model was chosen on the basis that the settings, types of OP ingested and doses of oxime vary extremely widely so a fixed effect model cannot be justified. Subgroup analysis based on type of organophosphorus compound (dimethyl vs diethyl) and time to treatment was to be included if possible.</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Samuel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel 1995</LINK>
<BR/>The first trial in 72 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit was carried out between August 1991 and November 1992 at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India. There was no untreated control group. A 1-g bolus of pralidoxime (termed 'low-dose') was compared with 12 g given as a reducing infusion over four days without a loading dose (termed 'high-dose').</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cherian-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cherian 1997</LINK>
<BR/>The dates of this second trial from the Vellore group are not given in either publication. Following on from Samuel 1995, it compared 'high-dose' pralidoxime (i.e. a total of 12 g by continuous infusion over 3 days without loading dose) with placebo saline infusion in 110 patients. Although the published details are incomplete, it appears that a different dosage regimen to that of Samuel 1995 was used: 12 g over three days.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Cherian-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Cherian 2005</LINK>
</P>
<P>This third study from Vellore largely explored the biochemical effects of pralidoxime on butylcholinesterase (BuChE) and the correlations of BuChE activity with severity. Just 21 patients were included and the dose of pralidoxime in the treatment arm varied (either 4g/day or 12g /day was given) based on the severity of poisoning. While OP bind to and inhibit BuChE in plasma and it is a widely available biomarker of exposure, the inhibition of this enzyme itself is not believed to be a causal factor in any clinical features. Further, different OP have widely varying preferences for inhibiting BuChE vs. AChE so the OP ingested must be known for it to be used as a marker of severity (<LINK REF="REF-Eddleston-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Eddleston 2008a</LINK>). Thus, even the results on BuChE are difficult to interpret.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2006</LINK>
</P>
<P>This study was conducted in a private hospital ICU in India. Unusually, patients purchased their own pralidoxime for the RCT from outside local pharmacies. This was assumed to be pralidoxime iodide although there obviously could not be effective control over the trial product or blinding. 200 patients with moderate OP poisoning were enrolled. All patients received a 2 gram loading dose of pralidoxime before randomisation to "low dose" (standard treatment control) and "high dose" groups. This standard "low dose" (6g/day) was actually substantially higher than the highest dose in the first two Vellore studies. The high dose was higher than previously recommended by the WHO: 1g/hr for the first 48h. Both groups then continued on standard treatment (6g/day) until weaned from ventilation. The overall mortality for OP poisoning admitted to ICU was remarkably low, but particularly so in the high dose group (1%). The patients had presented early to hospital (median 2 hours). Those who were most severely ill on presentation were excluded. There was a very high level of supportive care (e.g. all were admitted to ICU and 66% of these moderately-severely poisoned patients were intubated at baseline). No mechanistic data were available to demonstrate whether the higher dose of pralidoxime had a greater effect on neuromuscular function or acetylcholinesterase activity.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK>
</P>
<P>This Wellcome Trust funded study was conducted in two hospitals in Sri Lanka. A high fixed regimen based on WHO guidelines (2g bolus then 500mg/hr for up to 7 days) was used in all patients in the treatment arm. Controls received a placebo infusion. As well as the clinical outcomes (discussed below), the pralidoxime concentrations achieved and the reactivation of red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (RBC-AChE) were measured to document that apparently effective doses were given. The trial was originally planned with a sample size of 1500. However, delays in starting the study due to a global shortage of pralidoxime after Sept 11 2001, and a substantial fall off in recruitment after the <LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2006</LINK> study was published, lead to it being prematurely terminated after just 235 patients were enrolled. Measures of RBC-AChE activity indicated the regimen was effective in reactivating AChE particularly for diethyl-OP. The mean pralidoxime concentrations achieved were in the target range predicted, however, there was substantial variability.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Zhu-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Zhu 2006</LINK>
</P>
<P>This very small RCT enrolled 24 patients presenting to an emergency medicine service in China compared two regimens of pralidoxime, with one arm being given roughly double the dose of the other arm and both being reduced over time.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Gu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gu 2008</LINK>
</P>
<P>This RCT enrolled 187 patients also from an emergency medicine service in China. The report is of a very complex three arm trial with each arm having two different flexible dosing strategies (for moderate and severely poisoned patients). The means of measuring severity was not explicit. Further not only were three different dosing strategies being compared but also different routes of administration (IV vs. IM). The randomised ratio appears to be highly unusual (roughly 3:3:4) and was stated to be based on "Arabic numbers".</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Overall comments on included studies</HEADING>
<P>These last two trials were only reported in Chinese and this raised many difficulties in resolving what methodology had been used. For example, it is not clear the Chinese characters denoting random assignment have the exact same meaning as the English word and there are not sufficient details of randomisation recorded to be certain that a truly random method had been used for assignment.</P>
<P>No two RCTs examined the same dose comparison. Pralidoxime comes in different salts (<LINK REF="REF-Bismuth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bismuth 1992</LINK>) and thus for ease of comparison we have summarised the pralidoxime cation (active drug) doses in the studies in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.</P>

<P>For the two larger Vellore studies (<LINK REF="STD-Samuel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Cherian-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cherian 1997</LINK>); we wrote to the authors to clarify the methodology used in their trials in line with the CONSORT statement (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2001</LINK>) but received no response. Allocation concealment and method of randomisation are not apparent from the published trials. Both RCTs used a small fixed block size of four, which may have allowed subversion of randomisation through failure of allocation concealment for some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). A placebo was used in both trials but it is not stated who was blinded to the intervention.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2006</LINK> also used a small fixed block size of four which may have allowed subversion of randomisation through failure of allocation concealment for some patients (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). A placebo was used but it is not stated who was blinded to the allocation. Patients' families had to purchase the pralidoxime so blinding must have been limited.</P>
<P>The main risk of bias with <LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK> arises in the earlier than planned termination of this study. This was done in the light of poor recruitment following publication of the Pawar study. It is possible that stopping early may have resulted in an exaggerated estimate of harm. However, in other respects this trial had a more robust design than previous studies with stratified randomisation, allocation concealment, double blind design and verifiable clinical and biochemical outcomes.</P>
<P>It was quite hard to judge the risk of bias in the two Chinese studies as the reporting did not disclose many important aspects of trial design. Not surprisingly, reference to CONSORT guidelines when reporting these clinical trials in China did not appear to have occurred. We hope the recent Chinese translation of these guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>) may make this task easier in the next version of this review.</P>
<P>Only one study (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK>) had a clearly defined sample size calculation and although this study was the largest it still fell well short of the target. Thus all studies may be affected by bias due to premature stopping which may lead to exaggerated estimates of the magnitude of both benefits and harms (<LINK REF="REF-Bassler-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bassler 2010</LINK>).</P>

</B>In this RCT, pralidoxime (12g over three days (estimated 3.7 mg/kg/hr for a 45 kg patient)) was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (29% vs. 5%; OR 7.1 (95% CI 1.9-26.0)), requirement for ventilation (67% vs. 40%; OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-6.7)) and increased rate of Intermediate syndrome (65% vs. 35%; OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.6-7.2)).

<P>In this very small RCT (n=21), the primary aims were to look at the effects of treatment on the biomarker of BuChE activity and the correlation of BuChE activity with outcomes. There was 1 death in each arm of the trial; 7/10 treated vs 4/11 controls were ventilated and the duration of ventilation was longer in the treated group [15 (SD 8.4) vs. 11 (1.5) days]. Not surprisingly given the small numbers, no statistically significant effects were seen in any analysis of treatment vs placebo group. The doses of pralidoxime used in the treatment arm of this study (variable between 4 and 12 g/day) did not apparently lead to more rapid reactivation of BuChE.</P>

<P>This RCT reported that a number of outcomes were better with a higher dose of pralidoxime for the first 48 hours compared to a lower dose. There was a lower dose requirement for atropine in the first 24 hours (median 6 mg vs 30 mg; difference 24 mg (95% CI 24&#8211;26, p&lt;0·0001)), fewer patients needed intubation (64% vs 88%; relative risk=0·72 (95%CI 0·62&#8211;0·86, p=0·0001)) and the duration of ventilation was shorter (median 5 days vs 10 days; difference 5 days (95%CI: 5&#8211;6, p&lt;0·0001)). Among the secondary outcomes, it is noteworthy that there were also fewer deaths (1% vs 8%; relative risk 0·13 (95%CI: 0·016&#8211;0·98; p=0.035)) and fewer episodes of pneumonia (8% vs 35%).</P>

</P>
<P>This RCT reported that mortality was non significantly higher in patients receiving pralidoxime chloride (2 g loading dose over 20 min, followed by a constant infusion of 0.5 g/h for up to 7 d). 30/121 (24.8%) receiving pralidoxime died, compared with 18/114 (15.8%) receiving placebo (adjusted hazard ratio 1.69 (95% CI 0.88&#8211;3.26, p = 0.12)). Pralidoxime did produce substantial and moderate red cell acetylcholinesterase reactivation in patients poisoned by diethyl and dimethyl compounds, respectively. No clinical outcome, adjusted analysis or sub-group analysis showed a favourable effect (all hazard ratios were &#8771; or &gt; than 1) for pralidoxime. There were more intubated patients in the pralidoxime group (30/121 (25%) vs 18/114 (16%) crude HR 1.82 (95% CI 1.01-3.28)). While the duration of ventilation was apparently shorter in the pralidoxime treated patients (2.1 days (95% CI 0.8&#8211;4.8; n=45) versus 6.5 d (95% CI 1.8&#8211;10.1); n=37; p=0.02, Mann Whitney test), some of this reduction was attributed to increased deaths in ventilated patients in the treatment arm.</P>
<P>The authors concluded that "Despite clear reactivation of red cell acetylcholinesterase in diethyl organophosphorus pesticide poisoned patients, we found no evidence that this regimen improves survival or reduces need for intubation in patients with organophosphorus insecticide poisoning.

</RESULTS>
<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2011-01-17 02:03:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Nick A Buckley">
<P>Seven RCTs on pralidoxime treatment have been published, involving 845 patients. Three RCTs including 366 patients studied pralidoxime vs placebo and four RCTs including 479 patients compared two or more different doses. The authors of the unfunded studies in particular must be commended for attempting important studies in such a difficult environment. However, most studies did not take into account the type of OP or the timing of the oxime and the published methodology was often unclear. The wide range of doses and durations (<LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), settings, and types of OP mean that pooling the results (e.g. <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) may not lead to true estimates of effect. It is clear that there may be potential benefit from oximes as AChE activity is clearly increased by treatment (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Willems-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Willems 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thiermann-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiermann 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1997</LINK>) and two of the larger RCTs reported benefit from higher doses (<LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gu-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Gu 2008</LINK>). However, most RCTs did not report benefit or reported harm. Therefore, we believe a generalised statement cannot be justified from the published results and that the evidence for or against the use of oximes has not yet been established.<BR/>
<BR/>There are two key issues which future studies of oximes need to address. Firstly, the patients who might benefit are not clear, particularly at the time of recruitment. A rapid test to measure (or algorithm to predict) if there is substantial AChE inhibition and reactivatable (non-aged) AChE might be useful to only recruit patients that respond into future trials. While this is only a surrogate marker and people can clearly survive despite high degrees of inhibition (<LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK>), it seems unlikely that patients who do not reactivate RBC-AChE will obtain benefit from oximes. There are clearly toxic effects of pralidoxime as noted in the common adverse effects in the RCTs. Indeed the LD50 for pralidoxime chloride in mice (93.6mg/kg - <LINK REF="REF-Namba-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">Namba 1971</LINK>) is only about 3 fold higher than the WHO recommended loading dose (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>) and the drug would be expected to further accumulate with the infusion if there was impaired renal function (<LINK REF="REF-Kayouka-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kayouka 2009</LINK>), as is common in severe poisoning.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is the issue of what is the optimal dosing strategy for pralidoxime and should doses be individualised to avoid toxicity. The current WHO-sponsored recommendations for pralidoxime chloride therapy is to give at least 30 mg/kg bolus followed by 8 mg/kg/hr infusion. (The WHO recommendations are based on the doses that are known to be required to rapidly achieve and then maintain a high concentration of pralidoxime. This estimated effective concentration is based on in vitro and animal studies with P2S (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 2000</LINK>).) Perhaps the clearest answer from our review of the RCTs to date is that this dose does not improve clinical outcomes. Interestingly, although animal studies consistently show benefit from oximes (<LINK REF="REF-Thompson-1987" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thompson 1987</LINK>) there do not appear to be any animal studies that involve more than short term use of oximes. It may be that the maximum benefit from oximes occurs early on, for adaptive mechanisms mean that even the complete absence of AChE activity is compatible with life (<LINK REF="REF-Adler-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Adler 2004</LINK>). Further, attempts to completely reactivate inhibited AChE may be unnecessary as activity &gt;30% is usually sufficient for normal NMJ function even in the setting of acute OP poisoning (<LINK REF="REF-Thiermann-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thiermann 2005</LINK>).</P>
<P>Conversely, it is quite likely that both the 'low dose' and the 'high-dose' regimen of pralidoxime used in Vellore did not produce effective plasma concentrations. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 1 g given over 30 mins to patients with a mean weight of 72 kg (SD 8.5) falls below a plasma concentration of 4 mg/L within 1.5 hours (<LINK REF="REF-Medicis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Medicis 1996</LINK>). The weight of the Indian study participants is not given in either paper; however, an estimated mean weight of 45 kg would only increase the effective concentration time by a factor of ~2. In the group receiving the infusion only, it appears doubtful whether an estimated initial dose of 2.8 mg/kg over the first 30 mins would ever give a plasma level that would achieve significant or sustained reactivation. An alternative interpretation of the results of <LINK REF="STD-Samuel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel 1995</LINK> would, therefore, be that a loading dose of pralidoxime is required to reach an effective plasma concentration and that a bolus dose alone, while producing an effective concentration for only several hours, offers some benefit.</P>
<P>However, the worse outcome seen in patients who received pralidoxime in <LINK REF="STD-Cherian-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cherian 1997</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Eddleston-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Eddleston 2009</LINK> suggests that the pralidoxime infusion harms patients. An alternative explanation is that the potential biases in these trials led to exaggerated evidence of harm. Howver, it is clear that in these studies there was no benefit even if the evidence for harm may be an overestimate.</P>
<P>Sicker patients might have been randomised to the intervention arm of <LINK REF="STD-Cherian-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Cherian 1997</LINK>, which had much reduced mean pseudocholinesterase levels at baseline. No information on masking is given and a block size of four was used in both studies. As pointed out by <LINK REF="REF-Schulz-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 1995</LINK>, such a small non-varying block size can often be unravelled: if treatment assignment becomes known after allocation, a sequence can be easily discerned from the pattern of past assignments giving the risk of selection bias, even if concealment has been adequate. Problems with small fixed block sizes may have compromised allocation concealment in <LINK REF="STD-Samuel-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Samuel 1995</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Pawar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Pawar 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>Whether pesticides had dimethyl or diethyl groups was also not controlled for in some studies; this is important as only diethlyphosphorylated AChEs are expected to respond to pralidoxime after 12h (<LINK REF="REF-Worek-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worek 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hansen-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hansen 1999</LINK>). Deaths may have occurred in patients ingesting dimethylated compounds who presented after 12 hours when pralidoxime would not be expected to work. A study from Sri Lanka showed that around 70% of OP-poisoned patients had ingested dimethylated compounds (<LINK REF="STD-de-Silva-1992" TYPE="STUDY">de Silva 1992</LINK>). This situation may well be similar in other parts of the tropics and since many patients present more than 12 hours after the poisoning, it may be too late for oximes. There are many factors present in self-poisoning cases in South Asia that would reduce the effectiveness of pralidoxime. The OP dose is often large and the pesticide persistent for several days, resulting in repeated inhibition of any newly reactivated AChE. There is also often a lack of intensive care services and other resources, the absence of which may be far more critical to survival than the use of an antidote (<LINK REF="STD-Shivakumar-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Shivakumar 2006</LINK>).</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2011-01-14 13:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2010-10-21 07:48:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Nick A Buckley">
<P>Current evidence is insufficient to indicate whether oximes are harmful or beneficial in the management of acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning. The World Health Organization recommended pralidoxime regimen (30 mg/kg pralidoxime chloride bolus followed by 8 mg/kg/hr infusion) is not supported by outcomes to date. Lower doses have also shown worse outcomes in one RCT. Thus the published RCTs provide limited guidance for clinicians. Despite this there are consistent animal data supporting their effectiveness, when given early. Based on our understanding of the mechanism, <I>in vitro</I> and animal data, benefit&#8722;risk ratio is more likely to be favourable when they are given early, to patients with serious poisoning by diethyl OPs. However, the RCTs have not defined effective doses or sub-groups that are likely to benefit. Thus use should be confined to clinical trials and situations where better established treatments have proven ineffective.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2011-01-14 13:38:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Emma M Sydenham">
<P>Further RCTs are required to determine if there are other strategies and regimens that might consistently lead to benefit in some individuals. There are many theoretical and practical reasons why oximes may not be useful and might even be harmful to patients with overwhelming self-poisoning, particularly with late presentations of dimethyl OP. Future studies should attempt to incorporate as many as of the following features as possible:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to specifically screen for patient sub-groups that may benefit from oximes.</LI>
<LI>to explore different doses or incorporate flexible dosing strategies.</LI>
<LI>randomisation should be stratified by baseline severity, time to presentation, and class of OP pesticide taken (diethyl or dimethyl).</LI>
<LI>the trial should be registered and use predefined sub-group hypotheses.</LI>
<LI>RBC-AChE activity and the potential for ex-vivo reactivation should be measured (because of the importance of ageing in determining the usefulness of oxime).</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is noteworthy that a very large number of clinical studies on pralidoxime are being reported from China (<LINK REF="APP-02" TYPE="APPENDIX">Appendix 2</LINK>) and that flexible dosing strategies seem to be used in nearly all of them. However, much clearer reporting of these studies is required in order to firstly determine whether they are randomised and to assess other aspects of methodological quality. Further the complex regimens need to be described in sufficient detail that they can be replicated or incorporated into protocols. We hope future Chinese trials will take note of the CONSORT guidelines now that these have been translated (<LINK REF="REF-Moher-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Moher 2010</LINK>).</P>

<P>The methods followed in this review have been updated since the publication of the protocol for this review to reflect revised guidance from The Cochrane Collaboration (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2008</LINK>). Thus we used risk of bias assessment rather than the Jadad scale and Schulz assessment of the effectiveness of allocation concealment. We also incorporated a GRADE summary of findings assessment. These changes in methods have not altered the conclusions about the strength of evidence from the studies included in the 2005 version.</P>
<P>The search of Chinese language publications also was added in the 2010 version.</P>

The allocation sequences were generated independently by the statistician and implemented by the programmer, neither of whom interacted with patients. Variable block sizes were used to allocate patients in equal numbers to each treatment group using Stata v. 7 software (ralloc subroutine version 3.2.5).

In the light of interim data, and emerging evidence from other studies, the IDMC then informed the principal investigator if in their view there was proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicated that any part of the protocol under investigation became clearly indicated or contraindicated, or it was evident that no clear outcome would be obtained. The trial stopped after the first interim analysis due to lack of recruitment."</P>
<P>"Unfortunately, discussion of the results of an RCT [29] performed in Baramati, India, that suggested marked benefit from pralidoxime at a seminar in August 2005, resulted in loss of equipoise (the perception of treatments being of equal value) by clinicians, a fall off in recruitment, and early termination of the trial."</P>
