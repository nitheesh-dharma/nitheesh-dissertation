<DESCRIPTION>
<P>This review is an update of the previous Cochrane review that included 30 studies (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>). This updated review includes 22 new trials.</P>
<P>One of the previous authors, Dr Denise Grocke, decided not to participate in the update of this review, and we added a new co-author, Aaron Teague.</P>
<P>Our conclusions about the impact of music interventions on state anxiety in people with cancer remain similar to those in <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2011</LINK>. Although the pooled effect of the studies that used the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was slightly lower than in the previous review, the addition of trials examining this outcome resulted in a more precise estimate. The pooled effect of studies that used measurement tools other than the STAI was higher than in the previous review.</P>
<P>The conclusions for the effect of music interventions on depression changed. Whereas the previous review did not find support for an effect, this review update found a moderate effect for depression. We also found a similar effect size (moderate) as the previous review for mood, but the pooled effect was no longer statistically significant in this update.</P>
<P>The conclusions for the effect of music interventions on pain changed. Whereas the previous review reported a moderate effect, this review update found a large effect for pain.</P>
<P>The conclusions for the effect of music interventions on fatigue also changed. Whereas the previous review did not find evidence of an effect, this review update found a small to moderate effect for music interventions on fatigue. The conclusions for physical functioning remained the same.</P>
<P>The conclusion for the effect of music interventions on quality of life remained similar, that is, there was a large pooled effect size that was not statistically significant. However, a subgroup analysis revealed that music therapy interventions resulted in a moderate and statistically significant effect that was consistent across trials, whereas music medicine studies resulted in a large but heterogeneous effect size that was not statistically significant.</P>
<P>The conclusions for the effects of music interventions on vital signs remained similar to those of the previous review.</P>
<P>This review update included additional outcomes such as resilience, coping, and anesthetic and analgesic intake, but no meta-analysis was possible because we only identified one study per outcome.</P>
<P>Because of the addition of many trials in this update, we were able to conduct a priori determined sub-analyses comparing music therapy with music medicine studies and comparing patient-preferred music with researcher-selected music for several of the outcomes.</P>

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>
<B>The issue</B>
<BR/>Cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering. Current cancer care increasingly incorporates psychosocial interventions to improve quality of life. Music therapy and music medicine interventions have been used to alleviate symptoms and treatment side effects and address psychosocial needs in people with cancer. In music medicine interventions, the patient simply listens to pre-recorded music that is offered by a medical professional. Music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.</P>
<P>
<B>The aim of the review</B>
<BR/>This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2011, which included 30 studies and found support for an effect of music interventions on several psychological and physical outcomes. For this review update, we searched for additional trials studying the effect of music interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in people with cancer. We searched for published and ongoing studies up to January 2016. We considered all studies in which music therapy or music medicine was compared with standard treatment alone or standard care combined with other treatments or placebo.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the main findings?</B>
<BR/>We identified 22 new studies, so the evidence in this review update now rests on 52 studies with 3731 participants. The findings suggest that music therapy and music medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety, pain, fatigue, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure in people with cancer. Because of the very low quality of the evidence for depression, it is unclear what impact music interventions may have. Music therapy but not music medicine interventions may improve patients' quality of life. We did not find evidence that music interventions improve mood, distress or physical functioning, but only a few trials studied these outcomes. We could not draw any conclusions about the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or communication outcomes because there were not enough trials looking at these aspects. Therefore, more research is needed.</P>
<P>No adverse effects of music interventions were reported.</P>
<P>
<B>Quality of the evidence</B>
<BR/>Most trials were at high risk of bias, so these results need to be interpreted with caution. We did not identify any conflicts of interests in the included studies.</P>
<P>
<B>What are the conclusions?</B>
<BR/>We conclude that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in people with cancer. Furthermore, music may have a small positive effect on heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Reduction of anxiety, fatigue and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they have an impact on health and overall QoL. Therefore, we recommend considering the inclusion of music therapy and music medicine interventions in psychosocial cancer care.</P>

<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2016-08-01 10:48:15 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, Science Citation Index, CancerLit, CAIRSS, Proquest Digital Dissertations, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, the RILM Abstracts of Music Literature, <A HREF="http://www.wfmt.info/Musictherapyworld/">http://www.wfmt.info/Musictherapyworld/</A> and the National Research Register. We searched all databases, except for the last two, from their inception to January 2016; the other two are no longer functional, so we searched them until their termination date. We handsearched music therapy journals, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts. There was no language restriction.</P>

</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We identified 22 new trials for inclusion in this update. In total, the evidence of this review rests on 52 trials with a total of 3731 participants. We included music therapy interventions offered by trained music therapists, as well as music medicine interventions, which are defined as listening to pre-recorded music, offered by medical staff. We categorized 23 trials as music therapy trials and 29 as music medicine trials.</P>
<P>The results suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people with cancer, with a reported average anxiety reduction of 8.54 units (95% confidence interval (CI) &#8722;12.04 to &#8722;5.05, P &lt; 0.0001) on the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory - State Anxiety (STAI-S) scale (range 20 to 80) and &#8722;0.71 standardized units (13 studies, 1028 participants; 95% CI &#8722;0.98 to &#8722;0.43, P &lt; 0.00001; low quality evidence) on other anxiety scales, a moderate to strong effect. Results also suggested a moderately strong, positive impact on depression (7 studies, 723 participants; standardized mean difference (SMD): &#8722;0.40, 95% CI &#8722;0.74 to &#8722;0.06, P = 0.02; very low quality evidence), but because of the very low quality of the evidence for this outcome, this result needs to be interpreted with caution. We found no support for an effect of music interventions on mood or distress.</P>
<P>Music interventions may lead to small reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure but do not appear to impact oxygen saturation level. We found a large pain-reducing effect (7 studies, 528 participants; SMD: &#8722;0.91, 95% CI &#8722;1.46 to &#8722;0.36, P = 0.001, low quality evidence). In addition, music interventions had a small to moderate treatment effect on fatigue (6 studies, 253 participants; SMD: &#8722;0.38, 95% CI &#8722;0.72 to &#8722;0.04, P = 0.03; low quality evidence), but we did not find strong evidence for improvement in physical functioning.</P>
<P>The results suggest a large effect of music interventions on patients' quality of life (QoL), but the results were highly inconsistent across studies, and the pooled effect size for the music medicine and music therapy studies was accompanied by a large confidence interval (SMD: 0.98, 95% CI &#8722;0.36 to 2.33, P = 0.15, low quality evidence). A comparison between music therapy and music medicine interventions suggests a moderate effect of music therapy interventions for patients' quality of life (QoL) (3 studies, 132 participants; SMD: 0.42, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, P = 0.02; very low quality evidence), but we found no evidence of an effect for music medicine interventions. A comparison between music therapy and music medicine studies was also possible for anxiety, depression and mood, but we found no difference between the two types of interventions for these outcomes.</P>
<P>The results of single studies suggest that music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics as well as decrease recovery time and duration of hospitalization, but more research is needed for these outcomes.</P>
<P>We could not draw any conclusions regarding the effect of music interventions on immunologic functioning, coping, resilience or communication outcomes because either we could not pool the results of the studies that included these outcomes or we could only identify one trial. For spiritual well-being, we found no evidence of an effect in adolescents or young adults, and we could not draw any conclusions in adults.</P>
<P>The majority of studies included in this review update presented a high risk of bias, and therefore the quality of evidence is low.</P>

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The lifetime risk of developing any type of cancer is 44% for men and 38% for women (<LINK REF="REF-NCI-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">NCI 2010</LINK>), and a diagnosis of cancer may result in extensive emotional, physical and social suffering. Many symptoms and treatment side effects have an impact on cancer patients' physical well-being and quality of life (QoL), including appetite disturbance, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea or difficulty breathing, fatigue, insomnia, muscle weakness and numbness (<LINK REF="REF-King-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">King 2003</LINK>). In addition, study findings clearly indicate that people with cancer experience elevated levels of psychological distress and depression in response to diagnosis and treatment (<LINK REF="REF-van_x0027_t-Spijker-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">van't Spijker 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Massie-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Massie 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Norton-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Norton 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parle-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parle 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Raison-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Raison 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sellick-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sellick 1999</LINK>). The actual experience of chemotherapy-induced side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and their influence on psychological well-being varies widely in patients receiving the same cytotoxic agents. This suggests that non-pharmacological factors possibly play an important role in how patients experience or interpret physical symptoms during the treatment phase (<LINK REF="REF-Montgomery-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Montgomery 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Thune_x002d_Boyle-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thune-Boyle 2006</LINK>). It is therefore important that cancer care incorporates services that help meet patients' psychological, social and spiritual needs.</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-07-13 17:08:02 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The use of music in cancer care can be situated along a continuum of care, namely from music listening initiated by patients, to pre-recorded music offered by medical personnel, to music psychotherapy interventions offered by a trained music therapist. Therefore, when examining the efficacy of music interventions with cancer patients, it is important to make a clear distinction between music interventions administered by medical or healthcare professionals (music medicine) and those implemented by trained music therapists (music therapy). A substantive body of evidence suggests that music therapy interventions provided by medical professionals are significantly more effective than music medicine interventions for a wide variety of outcomes (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>). This difference might be attributed to the fact that music therapists individualize their interventions to meet patients' specific needs, more actively engage the patients in music making, and employ a systematic therapeutic process including assessment, treatment and evaluation. <LINK REF="REF-Dileo-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 1999</LINK> categorizes interventions as music medicine when medical personnel offer pre-recorded music for passive listening. For example, they may offer people a CD for relaxation or distraction; however, no systematic therapeutic process is present, nor is there a systematic assessment of the elements and suitability of the music stimulus. In contrast, music therapy requires the implementation of a music intervention by a trained music therapist, the presence of a therapeutic process and the use of personally tailored music experiences.</P>

<P>Music interventions have been used in different medical fields to meet patients' psychological, physical, social and spiritual needs. Research on the effects of music and music therapy for medical patients has burgeoned over the past 20 years, examining a variety of outcome measures in a wide range of specialty areas (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2005</LINK>). For both adult and pediatric cancer patients, music has been used to decrease anxiety prior to or during surgical procedures (<LINK REF="REF-Burns-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burns 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Haun-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haun 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pfaff-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Pfaff 1989</LINK>), to decrease stress during chemotherapy or radiation therapy (<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weber-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1996</LINK>), to lessen treatment side effects (<LINK REF="STD-Bozcuk-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Bozcuk 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ezzone-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Ezzone 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Frank-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Frank 1985</LINK>), to improve mood (<LINK REF="STD-Bailey-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Bailey 1983</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Barrera-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Barrera 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassileth 2003</LINK>), to enhance pain management (<LINK REF="STD-Akombo-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Akombo 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1989</LINK>), to improve immune system functioning (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001a</LINK>; Camprubi 1999), and to improve quality of life (QoL) (<LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilliard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hilliard 2003</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are inherent elements of music&#8212;such as rhythm and tempo, mode, pitch, timbre, melody and harmony&#8212;that are known to influence physiological and psycho-emotional responses in humans. For example, music has been found to arouse memory and association, stimulate imagery, evoke emotions, facilitate social interaction, and promote relaxation and distraction (<LINK REF="REF-Dileo-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dileo 2006</LINK>). In cancer settings, music therapists conduct ongoing assessments and utilize various individualized interventions in people with cancer and their families, including pertinent elements of music within the context of therapeutic relationships, to address prevailing biopsychosocial and spiritual issues, symptoms and needs (<LINK REF="REF-Magill-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magill 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McClean-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">McClean 2012</LINK>). The following music therapy interventions are common: use of songs (singing, song writing, and lyric analysis); music improvisation (instrumental and vocal), music and imagery, music-based reminiscence and life review, chanting and toning, music-based relaxation, and instrumental participation (<LINK REF="REF-O_x0027_Callaghan-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">O'Callaghan 2015</LINK>). Based on patient preferences and assessment outcomes, music therapists adapt and modify music interventions to address symptoms and areas of difficulty; they utilize music and verbal strategies to provide opportunities for expression and communication, reminiscence, the processing of thoughts and emotions and improvement of symptom management (<LINK REF="REF-Magill-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magill 2011</LINK>). Therapist-supported music therapy environments often provide the space and time through which patients and families may experience social connection, improve self fulfilment and acquire effective coping strategies (<LINK REF="REF-Magill-2015" TYPE="REFERENCE">Magill 2015</LINK>).</P>

The majority of these studies, however, are compromised by small sample size and lack of statistical power. In addition, differences in factors such as methods of interventions and type and intensity of treatment have led to varying results. A systematic review is needed to more accurately gauge the efficacy of music interventions in cancer patients as well as to identify variables that may moderate its effects.</P>

<P>Since participants cannot be blinded in a music intervention trial, we did not downgrade studies for not blinding the participants. As for personnel, in music therapy studies music therapists cannot be blinded because they are actively making music with the patients. In contrast, in music medicine studies blinding of personnel is possible by providing control group participants with headphones but no music (e.g. blank CD). Therefore, downgrading for not blinding personnel was only applied in studies that used listening to pre-recorded music.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:49:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>We present all outcomes in this review as continuous variables. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) for outcome measures using results from different scales. We used mean differences (MD) for results using the same scales. We anticipated that some individual trials would have used final scores and others change scores and even analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in their statistical analyses of the results. We combined these different types of analyses as MDs. We determined not to pool the results in case of significant clinical heterogeneity. We calculated pooled estimates using the more conservative random-effects model. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each effect size estimate. We interpreted the magnitude of the SMDs using the interpretation guidelines put forth by <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>). Cohen suggested that an effect size of 0.2 be considered a small effect, an effect size of 0.5 medium, and an effect size of 0.8 large.</P>

<P>For the original review, the database searches and handsearching of conference proceedings, journals and reference lists resulted in 773 unique citations. One review author (JB) and a research assistant examined the titles and abstracts and identified 101 reports as potentially relevant, which we retrieved for further assessment. One review author (JB) and a research assistant then independently screened them. We included 30 trials, reported in 36 records, in the original review. Where necessary, we contacted principal investigators to obtain additional details on trials and data. We identified three ongoing trials (<LINK REF="STD-NCT02261558" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02261558</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02583126" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02583126</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT02583139" TYPE="STUDY">NCT02583139</LINK>).

<P>In the original review, 27 of the 101 reports that we retrieved for further assessment turned out not to be outcome research studies. We identified 38 experimental research studies that appeared eligible for inclusion. However, we excluded these after closer examination or after receiving additional information from the principal investigators. Reasons for exclusions were: not a randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trial (29 studies); insufficient data reporting (2 studies); unacceptable methodological quality (3 studies); not a music intervention (1 study); not exclusively cancer patients (1 study); and article could not be located (2 studies).</P>
<P>For the update, we retrieved 94 reports for further assessment. We excluded 60 studies for the following reasons: not a randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trial (36 studies), insufficient data reporting (2 studies), not music intervention (12 studies), not population of interest (8 studies), use of healthy controls (1 study), and use of non-standardized measurement tools (1 study).</P>
<P>For studies with insufficient data reporting or those that could not be located, we attempted to contact the authors on multiple occasions.</P>

<P>Fifteen trials included objective outcomes, but only four of them reported blinding of the outcome assessors. For six trials, the use of blinding was unclear. The other trials did not use blinding. The majority of the trials included subjective outcomes only. It is important to point out that blinding of outcome assessors is not possible in the case of self report measurement tools for subjective outcomes (e.g. STAI; <LINK REF="REF-Spielberger-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spielberger 1983</LINK>) unless the participants are blinded to the intervention.

We did detect a possible publication bias for fatigue (<LINK REF="FIG-08" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 8</LINK>), but this was based on a small number of trials.

<P>We did not identify any other potential sources of bias in the studies included in this review.</P>
<P>As a result, only one trial was at low risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK>). Two additional trials were at low risk of bias for objective outcomes, as they satisfied all criteria used to assess risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Duocastella-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Duocastella 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2010</LINK>). Forty-six trials were at high risk of bias. Three trials were at moderate risk of bias (<LINK REF="STD-Binns_x002d_Turner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Binns-Turner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hilliard-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Hilliard 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2015</LINK>). The main reason for receiving a high risk of bias rating was the lack of blinding. As pointed out above, blinding is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless the studies compare the music intervention with another active treatment intervention (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation). This is especially true for music therapy studies that use active music-making. Therefore, it appears impossible for these types of studies to receive a low or even moderate risk of bias even if they have adequately addressed all other risk factors (e.g. randomization, allocation concealment, etc.).</P>
<P>It is worth noting that the Chinese trials were particularly problematic in terms of providing sufficient information regarding risk of bias. It is unclear, however, if this was due to incomplete translations or lack of detail in the original trial reports.</P>

We also did not include the data from <LINK REF="STD-Kwekkeboom-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwekkeboom 2003</LINK> in the meta-analysis because this study was affected by a serious flaw in the implementation of the intervention.

Finally, we report the data from <LINK REF="STD-Hanser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanser 2006</LINK> narratively but do not include them in the meta-analysis because of the high attrition rate (40%).

<P>A meta-analysis of 13 trials that used the full STAI-S (score range: 20 to 80) to examine state anxiety in 1028 participants indicated a significantly lower state of anxiety in participants who received standard care combined with music interventions than those who received standard care alone ( MD: &#8722;8.54, 95% CI &#8722;12.04 to &#8722;5.05, P &lt; 0.0001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Statistical heterogeneity across the trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%) was due to some trials reporting much larger beneficial effects of music interventions than others (<LINK REF="STD-Binns_x002d_Turner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Binns-Turner 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Harper-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Harper 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wan 2009</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Kwekkeboom-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwekkeboom 2003</LINK>, participants in the music listening group reported higher levels of anxiety at post-test (mean: 33.45, standard deviation (SD) 1.77) than those in the standard care group (mean: 30.59, SD 1.93), but this difference was not statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis excluding the trials that used inadequate methods of randomization (<LINK REF="STD-Bulfone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bulfone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Chen-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Chen 2013</LINK>), or for which the method of randomization was unclear (<LINK REF="STD-Bufalini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bufalini 2009</LINK>), had minimal impact on the pooled effect size (MD: &#8722;8.64, 95% CI &#8722;12.50 to &#8722;4.79, P &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 94%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>).</P>
<P>The standardized mean difference (SMD) of trials that reported post-test anxiety scores on measures other than the full-form STAI-S (N = 449) also suggested a moderate to large anxiety-reducing effect of music (SMD: &#8722;0.71, 95% CI &#8722;0.98 to &#8722;0.43, P &lt;.00001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2015</LINK>). The results were consistent across the trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 41%). We did not include the data of two trials in the meta-analysis because change scores and final scores should not be combined for the computation of a SMD (<LINK REF="STD-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassileth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2015</LINK>). However, the data by <LINK REF="STD-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassileth 2003</LINK> were consistent with the results of the meta-analysis, reporting a greater effect of music therapy on anxiety (mean change score: &#8722;2.6, SD 2.5) than standard care alone (mean change score: &#8722;0.9, SD 3.0) on the POMS-anxiety subscale (score range: 0 to 36). Likewise, the data from <LINK REF="STD-Palmer-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Palmer 2015</LINK> indicated a beneficial effect of music therapy (mean change score: &#8722;30.9, SD 36.3) versus standard care (mean change score: 0, SD 22.7) on the Global Anxiety-VAS (score range: 0 to 100 mm). A sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of randomization method, excluding the data of <LINK REF="STD-Cai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2001</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Ferrer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrer 2005</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>, resulted in a larger SMD of &#8722;0.80 (95% CI &#8722;1.44 to &#8722;0.16, P = 0.01; <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>), but the results were no longer consistent across studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 66%).</P>
<P>Next, we conducted several a priori determined subgroup analyses as outlined in the <LINK TAG="METHODS" TYPE="SECTION">Methods</LINK>.</P>
<P>First, we compared the treatment benefits of music therapy versus music medicine studies for anxiety. We only included studies that reported post-test scores in this analysis to allow for computation of a standardized mean difference across studies. The pooled effect of three music therapy studies (SMD: &#8722;0.62, 95% CI &#8722;1.01 to &#8722;0.24, P = 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 0%; <LINK REF="STD-Bufalini-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bufalini 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ferrer-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Ferrer 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2015</LINK>) was smaller than of the music medicine studies (SMD: &#8722;1.00, 95% CI &#8722;1.45 to &#8722;0.55, P &lt; 0.0001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 93%; <LINK REF="STD-Binns_x002d_Turner-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Binns-Turner 2008</LINK>;<LINK REF="STD-Bulfone-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Bulfone 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Danhauer-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Danhauer 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Jin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2004" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nguyen-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Nguyen 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-O_x0027_Callaghan-2012" TYPE="STUDY">O'Callaghan 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Smith-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Smith 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Vachiramon-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Vachiramon 2013</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhao-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Zhao 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2015</LINK>). However, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). It is worth noting that the results of the music therapy studies were consistent across studies, whereas the results of the music medicine studies were highly heterogeneous (<LINK REF="CMP-001.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.3</LINK>).</P>
<P>Second, we compared studies that used patient-preferred music with studies that used researcher-selected music. For this comparison, we only included studies that used listening to pre-recorded music as the intervention. Music preference did not appear to impact the treatment benefits for anxiety. The use of patient-preferred music resulted in a SMD of &#8722;0.86 (95% CI &#8722;1.38 to &#8722;0.34, P = 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 92%) whereas researcher-selected music resulted in a SMD of &#8722;0.89 (95% CI &#8722;1.43 to &#8722;0.35, P = 0.001, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 71%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.4</LINK>).</P>
<P>Finally, we compared the music medicine studies by type of intervention (e.g. music-guided relaxation, music listening alone, etc.). We could not conduct this subgroup analysis for music therapy studies because of an insufficient number of trials. The majority of the music medicine studies used listening to pre-recorded music. Four studies, however, embedded relaxation or imagery instructions within the pre-recorded music (<LINK REF="STD-Jin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Jin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Lin-2011" TYPE="STUDY">Lin 2011</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2015</LINK>). The pooled effect of these four studies (SMD: &#8722;1.61, 95% CI &#8722;2.56 to &#8722;0.65, P = 0.0009, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 95%) was much larger than that of music listening only studies (SMD: &#8722;0.71, 95% CI &#8722;1.16 to &#8722;0.26, P = 0.002, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%) but because of the large heterogeneity, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.10) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.5</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="6">Depression</HEADING>
<P>Seven trials examined the effects of music plus standard care compared to standard care alone on depression in 723 participants (<LINK REF="STD-Cai-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Cai 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassileth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Li-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2012</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wan-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Wan 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Yates-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Yates 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zhou-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Zhou 2015</LINK>). Their pooled estimate indicated a moderate treatment effect of music (SMD: &#8722;0.40, 95% CI &#8722;0.74 to &#8722;0.06, P = 0.02; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>), but the results were inconsistent across trials (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 77%). A sensitivity analysis examining the impact of randomization method did not have much impact on the pooled effect size (SMD: &#8722;0.37, 95% CI &#8722;0.79 to 0.05, P = 0.08, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 81%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.6</LINK>).</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between music therapy and music medicine studies for the outcome of depression (P = 0.12) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.07" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.7</LINK>). We also examined the impact of music preference in studies that used listening to pre-recorded music. Although the difference between studies that used patient-preferred versus researcher-selected music was not statistically significant (P = 0.25), allowing patients to select music from a variety of styles offered by the researcher resulted in a large effect size that was statistically significant (SMD: &#8722;0.88, 95% CI &#8722;1.67 to &#8722;0.09, P = 0.003, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 89%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.08" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.8</LINK>). In contrast, the use of researcher-selected music resulted in a small effect size that was not statistically significant (SMD: &#8722;0.32, 95% CI &#8722;0.84 to 0.19, P = 0.22, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 61%).</P>

<LINK REF="STD-Clark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2006</LINK> compared standard care plus music-guided relaxation versus standard care alone and reported a reduction of &#8722;2.03 (SD 2.46) on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale in the music therapy intervention group.

<P>The pooled estimate of five trials (N = 236) resulted in a moderate effect of music interventions for mood in participants with cancer (SMD: 0.47, 95% CI &#8722;0.02 to 0.97, P = 0.06; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Burrai-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burrai 2014</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cassileth-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Cassileth 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Moradian-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Moradian 2015</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ratcliff-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Ratcliff 2014</LINK>).The results were inconsistent across studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 70%), with <LINK REF="STD-Burrai-2014" TYPE="STUDY">Burrai 2014</LINK> reporting much larger treatment benefits than the other studies. A sensitivity analysis based on randomization method slightly increased the pooled effect (SMD: 0.57, 95% CI &#8722;0.03 to 1.18, P = 0.06, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 74%; <LINK REF="CMP-001.09" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.9</LINK>). We could not include the data from <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001a</LINK> in the meta-analysis because the authors did not use a constant in the computation of their scores, as recommended in the Profile of Mood States (POMS) scoring guide (<LINK REF="REF-McNair-1971" TYPE="REFERENCE">McNair 1971</LINK>). The results of the meta-analysis were robust to <LINK REF="STD-Burns-2001a" TYPE="STUDY">Burns 2001a</LINK>, which reported a mean post-test score of &#8722;48.25 (SD 32.96) for the music therapy group and a mean post-test score of 20.75 (SD 30.87) for the control group.</P>
<P>A subgroup analysis comparing music therapy (SMD: 0.37, 95% CI &#8722;0.13 to 0.87, P = 0.15) with music medicine (SMD: 0.55, 95% CI &#8722;0.37 to 1.47, P = 0.24) found no statistically significant differences between the two types of studies (P = 0.73), but the results of the music therapy studies were consistent across studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 37%), whereas the music medicine studies were inconsistent across studies (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 82%) (<LINK REF="CMP-001.10" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.10</LINK>).</P>

The literature suggests that increased anxiety leads to increased pain perception (<LINK REF="REF-McCracken-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">McCracken 2009</LINK>); therefore, we excluded these data from the meta-analysis. The pooled effect of the remaining seven studies with 528 participants resulted in a large effect for music on pain perception (SMD: &#8722;0.91, 95%CI &#8722;1.46 to &#8722;0.36, P = 0.001; <LINK REF="CMP-001.11" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.11</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK>). There was disagreement between the trials on the size of the effect (I<SUP>2</SUP> = 88%), but this was due to <LINK REF="STD-Li-2012" TYPE="STUDY">Li 2012</LINK> reporting much larger treatment benefits than the other trials.</P>
<P>Using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, <LINK REF="STD-Clark-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Clark 2006</LINK> found that music therapy resulted in greater pain reduction (mean change score: &#8722;0.44, SD 2.55) than standard care (mean change score: 0.45, SD 1.87). Likewise, <LINK REF="STD-Beck-1989" TYPE="STUDY">Beck 1989</LINK> reported a greater pain reduction for the music listening group as measured by a 100mm VAS (mean change score: &#8722;9.27, SD 18.86) than for the control group (mean change score: &#8722;5.69, SD 17.9).

<P>For this outcome, we were able to examine the impact of music preference on treatment effect (<LINK REF="CMP-001.12" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.12</LINK>). Although the difference between the use of patient-preferred music and researcher-selected music was not statistically significant (P = 0.42), the use of patient-preferred music led to a much larger and statistically significant pooled effect (SMD: &#8722;1.06, 95% CI &#8722;1.93 to &#8722;0.2, P = 0.02, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 91%) than the use of researcher-selected music (SMD: &#8722;0.59, 95% CI &#8722;1.34 to 0.15, P = 0.12, I<SUP>2</SUP> = 75%).

Active music making (post-test mean: 14.19, SD 8.3) and music listening (post-test mean: 15.89, SD 11.2) also increased the child's initiation behaviour compared to the audio storybooks (post-test mean: 7.43, SD 6.6). These differences were also statistically significant (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002, respectively).</P>

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-08-04 10:13:57 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The results of 19 trials suggest that music therapy and music medicine interventions may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in people with cancer, with a reported anxiety reduction of 8.54 units, on average, on the STAI-S (score range: 20 to 80) scale and &#8722;0.71 standardized units on other anxiety scales which is considered a moderate to large effect. Although the magnitude of the effect differed across the studies, the trials agreed on the direction of the point estimates. These anxiety-reducing results are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music with coronary heart disease patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013a</LINK>), with mechanically ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2014</LINK>), and for pre-operative anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013b</LINK>). A comparison of music therapy with music medicine trials for anxiety reduction in people with cancer suggest a moderate treatment effect for music therapy studies (SMD: &#8722;0.62) that was consistent across studies. Music medicine trials resulted in a larger effect (SMD: &#8722;1.0) but results were highly inconsistent across studies. <LINK REF="REF-Cohen-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cohen 1988</LINK> suggested that an effect size of 0.20 be considered a small effect, an effect size of 0.50 medium, and an effect size of 0.80 large. A direct comparison of music therapy with music medicine interventions for anxiety reduction in two studies indicated greater anxiety reduction of music therapy interventions. It is noteworthy that a large majority of the patients in one of the comparative studies expressed a preference for the music therapy intervention.</P>
<P>The results of seven studies suggest that music intervention may reduce depression in people with cancer. The results of a single study suggest that music therapy may help adolescents and young adults employ positive coping strategies during stem cell transplant, a high risk and high intensity treatment. We found no evidence of effect for distress or mood.</P>
<P>As for the effect of music on physical symptoms, the results of seven trials suggest that music has a large pain-reducing effect of &#8722;0.91 standardized units. The results of single studies suggest that music listening may reduce the need for anesthetics and analgesics. Music interventions also had a small to moderate effect on fatigue (&#8722;0.38 standardized units). We found no evidence for an effect of music on physical status. Reduction of anxiety, depression, fatigue and pain are important outcomes for people with cancer, as they have an impact on health and overall QoL.</P>
<P>It is important that careful consideration is given to the implementation of music listening interventions. The results of <LINK REF="STD-Kwekkeboom-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwekkeboom 2003</LINK> indicate that listening to music through headphones may be contraindicated during painful procedures because it prevents the patient from hearing the surgeon's instructions and comments. This may greatly increase patients' anxiety and, consequently, their perceived pain. In this case, it is better to listen to music without headphones.</P>
<P>Furthermore, results suggest that music interventions may have a beneficial effect on several physiological responses in patients with cancer. Listening to music may reduce heart rate by an average of three to four beats per minute and respiratory rate by an average of two breaths per minute. These results are consistent with the findings of a Cochrane systematic review on the use of music with coronary heart disease patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013a</LINK>), which reported a heart rate reduction of 3.4 bpm and a respiratory rate reduction of 2.5 breaths per minute. Similar results were reported in a Cochrane review on music interventions for mechanically ventilated patients (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2014</LINK>), namely a mean heart rate reduction of 3.95 bpm and a mean respiratory rate reduction of 2.87 breaths per minute. In the case of a resting heart rate within normal range, a reduction of 4 bpm may not be clinically significant. However, it might be in the case of a tachycardiac rate. In a study examining the quantitative relationship between resting heart rate reduction and clinical benefit, <LINK REF="REF-Cucherat-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cucherat 2007</LINK> found that each 10 bpm reduction in heart rate is estimated to reduce the relative risk of cardiac death by 30%. The results of this review also indicate that listening to music may have a beneficial effect on SBP, although we found no evidence of an effect for DBP. Trials on music listening with cardiac patients and mechanically ventilated patients have also reported reductions in systolic blood pressure (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2014</LINK>). The reduction of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure corresponds with the anxiety-reducing effects found by subjective outcome measures in this review.</P>
<P>No evidence of support was found for an effect of music interventions on oxygen saturation level. Single trials included in this review found support for a beneficial effect of music on mean arterial pressure and immunologic function.</P>
<P>Music therapy interventions had a moderate effect of 0.42 standardized units on quality of life, whereas we found no support for an effect for music medicine studies. Two studies that compared music therapy with audiobook control in adolescents and young adults did not find support for spiritual well-being. Two music therapy studies with adults reported conflicting results for this outcome. Finally, a single study with adolescents and young adults during stem cell transplant reported beneficial effects of music therapy on perceived social support and the family environment.</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses of treatment effects between music therapy and music medicine studies was possible for four outcomes, namely anxiety, depression, mood and quality of life. There was a difference for quality of life, with music therapy studies contributing to a larger pooled treatment effect than music medicine studies; we found no difference between music therapy and music medicine studies for the other outcomes. However, it is worth noting that for all outcomes, music therapy interventions resulted in consistent findings across studies whereas the results of music medicine studies were highly heterogeneous for these outcomes.</P>
<P>We could examine the impact of music preference for anxiety, depression, pain, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Music preference did not impact the effect of music on anxiety. For the other outcomes, even though there was no difference between the use of patient-preferred versus researcher-selected music, the results show some interesting trends. For pain, the use of patient-preferred music had a much larger impact on pain reduction. In contrast, no evidence of pain-reducing effect was found for researcher-selected music. For heart rate, researcher-selected music resulted in a larger and more consistent treatment effect than patient-preferred music. Interestingly, for blood pressure, patient-preferred music resulted in a larger treatment effect, but the results were highly inconsistent across studies. In contrast, researcher-selected music resulted in smaller effect.</P>
<P>For all outcomes, the sensitivity analyses were robust to the original conclusions.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-07-14 12:51:54 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This review included 52 randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.</P>
<P>Seventeen trials used listening to pre-recorded music, and 13 trials used music therapy interventions that actively engaged the patients (<LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). We were able to compare the treatment effects of music therapy studies with music medicine studies for four outcomes. For the other outcomes this was not possible due to insufficient number of music therapy and music medicine studies per outcome.</P>
<P>This review included both music therapy and music medicine studies, as defined in the <LINK TAG="BACKGROUND" TYPE="SECTION">Background</LINK>. Music therapists who work with cancer patients do not limit their interventions to offering music listening for relaxation purposes. Music therapists are specially trained clinically and academically to carefully select music interventions to offer emotional and spiritual support, support communication with loved ones, enhance a sense of control, and improve physical well-being in patients with cancer. Comparative analyses suggest that music therapy interventions are more effective than music medicine interventions in improving quality of life. We found no differences between music therapy and music medicine interventions for other outcomes, but it is worth noting that the results of music therapy studies were much less heterogeneous than those of music medicine studies. This is likely due to the fact that music therapists are trained to meet the individual needs of patients through music interventions (e.g. meeting the patient's in-the-moment needs when offering live music) rather than offering a limited selection of pre-recorded music, which may not be suitable for all patients. Participants in a cross-over trial who experienced both music therapy and music medicine interventions overwhelmingly preferred the music therapy sessions because of the personal attention and care, the creativity of the interactive music making, and the opportunity for emotional expression through singing and playing instruments.</P>
<P>In general, the trials that used listening to pre-recorded music provided little information about the music selections used, except for mentioning general music styles (e.g. new age, classical music, easy listening, etc). Music within each of these styles can vary widely, and more detailed information would help clinicians make well-informed decisions regarding music selections.</P>
<P>The frequency and duration of the interventions varied widely across the trials. Twelve trials offered a single music session. We would like to suggest that offering multiple music listening sessions allows for the patient to give feedback about the music, select different music if needed, and become more skilled in using music for relaxation purposes. In the case of music therapy interventions, multiple sessions allow for the development of a therapeutic relationship and deepening of the therapeutic process through the music. This may lead to greater health benefits. At this time, however, the relationship between the frequency and duration of treatment and treatment effect remains unclear. Further investigation into the optimal frequency and duration of music interventions for specific outcomes in people with cancer is needed. </P>
<P>Presently, we cannot provide data regarding cost or cost-effectiveness of music therapy or music medicine applications in the care of cancer patients, as the reviewed trials did not provide these data.</P>

<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-07-14 14:37:13 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>Because of the large number of trials at high risk of bias, readers should interpret the findings of this review with caution. Often blinding of participants is not possible in music medicine or music therapy studies unless a comparative design is used (e.g. <LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK>). Many of the trials in this review included subjective outcomes, such as anxiety, pain, mood and quality of life. When participants cannot be blinded to the intervention, there is definitely an opportunity for bias when they are asked to report on these subjective outcomes.</P>
<P>For many trials, the principal investigators needed to be contacted to provide additional methodological and statistical information, which improved the quality of evidence in the review.</P>
<P>For anxiety and pain, there were moderate to large effects across studies. For anxiety, the trials did not agree on the size of effect, with some reporting much larger beneficial effects than others, resulting in a large confidence interval. In summary, the quality of evidence was low for the outcomes (i.e. anxiety, mood, pain, fatigue and quality of life) and very low for depression (<LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2016-08-01 11:36:32 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The strength of our review is that we searched all available databases and a large number of music therapy journals (English, German, and French language), checked reference lists of all relevant trials, contacted relevant experts for identification of unpublished trials, and included publications without restricting language. We requested additional data where necessary for all trials we considered for inclusion. This allowed us to get accurate information on the trial quality and data for most trials and helped us make well-informed trial selection decisions.</P>
<P>Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that we missed some published and unpublished trials, we are confident that our detailed search strategy combined with extensive handsearching identified all relevant trials. It is possible that we did not identify some grey literature; however, it is doubtful that this would have had a significant impact on our results. Grey literature tends to include trials with relatively small numbers of participants and inconclusive results (<LINK REF="REF-McAuley-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">McAuley 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>One of the included trials (<LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK>) was conducted by the lead author of this review. As for all new studies included in this update, the risk of bias was assessed by CD and LM. Data extraction was completed independently by AT.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2016-08-01 12:20:01 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>The findings of this review are consistent with the results of a review (32 RCTs and controlled clinical trials) assessing the effect of music interventions on psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients (<LINK REF="REF-Zhang-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Zhang 2012</LINK>). Zhang and colleagues reported a mean difference of &#8722;12.3 for anxiety (STAI-S, score range 20 to 80), &#8722;6.23 for depression (Self-Rating Depression Scale, score range 20 to 80), &#8722;0.52 for pain (0 to 10 numeric rating scale) and 13.32 for quality of life (Quality of Life - Cancer, score range 0-100). The authors also reported that the effects of music on vital signs, especially blood pressure, were small. In contrast, <LINK REF="REF-Nightingale-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nightingale 2013</LINK> (a review of four RCT studies) evaluated the effects of music on anxiety in adult cancer patients, reporting no evidence of an effect for music on anxiety. This was likely due to the small number of studies included in this review. In addition, reviewers included <LINK REF="STD-Kwekkeboom-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Kwekkeboom 2003</LINK> in the meta-analysis, which was a quite problematic trial in terms of the implementation of the music listening interventions, as discussed in the <LINK TAG="RESULTS" TYPE="SECTION">Results</LINK> section of our review. Study participants reported that the use of headphones while undergoing painful medical procedures was anxiety-provoking because it prevented them from hearing the surgeon. In addition, <LINK REF="REF-Nightingale-2013" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nightingale 2013</LINK> included <LINK REF="STD-Hanser-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Hanser 2006</LINK> in the meta-analysis, whereas we included this study in the narrative only. Our decision was based on a very high attrition rate (40%) and the inability to implement the music therapy intervention within the a priori set timeframe, thereby highly diluting the intervention, as reported by the authors.</P>

<CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2016-08-01 12:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2016-07-14 12:54:17 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This systematic review indicates that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue and QoL in people with cancer. Furthermore, the results suggest that music may reduce heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure, though this reduction is rather small and therefore may not be clinically significant. Results from single trials suggest that music listening in cancer patients undergoing surgery may reduce anesthetic and analgesic consumption and reduce the length of hospital stay, but more research is needed before drawing solid conclusions. Results from a single study furthermore suggest that post-surgery recovery time may be shortened when a music therapist offers live, individualized music before and during surgery. Overall, evidence of the trials included in this review suggest that music interventions may be offered as a complementary treatment to people with cancer.</P>
<P>No evidence of effect was found for distress, mood, physical functioning, spiritual well-being or oxygen saturation. However, only a small number of trials investigated the effects of music on these outcomes. More research is needed. We cannot draw any conclusions at this time regarding the effects of music interventions on coping, resilience, mean arterial pressure, immunologic functioning or communication behaviours because the results of the studies that included these outcomes could not be pooled or because we could only identify one trial.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-08-01 12:20:12 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Clare Jess">
<P>This systematic review provides evidence that music interventions may have beneficial effects on anxiety, pain, fatigue, QoL, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure in patients with cancer. Comparative analyses between music therapy and music medicine interventions indicate that music therapy is more effective in improving QoL than music medicine interventions. At this time, more RCTs are needed to determine the effectiveness of music medicine versus music therapy for outcomes other than quality of life. This can be achieved by including more music medicine as well as music therapy RCTs in future reviews, when these become available or, alternatively, future trials could directly compare the effects of these two types of interventions. It is important to note that <LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK> undertook such a comparative study based on the recommendation of the original systematic review, concluding that both music therapy and music medicine interventions were similarly effective for symptom management. However, the results of their mixed methods research study clearly indicated that even listening to pre-recorded music can evoke strong emotions and existential issues in people with cancer and that the participants in this study were grateful for the presence of a music therapist to process these emotions and fears. Participants furthermore emphasized the importance of interactive music making, as it allowed them to access their creativity; this is considered an important resource for the facilitation of resilience in the face of life's challenges.<BR/>
<BR/>Future research should explore patient characteristics as moderators of treatment benefits of music therapy interventions versus listening to pre-recorded music. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK> suggested that listening to music may cause distress in patients who have a negative outlook on life. It is possible that these patients are at greater risk for music's powerful capacity to access sad and traumatic memories, and such patients may be better served by listening to music in the presence of a music therapist who can help them process their emotions. On the other hand, Bradt and colleagues emphasize that some patients have a great need for stability and emotional security during this challenging time in their life and may therefore prefer the familiarity of their own music. Self selected music presents predictable musical and emotional content and may therefore provide a much needed holding environment for the patient.</P>
<P>We recommend that future research efforts aim to enhance understanding of how each of music therapy and music medicine interventions can be optimized for symptom management, how music interventions can best serve patients along the cancer treatment trajectory, and what unique aspects of music therapy and music medicine interventions contribute to the care of patients (<LINK REF="STD-Bradt-2015" TYPE="STUDY">Bradt 2015</LINK>).</P>
<P>As stated in other reviews, it is important that investigators consider qualitative and mixed methods research, as these enhance understanding of the qualitative aspects of a patient's experience and identify factors that may contribute to or limit the effectiveness of music therapy or music medicine interventions (<LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2013a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2013a</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Bradt-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bradt 2014</LINK>).</P>
<P>Future trials that use listening to pre-recorded music should report more details related to the music selections made available to participants and exercise greater care in selecting music that reflects the patient's true preference (rather than just giving the patient the option to select from four or five general genres). In addition, researchers need to carefully consider the potential negative impact of the use of headphones during procedures because of hampered communication between the patient and medical personnel.</P>
<P>More research is needed that examines the relationship between frequency and duration of music interventions and treatment effects.</P>
<P>Many trials used small sample sizes and did not indicate the use of power calculations. Future trials need to include power calculations in order to use adequate sample sizes.</P>
<P>More studies are needed on the use of music interventions in pediatric patients with cancer. Of the 52 trials in this review, only four studies focused on outcomes in children and adolescents.</P>
<P>Many studies examined the effects of music interventions on anxiety, but more studies are needed for all other outcomes included in this review.</P>
<P>Formal cost-benefit evaluations of music medicine and music therapy are needed.</P>

<P>Unacceptable methodological quality: there were important pain-related differences between the 2 groups at pre-test. For example, there was unequal distribution of different procedures with the music group, which had significantly more biopsy procedures than the control group. Because biopsy procedures are more painful than other procedures included in the study, the author flagged this as a serious confounding variable. In addition, the amount of time that the patient listened to music was not controlled. The author stated that some patients only listened for 30 seconds prior to procedure.</P>
