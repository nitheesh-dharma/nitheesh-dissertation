<SUMMARY_BODY>
<P>Premature babies who are not yet ready to digest and absorb full milk feeds are given lipids through a vein to improve their nutrition. The issue of how early the lipids should be introduced to be advantageous while causing no harm is a matter of debate. The review found that, while no side effects were reported, there was no statistically significant benefit of introducing lipids before five days of age. Long term effects of early introduction of lipids in premature babies have not been reported. </P>

</SUMMARY>
<ABSTRACT>
<ABS_BACKGROUND>
<P>Lipids are essential components of parenteral nutrition for preterm infants. Parenteral lipids can be administered through a peripheral vein, and their early introduction offers the potential advantages of increasing energy intake and providing essential fatty acids and fat soluble vitamins. Concerns have been raised about potential adverse effects including chronic lung disease (CLD), increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, impaired pulmonary gas diffusion, bilirubin toxicity, sepsis and free radical stress.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<P>To determine the safety and efficacy of 'early' (&#8804; 5 days after birth) introduction of lipids to parenterally fed preterm infants.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<P>Eligible studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (December 2004), EMBASE 1980 - 2004, Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004) and CINAHL (December 1982 - December 2004). Abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research were hand searched from 1980 to 2004 inclusive. No language restrictions were applied.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<P>All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials comparing 'early' versus 'no early' introduction of lipids to preterm infants. </P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<P>Data were sought regarding effects on growth and risk of CLD or death, other respiratory morbidities including duration of respiratory support, duration of supplemental oxygen, the need for home oxygen, pneumothorax (PTX), pulmonary haemorrhage and pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), &#8805; stage 2 necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), clinically significant thrombocytopenia and significant jaundice. Methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed according to allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow up. When appropriate, meta-analysis was conducted to provide a pooled estimate of effect. For categorical data the Typical relative risk (RR), Typical risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean difference (WMD). </P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS>
<P>Five studies (n = 397) were included in the review. All studies compared the effectiveness and safety of 'early' introduction versus 'no early' introduction of lipids in preterm infants. The timing of introduction of 'early lipids' ranged from &lt; 12 hours after birth to day five of life. The timing of introduction of lipids in the 'no early' lipid group ranged from day six after birth to day 14 after birth. The initial dose ranged from 0.5 - 1 g/kg/day with gradual daily increments up to a maximum of 2.5 - 3.5 g/kg/day.<BR/>For the primary outcomes (growth, death and CLD), there was no statistically significant difference between the 'early' lipid and 'no early' lipid groups.<BR/>Days to regain birth weight: [WMD 0.59 (95% CI -2.41, 3.58); two trials; N = 71].<BR/>Rate of weight gain (g/day) during period of hospital stay: [MD -2.40 (95% CI -5.30, 0.50); one trial; N = 129]<BR/>Death (irrespective of time): [Typical RR 1.04 (95% CI 0.69, 1.56); Typical RD 0.01 (95% CI -0.07, 0.08); five trials; N = 397]<BR/>Neonatal deaths: [Typical RR 1.35 (95% CI 0.78, 2.34); Typical RD 0.05 (95% CI -0.04, 0.13); four trials; N = 268].<BR/>CLD: [Typical RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.81, 1.49); Typical RD 0.04 (95% CI -0.09, 0.17); two trials; N = 193].</P>
<P>For the secondary outcomes of other respiratory morbidities including duration of respiratory support, duration of supplemental oxygen, PTX, pulmonary haemorrhage, PIE, NEC, ROP, PDA, sepsis, IVH and significant jaundice, there were no statistically significant differences between 'early' and 'no early' lipid groups. </P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS>
<P>No statistically significant effects of 'early introduction' of lipids on short term nutritional or other clinical outcomes, either benefits or adverse effects, were demonstrated in the studies reviewed. Based on the currently available evidence, 'early' initiation of lipids (&#8804; 5 days after birth) can not be recommended for short term growth or to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. </P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2008-10-16 12:03:53 -0400" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Lipids are essential components of parenteral nutrition for preterm infants to provide essential fatty acids (EFA) and to meet their high energy needs. Preterm infants have very limited endogenous lipid stores (<LINK REF="REF-Koletzko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koletzko 2002</LINK>). Parenteral lipids are an attractive source of nutrition early in postnatal life because of their high energy density (<LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 2002</LINK>), energy efficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Flatt-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Flatt 1985</LINK>), isotonicity with plasma, and suitability for administration through a peripheral vein (<LINK REF="REF-Skeie-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Skeie 1988</LINK>). Parenteral lipid infusion enables the delivery of fat soluble vitamins.</P>
<P>Even a short delay of 3-7 days in supplying lipids to parenterally fed preterm infants leads to biochemical EFA deficiency (<LINK REF="REF-Gutcher-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutcher 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Friedman-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Friedman 1976</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Foote-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foote 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 1993</LINK>). EFA deficiency increases antioxidant susceptibility in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Tomsits-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomsits 2000</LINK>). Prenatal and postnatal EFA deficiency reduces body and brain weights (<LINK REF="REF-Van-Aerde-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Aerde 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>EFA deficiency can be prevented with introduction of as little as 0.5 to 1 g/kg/day lipid infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Gutcher-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gutcher 1991</LINK>). Prevention of EFA deficiency in preterm infants could theoretically decrease the prevalence of complications associated with free radical formation such as CLD and ROP (<LINK REF="REF-Tomsits-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomsits 2000</LINK>). Experimental animal studies suggest that increasing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can confer a protective effect against the toxic effects of hyperoxia on the newborn animal lung (<LINK REF="REF-Sosenko-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosenko 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sosenko-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosenko 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>The provision of parenteral lipids to sick preterm infants early in postnatal life may have risks. Concerns have been expressed about the potential adverse effects of 'early' lipid infusions in preterm infants including increased rates of sepsis due to coagulase negative staphylococci (<LINK REF="REF-Avila_x002d_Figueroa-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Avila-Figueroa 1998</LINK>), CLD and mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Cooke-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cooke 1991</LINK>). Reported pulmonary complications include deposition of fat globules in capillaries, alveolar macrophages and pulmonary arteriolar lining cells (<LINK REF="REF-Barson-1978" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barson 1978</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Levene-1980" TYPE="REFERENCE">Levene 1980</LINK>), interference with pulmonary gas diffusion (<LINK REF="REF-Greene-1976" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greene 1976</LINK>) and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Prasertsom-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prasertsom 1996</LINK>). Lipid infusion in adults with adult respiratory syndrome (ARDS) causes deterioration in lung functions and haemodynamics through activation of inflammatory mediators (<LINK REF="REF-Lekka-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lekka 2004</LINK>). Some studies have shown that lipid infusions convey an increased free radical stress (<LINK REF="REF-Pitkanen-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitkanen 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pitkanen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitkanen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helbock-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helbock 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neuzil-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuzil 1995</LINK>). Free fatty acids released after lipolysis of the parenteral lipids may displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites, resulting in increased levels of unbound bilirubin and an increased risk of kernicterus (<LINK REF="REF-Spear-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spear 1985</LINK>). Thrombocytopenia was reported as one of side effects of lipid infusion (<LINK REF="REF-Lipson-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipson 1974</LINK>). Most of the current literature suggests that there is no effect of parenteral lipid infusion on platelet number or function (<LINK REF="REF-Spear-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Spear 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Herson-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Herson 1989</LINK>).<BR/>
<BR/>The American Academy of Pediatrics (<LINK REF="REF-AAP-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">AAP 2003</LINK>) gives recommendations about the rate of lipid infusion, but not guidelines about how early lipids can be started. Reviews on the subject recommend early initiation of lipids on the first or second day of life at a low dose of 0.5-1 g/kg/day, gradually increasing to 3-3.5 g/kg/day, and with daily infusion over 20-24 hour period (<LINK REF="REF-Putet-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Putet 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ziegler-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ziegler 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Koletzko-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Koletzko 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Innis-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Innis 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Aerde-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Aerde 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis on the subject published in abstract form (<LINK REF="REF-Fox-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>) reported that 'early' lipid infusion when compared to 'late' lipid infusion is not associated with an increased risk CLD or death. It did not address the issue of potential advantages of early lipid infusion like physical growth and reduction in incidence of free-radical-injury associated diseases of prematurity like ROP, NEC and IVH. Hence we thought it is justified to do a systematic review and meta-analysis.</P>

<P>The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Trials were identified by MEDLINE (1966 to December 2004), EMBASE 1980 - 2004, Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2004) and CINAHL (December 1982 - December 2004). Abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research from 1980 to 2004 inclusive were hand searched.</P>
<P>MEDLINE was searched using the following MeSH terms or text words: infant, newborn/OR infant, low birth weight/OR infant, very low birth weight/OR infant, premature AND intravenous fat emulsion, intralipid, intravenous lipid, intravenous fat, lipid infusion, parenteral lipid and lipid emulsion in different combinations. Articles so obtained were hand searched to identify randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials which addressed the issue of 'early' introduction of parenteral lipids to preterm infants.</P>
<P>Reference lists of published narrative and systematic reviews were also reviewed. No language restriction was applied. The authors of all published studies were contacted to clarify reported data or provide additional information including mean and standard deviations. <LINK REF="STD-Sosenko-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sosenko 1993</LINK> provided clarification of existing data, but no additional information was available. <LINK REF="STD-Brownlee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brownlee 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Alwaidh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alwaidh 1996</LINK> (contact author Ryan) and <LINK REF="STD-Gilbertson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbertson 1991</LINK> (contact author Kovar) responded, but no additional information was available from these three authors.

<DATA_COLLECTION>
<P> Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.</P>
<P>
<B>Selection process:</B> Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials fulfilling the selection criteria were included. Selection was done separately by two investigators (KS and SR). </P>
<P>
<B>Criteria for assessing the methodological quality of the studies:</B> Two authors (KS and SR) assessed each study separately. Quality of included trials was evaluated independently by the authors, using the following criteria: Allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, blinding of outcome assessment and completeness of follow up. There are three potential answers to these questions: yes, no, cannot tell. </P>
<P>
<B>Data extraction and entry:</B> Both authors extracted, assessed and coded separately all data for each study, using a form that was designed specifically for this review. Any standard error of the mean was replaced by the corresponding standard deviation. For each study, final data was entered into RevMan by one author (SR) and then checked by a second author (KS). At each stage any disagreement was resolved by discussion.</P>
<P>
<B>Statistical analysis:</B> Standard method of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used, using a fixed effect model for meta-analysis. In assessing the treatment effects, we used the Typical relative risk and Typical risk difference, with 95% confidence intervals, for categorical outcomes. If risk difference (RD) was statistically significant, number needed to treat (1/RD) was calculated as well. For outcomes measured on a continuous scale we used the weighted mean difference (WMD), with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity tests were performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data. Results of the I<SUP>2 </SUP>statistic are reported. </P>

There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes of respiratory morbidity, significant jaundice, NEC, ROP, PDA, sepsis, IVH and thrombocytopenia. An increased incidence of mortality and pulmonary haemorrhage was reported by <LINK REF="STD-Sosenko-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sosenko 1993</LINK> in the subgroup of babies with birth weight 600-800 g. However significantly fewer babies in this subgroup had received antenatal corticosteroids which may have contributed to the morbidity and mortality. <LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1988</LINK> reported that 'early' administration of lipids to preterm infants is associated with increased incidence of CLD and ROP which was postulated as mediated by increased levels of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane B2. Similar results were not replicated by the subsequent RCTs. The meta-analysis revealed that there was a trend towards beneficial effect of 'early' lipid administration on the incidence of PDA and CNS haemorrhage but both did not reach statistically significant levels.</P>
<P>A meta-analysis (published as abstract: <LINK REF="REF-Fox-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Fox 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1998</LINK>)) of six prospective controlled trials in preterm infants also reported that 'early' lipid infusion is not associated with an increased risk of death or CLD when compared to 'late' lipid infusion. In addition to <LINK REF="STD-Alwaidh-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Alwaidh 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Brownlee-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Brownlee 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gilbertson-1991" TYPE="STUDY">Gilbertson 1991</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hammerman-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Hammerman 1988</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Sosenko-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Sosenko 1993</LINK> which are included in this review, they also included <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1997</LINK> in the analysis. As mentioned previously, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-Wilson-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Wilson 1997</LINK> because in both 'early' and 'no early' lipid groups, lipids were started &#8804; 5 days of life. In addition to effects on death and CLD that were reported in that meta-analysis, our review compared the effect of 'early' versus 'no early' introduction of lipids on physical growth and other morbidities of prematurity.</P>
<P>Essential fatty acid deficiency increases antioxidant susceptibility in preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Tomsits-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Tomsits 2000</LINK>). Prevention of EFA deficiency by 'early' introduction of lipid emulsions could theoretically decrease the prevalence of complications associated with free radical formation such as BPD and ROP. Experimental animal studies suggest that increasing lung lipid polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can confer a protective effect against the toxic effects of hyperoxia on the newborn animal lung (<LINK REF="REF-Sosenko-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosenko 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Sosenko-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sosenko 1991</LINK>). These theoretical advantages of 'early' lipid administration were generally not found in clinical trials. The possible explanation may be because the morbidities of the preterm infant are multifactorial in nature rather than just related to free radical injury. Secondly the lipid emulsion itself carries an increased free radical stress (<LINK REF="REF-Pitkanen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pitkanen 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Helbock-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Helbock 1993</LINK>). Elevated levels of oxidized lipids can be formed during its clinical use, especially when combined with phototherapy. Because lipid hydroperoxides are cytotoxic, inadvertent infusion of rancid lipid may add to the numerous problems encountered by preterm infants (<LINK REF="REF-Neuzil-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neuzil 1995</LINK>). The apparent lack of benefit on short term physical growth may be due to the very small time difference (five days) between 'early' and 'no early' lipids as defined in this review.</P>
<P>Essential fatty acids are necessary for brain development (<LINK REF="REF-Jensen-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jensen 2002</LINK>). It is not clear whether a short duration of deficiency of essential fatty acids will affect long term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. The studies in our review did not address the issue of long term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</P>
</DISCUSSION>
<CONCLUSIONS>
<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<P>No statistically significant effects of 'early' introduction of lipids on short term nutritional or other clinical outcomes, either benefits or adverse effects, were demonstrated in the studies reviewed. Based on the currently available data, 'early' introduction of lipids (&#8804; 5 days after birth) cannot be recommended for short term growth or to prevent morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. </P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH>
<P>An RCT with sample size adequate to estimate effects on long term growth, respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes is required to determine efficacy and safety of 'early' introduction of lipids in preterm infants. Future research needs to concentrate on infants less than 28 weeks gestation as these infants have high risk of short term morbidity, mortality and long term neurodevelopmental sequelae.</P>
