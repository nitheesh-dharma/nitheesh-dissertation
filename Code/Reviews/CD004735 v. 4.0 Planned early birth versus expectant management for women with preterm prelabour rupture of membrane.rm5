<P>Twelve trials included for this update. There are no clear differences in the incidence of neonatal sepsis between women delivered immediately or managed expectantly in preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Early planned birth is associated with an increase in the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal mortality and the likelihood of caesarean section.

<TITLE MODIFIED="2016-04-29 03:59:08 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">Is it better for the baby to be born immediately or wait for labour to start if the waters break without contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy?</TITLE>
<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2017-02-15 06:53:09 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>
<B>What is the issue?</B>
</P>
<P>If a pregnant woman's waters break without contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy there are two options: for the baby to be born as soon as possible, or to wait for labour to start naturally. We need to carefully look at the risks and benefits of both options.</P>
<P>
<B>Why is this important?</B>
</P>
<P>Being born too early can increase the chance of problems linked to prematurity, such as breathing difficulties and longer stays in the neonatal intensive care unit. However, staying in the womb may cause infections for both mother and baby that can lead to serious health problems and even death. This review aims to find out which is the best option.</P>
<P>
<B>What evidence did we find?</B>
</P>
<P>We included 12 trials that involved 3617 women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes. Women were randomly selected to either early birth or expectant management (wait for birth).The women were between 25 to 37 weeks of pregnancy. The studies happened in 16 countries between 1977 and 2013. Overall, the 12 studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias and the evidence was of moderate to high quality.</P>
<P>We found no difference in the rate of infant infection or infant death before birth between the two groups. However, early birth increased the risk of infant death after birth, as well as breathing problems, with the newborn needing extra help to breathe. The babies of women who had a planned early birth were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care, and were born earlier than babies of women who waited to give birth. Early birth also increased the rate of caesarean section, induction of labour and the risk of infection of the lining of the womb but decreased the risk of infection in the membranes. Women had a longer hospital stay if they were randomised to waiting.</P>
<P>
<B>What does this mean?</B>
</P>
<P>In women whose waters break before 37 weeks of pregnancy, waiting for labour to begin naturally is the best option for healthier outcomes, as long as there are no other reasons why the baby should be born immediately.</P>

<P>Current management of preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) involves either initiating birth soon after PPROM or, alternatively, adopting a 'wait and see' approach (expectant management).

<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2016-12-23 16:16:44 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We included 12 trials in the review (3617 women and 3628 babies). For primary outcomes, we identified no clear differences between early birth and expectant management in neonatal sepsis (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.30, 12 trials, 3628 babies, evidence graded moderate), or proven neonatal infection with positive blood culture (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.21, seven trials, 2925 babies). However, early birth increased the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53, 12 trials, 3622 babies, evidence graded high). Early birth was also associated with an increased rate of caesarean section (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.44, 12 trials, 3620 women, evidence graded high).</P>
<P>Assessment of secondary perinatal outcomes showed no clear differences in overall perinatal mortality (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.50, 11 trials, 3319 babies), or intrauterine deaths (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.57, 11 trials, 3321 babies) when comparing early birth with expectant management. However, early birth was associated with a higher rate of neonatal death (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.56, 11 trials, 3316 babies) and need for ventilation (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.58, seven trials, 2895 babies, evidence graded high). Babies of women randomised to early birth were delivered at a gestational age lower than those randomised to expectant management (mean difference (MD) -0.48 weeks, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.39, eight trials, 3139 babies). Admission to neonatal intensive care was more likely for those babies randomised to early birth (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.24, four trials, 2691 babies, evidence graded moderate).</P>
<P>In assessing secondary maternal outcomes, we found that early birth was associated with a decreased rate of chorioamnionitis (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.95, eight trials, 1358 women, evidence graded moderate), and an increased rate of endometritis (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.59, seven trials, 2980 women). As expected due to the intervention, women randomised to early birth had a higher chance of having an induction of labour (RR 2.18, 95% CI 2.01 to 2.36, four trials, 2691 women). Women randomised to early birth had a decreased total length of hospitalisation (MD -1.75 days, 95% CI -2.45 to -1.05, six trials, 2848 women, evidence graded moderate).</P>
<P>Subgroup analyses indicated improved maternal and infant outcomes in expectant management in pregnancies greater than 34 weeks' gestation, specifically relating to RDS and maternal infections. The use of prophylactic antibiotics were shown to be effective in reducing maternal infections in women randomised to expectant management.</P>
<P>Overall, we assessed all 12 studies as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Some studies lacked an adequate description of methods and the risk of bias could only be assessed as unclear. In five of the studies there were one and/or two domains where the risk of bias was judged as high. GRADE profiling showed the quality of evidence across all critical outcomes to be moderate to high.</P>
</ABS_RESULTS>
<ABS_CONCLUSIONS MODIFIED="2017-02-15 06:52:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>With the addition of five randomised controlled trials (2927 women) to this updated review, we found no clinically important difference in the incidence of neonatal sepsis between women who birth immediately and those managed expectantly in PPROM prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Early planned birth was associated with an increase in the incidence of neonatal RDS, need for ventilation, neonatal mortality, endometritis, admission to neonatal intensive care, and the likelihood of birth by caesarean section, but a decreased incidence of chorioamnionitis. Women randomised to early birth also had an increased risk of labour induction, but a decreased length of hospital stay. Babies of women randomised to early birth were more likely to be born at a lower gestational age. </P>
<P>In women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation with no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy, a policy of expectant management with careful monitoring was associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby.</P>
<P>The direction of future research should be aimed at determining which groups of women with PPROM would not benefit from expectant management. This could be determined by analysing subgroups according to gestational age at presentation, corticosteroid usage, and abnormal vaginal microbiological colonisation. Research should also evaluate long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2017-02-15 06:53:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2014-03-11 11:10:55 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Leanne V Jones">
<P>Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) occurs when there is rupture of the membranes prior to term and prior to the onset of labour. PPROM complicates pregnancy for 1% to 2% of all women and is associated with 30% to 40% of preterm births (less than 37 weeks) (<LINK REF="REF-Arias-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arias 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lee-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2005</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2016-04-21 07:15:26 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The purpose of this review is to determine the optimal management for women and their babies with pregnancies complicated by PPROM. This could either be planned delivery soon after rupture of the membranes or expectant management. Planned early birth involves the birth of the baby near to the time of rupture of the membranes and may be by induction of labour or caesarean section. Expectant management involves observation of the mother and baby and awaiting the spontaneous onset of labour in the absence of any complications that may necessitate delivery. Women with PPROM who are managed expectantly may then have the delivery of their baby planned for term if labour has not ensued.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2016-12-23 16:38:52 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The management of PPROM is dependent upon the gestation at which rupture of the membranes occurs. The health benefits for the fetus in continuing a pregnancy after PPROM may be considerable, particularly in the late second and early third trimesters. However, there is currently no consensus as to the optimal management of PPROM in women in whom the fetus is relatively mature, at gestations near to term such as in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. The aim of care for women with PPROM is to maximise the benefits of further fetal maturity while avoiding the potential harms of remaining in utero.</P>
<P>There are treatments such as antibiotics and antenatal corticosteroids that can reduce associated complications for the mother and baby in pregnancies complicated by PPROM. The use of antibiotics in PPROM significantly improves neonatal and maternal morbidity including prolongation of pregnancy, reduction in neonatal infection, reduced need for oxygen therapy and less risk of abnormal cerebral ultrasound (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2003</LINK>). In addition, antenatal corticosteroids have been shown to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress, intraventricular haemorrhage (bleeding within the ventricles of the baby's brain) and neonatal death in the preterm neonate (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 2006</LINK>). These beneficial effects of corticosteroids also apply to women with PPROM (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 2001</LINK>).</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2017-02-15 06:53:59 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There are recognised maternal and fetal risks associated with PPROM. These complications decrease the nearer to term that PPROM occurs. The recognised complications include ascending infection, cord prolapse (prolapsing of the umbilical cord through the cervix), intrapartum fetal distress and abruption (premature detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall) (<LINK REF="REF-Gonen-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gonen 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Major-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Major 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2003</LINK>). It may be that managing PPROM expectantly by awaiting the spontaneous onset of labour increases the risk to the fetus of these complications. In particular prolonged exposure to intrauterine infection is of major concern for the neonate. In fact it has been demonstrated that neonatal sepsis is twice as common in the setting of PPROM compared with preterm birth after preterm labour with intact membranes (<LINK REF="REF-Seo-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Seo 1992</LINK>).</P>
<P>There are potential risks associated with planned early delivery in pregnancies complicated by PPROM between 30 and 37 weeks' gestation. In particular the attendant risks of iatrogenic prematurity associated with birth before term but greater than 30 weeks' gestation are significant. These complications may include respiratory distress (<LINK REF="REF-Jones-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1996</LINK>), sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis (injury to the bowel of newborn babies), intraventricular haemorrhage, prolonged stays in the neonatal nursery, difficulty with thermoregulation and difficulty with breastfeeding (<LINK REF="REF-Engle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engle 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Robertson-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Robertson 1992</LINK>). These complications are less common when delivery occurs after 32 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Mercer-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mercer 2003</LINK>). A number of retrospective studies have similarly found a decrease in neonatal morbidity associated with birth at 34 weeks' gestation (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neerhof-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neerhof 1999</LINK>). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, hyperbilirubinaemia (high bilirubin within in the babies' blood which results in a yellow discolouration of the neonates' skin referred to as jaundice) and duration of stay in the neonatal nursery was significantly reduced in infants born after 34 weeks' gestation compared with those born before 34 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lewis-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lewis 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Neerhof-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Neerhof 1999</LINK>). Infants born beyond 34 weeks' gestation do have better outcomes than those born prior to 34 weeks, however those babies born between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation are still physiologically immature and as such do have significantly increased morbidity and mortality as compared with those infants born at term (<LINK REF="REF-Engle-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engle 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Engle-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Engle 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>The previous version of this review (<LINK REF="REF-Buchanan-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">Buchanan 2010</LINK>), which included seven trials and 690 women, found there was insufficient evidence available at that time to guide clinical practice and that all included trials had methodological weaknesses.</P>
<P>There is consensus on the management of term pregnancies with PROM (prelabour rupture of the membranes) (<LINK REF="REF-Middleton-2017" TYPE="REFERENCE">Middleton 2017</LINK>). This Cochrane review found that fewer women in the planned compared with the expectant management groups had chorioamnionitis (inflammation of the fetal membranes) and/or endometritis (a postpartum infection of the lining of the womb) (average risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.72, eight trials, 6864 women). Additionally, early birth appeared to reduce the likelihood of definite or probable early-onset neonatal sepsis (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92, sixteen trials, 7314 infants). There was no clear difference in the mode of birth between the groups.</P>
<P>It is evident that there is an increased incidence of chorioamnionitis associated with expectant management in women with PROM (<LINK REF="REF-Hannah-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hannah 1996</LINK>). Histological evidence of chorioamnionitis is present in up to 50% of women who deliver preterm and is often not associated with clinical symptoms or signs. Chorioamnionitis is a known significant risk factor for the development of both cystic periventricular leukomalacia (cystic changes around the ventricles of the babies brain) and cerebral palsy (<LINK REF="REF-Gaudet-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gaudet 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wu-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wu 2000</LINK>). Therefore, the question remains as to whether there is an increased chance of an adverse neurological outcome in those infants whose mothers are managed expectantly with PPROM by increasing their duration of exposure to often subclinical chorioamnionitis.</P>
<P>The objective of this review is to assess and further define the optimal management for women with PPROM prior to 37 weeks' gestation.</P>

<P>We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (30 September 2016).</P>
<P>The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth. For full search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth&#8217;s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link to the editorial information about the <A HREF="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/PREG/frame.html">Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth</A> in the Cochrane Library and select the &#8216;<I>

<P>Two people screen search results and review the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above. Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords. This results in a more specific search set which has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (<LINK TAG="INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Included studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>; <LINK TAG="ONGOING_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Ongoing studies</LINK>).</P>

<P>We used the <A HREF="http://www.guidelinedevelopment.org/">GRADEproGDT</A> (GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool) to import data from RevMan 5.3 (<LINK REF="REF-RevMan-2014" TYPE="REFERENCE">RevMan 2014</LINK>) to create 'Summary of findings' tables. We produced a summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.</P>

<P>The search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register retrieved 14 additional reports for consideration in this updated review, which contributed four additional studies to the review. Five of the reports were based on one study (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK>), six on another (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK>), four on the third (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK>) and one on the fourth (<LINK REF="STD-Koroveshi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koroveshi 2013</LINK>). We moved one study from 'excluded studies' in the first review to 'included studies' (<LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>) in this update as the authors felt the study fitted the inclusion criteria after translation into English. We moved another study from 'ongoing' to 'excluded' as the trial was terminated prematurely due to poor recruitment (<LINK REF="STD-Lacaze-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Lacaze 2006</LINK>).

One study (<LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>), although inclusion criteria specified singleton pregnancies only, reported outcomes for two sets of twins in each group in the analysis.</P>

<P>All of the studies defined determination of gestational age for inclusion by menstrual history or early ultrasound examination to give the most accurate clinical estimate. In the absence of an accurate clinical estimate, seven of the studies used ultrasound at the time of presentation to hospital to date the pregnancy (<LINK REF="STD-Garite-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 1987</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Intervention</HEADING>
<P>The intervention assessed by these studies was the effect of early birth on maternal and fetal well being. The timing of intervention for early birth differed between the studies. The mean latency from PROM to birth in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mercer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 1987</LINK>) indicated that birth was planned as soon as practicable from randomisation and less than 24 hours, although this was not explicitly stated in all the trials. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>) did not indicate when birth was intended but results indicated a median latency of three days. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK> planned for early birth between 24 and 48 hours after initial rupture of membranes and 24 hours after initiation of steroid therapy, while <LINK REF="STD-Garite-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1981</LINK> defined planned early birth as 48 hours after treatment with corticosteroids. <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1985</LINK> had an even longer delay in the early birth group and planned for early birth 48 to 72 hours after PPROM and initiation of steroid treatment. <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK> defined timing of birth as birth scheduled as close to randomisation as possible and preferably within 24 hours. In both <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK> women were randomised if not spontaneously delivered within 24 hours after initial rupture of membranes and women randomised to early birth were induced within 24 hours after randomisation.</P>
<P>The only study with a control arm of early birth for PPROM was <LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>. As a result, for the discussion and analysis, we flipped the definition and results for the 'treatment' group and the 'control' group in this study to be consistent with the rest of the studies, which all defined the control arm as being expectant management. The intention of expectant management was defined in the majority of studies as waiting until spontaneous labour or until there was medical indication to facilitate birth, such as infection or fetal distress. The exceptions were <LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Koroveshi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koroveshi 2013</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK>, which did not specify the intent of expectant management, although <LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK> did indicate in an outcomes table that the reasons for delivery in the expectant management group were onset of labour, infection, oligohydramnios and fetal distress. <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1985</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 1987</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK> allowed women to be discharged home at the discretion of the attending physician or according to local protocol, while the remainder of the studies required the women in the trial to be hospitalised until birth.</P>
<P>The co-interventions also differed between the included studies. <LINK REF="STD-Cox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1995</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Mercer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mercer 1993</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 1987</LINK> did not treat the women with corticosteroids or tocolysis. <LINK REF="STD-Garite-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1981</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1985</LINK> treated women in the early birth groups with corticosteroids and tocolysis as required. <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK> randomised women to steroids or no steroid therapy in the early birth group. These women in the early birth group were also treated with tocolytics. <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK> used tocolytics, antibiotics and corticosteroids according to local protocol, whereas <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK> only used tocolytics and antibiotics according to local protocol, but gave corticosteroids to women with PPROM less than 34 weeks' gestation. <LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK> used tocolytics as well as a fetal lung maturity protocol of intravenous aminophylline in the early birth arm, which was repeated weekly in the women randomised to expectant management. Antibiotics were not used unless there were signs of chorioamnionitis, in which case birth was indicated. <LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998</LINK> was the only trial in which prophylactic antibiotics were used for all women. In this trial all women were treated with ampicillin.</P>

<P>Chorioamnionitis was defined in all of the studies as maternal temperature associated with uterine tenderness, maternal or fetal tachycardia, or both, and/or foul smelling amniotic fluid in the absence of any other cause of identifiable infection. None of the studies confirmed the presence of clinical chorioamnionitis pathologically with a histological examination of the placenta and fetal membranes. <LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK> additionally included in their diagnosis a leucocyte count of 15,000 in maternal blood at the start of the study or a 50% increase from the baseline reading.</P>

<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the trials in assessing neonatal treatment with antibiotics as demonstrated by an I of 80%.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Neonatal hospitalisation</HEADING>
<P>Admission to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.24, four trials, 2691 babies, evidence graded moderate, 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.22" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.22</LINK>) was higher for those babies randomised to early birth. However, the length of stay in neonatal intensive care for those babies who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was no different between the two groups (MD -0.17 days, 95% CI -1.62 to 1.27, four trials, 2121 babies, Tau = 1.65, I = 85%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.23" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.23</LINK>). This may suggest that although fewer babies in the expectant management arm were admitted to NICU, their length of stay in NICU was longer. Furthermore, the duration of days in NICU for one trial (<LINK REF="STD-Iams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1985</LINK>) was considerably longer than the other three trials that assessed this outcome. This may be attributed to the earlier gestation at randomisation (28 to 34 weeks as compared to 34 to 36 + 6 weeks) as well as being the oldest of the four trials (1985). Changes in clinical practice over time may have influenced time spent in NICU. Two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK>) were excluded from this outcome on the advice of the study author as there was uncertainty regarding the denominator used for the analysis. Overall duration of neonatal hospitalisation (MD 0.67 days, 95% CI -0.28 to 1.61, six trials, 2832 babies, Tau = 0.80, I = 71%, 
<LINK REF="CMP-001.24" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.24</LINK>) was also no different between those babies in the early birth group compared to the expectant management group.</P>
<P>Heterogeneity for all these outcomes was high. This was likely due to the differences in clinical practice as evidenced by the large number of countries and sites represented in this review. Many hospitals routinely admit babies where the pregnancy is complicated by PPROM to NICU for observation for a specified period of time, whereas others do not.</P>

<P>In assessing maternal outcomes, we found that early birth was associated with a decreased rate of chorioamnionitis (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.95, eight trials, 1358 women, evidence graded moderate, Tau = 0.36, I = 48%, <LINK REF="CMP-001.25" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.25</LINK>). However, early birth was associated with an increased rate of endometritis (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.59, seven trials, 2980 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.26" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.26</LINK>). There was no difference between early planned birth and expectant management in the risk of postpartum fever (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.03, one trial, 1835 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.27" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.27</LINK>).</P>
<P>There was substantial heterogeneity between the trials in assessing chorioamnionitis as demonstrated by an I of 48%. To analyse the source of heterogeneity we performed a number of subgroup analyses. The subgroup analysis comparing those trials in which early birth occurred less than 24 hours after randomisation reduced chorioamnionitis (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55, three trials, 342 women), while no difference was seen when planned birth was 24 hours or more from randomisation (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.95, five trials, 1016 women). An interaction test for this difference between subgroups was significant in assessing the subgroup of early birth on chorioamnionitis: Chi = 6.02, df = 1 (P = 0.01), I = 83.4%, <LINK REF="CMP-005.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.5</LINK>). Likewise, the subgroup analysis for gestational age at randomisation showed a reduction in chorioamnionitis in women greater than 34 weeks' gestation (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.57, three trials, 847 women) compared to women less than 34 weeks' gestation (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.30, four trials, 418 women).

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Other complications</HEADING>
<P>There were no clear differences in rates of placental abruption between the two groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.87, one trial, 1835 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.28" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.28</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Mode of birth</HEADING>
<P>As expected due to the intervention, women randomised to early birth had a higher chance of having an induction of labour as compared to women randomised to expectant management (RR 2.18, 95% CI 2.01 to 2.36, four trials, 2691 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.29" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.29</LINK>). In <LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>, the results were probably in favour of the expectant management group, with more women in the planned early birth group using spinal/epidural anaesthesia (average RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.65, three trials, 2562 women, Tau = 0.03, I <I>= </I>57%<I>, </I>
<LINK REF="CMP-001.30" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.30</LINK>). The high heterogeneity for this outcome was likely due to the differences in clinical practice between sites regarding the availability and use of epidural/spinal anaesthesia. The chances of a vaginal birth were lower in women randomised to early birth (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.97, 12 trials, 3618 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.31" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.31</LINK>), although the rate of operative vaginal birth showed no difference (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10, four trials, 2685 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.32" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.32</LINK>). Although caesarean section rates were higher in the early birth group, if the reason for the caesarean section was fetal distress, the difference between the early birth group and the expectant management group was not apparent (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.20, seven trials, 2918 women, <LINK REF="CMP-001.33" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.33</LINK>).</P>

<P>The test for subgroup differences were not significant for neonatal infection (<LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>), neonatal infection confirmed with positive blood culture (<LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>), RDS (<LINK REF="CMP-004.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.3</LINK>), caesarean section (<LINK REF="CMP-004.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.4</LINK>), or chorioamnionitis (<LINK REF="CMP-004.05" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.5</LINK>), between trials whether all, none or some women received prophylactic antibiotics. However, there was an increase in endometritis in women randomised to early birth in trials that did not use prophylactic antibiotics (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.84, four trials, 418 women) as compared to trials where some women received prophylactic antibiotics (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.40, three trials, 2562 women).

Overall effect differences showed a decrease in chorioamnionitis in expectant management when all or some prophylactic antibiotics were used, suggesting that antibiotics were effective in reducing maternal infections.

Independent participant data analysis would be useful to assess this more comprehensively.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Timing of birth</HEADING>
<P>The timing of intervention for early birth differed between the studies. The mean latency from PROM to birth in four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Cox-1995" TYPE="STUDY">Cox 1995</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mercer-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Mercer 1993</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998;</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Spinnato-1987" TYPE="STUDY">Spinnato 1987</LINK>) indicated that early birth was planned for less than 24 hours, even though this was not explicitly stated. One study (<LINK REF="STD-Eroiz_x002d_Hernandez-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Eroiz-Hernandez 1997</LINK>) did not indicate when birth was intended but results indicated a median latency of three days. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Garite-1981" TYPE="STUDY">Garite 1981</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Iams-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Iams 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Nelson-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Nelson 1985</LINK>) planned for women in the early birth arm to give birth more than 24 hours after randomisation. Three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012a" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012a</LINK> <LINK REF="STD-Van-der-Ham-2012b" TYPE="STUDY">Van der Ham 2012b</LINK>) intended for women randomised to early birth to have labour initiated within 24 hours. However, the mean latency from randomisation to birth in these trials ranged from 33.9 to 39 hours. <LINK REF="STD-Koroveshi-2013" TYPE="STUDY">Koroveshi 2013</LINK> did not indicate or provide data to support timing of early birth. Because of the lack of information related to 'intention' of timing of delivery in four of the trials, we based subgroup analysis on mean latency results rather than intended timing of early birth.</P>
<P>Subgroup analysis by timing of birth showed the tests for subgroup differences were not significant for neonatal sepsis (<LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>), neonatal infection confirmed with positive blood culture (<LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>), RDS (<LINK REF="CMP-005.03" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.3</LINK>), caesarean section (<LINK REF="CMP-005.04" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.4</LINK>), and endometritis (<LINK REF="CMP-005.06" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.6)</LINK> between trials where early birth occurred less than 24 hours after randomisation as compared to trials where early birth occurred more than 24 hours after randomisation. However, chorioamnionitis was reduced in women randomised to early birth when planned birth occurred within 24 hours (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, three trials, 342 women) as compared to when planned birth occurred more than 24 hours from randomisation (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.42, five trials, 1016 women).

<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2017-02-15 06:38:08 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The existing evidence arose from clinical trials in which the protocols differed in their management of women with preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM), particularly the use of prophylactic antibiotics, use of corticosteroids, timing of early birth and gestational age at trial entry. However, subgroup analyses of these four factors did not alter the result of the primary outcome of sepsis, which indicated that there was no difference in the incidence of neonatal sepsis between women who gave birth immediately or were managed expectantly in PPROM prior to 37 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Planned early birth was associated with an increase in the incidence of neonatal RDS, neonatal mortality and the likelihood of birth by caesarean section. Babies in the early birth arm were more likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit, and receive ventilatory support. </P>
<P>Maternal outcomes indicated early birth was associated with an increased likelihood of induction of labour and endometritis, which was reduced with the use of antenatal antibiotics, and a decreased incidence of chorioamnionitis. The clinical significance of the decreased likelihood of chorioamnionitis following early planned birth but an increased risk of endometritis is difficult to interpret. Chorioamnionitis was defined clinically and by those not blinded to treatment allocation so there is a possibility of bias in reporting this outcome. Long term follow-up studies are necessary to ascertain whether there are any sequelae beyond the neonatal period that may result from these exposures. Chorioamnionitis was decreased when randomisation occurred greater than 34 weeks of gestation and if birth occurred within 24 hours of randomisation. However, not all trials assessed this outcome on women randomised to early birth as the presence of chorioamnionitis was an exclusion criteria. The length of time between randomisation and birth as well as overall length of maternal hospitalisation was longer in women randomised to expectant management. The three trials which reported on suspected neonatal infection showed an increase in babies who were managed expectantly, however the numbers were too small to be interpreted with confidence.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2016-12-23 16:39:04 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The applicability of findings from the meta-analysis to other populations and settings is limited by several factors. Firstly, the gestational age for inclusion into the studies was often wide. As the perinatal complications associated with PPROM change with gestational age, the management of women with a pregnancy complicated by PPROM requires a stratified approach based largely on gestational age. However, the addition of four trials with inclusion criteria between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation provided some meaningful gestational age-based management for women at 34 or more weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Secondly, a number of trials included co-interventions in addition to the timing of birth such as corticosteroids, tocolysis and antibiotics which may also limit the applicability of these findings. Since the publication of these earlier trials it has been clearly demonstrated that a number of these co-interventions are of benefit for the mother and baby in the setting of PPROM. There is a beneficial effect for both the mother and the baby in the use of prophylactic erythromycin in the setting of PPROM (<LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Kenyon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kenyon 2003</LINK>) similar to the demonstrated beneficial effects of antenatal corticosteroids for women with PPROM, particularly for the neonate at gestations less than 34 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Harding-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harding 2001</LINK>). Only one of these trials (<LINK REF="STD-Naef-1998" TYPE="STUDY">Naef 1998</LINK>) used prophylactic antibiotics for all women. However, <LINK REF="STD-Morris-2016" TYPE="STUDY">Morris 2016</LINK> provided data for those women who did receive prophylactic antibiotics that contributed a substantial number towards the analysis. None of the trials used corticosteroids for both the early birth and expectant management groups. Using corticosteroids for both the early birth and expectant management groups in women at gestations less than 34 weeks would have provided clinically meaningful information and would have removed the confounder of steroids in assessing the effect of early birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2016-12-23 10:29:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Overall, all 12 studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Some of the studies lacked an adequate description of methods and the risk of bias could only be assessed as unclear. In five of the studies there were one or two domains where the we judged the risk of bias as high. However, this was unlikely to change the magnitude of effect. We used GRADE profiling to assess neonatal outcomes of infection/sepsis, RDS, need for ventilation, and admission to NICU: and maternal outcomes of caesarean section, chorioamnionitis, and length of hospital stay. The results show the quality of evidence across all critical outcomes to be moderate to high. Downgrading was mainly due to imprecision where few events resulted in wide confidence intervals, and inconsistency as evidenced by heterogeneity.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2017-02-13 14:08:17 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The inclusion criteria for this review were intentionally broad, with the aim of being able to better examine all of the possible evidence available. These trials differed with respect to inclusion criteria, co-interventions and the timing of the early birth intervention. The results provided by the subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the large differences in numbers of women between the subgroups.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that there was the potential for bias at all stages in the reviewing process. We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways; for example, two review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. David P van der Ham was Chief Investigator and first author of the PPROMEXIL trials and so JM and DB were responsible for data extraction and assessment of all trial reports relating to this study. Jonathan Morris was the Chief Investigator and first author for the NHMRC- (National Health and Medical Research Council) funded PPROMT trial and so data was assessed and extracted independently by PM. However, we acknowledge that such assessments involve subjective judgments, and another review team may not have agreed with all of our decisions.</P>

<P>Current evidence does not demonstrate a difference in neonatal sepsis between women who give birth immediately or are managed expectantly in preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Early planned birth is associated with an increase in the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal mortality, endometritis, induction of labour, and the likelihood of birth by caesarean section, and a decreased incidence of chorioamnionitis. In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes a policy of expectant management with careful observation is associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2016-12-22 17:00:30 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Future randomised trials should be adequately powered to evaluate the effect of the different management strategies on long-term childhood health, behaviour and cognitive outcomes. Also, future research should be aimed at identifying women with PPROM who would not benefit from expectant management by comparing gestational age at presentation, corticosteroid use and abnormal vaginal microbiological colonisation in both groups. An independent participant data analysis could be considered to address these differences.</P>

<P>The methods section has been updated.</P>
<P>We removed the following specifier from our inclusion criteria: studies that planned early birth should be within 24 hours of randomisation. We left the definition of planned early birth to be specified by the authors of the included trials. We did, however, perform a subgroup analysis of those trials in which early birth was specified to be less than 24 hours from randomisation versus those trials in which this was not specified. This analysis was important as the trials were very heterogeneous with respect to the time at which birth was planned. By increasing the duration of time from randomisation to planned birth, the anticipated observed differences in outcomes between the early birth and the expectant management group would be less apparent.</P>
<P>It was not possible to extract data on early onset neonatal sepsis as initially specified in the protocol. Therefore, we further categorised neonatal sepsis into subgroups of: neonatal sepsis proven with positive blood culture (and included those trials that specified their sepsis outcome was defined by a positive culture); presumed sepsis; and neonatal treatment with antibiotics.</P>
<P>We included a new subgroup analysis for timing of intervention of early birth with a cutoff of 24 hours.</P>
<P>The protocol specified that there would be a subgroup analysis by gestational age at randomisation with three groups:</P>
<UL>
<LI>less than 30 weeks' gestation;</LI>
<LI>30 to 33 weeks' plus six days' gestation;</LI>
<LI>34 to 37 weeks' gestation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, seven of the trials included women that were able to be included in more than one gestational age group. As individual participant data were not available for assessment, we performed subgroup analysis to assess gestational age in five trials that randomised women greater than 34 weeks' gestation and in five trials that randomised women less than 34 weeks' gestation.</P>
<P>Vaginal birth was removed from the list of maternal outcomes in the subgroup analysis as this was just mirrored data in relation to caesarean section.</P>
<P>For subgroup analyses of antibiotic and corticosteroid usage, an additional subgroup was added to each category to include those trials where only some women received the intervention.</P>
<P>In this update, 2016, we used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence and produced a 'Summary of findings' table.</P>
