I have accepted the changes and addressed the remaining responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28/01/2013 CJC amended abstract, PLS and SoF to reflect uncertainty from the Odds ratio applied to the risk in ICS alone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16/01/13 CJC added new Risk of Bias domain in relation to detection bias for asthma-related events and clarified sequence generation and allocation concealment in Figure 1 in the text. All Emma's edits accepted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Notes 15/01/2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks great - two comment on risk of bias&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;allocation (selection bias). I agree with your judgement in the text, however, it conflicts with the unclear judgement across all but one of the trials made in the ROB table. it's semantic, I think it is it worth qualifying this in the text.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blinding. I accept your point about the difference in bias in the all cause and asthma related AEs, however, ideally this would be reflected in separate rows in the ROB table. Could you do this relatively easily?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC amended figures and date of Roman's conflicts. Emma J will amend affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC all changes accepted and ready to send to co-authors. 06 December 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 18/9/2012 Reddel excluded as designed to have differenct ICS level in each arm whilst down titrating. Data entered for Bailey 2008). Data added to Table one, What's new and outcomes. Table 1 now updated for all studies and mean duration and totals amended in the text. Renzi paper seems to have an error so email sent to Kclark (corresponding author). Updated as far as results so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoF tables updated and Figures pruned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC 2 may 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new trials in children added to the Forest plots. Characteristics and RoB now done in conjunction with Marta and results will need updating in the results section, when further data for adults has been added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC Revision May 6th 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have added an All-cause SAE outcome at the suggestion of peer reviewer and included this as a sensitivity analysis. This is in line with the previous salmeterol review. I have not combined the results of this review with those of the previous salmeterol review as the other authors did not feel that this was sensible. The overall result would be dominated by the SMART study. The results of the two reviews are compared in the first paragraph of the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could this go to John White to sign off for publication please?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer review comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I have some difficulty with the outcome used in this review: all cause non-fatal serious adverse events. By definition, SAEs are those that result in death, hospitalization etc. The analysis should look firstly at &lt;u&gt;all &lt;/u&gt;SAEs (which captures fatal events). Following that, if there is sufficient information to determine which SAEs were fatal ones, then it should be possible to do a separate analysis on SAEs that did not result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. If these studies were pooled with the previous review of SAL vs. placebo to make a combined analysis (SAL vs Placebo, SAL/ICS vs ICS), would that change the findings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 14th Revisions suggested by Roman have been incorporated, so this is now ready for Peer Review. There is a validation error in relation to the size of Figures 11 and 12 and I have resized these to less than 800 pixels wide so the validation warning has gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have checked and revised the text of the review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 20th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoF added and I have also added as Figures 11 and 12 the Forest plots from the FDA submission by GSK. If you are happy with this can we send it on to Roman to look at. I am not sure he can download yet so can you check how he would like to receive the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 13th. Abstract and PLS added, also Discussion. Mistake in one trial data entry spotted when reporting totals on Figure 4. Can we say GSK have confirmed SAE entry. How far can we go in warning re ICS compliance? Is the GSK data overplayed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 3rd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to strip out the GSK included studies before this gets published...... Discussion next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 24th Figures added with GSK database information in relation to background versus randomised ICS use. This can be interpreted in different ways. GSK say .....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;salmeterol used with ICS was not associated with increase risk of asthma-related hospitalisation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 16th FDA 2008 submission checked and no missed trials found. We also have Koenig 2008! Cates 2009 needs reference details adding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 22nd. Results now all written up, but may need to be amended following feedback from Roman. Watch this space! Conclusions left for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 28th DATA checked against Roman and entered in the text for deaths. Discrepancy log for Roman@&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&amp;#160;Log of discrepancies Salmeterol randomised with ICS&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Aubier had one death in the Salmeterol arm (see note from Roman, patient had discontinued Rx to have elective surgery, but was still in the study). Also I have 10 v 5 from safety report on web and Roman has 12 v 6. Why the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Non Fatal SAE patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; GOAL is discrepant. I have assumed pts with SAE includes deaths so have subtracted for each giving 67-3=64 for salmeterol and 53-2=51 for fluticasone. Roman has 71 v 55. Does this include open phase data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Ind treatment total for Salmeterol is 171(this is ITT population) not 173 on web report?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Koopmans: Roman has 0/27 for FP arm and web report is 1/27?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Van Noord: Roman has 9 and 4 patients, I have 8 and 2. The extra one on could be the fatality in the salmeterol group but I do not understand the discrepancy for FP arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; SAS 40068: Roman has 3 v 3, I have 4 v 2? Again the mortality may explain one more in the FP arm but why one less on S?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Additionally I have Koenig 2008, SAM 30007, 40004,40008,40031 and 40065. Also SAS 30022, 40036, and 40037. None of these seem to be in Roman forest plot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Asthma related SAE patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; GOAL: Paper and web report say 8 v 12 Roman has 8 v 13. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; IND: I have 1 v 3 and Roman has 2 v 2. Why~?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; NELSON 2003: One exacerbation on FPS in web report. Roman has 0 v 0?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; SFCF4026 does not have any asthma SAE on web report, but Roman has one on salmeterol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Van Noord: Roman has 3 v 2 and I have 2 v 1. Could Roman have all cause SAE here by mistake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendices and references have been added to this review. Results need to be checked against Roman's data before doing sensitivity and subgroup work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nov 24th&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included studies checked from Endnote and Excluded studies also entered. Reference to Sweeting added to additional references in relation to continuity corrections. SHOULD Susan be an author on these two reviews? Should we proceed with any further subgroups (eg leave out lower dose of Salmeterol, dose of ICS?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 11th SFA103153 added with reference and asthma SAE data. (2-2 but some borderline issues). Data entered for a dozen studies today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 31st Goal characteristics added and Koenig data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 18th first 8 studies added!!! Next 6 on July 21st. SAS30022 Why not in the Bateman review? GOAL imported but will need a tidy up and asthma hospitalisations with pneumonia may need discussion?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and TL signed off. Ready for MJC&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Nov 9&lt;br&gt;Amendments in red following discussion with TL, in relation to the control arms for this review. I will send to MJC prior to publication. Toby can you check for mistakes etc in the red sections?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Nov 5&lt;br&gt;1. References imported and moved to additional references&lt;br&gt;2. Text imported and links activated&lt;br&gt;3. Background and objectives altered to include ICS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;br&gt;I have modified the first protocol so that this one includes ICS. Could you check it. When you are happy with this it can be published. I have added you as final author.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;" NOTES_MODIFIED="2013-02-12 17:05:31 +0000" NOTES_MODIFIED_BY="Emma Welsh" REVIEW_NO="LAB3-AST" REVMAN_SUB_VERSION="5.2.3 " REVMAN_VERSION="5" SPLIT_FROM="" STAGE="R" STATUS="A" TYPE="INTERVENTION" VERSION_NO="4.0">

<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-12 10:39:01 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>There has been some concern raised at the possibility of increased serious adverse events following administration of salmeterol, a long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist, to people with asthma. We analysed data from 35 studies in adults and 5 in children that compared regular salmeterol in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, against the same dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Too few deaths occurred in the trials to gain any conclusive reassurance that regular salmeterol taken with inhaled corticosteroids either reduces the risk of mortality, or in fact does not increase it. The frequency of deaths in the studies was equivalent to around 10 per 10,000 adults or adolescents treated with inhaled corticosteroids and between 3 and 26 per 10,000 when treated with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids. No deaths occurred in the studies conducted in children. Serious adverse events were not significantly increased in adults or children when regular salmeterol was added to inhaled corticosteroids as randomised treatment, but the results are too imprecise to conclude that there is no increased risk. The frequency of serious adverse events was 21 per 1000 in the adults treated with inhaled corticosteroids and 24 per 1000 in those treated with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids. There were fewer serious adverse events in children, 5 per thousand on inhaled corticosteroids and 6 per 1000 on salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids. Large surveillance studies are currently ongoing.</P>

<ABS_BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-01-28 09:32:12 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and increased asthma mortality. There has been much debate about possible causal links for this association, and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are safe. This is an updated systematic review.</P>
</ABS_BACKGROUND>
<ABS_OBJECTIVES MODIFIED="2013-01-28 09:32:14 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>To assess the risk of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials which randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids in comparison to the same dose of inhaled corticosteroids.</P>
</ABS_OBJECTIVES>
<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY MODIFIED="2013-02-12 10:38:36 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We identified randomised trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. We checked websites of clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search is August 2012.</P>
</ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY>
<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA MODIFIED="2012-12-19 11:05:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We included parallel design controlled clinical trials on patients of any age and severity of asthma if they randomised patients to treatment with regular salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroids (in separate or combined inhalers), and were of at least 12 weeks duration.</P>
</ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA>
<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION MODIFIED="2013-01-28 09:32:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We conducted the review according to standard procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We obtained unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events from the sponsors, and from FDA submissions. We assessed the quality of evidence according to GRADE recommendations.</P>
</ABS_DATA_COLLECTION>
<ABS_RESULTS MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:49:56 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We have included 35 studies (13,447 participants) in adults and adolescents, and 5 studies (1862 participants) in children in this review. We judged that the overall risk of bias was low, and we obtained data on serious adverse events from all studies. All except 542 adults (and none of the children) who were randomised to salmeterol were given fluticasone in the same (combination) inhaler.</P>
<P>Seven deaths occurred in 6986 adults on regular salmeterol with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and seven deaths in 6461 adults on regular inhaled corticosteroids at the same dose. The difference was not statistically significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.60, moderate quality evidence). The risk of dying from any cause in adults on ICS was 10 per 10,000, and on salmeterol and ICS we would expect between 3 and 26 deaths per 10,000. No deaths were reported in 1862 children, and no deaths were reported to be asthma-related in adults or children.</P>
<P>Non-fatal serious adverse events of any cause were reported in 167 adults on regular salmeterol with ICS, compared to 135 adults on regular ICS; again this was not a statistically significant increase (Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44, moderate quality evidence). The frequency of serious adverse events was 21 per 1000 in the adults treated with ICS and 24 per 1000 in those treated with salmeterol and ICS. The absolute difference in the risk of non-fatal serious adverse events was an increase of 3 per 1000, that was not statistically significant (risk difference (RD) 0.003; 95% CI -0.002 to 0.008).</P>
<P>There were 6 of 930 children with serious adverse events on regular salmeterol with ICS, compared to 5 out of 932 on regular ICS: there was no significant difference between treatments (Peto OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.37 to 3.91, moderate quality evidence).</P>
<P>Asthma-related serious adverse events were reported in 29 and 23 adults in each group respectively, a non-significant difference (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.94, moderate quality evidence), and only 1 asthma-related event was reported in children in each treatment group.</P>

<P>We found no statistically significant differences in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events in trials in which regular salmeterol was randomly allocated with ICS, in comparison to ICS alone at the same dose. Although 13,447 adults and 1862 children have now been included in trials, the frequency of adverse events is too low and the results are too imprecise to confidently rule out a relative increase in all cause mortality or non-fatal adverse events with salmeterol used in conjunction with ICS. However, the absolute difference between groups in the risk of serious adverse events was very small. We could not determine whether the increase in all cause non-fatal serious adverse events reported in the previous meta-analysis on regular salmeterol alone is abolished by the additional use of regular ICS. We await the results of large ongoing surveillance studies mandated by the FDA to provide more information. There were no asthma-related deaths and few asthma-related serious adverse events. Clinical decisions and information for patients regarding regular use of salmeterol have to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of salmeterol and the degree of uncertainty and concern associated with its potential harmful effects.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:50:06 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>For patients whose asthma is not controlled by low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone, many asthma guidelines recommend additional long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Several Cochrane reviews have addressed the efficacy of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in addition to ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Ni-Chroinin-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ni Chroinin 2005</LINK>), in comparison with placebo (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2007</LINK>), short-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists (<LINK REF="REF-Walters-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Walters 2002</LINK>), leukotriene-receptor antagonists (<LINK REF="REF-Ducharme-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ducharme 2006</LINK>), and increased doses of ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Greenstone-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Greenstone 2005</LINK>). The beneficial effects of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists on lung function, symptoms, quality of life and exacerbations requiring oral steroids have been demonstrated.</P>
<P>However, there is also longstanding controversy over the regular use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists for people with asthma. <LINK REF="REF-Sears-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1986</LINK> suggested that excessive use of short acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists might have contributed directly or indirectly to increases in asthma deaths in New Zealand between 1960 and 1980. The authors comment that "most deaths were associated with poor assessment, underestimation of severity and inappropriate treatment (over-reliance on bronchodilators and under use of systemic corticosteroids), and delays in obtaining help."</P>
<P>Concern remains that the symptomatic benefit from treatment with long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists might lead to underestimation of attack severity in acute asthma, and could lead to an increase in asthma-related deaths. Furthermore, regular treatment with beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists can lead to tolerance to their bronchodilator effects and this phenomenon may be more marked with longer acting, as opposed to shorter acting, compounds (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>). A number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain the possible detrimental effect of long-term beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use in asthma, including receptor down regulation and desensitisation (<LINK REF="REF-Giembycz-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Giembycz 2006</LINK>).</P>
<P>A meta-analysis of the effect of long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists on severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths (<LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK>) concluded that "long-acting beta-agonists have been shown to increase severe and life-threatening asthma exacerbations, as well as asthma-related deaths". However, <LINK REF="REF-Salpeter-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Salpeter 2006</LINK> only considered trials that compared long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with placebo, and 28 of the included trials on 6000 patients did not report asthma-related deaths, reducing certainty in the strength of the conclusion.</P>
<P>Currently there are two long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists available, salmeterol and formoterol (also known as eformoterol). These two drugs are known to have differences in receptor activity, and are used in different ways (for example salmeterol has a slower onset of action than salbutamol, and is therefore unsuitable for use as a reliever (<LINK REF="REF-Beach-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Beach 1992</LINK>)). 'The Fenoterol Story' is a reminder that all beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may not carry the same risks (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>), so in view of the potential difference in adverse effects between salmeterol and formoterol, we revised our original protocol to consider the two drugs separately.</P>
<P>There has been much debate about the interaction between ICS and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, in relation to serious adverse events, since the publication of <LINK REF="REF-SMART-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMART 2006</LINK>. This study did not randomise patients to ICS, but nevertheless conducted a subgroup analysis of the results on the basis of inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline. It is tempting to be reassured by the fact that there was not a statistically significant increase in asthma-related mortality in the subgroup using ICS, but this is not the correct way to test for interaction (<LINK REF="REF-Altman-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Altman 2003</LINK>), and no assessment was carried out during the trial in relation to the actual use of ICS during the course of the study. There is a need to systematically review all the available data from controlled trials that randomised patients to regular salmeterol in combination with ICS, and to consider all serious adverse events (fatal and non-fatal), whether or not these are deemed by the investigators to be related to trial medication.</P>
<P>The focus of this review is therefore on regular salmeterol which has been randomised in combination with ICS, (in a single inhaler or separate inhalers). Due to the difficulty in deciding whether adverse events are asthma-related (particularly in the many studies that do not have independent outcome assessment of adverse events), this review is concerned with studies that capture mortality and serious adverse events, and records both all cause outcomes, and those considered by the trial investigators to be asthma-related events. This approach differs from that of <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK> in which the authors restricted the outcomes to asthma-related events.<BR/>
<BR/>Regular salmeterol alone is the subject of a previous review (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>), as is regular formoterol alone (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2012b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2012b</LINK>). In both of these reviews, an increase in serious adverse events was demonstrated with regular long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists. Formoterol with ICS has been considered in a further review (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2009a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2009a</LINK>). An overview of the safety of combination therapy in children has also been completed (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2012a</LINK>).</P>

<P>Data were extracted using a prepared checklist before being entered into RevMan 5.2 by one review author (CJC) with assistance from Susan Hansen, and another author (TL, MF or SS) checked data on trial characteristics. Outcome data were independently extracted by a third author (RJ, MF or SS) and discrepancies resolved by discussion and correspondence with the sponsors. Data included characteristics of included studies (methods, participants, interventions, outcomes) and results of the included studies. We contacted authors and sponsors of included studies for unpublished adverse event data, and searched manufacturers' websites for further details of adverse events. We also searched FDA submissions. We collected all cause serious adverse events (fatal and non-fatal), and in view of the difficulty in deciding whether events are asthma-related, noted details of the cause of death and serious adverse events where they were available. We also recorded the definition of serious adverse events, and sought further information if this was not clear (particularly in relation to hospital admissions and serious adverse events).</P>

This property was more important than potential problems with unbalanced treatment arms and large effect sizes (in view of the high proportion of zero cells), but the Mantel-Haenszel method was also used for sensitivity analysis. ORs do not include the large body of evidence coming from the trials with no event in either arm, but such data is included in the analysis of absolute rates using RD.

<P>In the adult and adolescent studies there were 7 deaths (out of 6986 participants) on salmeterol with ICS and 7 deaths (out of 6461 participants) on ICS alone. The pooled odds ratio (OR) in adults and adolescents was not statistically significant and I<SUP>2 </SUP>was zero, (Peto OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.60), but the confidence interval is wide due to the small number of deaths, and still includes the possibility of a nearly three-fold increase in mortality, as well as a three-fold reduction (<LINK REF="FIG-02" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 2</LINK>). The pooled risk difference (RD) from these studies is very small (RD 0.0001; 95% CI -0.0021 to 0.0019, expressed as fractions not percentages throughout). In other words, for every 1000 adults or adolescents treated with salmeterol and ICS for 34 weeks, the results are compatible with both a possible increase or decrease of up to 2 deaths (in comparison with regular fluticasone).

<P>In the trials in children there were 6 out of 930 (0.6%) participants with serious adverse events on regular salmeterol with ICS and 5 out of 932 (0.5%) on ICS alone. The Peto OR was 1.20 (95% CI 0.37 to 3.91) and I<SUP>2 </SUP>was 0%, and the pooled RD for children was 0.0011 (95% CI -0.0065 to 0.0086).

<P>The number of patients experiencing one or more asthma-related non-fatal serious adverse events was similar when salmeterol was given with ICS in comparison to ICS alone. There were 29 out of 6986 (0.4%) participants on regular salmeterol with ICS and 23 out of 6461 (0.4%) on ICS alone, with no significant difference in the OR (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.94, I<SUP>2 </SUP>= 5%) as shown in <LINK REF="FIG-04" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 4</LINK>. The pooled RD was 0.0005 (95% CI -0.0018 to 0.0027).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Children</HEADING>
<P>In the trials in patients who were less than 12 years of age, 1 of the children out of 930 (0.1%) had an asthma-related serious adverse event on regular salmeterol with ICS, and 1 out of 932 (0.1%) on ICS alone. The Peto OR showed no significant difference, with wide confidence intervals (Peto OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85). The pooled RD was -0.0005 (95% CI -0.0058 to 0.0048).</P>
<P>The difference between children and adults was again not statistically significant. We did not find data to assess the other proposed secondary outcomes (such as intensive care unit admission and intubation).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Sensitivity analyses</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Risk of bias</HEADING>
<P>We identified no unblinded studies. Removal of the four studies thought to be at high risk of attrition bias (see <LINK REF="FIG-01" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 1</LINK>) made little difference to the OR of non-fatal serious adverse events in adults (Peto OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.39). A funnel plot of non-fatal serious adverse events did not suggest obvious publication bias (<LINK REF="FIG-05" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 5</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Methods of analysis</HEADING>
<P>The primary outcomes were also analysed using Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect and random-effects models. The result of the fixed-effect model for mortality in adults was OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.36 to 2.08) and for random effects OR 0.90 (95% CI 0.35 to 2.31); both were very similar to the Peto OR result. This method uses a correction for zero cells which is not required for the Peto OR. With this method the addition of 0.5 to all cells when the arms have similar numbers randomised will generate an OR of 3 when there is only one event in the treatment group and none in the control group. When there are very sparse outcomes (such as for mortality), the calculated OR is entirely dependent on the size of the zero cell adjustment, and whether the treatment arms are balanced.</P>
<P>For non-fatal serious adverse events in adults the Peto method (Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44) gave almost identical results to Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model (OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44) or Mantel-Haenszel random-effects (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.42).</P>
<P>When fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events were combined the results for adults were almost identical to the pooled result for the non-fatal events in adults (Peto OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42), and were unchanged in children as there were no deaths in children.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Dose of salmeterol</HEADING>
<P>The dose of salmeterol used in three studies was less than the usual daily dose of 50 mcg twice daily, so we carried out sensitivity analysis out on the primary outcomes excluding these studies (<LINK REF="STD-SAS30021" TYPE="STUDY">SAS30021</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAS30022" TYPE="STUDY">SAS30022</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SAS30023" TYPE="STUDY">SAS30023</LINK>). There were no deaths in these studies so mortality results were unaffected. The results for a serious adverse event of any cause without these studies in adults (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.42) are very similar to the full data set, but in children (Peto OR 2.36; 95% CI 0.53 to 10.41) the confidence interval widens when these studies are excluded.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Subgroup analyses</HEADING>
<P>Mortality data were too sparse to carry out any subgroup analysis. For non-fatal serious adverse events, tests for interaction between adults and children were all negative, but very few children have been studied, so this result should not be interpreted as excluding important possible differences between adults and children. As only four studies included patients on separate salmeterol and fluticasone inhalers (<LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999</LINK> [one of the three study arms]; <LINK REF="STD-Ind-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Ind 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-SLGF75" TYPE="STUDY">SLGF75</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wallin-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Wallin 2003</LINK>; see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>), we did not attempt to make a subgroup comparison between separate and combined inhalers.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">All cause mortality</HEADING>
<P>Seven deaths occurred in 6986 adults on regular salmeterol with ICS, and seven deaths in 6461 adults on regular ICS at the same dose. The difference was not statistically significant (Peto OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.60) and the absolute difference between groups in risk of death of any cause was -0.0001 (95% CI -0.0021 to 0.0019). No deaths were reported in 1862 children, and no deaths were reported to be asthma-related.</P>
<P>The confidence intervals for all cause mortality in adults and adolescents indicate that for every 1000 patients treated with regular salmeterol and ICS in comparison to the same dose of ICS, results are compatible with up to 2 additional deaths or 2 less deaths in adults over 34 weeks of treatment, and at most 5 additional deaths to 5 less deaths in children over 15 weeks of treatment (the average duration of treatment in the respective trials).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">All cause non-fatal serious adverse events</HEADING>
<P>Non-fatal serious adverse events of any cause were reported in 167 adults on regular salmeterol with ICS, compared to 135 adults on regular ICS; again this was not a significant increase (Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44). The absolute difference in the risk of non-fatal serious adverse events was 0.003 (95% CI -0.0021 to 0.0081).</P>
<P>There were 6 of 930 children with serious adverse events on regular salmeterol with ICS, compared to 5 out of 932 on regular ICS: there was no significant difference between treatments (Peto OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.37 to 3.91). The absolute difference in the risk of non-fatal serious adverse events in children was RD 0.0011 (95% CI -0.0065 to 0.0086).</P>
<P>For non-fatal serious adverse events, the limits of the pooled confidence interval are 8 more to 2 fewer adults, and adolescents and 9 more to 7 fewer children for every 1000 treated over the period of time represented in the trials.</P>
<P>Asthma-related serious adverse events were reported in 29 and 23 adults in each group respectively, a non-significant difference (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.94), and only 1 event was reported in children in each treatment group.</P>

</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:50:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Two large surveillance studies have been carried out on the use of regular salmeterol (<LINK REF="REF-SMART-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMART 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="REF-SNS-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">SNS 1993</LINK>) without randomised ICS. No similar size study has been performed to assess the safety of regular salmeterol randomised with ICS. The results of this review are therefore less precise than those of the previous review on the safety of regular salmeterol randomised without ICS (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>), and very little data are available from studies involving children.</P>
<P>There are now large surveillance studies ongoing in adults and children assessing the safety of regular salmeterol in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid (<LINK REF="STD-NCT01462344" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01462344</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-NCT01475721" TYPE="STUDY">NCT01475721</LINK>).</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-02-12 10:44:49 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Risk of bias was assessed as low in the included studies, as the procedures for randomisation and blinding were appropriate, having been designed for regulatory purposes (thereby ensuring common definitions of serious adverse events and minimising the likelihood of selection bias, even though this was not well reported in published papers or trial registers). We assessed the quality of evidence from the studies as moderate due to statistical imprecision. This reflects the low rates of mortality and non-fatal adverse events across the studies we included in the review (see <LINK REF="SOF-01" TYPE="SOF">Summary of findings table 1</LINK>).</P>
</QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE>
<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:50:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>The selection of the best method to combine studies with rare events is contentious when event rates are low, not least because of the corrections required to calculate ORs with zero events (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>). Since it became apparent in the course of carrying out our reviews that the pooled ORs were heavily dependent on the zero adjustment used in the Mantel-Haenszel and Inverse Variance methods, we used the Peto OR and RDs to report results of this review. The likely bias in using the Peto OR is small, as only three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bateman-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Bateman 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-Noord-2001" TYPE="STUDY">van Noord 2001</LINK>) had any imbalance in the number of patients in each arm (<LINK REF="REF-Sweeting-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sweeting 2004</LINK>). In these studies, twice the number patients were randomised to regular salmeterol with ICS in comparison to ICS alone.</P>
<P>Similarly, the included studies were influenced by the decision to restrict the review to trials that randomised participants to salmeterol and ICS, but this decision reduces the risk of bias arising from patients discontinuing their usual inhaled steroid medication if they feel better on the randomised treatment. This presupposes a similar risk of serious adverse events when salmeterol and fluticasone are delivered via one inhaler, and when salmeterol is added to inhaled corticosteroid therapy via a separate inhaler, when both are randomised treatments in a controlled trial.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:50:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>An overview of Cochrane reviews of the safety of regular salmeterol or formoterol in children (with and without combination ICS) in children has recently been completed (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2012a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2012a</LINK>). The overview did not find any significant differences between the safety of regular salmeterol and regular formoterol in children, but the number of children studied remains small (in comparison to adults). Moreover, no separate safety results are currently available for adolescents who were recruited in the adult and adolescent trials.</P>
<P>Two existing reviews of the use of salmeterol with ICS have shown similar results to the findings of this review. <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK> concentrated on asthma-related outcomes, whilst <LINK REF="REF-Jaeschke-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeschke 2008a</LINK> considered both salmeterol and formoterol in adults in comparison to the ICS at the same dose and higher doses. Neither of these reviews showed a significant increase in the risk of serious adverse events, but the results were not precise enough to rule out a clinically-important increase or decrease in serious adverse events with regular salmeterol.</P>
<P>It became apparent during the course of preparing this review that there are minor discrepancies between the results recorded in the serious adverse event reports on the GlaxoSmithKline website and the data used in <LINK REF="REF-Bateman-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bateman 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-Jaeschke-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jaeschke 2008a</LINK>. An example of this concerns the death in <LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999</LINK>, and is related to the question of whether the adverse event was classified as being "on-treatment" (see <LINK REF="STD-Aubier-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Aubier 1999</LINK>Notes in <LINK TAG="CHARACTERISTICS_OF_INCLUDED_STUDIES" TYPE="SECTION">Characteristics of included studies</LINK>). Overall the magnitude of these differences is small, and mostly relates to an external review of company data and inclusion of reviewed data in some of the analyses; this has not altered the conclusions of the review.</P>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Administration of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)</HEADING>
<P>There is no clear difference seen between the point estimate and confidence interval of the OR for non-fatal serious adverse events found in this review (Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.44), and those seen in the review comparing salmeterol to placebo (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28) (<LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>). However the average non-fatal serious adverse event rate in the control arms of the trials in this review that included randomised ICS was 2.1% over 34 weeks, in comparison to 3.6% over 28 weeks in <LINK REF="REF-SMART-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">SMART 2006</LINK> (which accounted for the majority of patients in <LINK REF="REF-Cates-2008a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cates 2008a</LINK>).</P>
<P>Combined data from the GlaxoSmithKline submission to the FDA (<LINK REF="REF-FDA-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">FDA 2008</LINK>) shows separate outcome data for GlaxoSmithKline trials that used ICS as background treatment, those which randomised patients to ICS in a separate inhaler and those which randomised patients to a combined salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. These results are not directly comparable to those included in this review (as higher doses of ICS may have been used in the control arms), but the breakdown by inhaled corticosteroid use is shown in <LINK REF="FIG-06" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 6</LINK> and <LINK REF="FIG-07" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 7</LINK>. These results demonstrate that there was a significantly higher risk of asthma-related hospitalisation in trials in which background ICS were used, but there was no significant difference in trials which randomised patients to ICS. Smaller numbers of events in the latter groups resulted in wide confidence intervals, however, so that an increase in adverse events could not be ruled out in trials that randomised patients to regular ICS with regular salmeterol.</P>
<P>It is of interest that the serious adverse event rates in the control arms of these studies are also consistently higher in trials using background ICS in comparison to those that randomised patients to ICS. This may reflect a greater asthma severity in those patients who had been started by their own physician on background ICS (as shown by <LINK REF="REF-Sears-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 2009</LINK> in the RELIEF study), but could also be compounded by the known poor adherence to treatment with ICS in routine practice. This raises uncertainty about the application of the results of patients in clinical trials, which usually include much more intensive monitoring of adherence to therapy. Since we cannot assume that adherence to treatment in trials will be matched in routine practice, care needs to be exercised in both the interpretation and application of the trial results (<LINK REF="REF-Weiss-2008" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weiss 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>We were not able to investigate possible differences in trial findings with combined and separate inhalers due to the paucity of patients on separate inhalers included in the trials in this review (less than 300 patients were randomised to separate fluticasone and salmeterol inhalers, see <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>).</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2013-02-12 11:50:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>We found no significant differences in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events in trials in which regular salmeterol was randomly allocated with ICS, in comparison to ICS at the same dose. The quality of the evidence was moderate. Although 13,447 adults and 1862 children were included in trials, the number of patients suffering adverse events is too small, and the results are too imprecise to confidently rule out a relative increase in all cause mortality or non-fatal adverse events. It is therefore not possible to determine whether the increase in all cause non-fatal serious adverse events reported in the previous meta-analysis of regular salmeterol alone is abolished by the additional use of ICS. The absolute difference between groups in the risk of serious adverse events was very small.There were no asthma-related deaths and few asthma-related serious adverse events. Clinical decisions and information for patients regarding regular use of salmeterol have to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of salmeterol and the degree of uncertainty and concern associated with its potential harmful effects.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2013-02-12 10:45:23 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Studies on children are currently lacking in this area. We await the results of large ongoing surveillance studies in adults, children and adolescents. Future research should specify clearly the number of patients with fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events by treatment group and cause, and outcomes should be verified by an independent outcome panel.</P>

Reference to Sweeting added to additional references in relation to continuity corrections. SHOULD Susan be an author on these two reviews? Should we proceed with any further subgroups (eg leave out lower dose of Salmeterol, dose of ICS?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 11th SFA103153 added with reference and asthma SAE data. (2-2 but some borderline issues). Data entered for a dozen studies today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 31st Goal characteristics added and Koenig data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 18th first 8 studies added!!! Next 6 on July 21st. SAS30022 Why not in the Bateman review? GOAL imported but will need a tidy up and asthma hospitalisations with pneumonia may need discussion?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJC and TL signed off. Ready for MJC&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Nov 9&lt;br&gt;Amendments in red following discussion with TL, in relation to the control arms for this review. I will send to MJC prior to publication. Toby can you check for mistakes etc in the red sections?&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;br&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br&gt;CJC Nov 5&lt;br&gt;1. References imported and moved to additional references&lt;br&gt;2. Text imported and links activated&lt;br&gt;3. Background and objectives altered to include ICS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Toby,&lt;br&gt;I have modified the first protocol so that this one includes ICS. Could you check it. When you are happy with this it can be published. I have added you as final author.&lt;br&gt;Chris&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;fixedtext&quot; readonly=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;f13300&quot;&gt;&lt;span coll_flag=&quot;f13300&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;collapse.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;fixedtext&quot;

<APPENDIX_BODY MODIFIED="2013-02-12 10:55:16 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Christopher J Cates">
<P>Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are thought to cause bronchodilation primarily through binding beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors on airways smooth muscle (ASM), with subsequent activation of both membrane-bound potassium channels and a signalling cascade involving enzyme activation and changes in intracellular calcium levels following a rise in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1993</LINK>). However, beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors are also expressed on a wide range of cell types where beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may have a clinically-significant effect including airway epithelium (<LINK REF="REF-Morrison-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Morrison 1993</LINK>), mast cells, post capillary venules, sensory and cholinergic nerves and dendritic cells (<LINK REF="REF-Anderson-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Anderson 2006</LINK>).Beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists will also cross-react to some extent with other beta-adrenoceptors including beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors on the heart.</P>
<P>The <I>in vivo </I>effect of any beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist will depend on a number of factors relating to both the drug and the patient.The degree to which a drug binds to one receptor over another is known as <I>selectivity, </I>which can be defined as absolute binding ratios to different receptors <I>in vitro</I>, whilst <I>functional selectivity</I> is measured from downstream effects of drugs in different tissue types <I>in vitro </I>or <I>in vivo. </I>All of the beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists described thus far are more beta<SUB>2</SUB> selective than their predecessor isoprenaline <I>in vitro</I>. However, because attempts to differentiate selectivity between the newer agents are confounded by so many factors, it is difficult to draw conclusions about <I>in vitro </I>selectivity studies and probably best to concentrate on specific adverse side-effects in human subjects at doses which cause the same degree of bronchodilatation.The <I>potency</I> of a drug refers to the concentration that achieves half the maximal receptor activation of which that drug is capable but it is not very important clinically as for each drug, manufacturers will alter the dose to try to achieve a therapeutic ratio of desired to undesired effects. In contrast <I>efficacy</I> refers to the ability of a drug to activate its receptor independent of drug concentration. Drugs that fully activate a receptor are known as full agonists and those that partially activate a receptor are known as partial agonists. Efficacy also is very much dependent on the system in which it is being tested and is affected by factors including the number of receptors available and the presence of other agonists and antagonists. Thus whilst salmeterol acts as a partial agonist <I>in vitro </I>it causes a similar degree of bronchodilation to the strong agonist formoterol in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-vanNoord-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">vanNoord 1996</LINK>), presumably because there are an abundance of well-coupled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors available with few downstream antagonising signals. In contrast, with repetitive dosing formoterol is significantly better than salmeterol at preventing methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). These differences have led to attempts to define the &#8220;intrinsic efficacy&#8221; of a drug independent of tissue conditions (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2002</LINK>), as shown in <LINK REF="TBL-01" TYPE="TABLE">Table 1</LINK>.The clinical significance of intrinsic efficacy remains unclear.</P>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Direct toxicity</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis states that direct adverse effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are responsible for an associated increase in mortality and most research in the area has concentrated on effects detrimental to the heart. Whilst it is often assumed that cardiac side-effects of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists are due to cross-reactivity with beta<SUB>1</SUB>-adrenoceptors (i.e. poor selectivity), it is worth noting that human myocardium also contains an abundance of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors capable of triggering positive chronotropic and inotropic responses (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1992</LINK>). Indeed, there is good evidence that cardiovascular side-effects of isoprenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Arnold-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Arnold 1985</LINK>) and other beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Hall-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hall 1989</LINK>) are mediated predominantly via cardiac beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors thus making the concept of <I>in vitro </I>selectivity less relevant. Generalised beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptor activation can also cause hypokalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Brown-1983" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brown 1983</LINK>) and it has been proposed that, through these and other actions beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists may predispose to life-threatening dysrhythmias or cause other adverse cardiac effects.</P>
<P>During the 1960s epidemic most deaths occurred in patients with severe asthma and it was originally assumed that asthma and its sequelae, including hypoxia, were the primary cause of death. However, mucus plugging and hypoxia does not preclude a cardiac event as the final cause of death, and one might expect those with severe asthma to take more doses of a prescribed inhaler. As noted by Speizer and Doll, most deaths in the 1960s were in the 10 to 19 age group and &#8220;at these ages children have begun to act independently and may be particularly prone to misuse a self-administered form of treatment&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Speizer-1968" TYPE="REFERENCE">Speizer 1968</LINK>). If toxicity were related to increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists one might expect most deaths to occur in hospital where high doses are typically used, and this was not the case. One possible explanation for this anomaly was provided by animal experiments in which large doses of isoprenaline caused little ill effect in anaesthetised dogs with normal arterial oxygenation, whereas much smaller doses caused fatal cardiac depression and asystole (although no obvious dysrhythmia) when hypoxic (<LINK REF="REF-Collins-1969" TYPE="REFERENCE">Collins 1969</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McDevitt-1974" TYPE="REFERENCE">McDevitt 1974</LINK>). It has been hypothesised, therefore, that such events would be less likely in hospital where supplemental oxygen is routinely given.The clinical relevance of these studies remains unclear although there is some evidence of a synergistic effect between hypoxia and salbutamol use in asthmatic patients in reducing total peripheral vascular resistance (<LINK REF="REF-Burggraaf-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burggraaf 2001</LINK>) &#8211; another beta<SUB>2-</SUB>mediated effect which could be detrimental to the heart during an acute asthma attack through a reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Other potential mechanisms of isoprenaline toxicity include a potential increase in mucus plugging and worsening of ventilation perfusion mismatch despite bronchodilation (<LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>).</P>
<P>Further concerns about a possible toxic effect of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists were raised during the New Zealand epidemic in the 1970s. In 1981 Wilson et al who first reported the epidemic reviewed 22 fatal cases of asthma and noted &#8220;In 16 patients death was seen to be sudden and unexpected. Although all were experiencing respiratory distress, most were not cyanosed and the precipitate nature of their death suggested a cardiac event, such as an arrest, inappropriate to the severity of their respiratory problem&#8221; (<LINK REF="REF-Wilson-1981" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wilson 1981</LINK>). In humans, fenoterol causes significantly greater chronotropic, inotropic and electrocardiographic side-effects than salbutamol in asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>). Interestingly, across the same parameters fenoterol also causes more side-effects than isoprenaline (<LINK REF="REF-Burgess-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Burgess 1991</LINK>).</P>
<P>In patients with mild asthma and without a bronchoconstrictor challenge, salmeterol and salbutamol cause a similar degree of near maximal bronchodilation at low doses (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>). However, whilst as a one off dose salbutamol is typically used at 2 to 4 times the concentration of salmeterol, the dose equivalences for salmeterol versus salbutamol in increasing heart rate and decreasing potassium concentration and diastolic blood pressure were 17.7, 7.8 and 7.6 respectively (i.e. salmeterol had a greater effect across all parameters). Given the lower intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol, these results highlight the importance of <I>in vivo </I>factors; one possible explanation for the difference is the increased lipophilicity of salmeterol compared to salbutamol contributing to higher systemic absorption (<LINK REF="REF-Bennett-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bennett 1994</LINK>). </P>
<P>When comparing increasing actuations of standard doses of formoterol and salmeterol inhalers in stable asthmatic patients, relatively similar cardiovascular effects are seen at lower doses (<LINK REF="REF-Guhan-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Guhan 2000</LINK>). However, at the highest doses (above those recommended by the manufacturers) there were trends towards an increase in systolic blood pressure with formoterol; in comparison there was a trend towards a decrease in diastolic blood pressure and an increase in QTc interval with salmeterol although no statistical analysis of the difference was performed. In contrast, in asthmatic patients with methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction there was no significant difference between salmeterol and formoterol in causing increased heart rate and QTc interval, although formoterol caused significantly greater bronchodilation and hypokalaemia (<LINK REF="REF-Palmqvist-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Palmqvist 1999</LINK>). Whilst there is good evidence of cardiovascular and metabolic side-effects with increasing doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, it is a little difficult to envisage serious adverse effects of this nature when using LABAs at manufacturer-recommended preventative doses. However, it is possible that some patients choose to use repeated doses of LABAs during exacerbations.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Tolerance</HEADING>
<P>In this setting, the term <I>tolerance </I>refers to an impaired response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in patients who have been using regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist treatment previously (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>).Tolerance is likely to result from a combination of reduced receptor numbers secondary to receptor internalisation and reduced production and also uncoupling of receptors to downstream signalling pathways following repeated activation (<LINK REF="REF-Barnes-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Barnes 1995</LINK>). This phenomenon is likely to explain the beneficial reduction in systemic side effects seen with regular use of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists including salbutamol after 1 to 2 weeks (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>).However, the same effect on beta<SUB>2</SUB>-adrenoceptors in the lung might be expected to produce a diminished response to the bronchodilating activity of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists following regular use.In patients with stable asthma, whilst there is some evidence of tolerance to both salbutamol (<LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1977" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1977</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Weber-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weber 1982</LINK>) other studies have been less conclusive (<LINK REF="REF-Harvey-1982" TYPE="REFERENCE">Harvey 1982</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, evidence of tolerance to short and long-acting beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in both protecting against and reducing bronchoconstriction is much stronger in the setting of an acute bronchoconstrictor challenge with chemical, allergen and 'natural' stimuli (<LINK REF="REF-Haney-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Haney 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>Studies comparing salmeterol and formoterol have shown that both cause tolerance compared to placebo, but there was no significant difference between the drugs (<LINK REF="REF-van-der-Woude-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">van der Woude 2001</LINK>). There also appears to be little difference in the tolerance induced by regular formoterol and regular salbutamol treatment (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>). To the authors' knowledge no studies have looked specifically at the degree of tolerance caused by isoprenaline and fenoterol in the setting of acute bronchoconstriction.Tolerance to bronchodilation has been shown to clearly occur with addition of inhaled corticosteroids to salmeterol and formoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Lee-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lee 2003</LINK>) and terbutaline (<LINK REF="REF-Yates-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Yates 1996</LINK>). There is conflicting evidence as to whether high dose steroids can reverse tolerance in the acute setting (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Jones-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Jones 2001</LINK>).</P>
<P>At first glance the toxicity and tolerance hypotheses might appear incompatible, as systemic and cardiovascular tolerance ought to protect against toxicity in the acute setting and there is good evidence that such tolerance occurs in stable asthmatic patients (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). However, whilst this study showed that changes in heart rate and potassium levels were blunted by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use, they were not abolished; furthermore, at the doses studied these side-effects appear to follow an exponential pattern (<LINK REF="REF-Lipworth-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Lipworth 1989</LINK>). In contrast, in the presence of bronchoconstrictor stimuli the bronchodilator response to beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists follows a flatter curve (<LINK REF="REF-Wong-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wong 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>) and as previously discussed this curve is shifted downwards by previous beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 1999</LINK>). Thus, it is theoretically possible that in the setting of an acute asthmatic attack and strong bronchoconstricting stimuli, bronchodilator tolerance could lead to repetitive beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist use and ultimately more systemic side-effects than would otherwise have occurred. Of course, other sequelae of inadequate bronchodilation including airway obstruction will be detrimental in this setting.</P>
<P>Whilst the tolerance hypothesis is often cited as contributing towards the asthma mortality epidemics, it is difficult to argue that reduced efficacy of a drug can cause increased mortality relative to a time when that drug was not used at all. However, tolerance to the bronchodilating effect of endogenous circulating adrenaline is theoretically possible, and there is also evidence of rebound bronchoconstriction when stopping fenoterol (<LINK REF="REF-Sears-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sears 1990</LINK>), which may be detrimental. Furthermore, it appears that regular salbutamol treatment can actually increase airway responsiveness to allergen (<LINK REF="REF-Cockcroft-1993" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cockcroft 1993</LINK>); a potentially important effect that could form a variant of the toxicity hypothesis. Differences between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists in this regard are unclear, but the combination of rebound hyperresponsiveness and tolerance of the bronchodilator effect with regular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist exposure has been recently advocated as a possible mechanism to explain the association between beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and asthma mortality (<LINK REF="REF-Hancox-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hancox 2006</LINK>).</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="4">Other explanations</HEADING>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Confounding by severity</HEADING>
<P>Historically, this hypothesis has been used extensively to try to explain the association between mortality and the use of fenoterol during the 1970s New Zealand epidemic (see <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 2007</LINK>) and is still quoted today. The hypothesis essentially relies on the supposition that patients with more severe asthma are more likely to take either higher doses of beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist (such as fenoterol) thereby explaining the association. This hypothesis was carefully ruled out in the three case-control studies by comparing the association between fenoterol and mortality in patients with varying severity of disease (<LINK REF="REF-Crane-1989" TYPE="REFERENCE">Crane 1989</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Pearce-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Pearce 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Grainger-1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Grainger 1991</LINK>). Furthermore, the hypothesis cannot explain the overall increase in mortality in the 1960s and 1970s, nor can it explain any significant increase in mortality (whether taking inhaled steroids or not) from randomised controlled trial data.</P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">The delay hypothesis</HEADING>
<P>This hypothesis accepts that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists or a particular beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonist cause an increased risk of mortality but indirectly by causing patients to delay before getting medical help and further treatments including high dose steroids and oxygen. There is evidence that both salmeterol and formoterol can reduce awareness of worsening underlying inflammation (<LINK REF="REF-Bijl_x002d_Hofland-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bijl-Hofland 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-McIvor-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">McIvor 1998</LINK>). It is difficult to rule out the delay hypothesis in either explaining or contributing towards both the asthma mortality epidemics and an association with regular use of LABAs. There is evidence that beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists with higher intrinsic efficacy are more effective at relieving bronchoconstriction in the acute setting (<LINK REF="REF-Hanania-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hanania 2007</LINK>) and could paradoxically cause patients to delay longer in seeking medical help.For the delay hypothesis to explain the increase in mortality during the 1960s and 1970s, one has to imply that hospital treatment of asthma when mortality rates were low during the earlier years of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century was effective. It is difficult to say exactly how effective such treatment is likely to have been. </P>
</SUBSECTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEADING LEVEL="5">Reduced corticosteroid treatment</HEADING>
<P>A slight but significant variation of the delay hypothesis suggests that patients who have separate beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists and corticosteroid inhalers may choose to take less corticosteroid because of better symptom control from the inhaled beta<SUB>2</SUB>-agonists, and it is reduced corticosteroid treatment that contributes to a rise in mortality. It is rather difficult to see how this hypothesis explains the epidemics of asthma deaths in the 1960s and 1970s relative to the 1920s and 1930s, given that corticosteroids were not used for the treatment of asthma in the earlier decades. If this hypothesis were to explain increased mortality from more recent randomised controlled trial data, one would not expect to see an increase in mortality in those taking LABAs alone.</P>
