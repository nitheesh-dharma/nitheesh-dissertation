<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2009-11-11 11:19:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>Hamstring (muscles situated at the back of the thigh) injuries are common in sports such as football and basketball. These injuries are often serious, causing pain, long rehabilitation times and a distinct proneness to re-injury. Various interventions targeting the prevention of such injuries are in common use. This review set out to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions in preventing hamstring injuries.</P>
<P>Seven randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1919 participants were included. All trials involved people, predominantly young adults, participating in regular sporting activities. Some trials were compromised by poor methodology, including lack of blinding and incomplete outcome data.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Four trials, including 287 participants, examined interventions directly targeted at preventing hamstring injuries. Three of these trials, which tested hamstring strengthening protocols, had contradictory findings and we could not conclude whether strengthening exercises of the hamstrings was beneficial or not. One small trial found that manual therapy (involving manipulation, massage and specific stretches to joints and muscles of the spine and leg) may prevent injuries of leg muscles, including the hamstrings.</P>
<P>Three inconclusive trials tested interventions for preventing all leg injuries for which data for hamstring injury were available. Two trials found no evidence for an effect for balance training on a wobble board (proprioceptive protocol). One trial found no evidence for a warm up/cool down and stretching protocol for distance runners.</P>
<P>Based on currently available research findings, no specific intervention can be recommended for decreasing the risk of incurring hamstring injuries.</P>

<BACKGROUND MODIFIED="2009-11-10 23:54:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<CONDITION MODIFIED="2009-11-10 23:54:02 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<P>Hamstrings are a group of muscles of the posterior thigh which cross both the hip and knee joints and are involved in thigh extension and knee flexion. The hamstring muscle group comprises three separate muscles: semitendinosus, semimembranosus and biceps femoris. Hamstring injury is defined by the anatomical site within the muscle that is affected, and injury must be present in one or more of the component muscles. Hamstring injuries are commonly classified as grades one, two and three, where severity increases with the grade of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Kellet-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kellet 1986</LINK>). Diagnosis is based on patient history, including the cause of injury and clinical findings of local pain and loss of function, demonstrated by palpation, range of motion and muscle testing (<LINK REF="REF-Kujala-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kujala 1997</LINK>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide further information on the extent of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Brandser-1995" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brandser 1995</LINK>). It is important to note that the frequency and severity of injury may differ in adolescents from that in skeletally mature people. Injuries occur in patterns unique to the skeletally immature adolescent, reflecting their developing bones and supporting ligamentous structures (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Musculotendinous injuries usually occur as a result of either direct or indirect trauma (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 1985</LINK>). Direct trauma such as from a blow results in muscle contusion (bruising). Indirect trauma can occur as a result of alteration in the intensity or synergy of contraction, resulting in a single powerful muscle contraction. Hamstrings are capable of producing large forces (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1984</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Noonan-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Noonan 1999</LINK>) that are most beneficial during periods of increased activity requiring bursts of speed or rapid acceleration and deceleration. Recent evidence has suggested that the hamstring muscles are most vulnerable to injury during the rapid change from eccentric to concentric function, such as where the leg decelerates to strike the ground during running (<LINK REF="REF-Verrall-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrall 2001</LINK>). (Concentric function is where a muscle actively shortens in order to produce movement. For example, concentric action of the quadriceps, the muscle at the front of the thigh, straightens the knee to produce a kicking action. Eccentric function is where a muscle generates active tension as it lengthens, braking a movement. For example, the hamstrings, situated at the back of the thigh, would function eccentrically to brake the kicking action.) Indirect trauma can also result from an overstretch of the musculotendinous unit leading to a strain, tear or avulsion (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 1985</LINK>). It is generally claimed that strain injuries most often occur near the musculotendinous junction (<LINK REF="REF-Garrett-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Garrett 1996</LINK>). <B>
<BR/>
</B>
<BR/>Hamstring injuries are commonplace in many mainstream sports and occupations involving physical activity (<LINK REF="REF-Kroll-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kroll 1997</LINK>). The initial Football Association Audit of Injuries study (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 2001</LINK>) found that 12% of all injuries reported over two seasons were hamstring strains. A hamstring injury is likely to cause a professional footballer to miss approximately three matches or weeks of play (<LINK REF="REF-Woods-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Woods 2004</LINK>). Hamstring injuries are often serious requiring rehabilitation and they tend to recur (<LINK REF="REF-Croisier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croisier 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002a" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002a</LINK>). For instance, <LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002b</LINK> reported a high rate of recurrence in 34% of primary cases over the course of a Australian football season.</P>
<P>The causes of hamstring injuries are complicated and multifactorial (<LINK REF="REF-Gleim-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Gleim 1997</LINK>). In general, a distinction in risk factors has been made between so-called intrinsic (person-related) and extrinsic (environment-related) risk factors (<LINK REF="REF-Inklar-1994" TYPE="REFERENCE">Inklar 1994</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Taimela-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Taimela 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Van-Mechelen-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Van Mechelen 1992</LINK>). Intrinsic factors include hamstring muscle weakness, strength imbalances, fatigue, inadequate flexibility, body mechanics and disturbed posture, poor running technique and psychosocial factors (<LINK REF="REF-Agre-1985" TYPE="REFERENCE">Agre 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Croisier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croisier 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Knapik-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Knapik 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Worrell-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Worrell 1992</LINK>). Extrinsic factors include unsatisfactory warm-up and training procedures, fatigue related to enforced excessive activity, poor playing surfaces and unsuitable training and sports specific activities (<LINK REF="REF-Hawkins-1999" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hawkins 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Safran-1988" TYPE="REFERENCE">Safran 1988</LINK>). <LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2001</LINK> suggested intrinsic factors are more predictive of muscle strain than extrinsic factors. However, a recent systematic review (<LINK REF="REF-Foreman-2006" TYPE="REFERENCE">Foreman 2006</LINK>) concluded that no single risk factor was found to have a significant association with hamstring injury (although the review was limited by the use of smaller cohort studies and the exclusion of non-English papers). Understanding the individual risk factors for injury is an important basis for developing preventive measures.</P>

<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2009-11-05 22:38:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>The prevention of hamstring injuries is an ongoing process where intervention is necessary for as long as participants engage in the physical activities that place them at risk. Many interventions are widely employed by participants, trainers, coaches and therapists specifically aiming to prevent such injuries. These include exercise therapy to strengthen and lengthen the hamstring muscles, such as stretching and strengthening exercises (<LINK REF="REF-Croisier-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croisier 2002</LINK>); neuromuscular injury prevention strategies including proprioceptive balance training (<LINK REF="REF-Emery-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Turl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turl 1998</LINK>); chiropractic, spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and correction of lumbar-pelvic biomechanics (<LINK REF="REF-Hoskins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskins 2005</LINK>); muscle activation work to improve hip extension motor patterns and running technique (<LINK REF="REF-Hoskins-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Hoskins 2005</LINK>); massage and mobilisation to increase flexibility and range of movement directed towards soft-tissues structures (<LINK REF="REF-Brosseau-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Brosseau 2002</LINK>), articular structures (<LINK REF="REF-Cibulka-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cibulka 1986</LINK>) and neural tissue (<LINK REF="REF-Turl-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Turl 1998</LINK>); education, including awareness of the risks for hamstring injury and importance of training (<LINK REF="STD-Arnason-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnason 2005</LINK>); and functional training and sport specific drills (<LINK REF="REF-Verrall-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Verrall 2005</LINK>).</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2009-10-16 13:03:07 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>The unit of randomisation in these trials may be groups of individuals, such as a football team, rather than individuals. For such trials, unit of analysis errors are likely to result from the presentation of the outcomes for individual participants. The risk of injury in individuals, for example of a football team, can not be considered independent of the cluster unit. Statistical methods which assume participants&#8217; chances are independent ignore any potential similarity between outcomes for participants within the same team. This may result in underestimated standard errors and give misleadingly narrow confidence intervals (<LINK REF="REF-Bland-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bland 1997</LINK>). Where cluster randomisation was used, we sought the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) and pooled data using the generic inverse variance. Exploratory analyses using assumed values for cluster-randomised studies which did not report the ICC were also included.</P>

<P>Participants were restricted to males in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>), whereas all participants were female in <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>. <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK> included similar numbers of males and females. <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK> included adolescents only (aged 12 to 18 years). The mean ages of trial participants in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>) ranged from 20 to 26 years old. It is likely that the adult civil servants in another trial (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) formed a slightly older population. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>) excluded people with any injury present at the time of recruitment, whereas another (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>) excluded any injury within six weeks that prevented full participation in basketball at the start of the season. More specifically two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>) excluded people with a history of chronic hamstring injuries; however, it was not clear if this included minor as well as major sprains.

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Interventions</HEADING>
<P>Four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>) tested interventions aimed directly at preventing hamstring injuries. In <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>, this applied to a subgroup of 37 participants who received only interventions targeting hamstring injury prevention. Data for this subgroup were obtained from the trial author. The remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) reported the outcomes of interventions aimed at preventing lower limb injuries; where available data for hamstring injury occurrence was extracted. There were four comparisons.</P>
<P>Three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>), involving 287 participants, compared the use of eccentric hamstring strength training. Two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>) evaluated the effect of eccentric strength training on the non-fatigued muscle, whereas the remaining study (<LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>) evaluated the effects after core training sessions.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>, participants decelerated a flywheel ergometer by eccentric hamstring action. The ergometer was set to &#8216;overload&#8217; the hamstrings (&#8216;eccentric overload training&#8217;): to produce a moving force greater than these muscles could concentrically generate or statically resist. The remaining two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>) employed standard eccentric strength training (without &#8216;overload&#8217;) using the Nordic hamstring exercise. This is an exercise in which the athlete kneels upright on a mat, ankles supported by an assistant, then gradually straightens their knees by tilting forwards and slowly lowering themselves to the floor. When the athlete is unable to control the lowering any further, they are able to relax, fall forward and stop their descent with their arms.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK> investigated the use of manual therapy techniques including high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) manipulation and mobilisation and/or supporting soft tissue therapies to prevent hamstring injuries in 59 participants.</P>

Both studies incorporated the use of a home balance-board training protocol, although in only <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK> did the difficulty of training increase, by progressing the exercises as well as adjusting the height of the balance board.</P>
<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>, which involved 421 participants, investigated a health education intervention aimed at injury awareness and with accompanying instructions for appropriate activities for warm-up before running, cool-down after running and regular stretching exercises, with control. The stretching exercises targeted the low back and the major lower limb muscle groups (hip/knee flexors and extensors, hip adductors and calf muscles).</P>
<P>The intensity of training schedules varied in the trials. The majority of trials did not disclose exact intensity times, but six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>) reported the number of training sessions implemented within the intervention period.

<HEADING LEVEL="5">Primary outcome: Incidence of hamstring injuries</HEADING>
<P>The methods for assessing injury diagnosis were stated in all trials. All reported the incidence of lower limb injuries by location and by type. The primary outcome was the occurrence of hamstring injury defined by clinical physical assessment.  Diagnosis was made by medical personnel (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>), physical therapists (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) and orthopaedic surgeons (<LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>). The definitions for injury were similar in five studies (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>). Injury was defined as that which occurred during scheduled football/basketball matches or practices and caused the player to, at least, miss the next game or practice session. <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK> defined injury by sudden onset posterior thigh pain, tenderness on palpation, with or without pain on stretch of the hamstring muscles; and with or without pain on contraction of the hamstring muscles. Lastly, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK> defined an injury as that causing the participant to stop running, being unable to run on the next occasion, being unable to work the next day, needing medical attention, or suffering from pain or stiffness during 10 subsequent days while running.<BR/>

Pooled results, done on an exploratory basis, for participants sustaining hamstring injuries showed substantial heterogeneity between the results of three trials (I² = 62%) and no statistically significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 2.65; random-effects; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>). Only a portion of study participants of <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> (33%) and <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK> (14%) had a past history of hamstring injury, thus predisposing them to high possibility of injury recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002b</LINK>). In contrast, all of the subgroup of participants from <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> were selected solely due to their high risk of hamstring injury, primarily due to past history.</P>
<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> reported data on the severity of hamstring injuries, based on duration of absence from practice or matches. Most of the injuries were minor in that they caused absence from test matches for under a week. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the number of participants with more serious injuries (2/15 versus 3/15, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.44; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).</P>
<P>Reported compliance with the intervention was poor in the two trials reporting this outcome (<LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>). In <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>, 30% of players who agreed to participate in the study failed to complete even one of the five prescribed sessions, and only 47% completed at least two sessions: the difference between two groups in the participants sustaining hamstring injury was not statistically significant (2/50 versus 7/53, RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.39; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-001.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.2</LINK>).

<P>Only <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> provided data on overall lower limb injuries.

Eccentric strength training (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>) reportedly resulted in delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Although this type of soreness is a response of the muscle to the damage induced by eccentric exercise, DOMS is believed to have a protective effect against further injury. However, in <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK> the DOMS experienced inhibited the players&#8217; ability to participate in subsequent club training sessions and, in addition, players believed that the soreness would increase their risk of hamstring injury which reduced compliance. In <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>, 11 players out of 15 had subjectively reported they had experienced muscle soreness of varying intensity 1 to 3 days after training, although this did not seem to affect their continued participation and attitudes towards the intervention.</P>

<P>
<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK> evaluated manual therapy for preventing hamstring injuries.

We considered that it was reasonable to use the same ICC to correct for clustering for <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>. However, both trials had problems with loss to follow-up, and moreover, <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK> reported number of injuries rather than participants incurring injuries. All the analyses presented here are exploratory.</P>
<P>Uncorrected data for hamstring injuries for the two trials are presented in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK>. As well as a large loss to follow-up in <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>, the results for 27 non-compliant intervention group participants were not available. The second analysis in <LINK REF="CMP-003.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.1</LINK> is an intention-to-treat analysis where the missing participants (these were just from the one dropped-out enrolled team in <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>) are assumed to have the same incidence of injury as the control rate. Neither analysis shows a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in hamstring injury for either trial. <LINK REF="CMP-003.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 3.2</LINK> presents the 'intention-to-treat' analysis corrected for clustering.

<P>One study (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) evaluated the effectiveness of stretching interventions alongside warm-up/cool down protocols on the prevention of injuries at the end of the 16-week treatment period. As well as a 23% loss to follow-up, location-specific injury data were only available for 44 out of 49 injuries. There were three hamstring injuries ("posterior side upper leg") in each group (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.13; see <LINK REF="CMP-004.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.1</LINK>). Of the 44 injuries, one located in the lower back was registered for the intervention group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the numbers of recorded lower limb injuries (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.11; <I>see</I> <LINK REF="CMP-004.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 4.2</LINK>). It is not known whether the trial participants sustained more than one injury.</P>
<P>In <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>, compliance was assessed by analysing participants&#8217; self-reported daily diaries to determine if performance of the exercises was in accordance with those prescribed.

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2009-11-11 00:53:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<P>Hamstring injuries are highly prevalent, and result in the need for medical care, missed competition, work, or habitual activities. Reductions in the incidence or severity of these events have the potential to reduce medical costs, lost time from work or leisure, and suffering. This review paper examines the evidence for interventions to prevent hamstring injuries from the clinical trials literature using a systematic approach. At present very little empirical evidence exists to support the efficacy of prevention regimens</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2009-11-09 15:28:15 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>Seven randomised controlled studies, involving a total of 1919 participants, were included. These evaluated four different interventions: hamstring muscle group strengthening; manual therapy; proprioceptive training and a warm-up/ cool down/ stretching protocol. The trials were heterogeneous but all involved active people, predominantly young adults, participating in regular sporting activities.</P>
<P>Where possible intention-to-treat analyses including all trial participants for participants sustaining at hamstring injuries were presented. All results had wide confidence intervals.</P>
<P>Pooled data from three heterogeneous trials testing strengthening protocols for hamstrings showed no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups in the incidence of participants sustaining a hamstring injury (random effects: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.65; I² = 62%). Although <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> found a significant benefit for strengthening (RR 0.30, 95% 0.10 to 0.88), the control rate of mainly minor hamstring injury was unusually high (67%). When data from all participants in <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK> were included there was no evidence of a benefit (RR 1.16, 95% 0.48 to 2.83). <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> also found no evidence of benefit for hamstring strengthening (RR 2.71; 95% CI 0.35 to 20.79). Reported compliance was poor in both <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>. While muscle soreness was reported for intervention group participants in both <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>, this seemed only to affect compliance and participation in <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>.</P>
<P>One underpowered trial (<LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>) found some evidence for a potential protective effect from manual therapy but the difference for hamstring injury was not statistically significant (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.66). However, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the manual therapy group for lower-limb muscle strain (RR 0.13, 95% 0.02 to 0.97), and back pain. No adverse effects of manual therapy were recorded.</P>
<P>The remaining three trials tested interventions for preventing lower-limb injuries rather than directly targeting hamstring injury. Proprioceptive training for prevention of lower-limb injuries was evaluated by two cluster randomised trials. Exploratory analyses with 'intention-to-treat' analysis corrected for clustering showed a lack of statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in hamstring injury for both trials. Notably, only four participants incurred hamstring injury in <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>. Only data for hamstring injuries rather than participants sustaining a hamstring injury were available for <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>. Equal numbers of participants sustained hamstring injuries in the intervention and control group of <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>, which evaluated stretching alongside warm-up/cool down protocols (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.22 to 5.13). As well as recording low compliance, <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK> also had substantial loss to follow-up.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2009-11-11 00:53:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<P>The applicability of the results from this review are strengthened by the fact that the included studies incorporated sportsmen and women across a number of sporting domains. Furthermore the small between-group differences in definitions of injury for surveillance systems in team sports indicates a reliable and valid approach to injury rates within these studies and supports recommendations that "a match time loss definition" should form the basis for the injury definition in a consensus statement (<LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2007</LINK>).</P>
<P>Four of the included trials tested interventions specifically targeted at preventing hamstring injuries. Three of these trials with 287 participants evaluated strengthening protocols and one with 59 participants evaluated manual therapy.</P>
<P>Insufficient data and the statistical heterogeneity of the pooled data for strengthening protocols hampers the drawing of conclusions on effect and hence applicability. As indicated above, the control rate of hamstring injury in <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> is unusually high but may, as discussed by <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>, reflect their data collection method. The favourable findings of <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> were not found in <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> nor <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>. While subgroup analysis including compliers only (completion of at least two of the five sessions) in <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK> seemed to point to a potential but not statistically significant benefit from strengthening, the validity of this finding is questionable given that the results for non-compliers favoured the control group. It is notable that all of the subgroup of participants from <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK> were selected solely due to their high risk of hamstring injury, primarily due to past history thus predisposing them to high possibility of injury recurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002b</LINK>). It is, however, not possible to determine from the available data whether past history of hamstring injury affects the potential for strengthening to prevent hamstring injuries. <LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK> involved the use of specific equipment, which limits the applicability of this trial to situations where there are sufficient resources.</P>
<P>Although the trial testing manual therapy did not find a statistically significant result for hamstring injury, the statistically significant reduction in lower limb muscle strain and back strain points to a promising intervention. This is strengthened by the fact that <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK> exhibits strong external validity in reference to the active population in question.</P>
<P>The remaining three trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) reported the outcomes of interventions for the prevention of leg injuries, including providing data for hamstring injuries. We excluded several other trials that did not provide data on hamstring injuries but were otherwise suitable for inclusion. The results for the above three trials thus must be put in the context of the missing data from these excluded trials.</P>
<P>In terms of preventing hamstring injuries, the clinical applicability of the results of the two trials (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>) testing proprioceptive protocols (involving wobble board exercises) is uncertain. Although analytical findings for proprioceptive protocols demonstrate potentially small protective effects, both included studies (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK>) targeted the prevention of leg injuries rather than hamstring injuries in isolation. Therefore its true protective effect on hamstring injury prevention remains in doubt. Doubts over applicability are further compounded by the fact that interventions were tested on adolescents in one study (<LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>). As noted already, injury frequency and severity to adolescents differs from that in adults (<LINK REF="REF-Frank-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Frank 2007</LINK>). However, there were only four hamstring injuries in <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>. It is possible that this may reflect that control group participants were given dynamic stretch components. Dynamic stretches tend to incorporate more sport specific movements. This may have resulted in a training effect on the neuromuscular system promoting neuromuscular control and thus reducing injury occurrence (<LINK REF="REF-Mandelbaum-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mandelbaum 2005</LINK>), therefore resulting in similar training effects to proprioceptive interventions.</P>
<P>The ineffectiveness of warm-up/ cool down/ stretching protocols (<LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>) in preventing of hamstring injuries may reflect the more generalised approach to lower limb injury and poor compliance with stretching exercises. It may also result from an inadequate intervention. In <LINK REF="STD-Van-Mechelen-1993" TYPE="STUDY">Van Mechelen 1993</LINK>, stretching exercises were held for only 10 seconds, whereas current evidence suggests that stretches need to be held for at least 20 seconds to influence the stretch reflex and allow for elongation of muscle fibres (<LINK REF="REF-Bandy-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Bandy 1997</LINK>).</P>
<P>The occurrence of adverse events in some of the trials may influence their true clinical applicability. A reduction in joint range of motion, peak torque, along with alterations in muscle sequencing and recruitment patterns has been associated with DOMS (<LINK REF="REF-Cheung-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Cheung 2003</LINK>). Nonetheless, the effect of DOMS on overall sporting performance has not been well documented. Stretching also has its potential harms, associated with a temporary strength deficit hindering performance (<LINK REF="REF-Kokkonen-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Kokkonen 1998</LINK>). The side-effects of manual therapy have also been investigated. Common reactions include local discomfort, headache, fatigue and radiating discomfort (<LINK REF="REF-Senstad-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Senstad 1996</LINK>); however, these are usually benign in nature and of short duration. Potential harms may greatly influence consent, compliance and the overall selection of an intervention, especially in a sporting domain, and therefore there is a need for specifically focused research to investigate adverse events within hamstring prevention protocols.</P>
<P>Several studies reported poor compliance with the chosen interventions, sometimes further compounded by adverse events (as in <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>), although these events were minor. The ability of a participant to adhere to the prevention protocol is without doubt an important factor to be considered when applying this intervention in clinical practice, potentially having an impact on compliance and thus hamstring injury prevention within a sporting or recreational setting and within any future studies in this field. In addition, the large between-group differences in definitions of injury severity suggest that there is a need for a better consensus. This is an important factor to consider when assessing the true efficacy of interventions in preventing different grades of severity of hamstring injuries within a clinical setting.</P>
<P>Finally, it should be noted that all included studies failed to exclude injuries sustained through direct contact. Various sports include physical contact and it has been proposed that there is a direct relationship between the amount of contact a player gives or receives and the incidence of injury (<LINK REF="REF-Mueller-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mueller 1996</LINK>). Masking of the true efficacy of an intervention may arise if injuries occurring by such mechanisms are included. </P>

<P>We included only randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials as they are less susceptible to selection bias (<LINK REF="REF-Roberts-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Roberts 1998</LINK>).

Research suggests that greater than 20% loss potentially poses serious threats to validity, and in-between levels lead to intermediate levels of problems (<LINK REF="REF-Sackett-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackett 1997</LINK>). The problem was compounded in <LINK REF="STD-S_x00f6_derman-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Söderman 2000</LINK> through the exclusion of intervention group participants who had not complied. In <LINK REF="STD-Emery-2007" TYPE="STUDY">Emery 2007</LINK>, after allocation of the participating schools to one of two interventions, coaches of eight of the 105 teams within the 25 participating schools declined participation. The loss to follow-up from this was not reported. Intention-to-treat analysis was, however, possible for four trials (<LINK REF="STD-Askling-2003" TYPE="STUDY">Askling 2003</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Engebretsen-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Engebretsen 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Gabbe-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Gabbe 2006</LINK>, <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK>).</P>
<P>Interpretation of the results of small studies may be compromised by the lack of power. Hamstring occurrence among a healthy active population is a relatively small occurrence. The sample sizes used by the trials were insufficient to account for a relatively small occurrence of injury within a healthy population. For example, <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK> failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between groups in hamstring injury, but with only 59 participants it is difficult to determine whether this finding was due to inadequate power or the lack of effect. All findings in this review were associated with wide confidence intervals, which hampers the interpretation of the clinical significance.</P>
<P>Lack of participant blinding to group allocation is potentially important in these trials. Knowledge of group assignment can affect responses to the intervention received and introduce performance bias (<LINK REF="REF-Schulz-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Schulz 2002</LINK>). Participants who know that they have been assigned to a group who will receive a new treatment might harbour favourable expectations (Hawthorn Effect) or increased apprehension. Futhermore a lack of treatment provider blinding may have introduced detection bias, whereby the assessors are likely to have preferentially attributed injury occurrence to the control group. However, it is important to consider that it would be difficult to blind participants and providers in competitive sporting domains. Sports clubs may be very reluctant to engage in research studies that possess control groups with no intervention, potentially placing participants at greater risk of injury. To accommodate this, modern research design often requires new interventions to be compared with the existing best practice approach. This pragmatic research design makes it very difficult to achieve participant and provider blinding.</P>
<P>Finally due to the presence of a pragmatic research design in all seven included studies, the presence of a combination of interventions to prevent hamstring injury may explain the observed effects. Application of combined interventions in an environmental context is a more realistic approach to prevention of injury.<B> </B>Rarely is it the case that one aetiological factor is the cause of injury, factors may be multiple and interact (<LINK REF="REF-Croisier-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Croisier 2004</LINK>). Nevertheless, it may be difficult to attribute the significance of the observed effects solely to the intervention type being investigated because of the presence of combined intervention protocols and thus the inclusion of such a factor may mask the true efficacy of the interventions being tested.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2009-11-10 17:25:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lindsey Elstub">
<P>We are confident that we were exhaustive in our search strategy. In an effort to locate all relevant trials, sensitive searches were conducted across a comprehensive list of electronic databases. To identify grey literature, we performed citation tracking and searched for unpublished studies through internet clinical trials registers. However, it is still possible that we missed some trials, especially trials evaluating interventions for preventing lower-limb injuries for which separate hamstring injuries data were perhaps available but not evidently so in the electronic citation and abstract.<BR/>
</P>
<P>Despite our efforts and often success in contacting authors, this review is limited by the availability of data from the studies. Eleven studies meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded primarily because of lack of data on hamstring injuries (<LINK REF="STD-Arnason-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Arnason 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bixler-1992" TYPE="STUDY">Bixler 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Cabry-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Cabry 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Ekstrand-1983" TYPE="STUDY">Ekstrand 1983</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Hartig-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Hartig 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Larsen-2002" TYPE="STUDY">Larsen 2002</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Olsen-2005" TYPE="STUDY">Olsen 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Pope-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Pope 2000</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rudzki-1997" TYPE="STUDY">Rudzki 1997</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wedderkopp-1999" TYPE="STUDY">Wedderkopp 1999</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Withnall-2006" TYPE="STUDY">Withnall 2006</LINK>). Most of these trials tested interventions aimed at preventing leg injuries rather than specifically targeting hamstring injury. The probable extent of missing data limits the conclusions that we can draw from the three trials in this category for which hamstring injury data were available.</P>

<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2009-10-19 16:33:53 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="Helen HG Handoll">
<P>A recent systematic review on the rehabilitation of hamstring injuries (<LINK REF="REF-Mason-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mason 2007</LINK>) called for consideration of the lumbar spine, sacroiliac and pelvic orientation and control mechanisms when diagnosing and managing the rehabilitation of hamstring injuries. The results from <LINK REF="STD-Hoskins-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Hoskins 2008</LINK> are compatible with these recommendations in that manual therapy applied to the spine and pelvis reduced the rate of hamstring injury.</P>
<P>Our finding for strengthening protocols was inconclusive. However, the choice of eccentric hamstring strength training by the three trials testing strengthening protocols rather than concentric strengthening is supported by the findings of a randomised trial comparing eccentric versus concentric hamstring strengthening (<LINK REF="REF-Mj_x00f8_lsnes-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mjølsnes 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>The results presented for stretching protocols are in agreement with two existing systematic reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Thacker-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Thacker 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Weldon-2003" TYPE="REFERENCE">Weldon 2003</LINK>), which concluded that no definitive conclusions could be drawn as to the value of stretching for reducing the risk of injury.</P>

<IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE MODIFIED="2009-11-06 17:29:51 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of interventions used to prevent hamstring injuries in people participating in football or other high risk activities for these injuries. The promising findings for manual therapy need confirmation.</P>
</IMPLICATIONS_PRACTICE>
<IMPLICATIONS_RESEARCH MODIFIED="2009-11-11 00:54:42 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Lesley Gillespie">
<P>Rigorously conducted and sufficiently powered randomised controlled trials are warranted to determine the effects of commonly used interventions, particularly stretching, strengthening and manual therapy protocols, that target the prevention of hamstring injuries. Trials evaluating interventions for preventing lower-limb injuries overall should record and report on specific injuries, including hamstring injuries, and also present injury data by participants. There remains a need for well-conducted randomised controlled trials to justify the continued inclusion of stretching protocols within prevention programmes. Where randomisation by clusters seems valid, appropriate analyses of outcome and the inclusion of sufficient information in trial reports to aid interpretation by readers and users should be undertaken (<LINK REF="REF-Campbell-2004" TYPE="REFERENCE">Campbell 2004</LINK>).</P>
<P>Research should also be considered on upcoming and relatively neglected areas. These include the encouraging role of health education, particularly in terms of injury awareness and running technique in hamstring injury. (A common mechanism of injury occurs through poor running technique, resulting in over-striding (<LINK REF="REF-Orchard-2002b" TYPE="REFERENCE">Orchard 2002b</LINK>).) Reflecting the complex interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for hamstring injury in individuals, consideration of research on multi-modal approaches, probably tailored towards individuals addressing more than one risk factor, for prevention of injuries is warranted. The shift in current practice away from training the hamstrings through static and isolated movements to dynamic movements, such as sports-specific drills and plyometric exercises, should also be noted when considering future research.</P>
<P>Finally, the strength of the included studies in this review was limited by a lack of compliance; future studies need to implement techniques that will ensure that a greater number of participants comply with interventions. Biofeedback is a technique where information regarding &#8220;hidden&#8221; physiological processes is displayed in a form understandable to the participant (<LINK REF="REF-Krebs-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Krebs 1990</LINK>). This technique has been shown to improve compliance towards exercise (<LINK REF="REF-Berghmans-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Berghmans 1996</LINK>), whereby participants are more easily able to recognise the significance of an intervention throughout a trial and can therefore reinforce compliance.</P>
